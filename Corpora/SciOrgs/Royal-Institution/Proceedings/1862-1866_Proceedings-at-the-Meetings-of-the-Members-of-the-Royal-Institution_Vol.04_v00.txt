great grace which was done to the body, when the late Vice-Patron,
His Royal Highness the Prince Consort, with yourself and the Prince
your brother, favoured our Lectures with your presence, have requested
me to express the hope they entertain, that Your Royal Highness will
allow of your election into the position then filled by your admirable
and much-loved Father.                       I
                              It is because had the honour of speaking
at that time in your presence, that the authorities here think           I may
not be unacceptable as the channel through which their earnest desire
may be made known.         Our most honoured Queen is our Patron ; and
that we may have your Royal Highness as Her and our Vice-Patron
is the most earnest wish of our hearts.          Remembering the past, we
hope for this great grace for the future.

Him to be in any way associated with the interests of Science. And
His Royal Highness has commanded me particularly to assure you of
the peculiar pleasure it will give Him to meet you again, where He has
listened to you before, and derived so much instruction from your

 SIR HENRY HOLLAND,          Bart.    M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. Vice-President,
                                   in the Chair.
                       JOHN TYNDALL, Esq.           F.R.S.

             On Radiation through         the  Earth's Atmosphere.
NORODY ever obtained the idea of a line from Euclid's definition
that it is length without breadth. The idea is obtained from a real
physical line drawn by a pen or pencil, and therefore possessing width ;
the idea being afterwards brought, by a process of abstraction, more
nearly into accordance with the conditions of the definition.              So also
with regard to physical phenomena ; we must help ourselves to a con
ception of the invisible by means of proper images derived from the
visible, afterwards purifying our conceptions to the needful extent.
Definiteness of conceptions, even though at some expense to delicacy,
is of the greatest utility in dealing with physical phenomena.             Indeed
it may   be questioned   whether    a mind   trained  in   physical research, can
at all enjoy peace, without having made clear to itself some possible
way of conceiving of those operations which lie beyond the boundaries
of sense, and in which sensible phenomena originate.
     When we speak of radiation through the atmosphere, we ought to
be able to affix definite physical ideas, both to the term atmosphere
and the term radiation.         It is well known that our atmosphere is
mainly composed of the two elements, oxygen and nitrogen. These
elementary atoms may be figured as small spheres scattered thickly in
the space which immediately surrounds the earth.                   They constitute
about 99i per cent, of the atmosphere.            Mixed with these atoms we
have others of a totally different character ; we have the molecules,
or atomic groups, of carbonic acid, of ammonia, and of aqueous
vapour.     In these substances diverse atoms have coalesced to form
little systems of atoms. The molecule of aqueous vapour, for example,
consists of two atoms of hydrogen united to one of oxygen ; and they
mingle as little triads among the monads of oxygen and nitrogen,
which constitute the great mass of the atmosphere.
     These atoms and molecules are separate ; but in what sense? They
are separate from each other in the sense in which the individual fishes

1863.]       on    Radiation through      the     Earth's Atmosphere.             5
of    a shoal are separate.    The shoal of fish is embraced by a common
medium, which connects the different members of the shoal, and renders
intercommunication between them possible. A medium also embraces
our atoms ; within our atmosphere exists a second, and a finer atmo
sphere, in which the atoms of oxygen and nitrogen hang like suspended
grains. This finer atmosphere unites not only atom with atom, but
star with star ; and the light of all suns, and of all stars, is in reality a
 kind of music propagated through this interstellar air. This image
must be clearly seized, and then we have to advance a step.              We must
 not only figure our atoms suspended in this medium, but we must
 figure them vibrating in it. In this motion of the atoms consists what
 we call their heat.       " What is heat in us," as Locke has perfectly
 expressed  it,   "    in the body heated nothing but motion."
                       is                                                Well, we
 must figure this motion communicated to the medium in which the
 atoms swing, and sent in ripples through          with inconceivable velocity to
                                                   it
 the bounds of space.       Motion in this form, unconnected with ordinary
 matter, but speeding through the interstellar medium, receives the
 name of Radiant Heat           and,
                                ;        ifcompetent to excite the nerves of
vision, we call    it Light.
       Aqueous vapour was defined to be an invisible gas.              Vapour was
 permitted to issue horizontally with considerable force from tube con  a
 nected with      a  small boiler.    The track of the cloud of condensed
 steam was vividly illuminated by the electric light.            What was seen,
 however, was not vapour, but vapour condensed to water. Beyond
 the visible end of the jet the cloud resolved itself into true vapour.          A
 lamp     was placed    under  the  jet at  various   points   the
                                                               ;     cloud was  cut
 sharply off at that point, and when the flame was placed near the efflux
 orifice the cloud entirely disappeared. The heat of the lamp completely
 prevented precipitation. This same vapour was condensed and congealed
 on the surface of        vessel containing
                            a                     afreezing mixture, from which
it    was scraped in quantities sufficient to form         small snowball.
                                                           a                   The
 beam of the electric lamp, moreover, was sent through             alarge receiver
  placed on an air-pump.           A single stroke of the pump caused the
  precipitation of the aqueous vapour within, which became beautifully
  illuminated     bythe beam    while, upon
                                ;                screen behind, richly-coloured

  halo due to diffraction by the little cloud within the receiver flashed
  forth.
        The waves of heat speed from our earth through our atmosphere
  towards space.       These waves dash in their passage against the atoms
  of oxygen and nitrogen, and against the molecules of aqueous vapour.
  Thinly scattered as these latter are, we might naturally think meanly
  of them as barriers to the waves of heat. We might imagine that
  the wide spaces between the vapour molecules would be an open door
  for the passage of the undulations and that if those waves were at all
                                              ;
  intercepted,    itwould be       the substances which form 99^ per cent, of
                                    by
  the whole atmosphere.       Three or four years ago, however,          was found
                                                                        it
 by    the speaker that this small modicum of aqueous vapour intercepted
  fifteen times the quantity of heat stopped          the whole of the air
                                                      by                     which
                                                                             in

 it  was diffused.        It
                        was afterwards found that the dry air then experi
  mented with     was not  perfectly pure, and that the purer the air became
  the more it approached the character of a vacuum, and the greater, by
  comparison, became the action of the aqueous vapour.             The vapour
  was found to act with 30, 40, 50, 60, 70 times the energy of the air
  in which it was diffused ; and no doubt was entertained that the
  aqueous vapour of the air which filled the Royal Institution theatre,
  during the delivery of the discourse, absorbed 90 or 100 times the
  quantity of radiant heat which was absorbed by the main body of the uir
  of the room.
      Looking at the single atoms, for every 200 of oxygen and nitrogen
 there is about 1 of aqueous vapour.           This 1, then, is 80 times more
 powerful than the 200 ; and hence, comparing a single atom of oxygen
 or nitrogen with a single atom of aqueous vapour, we may infer that
 the action of the latter is 16,000 times that of the former.              This
 was a very astonishing result, and it naturally excited opposition,
 based on      the philosophic      reluctance to accept a result so grave
 in consequences      before testing it to the uttermost.           From such
 opposition a discovery, if it be worth the name, emerges with its
 fibre strengthened ; as the human character gathers force from the
 healthy antagonisms of active life. It was urged, that the result was
on the face of it improbable ; that there were, moreover, many ways of
accounting for          it,
                      without ascribing so enormous         comparative action

 to aqueous vapour.       For example, the cylinder which contained the
air in which these experiments were made, was stopped at its ends by
plates of rocksalt, on account of their transparency to radiant heat.

brilliant colours of thin plates (soap-bubble colours) flashed forth
immediately upon the screen — these being caused by the film of
moisture which overspread the salt.          Such    film,

                                                                 it              is
formed when undried air            sent into the cylinder
                                       is                       was, therefore,
                                                                 ;    it
the absorption of      layer of brine which was measured, instead of the
                         a
absorption of aqueous vapour.
    This objection was met in two ways.        Firstly, by showing that
the plates of salt when subjected to the strictest examination show no
trace of     film of moisture.
              a                  Secondly, by abolishing the plates of
salt altogether, and obtaining the same results in a cylinder open at
both ends.
    It was next surmised, that the effect was due to the impurity of the
London air, and the suspended carbon particles were pointed to as
the cause of the opacity to radiant heat.    This objection was met by
bringing air from Hyde Park, Ilampstead Heath, Primrose Hill, Epsom
Downs, a field near Newport in the Isle of Wight, St. Catharine's Down,

1863.]           on   Radiation through     the      Earth's Atmosphere.        1
and the sea-beach near Black Gang Chine. The aqueous vapour of the
air from these localities intercepted at least seventy times the amount
of radiant heat absorbed by the air in which the vapour was diffused.
Experiments made with smoky air proved that the suspended smoke
of the atmosphere of West London, even when an east wind pours over
it the smoke of the city, exerts only a fraction of the destructive powers
exercised by the transparent and            impalpable aqueous vapour diffused
in the air.
     The cylinder which contained the air through which the calorific
rays passed was polished within, and the rays which struck the interior
surface were reflected from it to the thermo-electric pile which mea
sured the radiation.   The following objection was raised : — You per
mit moist air to enter your cylinder ; a portion of this moisture is
condensed as a liquid film upon the interior surface of your tube ; its
reflective power is thereby diminished ; less heat therefore reaches the
pile, and you incorrectly ascribe to the absorption of aqueous vapour
an effect which is really due to diminished reflection of the interor
surface of your cylinder.
    But why should the aqueous vapour so condense? The tube within
is warmer than the air without, and against its inner surface the rays of
heat are impinging.       There can be no tendency to condensation under
such circumstances. Further, let five inches of undried air be sent into
the tube — that      one-sixth of the amount which
                      is,                                    can contain. These
                                                             it
five inches produce their proportionate absorption.            The driest day, on
the driest portion of the earth's surface, would make no approach to
the dryness of our cylinder when              contains only five inches of air.
                                                it
Make  it  10, 15, 20, 25, 30 inches    : you obtain an absorption exactly pro
portional to the quantity of vapour present.            It next to physical
                                                              is       a
impossibility that this could be the case         the effect were due to conden
                                                     if
sation.   But lest     doubt should linger in the mind, not only were the
                       a
plates of rock-salt  abolished,    but the cylinder itself was dispensed with.
Humid air was displaced by dry, and dry air                  by
                                                              humid in the free
atmosphere   ;  the absorption     of  the aqueous vapour was here manifest,
as in all the other cases.
     No doubt, therefore, can exist of the extraordinary opacity of this
substance to the rays of obscure heat         and particularly such rays as are
                                                ;
emitted by the earth after        ithas been warmed by the sun.        It per
                                                                           is
fectly certain that more than ten per cent, of the terrestrial radiation
from the soil of England          stopped within ten feet of the surface of
                                 is
the soil. This one fact     issufficient to show the immense influence which
this newly-discovered property of aqueous vapours must exert on the
phenomena of meteorology.
     This aqueous vapour         is
                                 a blanket more necessary to the vegetable
life of England than clothing               to man.
                                           is             Remove for a single
summer-night the aqueous vapour from the air which overspreads this
country, and you would assuredly destroy every plant capable of being
destroyed by a freezing temperature.           The warmth of our fields and
gardens   would   pour  itself  unrequited    into  space, and the sun would

rise upon an island held fast in the iron grip of frost.          The aqueous
vapour     constitutes  a  local dam,   by which    the  temperature      at the
earth's surface is deepened : the dam, however, finally overflows, and
we give to space all that we receive from the sun.
      The sun raises the vapours of the equatorial ocean ; they rise, but
for a time a vapour screen spreads above and around them.                But the
higher they rise, the more they come into the presence of pure space ;
and when, by their levity, they have penetrated the vapour screen,
which lies close to the earth's surface, what must occur?
      It has been said that, compared atom for atom, the absorption of an
atom of aqueous vapour is 16,000 times that of air.            Now the power
to absorb and the power to radiate are perfectly reciprocal and pro
portional.     The atom of aqueous vapour will therefore radiate with
 16,000 times the energy of an atom of air.        Imagine then this power
ful radiant in the presence of space, and with no screen above it to
check its radiation.     Into space it pours its heat, chills itself, condenses,
and the tropical torrents are the consequence.      The expansion of the air,
no doubt, also refrigerates it ; but in accounting for those deluges, the
chilling of the vapour by its own radiation must play a most important
part. The rain quits the ocean as vapour ; it returns to it as water.
 How are the vast stores of heat set free by the change from the
vaporous to the liquid condition disposed of? Doubtless in great part
 they are wasted by radiation into space.      Similar remarks apply to the
cumuli of our latitudes. The warmed air, charged with vapour, rises
in columns, so as to penetrate the vapour screen which hugs the earth ;
in the presence of space, the head of each pillar wastes its heat by
radiation, condenses to a cumulus, which constitutes the visible capital
 of an invisible column of saturated air.
      Numberless other meteorological phenomena receive their solution,
 by  reference  to the radiant and absorbent properties of aqueous vapour.
 It is the absence of this screen, and the consequent copious waste of
 heat, that causes mountains to be so much chilled when the sun is
 withdrawn.       Its absence in Central Asia renders the winter there
 almost unendurable ; in Sahara the dryness of the air is sometimes
 such, that though during the day " the soil is fire and the wind is
 flame," the chill at night is painful to bear.        In Australia, also, the
 thermometric range is enormous, on account of the absence of this
 qualifying agent.      A clear day, and a dry day, moreover, are very
 different things.    The atmosphere may possess great visual clearness,
 while it is charged with aqueous vapour, and on such occasions great
 chilling cannot occur by terrestrial radiation. Sir John Leslie and
 others have been perplexed by the varying indications of their instru
 ments on days equally bright — but all these anomalies are completely
 accounted for by reference to this newly-discovered property of trans
 parent aqueous vapour. Its presence would check the earth's loss ;
 its absence, without sensibly altering the transparency of the air, would
 open wide a door for the escape of the earth's heat into infinitude.

1863.]    Cardinal Wiseman      on Contact between Science and     Art.    9
                 WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                         Friday, January 30,    18G3.
 SIR HKNRY HOLLAND,          Bart.  M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. Vice-President,
                                 in the Chair.
                   His EMINENCE CARDINAL WISEMAN
         On the Points      of Contact  between  Science and    Art.
In  his preliminary   observations, the Cardinal stated that, in speaking of
Science and    Art,   he wished to extend the meaning of one of these
words to the utmost, and to restrict that of the other.       By Science he
wished to understand       whatever knowledge has come to man as the
result of his investigations by thought, calculation, and experiment ;
by Art, he meant not the arts of life — the practical arts — but the Fine
Arts, and even these restricted to the Arts of Design. As an example
of their union, he referred to our three great museums, where the
objects of science are almost always to be found blended or associated
with objects of art. The great artist, Leonardo da Vinci, is a " represen
tative man
             " of this union but
                              ;     though so well known as a consummate
painter, he is comparatively little acknowledged as a man of science.
Yet he finds his place in the history and philosophy of the induc
tive sciences as a practical reformer, and has left behind thirteen
volumes of scientific sketches connected with mechanics and hydraulics.
It has been said also of the late Prince Consort, that he never saw
Art without Science, and never looked at Science without seeing
Art ; and that he seized every opportunity of inculcating the necessity
of cultivating the two harmoniously and inseparably, yet also inde
pendently.
    The Arts of Design treated of were Painting, Sculpture, and
Architecture.
    Painting. — The most obvious point of contact between painting
and practical science is Perspective, which signifies the art of repre
senting on a flat surface objects which are supposed to be on different
planes, or at varying distances, so as to give them, by the gradation
of proportion and colour, the appearance to the eye which they would
have if they were real substances.       This science, by no means old, is
of uncertain origin.     At the Revival, its principles were observed and
acted upon by the great painters by intuition ; but it was long before
the rules of perspective can be said to have pervaded the whole art.
Attention to scientific and artistic perspective began simultaneously in
Belgium and Italy, — in the schools of Van Eyck, in Belgium, and of

10                             Cardinal         Wiseman   :                [Jan. 30,
Giotto in Italy.        In           of the Van Eycks — (Hubert died in
                             the works
1426 and John                   —
                        in 1446) great improvements appear in lineal and
aerial perspective, which were much advanced also by the Giotteschi,
of Florence, &c. But the true history of Scientific Perspective begins
with Michelangelo, in whose works the anticipations of art are verified
by science, and reduced to unvarying rule.* Leonardo da Vinci
(who died in 1519), and Albert Diirer (who died in 1528), a mathe
matician as well as painter, were also worthy agents in this great
advancement of art. It was not, however, till 1608 that Guido Ubaldo
published the first satisfactory treatise on Perspective.         In 1642,
F. Dubreuil edited his ' Prospectiva Practica,' well known as ' The
Jesuit's Perspective'; and, finally, in 1731 the mathematical theory
of perspective was conclusively demonstrated            by Brook Taylor.
These certain principles gradually became so fixed, that it was impos
sible afterwards to allow deviation from them.          The theorems were
converted into practical rules, which are now accepted for all useful
purposes, without further proof ; and perspective was reduced to scientific
principles, which are now popularized and adopted as an essential part
of artistic education.
    As means of proceeding still further in educating the public eye
and mind, attention was called to the greatly increased facilities which
the railway, a creation of science, has afforded us for studying the
beautiful in nature, and of gratifying our love of landscape in our own
country and abroad.
     In regard to Colour, there          is,
                                      most certainly, want of more contact
                                                              a
between Science and Art. Some of the colours on the mural paintings
of the ancients are still fresh, after an interval of eighteen hundred
years;   and the frescoes of the first periods of modern art, though much
decayed, yet promise to remain at least distinguishable for      very much
                                                                      a
longer period.     Surely, with the accurate knowledge which chemistry
gives us, we ought to obtain effects not inferior to those produced by
the older painters almost by accident.       Science must come to the aid
of art, and answer the question — " Is there any atmospherical, or other
chemical action, in this country, which prevents our carrying out in              it
such public works of art as exist in other countries?" — In regard to
Mosaics,  it  was stated, that in the great Vatican studio the progression
of new colours and shades are entirely in the hands of chemist, who
                                                                  a
commands and directs the laboratories and finances requisite for the
work.     In the catalogue,' the graduated specimens of colours num

    In Sculpture, one point of contact with science                 in pure
                                                                      is
Mathematics.      From the time of Michelangelo, though undoubtedly
the feeling     much more ancient, there has been an expression of the
               is
thought, that the human figure         perfect in its proportions, and that
                                           is
those proportions must have       law.
                                   a      It has been since shown that the

whole of this figure is ruled by lines, the angles of which are harmonic
— so musical that they may be represented by tonic'mediant and domi
nant ; and that the curves which circumscribe the subdivisions possess
this quality no less than the angles. It is interesting to find that the
curve which dominates through the structure of man is the curve which
rules the heavens — the ellipse.*
     A necessary connection exists between Sculpture (and no less
Painting) and the science of Anatomy.               In the ancient Grecian mar
bles we perceive a striking contrast : we see heads of magnificent
placidity, and of grandeur of organisation ; heads of surpassing intel
lectuality united to bodies apparently of exaggerated muscularity and
salient framework.          There were clearly two types familiar to the
Grecian artist — the men of thought, the philosopher, poet, and orator ;
and the athletes, whose bodies were subjected to gymnastic training.
No doubt the conflicts in the arena, in which all the muscles of the
body were brought into various and violent actions, were frequently
witnessed and noted by the keen eye of the ancient sculptor, who
had not the opportunity that artists now enjoy, of studying calmly
the same muscles upon the dissected corpse, or even upon casts taken
from it. Galen himself was obliged to study the ape, in order to come
to his approximating knowledge of human anatomy.                  The Greek or
Roman arrived at the knowledge of the interior construction of the
figure, by what he saw without ; the modern may learn directly what is
concealed by the outward integuments and represent its external action.
     The modern science of Ethnography, which classifies the different
types of races and nations, and at the same time pays attention to the
habits, manners, and customs of different countries, is also a most
desirable adjunct to both branches of representative art. Great poets
have shown themselves to be not above studying common subjects, or the
mechanical operations of practical science, when they had to introduce
them into their verses (e.g. Schiller, in the " Song of the Bell") ;
so our conclusion must be, that a great artist should despise no branch
of knowledge, but should endeavour to acquire every variety of it. " Ut
pit-turn poesis — as painting so is poetry," says Horace, and adds —
                      " Ego nee studium sine divite vena,
               Nee rude quid possit video ingenium ; alterius sic
               Altera poscit opem res, et conjurat amice." t
     Of ARCHiTEfTURE, as a fine art, we may repeat what has been
said   of the human figure ; the proportions and parts of its perfect
productions are no less tonic or musical : lines and angles — there
being here no curves — are reducible to the same harmonic scale. This

12     Cardinal Wiseman     on Contact between Scie|icc and   Art. [Jan. 30,
has been    shown to be the case in the Parthenon, the grandest of all
classical edifices ; and also in Lincoln and Salisbury cathedrals. —
 Science, however, comes directly into contact with Architecture in the
 Constructive element — in the value and fitness of the materials em
 ployed in building.    The necessity for this is but too evident in the
 disintegration of the stone of which the new Houses of Parliament
are built.     A commission, comprising architects, chemists, and geolo
 gists, was formed to select the best stone for the building ; but the
 recommendation of the men of science was not carried out ; and in
 1861, it was said before a committee — " We" (the builders) "did not
 look at the stone with the eyes of chemists ; we looked at it as builders."
 The committee, therefore, recommended           that a series of chemical
 experiments (with the view of arresting the decay) should be con
ducted under chemical supervision.        2. Science comes also into contact
 with Architecture     in the adjustment of weight and support — the
 balancing of the parts of a building.        In the first stages of archi
 tecture, we are struck with the massiveness           of construction — in
the old Grecian, the Roman, the Etruscan, and in the Norman.            This
ponderous solidity was probably due to timidity and ignorance. As
science advanced, architecture became slimmer.            In the sixteenth
century, the architects considerably lightened their style ; altering the
 old Norman arch into the pointed, and the round massive piers into
clustered columns ; thus cutting out masses of sustaining material
without apprehension of insecurity. — A striking example of the most
 salutary, because uncontrolled intervention of science in a matter re
lating to architecture occurred in the history of St. Peter's, at Rome.
Although the architect, Michelangelo, had taken the greatest precau
tion for the security of the dome, yet in 1681 numerous cracks
appeared in various directions through the cupola.         Marble dovetails
placed across the crack broke with alarming rapidity, and it was feared
that in a few years the whole dome might fall in. Various remedies
were suggested by architects ; but the Pope Benedict XIV. wisely
observed that this was not the business of Art but of Science.            A
commission of three eminent mathematicians (Boscovich, Le Sueur, and
Jacquier) was appointed to examine the case. In 1742 they issued
their report, showing by their calculations, that the entire dome with
its lantern came to the weight of 55,248 tons, and that there was a
balance of 1674 tons on the side of pressure against support ; con
cluding with the remark,
                             " that irreparable ruin must be apprehended,
unless a timely and efficient remedy was applied."         The remedy they
proposed was entirely scientific — to put six more solid iron girders
round the huge periphery of 420 feet.          No time was lost. In 1743
two girders were braced round the drum, and in 1744 three more
were added.      We have here a notable instance of Science coming to
the rescue of Art in one of its most painful crises.          The proposed
cure fully answered ; and now, after 120 years, no sign has been
given of subsequent damage.
     In the concluding remarks, the Cardinal made reference to the

  1863.]                   General     Monthly Meeting.                         13
 advantages Science may derive from Art ; an example of which occurs
 in the assistance which astronomy has obtained from photography —
 portraits of the sun and moon, and other celestial bodies, having been
 thus taken by Mr. Warren De la Rue.

                            On Artificial Illumination.
 Ten   years    ago   the speaker      in this Institution a sketch of the
                                        gave
condition      of   Artificial    Illumination.
                                              Since that period but little
 progress   had been  made towards   perfecting   those processes of produc
 ing artificial light at that time in general use.         Nevertheless, the
improvements effected in the production and application of the electric
light, the increase of our knowledge both of solar and terrestrial light,
and especially the discovery of an entirely new illuminating agent,
threatening to produce a revolution in lighting almost equal to that
 which was the result of the invention of gas — rendered it desirable
again to review this subject after the lapse of a decade.
     In glancing at the improvements effected in the different depart
ments of artificial illumination, those which relate to the Electric Light
were first noticed. The electric light is produced by the interruption
of an electric current flowing through good conductors ; by this
interruption the current is made to leap across a space provided in
its circuit.   The boundaries of this space, in the ordinary electric light,
are formed by two portions of gas carbon, and during the passage of
the electric current across     the two pieces of carbon are heated to
                                  it,                                           a
most intense degree, and far beyond that produced by any other means
at our disposal.   The great source of illuminating power was shown to
be the ignited ends of these two pieces of gas-carbon, and not the
space between them.
    Such being the nature of the electric light, the principal improve
ment which has been effected in              it,
                                    during the past ten years, consists
in the production of the electric current through the intervention of
heat and mechanical force, by what         termed magneto-electricity.
                                                   is
More than thirty years ago, Mr. Faraday produced         spark from the
                                                                   a
ordinary permanent magnet.      Here, said the speaker (producing a
magnet)  isthe very cradle of this magneto-electric light, and this             is
the very magnet with which Mr. Faraday operated.        This improve
ment constitutes one of the greatest steps in advance which have been
made in the application and production of the electric light.  By the

  1863.]                   on Artificial Illumination.                      17
 combustion of coal a certain amount of mechanical power is obtained,
 which is applied to the rotation of masses of iron in the neighbourhood
 of very powerful permanent magnets.              In this way, currents of
 electricity are produced, and these are thrown together, and made to
 circulate through a system of conductors : in fact, there is no
 difference, as regards the effect at the carbon-prisms, between the
 action of this magneto-electric current, and the ordinary electric
 current produced by the chemical action which takes place in the
 voltaic battery. But this improved mode of producing the electric
 force demands      less manual labour ; the mechanical work being
 performed by a steam-engine, which causes the rotation of the arma
 tures.
      This magneto-electric apparatus, as perfected by Mr. Holmes,
 has now been in use for upwards of two years in the South Foreland
 and Dungeness lighthouses, where, as well as in other similar beacons,
 the production of a light of the greatest intensity is of the greatest
 importance to the mariner.         During this time it has performed its
office remarkably well, and without a single instance of failure ; thus
proving itself well adapted for the purposes of lighthouse illumination.
      For domestic light it has not yet been brought into use; its
expense, doubtless,      at the present moment, being far too great to
admit of its being employed in this way : but where a light of great
intensity, regardless almost of the question of expense, is required, as
in the case of lighthouses, this magneto-electric light can scarcely be
too much prized.
      The speaker also described the mercurial electric light, but con
sidered it inferior both in brilliancy and steadiness to that procured by
the passage of the electric current between carbon terminals.
      The discoveries and improvements connected with Gas as an illumi
nating agent were then considered.        It is of great importance that gas,
as a light-giving material, should be improved to the utmost possible
extent, so as to make it a perfect source of light.      Its conveniences are
so patent to every one, its use is attended with so few discomforts, and
the light is obtained with such facility, and of any desired intensity
within certain limits, that there is, perhaps, no source of artificial light
capable of such general application.         Nevertheless, this is one of the
modes of illumination which, having been long previously in use, have
 not made great progress during the past ten years.              The sulphur
compounds,    which   at  the commencement     of that time  were complained
of as being present in purified gas, are still there in considerable, if not
in undiminished quantity, although there has recently been a process
devised by means of which these impurities can be, to a great extent,
got rid of. It remains to be seen whether this process be applicable,
on a large scale, in the gas manufactory ; but, so far as can be
judged from experiments made upon a small scale, it is a process
 which is likely to be very effective.          It is the invention of the
 Rev. Mr. Bowditch, of Wakefield.            These sulphur compounds are
 irremovable in the ordinary process of purification.           The gas may

be passed in the usual manner over hydrate of lime, or the peroxide
of iron ; but this operation does not, in the slightest degree, affect the
sulphur compounds in question. During the combustion of the gas,
however, their sulphur is converted into sulphurous acid, which diffuses
itself into the apartment in which the gas is burned, and a great deal of
the discomfort of which many complain in the use of gas is due to this
cause.    Mr. Bowditch discovered that though cold hydrate of lime will
not remove these impurities, they are to a great extent got rid of by
heating the hydrate of lime to a temperature varying from the boiling
point of water up to 400° or 500° Fahr., a temperature of 400" being
the most convenient for the development       of the effects of his process.
The heated hydrate of lime converts the sulphur compounds into
sulphuretted hydrogen and carbonic acid, which can then be removed by
 the ordinary purifying material — cold hydrate of lime.       This process
has been found by repeated experiments to remove all but about 2 or 3
grains of sulphur per 100 cubic feet of gas, the quantity of sulphur
originally contained in the gas varying from 5 or 6 grains up to 20
grains in 100 cubic feet.    Heated hydrate of lime was shown to develop
sulphuretted hydrogen from the gas supplied to the Institution.
     Another recently ascertained fact in connection with gas is the dis
covery of a new illuminating constituent recently made by M. Berthelot.
This is a gaseous body, called Acetylene, which is produced under
very peculiar circumstances.     Unlike all other hydrocarbons with which
we were formerly acquainted, an intense heat is favourable to the pro
duction of this body. For instance, it is produced when coke is very
intensely ignited in hydrogen gas ; and Dr. Odling has recently demon
strated that two of the constituents of coal-gas, light carburetted
 hydrogen and carbonic oxide, which are useless for lighting purposes,
may, by means of strong ignition, be made to form acetylene, and thus
become luminiferous agents.     It has generally been considered important
to preserve a moderate degree of heat in gas-making, in order to prevent
 the destruction of the luminiferous hydrocarbons ; but the discovery of
the formation of acetylene, under the circumstances named, will render
it necessary to investigate how far the production of this substance can
be carried on upon a large scale, and rendered valuable for increasing
the illuminating power of gas.     The subject is yet in embryo ; but it has
an important bearing upon the future progress of gas-lighting.       Acety
lene and olefiarit gas contain, in equal volumes, the same amount of
carbon, but the former contains only half as much hydrogen as the
latter ; consequently, the illuminating power of acetylene is probably
at least double that of olefiant gas.
     The compound of acetylene with copper, is a substance not altogether
devoid of interest to the gas-manufacturer.      When it attains a certain
heat, it explodes with considerable violence, and the same effect may
be produced by friction.       It has been demonstrated recently, that
acetylide of copper can be produced by the passage of ordinary coal-
gas, containing, as it does, a trace of ammonia, through copper or
 brass tubes; and explosions which have taken place through clean

ing out such tubes, resulting in serious injury to workmen, have been
doubtless due to the presence of this substance.            It     of course,
                                                                  is,
obvious that an explosion of this kind, even if slight in itself, may be
communicated to explosive mixtures of gas and air (in gas-holder or
                                                              a
gas-meter, for instance), and may thus lead to very disastrous results.
An explosion of this kind occurred a few years ago in Lancashire. A
large meter had been detached, and brought into the open air a work     ;
man was unscrewing one of the brass connections, when the meter
exploded with a loud report. The explosion could not be accounted
for, as all the eye-witnesses were positive that no ignited body of any
kind was near the meter.
     The improvements effected in the production and application of Oils
for illuminating purposes were next referred to.
     The animal and vegetable oils, which for ages have been employed
for this purpose, have received no development of importance during
the last ten years.      On the other hand, new sources of this class of
illuminants have been discovered, which threaten to produce             great
                                                                            a
revolution in the modes of obtaining artificial light.
     One of the most important of the materials manufactured from
these sources is paraffin-oil, the production of which from Bog coal
has been carried out on an immense scale with great ingenuity
and success by Mr. Young, of Bathgate, near Edinburgh.                  [The
speaker here exhibited several lamps fed with this oil.] This new source
of light however already threatened by a formidable rival — native
         is
coal oil — which has been distilled by nature herself, and consequently
does not require those preliminary processes which oil produced from
bituminous coal has to undergo. These discoveries have been made
principally in the United States of America, and more especially in
Canada. In the latter country alone no less than twenty millions of
gallons of this oil have been obtained from wells, several of which are
spouting-wells.    From these the oil rises, probably from the pressure of
gas,  to a considerable   height above the surface of the ground, so as
not to require pumping.        The twenty millions of gallons, which re
present the annual production of the Canadian wells, may, upon                  a
moderate calculation, be said to furnish, in refined oil alone, illuminating
material equal to one hundred and eighty millions of pounds of sperm
candles.
     The importance of such     a    vast amount of illuminating material
so cheaply obtained can scarcely be overrated in connexion with the
question of the production of artificial light.    Up to the present time,
the refined oil from this crude petroleum (specimens           of which were
exhibited) has been prevented from coming        into  effective  competition
with the original paraffin-oil, owing to the carelessness with which
the former has been manufactured.         There  is  a considerable portion
of light naphtha left in this oil, which renders         capable of forming
                                                         it
explosive   mixtures   in  the lamps   wherein it   isburned.      Both these
American oils require to be still further freed from volatile naphtha.
They would then form valuable illuminating materials.
                                                                        c   2

     Thus, from an economical point of view, the rock-oil and the paraf
 fin-oil approach gas much more closely than any other ill uminating'agent
 hitherto invented ; while the enormous quantities in which these oils
are now being produced cannot fail to make them still lower in price.
They may consequently be regarded as very formidable rivals of gas
light.

 illumination depend were then referred to.                     Every method of artificial
 illumination depends upon the heating of certain bodies to such a tem
 perature that they become incandescent With gases this temperature
is much higher than with liquids or solids. There is only one instance in
 which the incandescence of vapour is used, and that is the mercurial
electric light, already alluded to. In all other cases the incandescence
of solid bodies is employed. In the ordinary method of obtaining the
electric light, the incandescence of solid prisms of carbon is the source
of luminosity. In gas and oil flames, it is the incandescence of little
particles of carbon, and in all these cases the light is produced from solid
matter. The luminosity of any flame depends, first, upon the number
of solid particles which exist in it at any given moment ; and, secondly,
upon the temperature of the flame.                   The number of solid particles is
dependent upon         the nature      of   the flame itself, whether it be a flame
produced by        the   burning     of    bodies    rich in hydrocarbons, or by the
burning     of  bodies   which   are    poorer     in  this respect.       Such a flame is
always affected by the pressure of the atmosphere.                         The higher the
pressure of the air, the greater the number of luminous particles of
carbon present at one time in the flame.                      If, after the barometer has
been standing at 30 inches, it falls to 29 inches, the light of all flames
is reduced to the extent of about 5 per cent.                      The temperature, upon
which the luminosity of a flame also depends, may be increased by
heating both the gas and the air supplied to it for combustion, before
they are brought together to be burned.
     The speaker exhibited a gas lamp which he had constructed to effect
this object. It consisted of an ordinary argand burner, with glass
chimney, but furnished with an outer glass cylinder resting upon a solid
plate of glass, through the centre of which the tube supplying the gas
rose.     Thus all the air supplied to the flame was compelled to pass
down between the chimney and outer cylinder, becoming thereby
strongly heated before it reached the flame, whilst considerable heat
was also imparted to the gas before the latter issued from the burner.
In this manner a great increase of light, with the same consumption of
gas, was obtained.
     The following table was exhibited, showing the effect of this hot
air gas-burner in reducing the consumption of gas for a given amount
of light, and thereby also the impurities and heat which are thrown
into the atmosphere in which such a lamp is burned: —

     The temperature necessary to render substances incandescent may
be imparted to them in various ways.       It may be given directly by
mechanical power, as in the " steel mill," formerly used in coal-mines.
Usually, however, chemical action is employed, as in gas, candle, and
oil-flames ; or electricity is used, as in the various forms of electric
light.
     The conditions necessary for a good and satisfactory artificial light
were now examined.      In the first place, the light should contain all
colours ; that      is,
                     should
                          it be capable of showing every variety of tint
which will be exposed to it. This       the case with the carbon electric
                                                is
light, and that of candle, oil, and gas flames, since the light from these
sources contains all the colours of the spectrum.     But there are many
colours which the mercurial electric light          incapable of showing, since
                                                          is
they are absent from its spectrum.           It was also shown that all pure
colours, except yellow, were perfectly black, when seen by the light of
incandescent sodium vapour.
     Solar light, although in so many respects superior to artificial light,
is  defective as regards the showing of colours. There are certain
colours which cannot be seen by solar light — for instance, all the colour
which can be seen by the sodium flame               quite invisible in daylight.
                                                          is
If  a pigment could be made of such          yellow colour as to be of exactly

black in solar light.     But our pigments are all mixed colours, and no
such pigment which thus entirely disappears in the light of the sun                 is
known.      But in addition to this tint of the sodium flame, there are
hundreds of other tints which are also not present in the solar spectrum,
and which are consequently invisible in daylight.
     Although solar light         inferior to artificial light in the complete
                                   is
 ness of its colours, yet, in another respect — in the comparatively small
amount of heat which accompanies its rays in proportion to the light
itself—   it   greatly superior to every sort of artificial light.
               is                                                      The great
amount of heat in our artificial lights        absolutely useless.

 mination cannot fail to impress upon us the difficulties in the way of
 the application of scientific discovery to the utilities of life.     How long
 was it  after the discovery of the production of gas from coal, before a
 manufacturer could be found to bring           into actual operation?

 years ago, working in his laboratory at Blansko, Reichenbach showed
 us the process by which we could obtain paraffin and paraffin-oil from
 bituminous coal     ; but the discovery remained unheeded for twenty
 years.    More than thirty years ago,. Mr. Faraday pointed out source      a
 of the electric light in the permanent magnet; but we, are only now
 beginning to use         for illuminating purposes.

  now beginning to flash across the sea, guiding the mariner safely into
   harbour, or warning him from approaching a dangerous coast.                   How
  long   will  thermo-electricity   have   to  wait    before   it receives  a similar
  application ? In thermo-electricity we have a direct transformation of
  the force of heat, which we obtain with such great economy from coal,
  into an electric current, and this, by further education and develop
  ment, might be rendered available in the production of the electric light.
  Hitherto, its application in this direction has been altogether unheeded,
 and yet, of all sources of the power necessary for the electric light,
  thermo-electricity evokes this power most directly from coal. In the
 magneto-electric light we have the great disadvantage, that the heat of
 burning coal must be first transformed into mechanical power, which is
 made to rotate the armatures of magnets, and thus produce the ne
 cessary electric current.      In this transformation of heat into mechanical
 power there is no less than 9-lOths of the original force in the coal
 absolutely lost. Hence the advantage which would result from the
 direct application of heat to the production of the electric current.
      The man of science rejoices in the discovery of truth for its own
 sake.    He gives his results freely to the world. It is no part of his
 duty,  it is not his function, to apply those truths to the utilities of life.
 Success in this direction demands quite different powers of mind. Those
 who possess these powers, ought also to acquire the necessary knowledge
 which would enable them, with more facility, to seize upon the disco
 veries of science, and apply them to the wants of every-day life. This
 scientific knowledge is the link which, up to the present time, has so
 sadly failed in the application of science to the manufacturing arts.

Tire chief interest that attaches to the discoveries lately made at Jeru
salem    by Signor Pierotti, corroborated, as they doubtless will be, in
all main points, by the still more recent investigations of the Count

24                           Kev. G. Williaml                    [Feb- 20,
de VogiitS and M. Waddington in the course of last year, is derived
from the remarkable confirmation which they afford to the received
views of the topography and archaeology of the Holy City, in the case
of those sites which are of greatest importance in connection with its
sacred history.    I gratefully accept all the facts brought to light by
Signer Pierotti, while     I  differ considerably from his inferences and
conclusions.    Here   I shall state my own views, without entering into
controversy.
     As it would be impossible to do justice to all these discoveries in
the course of a single lecture,     I propose to confine my remarks to the
site of the Temple and its contiguous fortress, Antonia.      The situation
of the former appears to be fixed beyond all possibility of doubt by
the recent discovery by Signor Pierotti of the complete water system
connected with the Hebrew temple, still existing as entire as when
it was in daily use during the period of the Jewish commonwealth.
The perfect preservation of this complicated system of aqueducts,
drains, and reservoirs, is owing to the fact that they are all exca
 vated in the solid rock, and therefore have not been affected by the
demolition of the structures above, except so far as they may have
 become partially blocked up by the accidental falling in of debris
of the ruined buildings.
     Had history been silent on the subject, yet we should have been
forced to conclude, from the account of the various sacrifices connected
with the Jewish ritual, especially from the description of the numerous
victims offered by Solomon at the Feast of Dedication, that there was
a very complete system of sewerage connected with the Temple, intro
ducing a large quantity of water to dilute the blood, which would
otherwise have had a tendency to coagulate, and carrying off the blood
and offal from the sacred precinct.
     This, history tells us, was actually the case. The fullest account
which is preserved of these waterworks is contained in the descrip
tion of the Holy City and of the Temple worship, in a tract of
Aristeas, who visited Jerusalem during the reign of Ptolemy Phila-
delphus, and who describes a vast series of reservoirs beneath the
area of the Temple, supplied by a copious spring of living water, and
connected together by pipes and conduits extending over a space of
five furlongs.    There were many openings to these hidden depths from
the area above, the secret of which was known only to the ministers of
the Temple ; and the supply of water was so managed as to flush the
whole court, and carry off the blood of the numerous sacrifices.       This
description is fully confirmed by the Mishna and other Jewish autho
rities.
     This language, which might formerly have appeared exaggerated,
 is now proved to be literally correct ; for those cisterns have been
actually explored, and the conduits and drains traversed in all direc
 tions by Signor Pierotti ; so it is no more matter of conjecture, but of
 ascertained and positive fact.
     It was the happy suggestion of Professor Willis, and a striking

1863.]              on recent Discoveries at Jerusalem.                  25
example of that marvellous intuition for which he is so remarkable in
investigations of this nature, that the hole in the Sacred Rock of the
Moslems, under the well-known Dome of their Mosk, and the cave
in that rock, now so familiar to all from the frequent descriptions of
many travellers, but especially from the drawings of Mr. Catherwood,
were the drain and cesspool of the Jewish altar ; and that the round
hole in the centre of the rocky pavement of that cave was the mouth
of the channel by which the blood, poured out at the horns of the
altar, flowed off, according to the Mishna, to the valley of the Kidron.
That theory of Professor Willis really implied the condition that, if
ever the hollow in the rock under that circular stone should be ex
plored, there would be found an aqueduct for bringing in a supply of
water on one side, and a drain for carrying off the blood and water
on the other side.     Now such is really proved to be the case ; and
 Signor Pierotti has actually entered that lower cave by one channel,
and quitted it by the other.
      The supply of water, which no longer flows in these channels owing
to various obstructions, was derived from the celebrated Pools of
Solomon on the road to Hebron, south of Bethlehem, and was brought
 to Jerusalem by an aqueduct which still exists.     It crosses the Valley
of the Tyropceon by the artificial embankment which joins Mount Sion
 to the Temple Mount — the Bridge of the Jewish historian.           It was
 then received into a well, sunk in the rock immediately in front of the
 Porch of El-Aksa, from whence it was distributed according to the
 exigences of the Temple worship ; for the supply could be regulated
 according to the requirements of the season.       The channel for the
 supply of the Temple ran northward from this well, under the wide
 causeway which leads from the north door of El- Aksa to the south gate
 of the Dome of the Rock, passes under the stairs opposite the Gate of
 Prayer, and so through the rock of the raised platform into the lower
 cave, as already described, which marks the site of the altar of the daily
 burnt-sacrifice.   When this is once ascertained, the whole Temple can
 be laid out, with the help of the tract Middoth (Measures) in the
 Mishna ; and it is a curious and interesting fact, that when the various
 parts of the Temple are distributed and adjusted according to these
 measures, the interval between the western wall of the Holy of Holies
 and the boundary-wall of the inner Temple, is exactly what it ought to
  be, supposing the western limit of the inner Temple to correspond with
  that of the raised platform of the Haram, which, as being cut in the
  live rock, has probably remained unaltered from Jewish times.
       The drain from under the Jewish altar then runs northward for a
  distance of 120 feet, to a large double cistern, hollowed in the rock of
  the raised platform of the Haram.     The Jewish authorities inform us,
  that the place where the victims were slaughtered, the hooks to which
  they were hung for the purpose of being flayed, and the marble tables
  on which they were dressed, and the parts appropriate for the sacrifice
  separated and prepared, was to the north of the great altar.        Here,
  therefore, would be the greatest effusion of blood and other matter

 26    •                     Kev. G. Williams                      [Feb. 20,
 connected    with the slaughter of the beasts ; and here, accordingly,
 were these large receptacles, with an arrangement for a fresh supply of
 water coming in from the west, the source of which has not yet been
 fully investigated.
     From this point    the sewerage took an easterly direction, and ran
 through   a triple rock-hewn  tank under the lower area of the Temple,
 about half way between the raised platform and the eastern wall,
 where it was further diluted by a fresh supply of water introduced by
an aqueduct from the enormous tank outside the northern wall of the
 Temple Close, known as the traditionary Pool of Bethesda. The
drain then passes under the wall of the Haram, and skirting it on the
east side, along the narrow ridge now occupied by a Moslem burial-
ground, descends steeply to the Fountain of the Virgin, in the valley of
the Kidron, where, according to the Mishna, this sewerage from the
Temple was disposed of as liquid manure to the market-gardeners.
     So much of the water from Solomon's pools as was not required for
the use of the Temple, flowed off from the well in front of El-Aksa to
an enormous rocky reservoir, called the Royal Pool in the chronicles
of the Crusades ; from whence it ran by a channel traced by Signor
Pierotti, to the same Fountain of the Virgin.
     The next point of interest in these recent discoveries, is the secret
passage which Herod the Great made, according to Josephus, for the
purpose of connecting the fortress of Antonia with the eastern gate
of the inner Temple — as the present text of the Jewish historian reads.
Such a passage has been found by Signor Pierotti, extending from the
Golden Gate in a north-westerly direction.       But unhappily he has not
been able to follow it along its whole length ; only one section from
the Golden Gate about 130 feet long, and another fragment of about
 150 feet in length, being at present practicable.
     It is true that this would connect Antonia with the eastern gate
of the outer, not of the inner Temple.        But in the first place, it is
obvious that if the passage had been designed to communicate with the
inner Temple, it would have run to the northern, not to the eastern gate,
which was much more distant from the fortress ; and further, as one
object of Herod was to provide for his escape into the country, in case
of a sedition in the city, that purpose would not have been answered by
securing a hidden access only to the gate of the inner Temple.        When
then, it is considered that the change of a single letter would obviate
these difficulties, and place the passage precisely where it is found,
it is perhaps not taking too great a liberty with the text to propose to
read TOV t&eiv iipov (the outer Temple) in the passage in question,
instead of rov itria0cv ttpov (the inner Temple) as the text now
stands.
     The   course of Herod's passage is of great importance for deter
mining   the position both of the eastern gate and of the fortress Antonia.
It has been much disputed, whether that fortress stood entirely without
the present area of the Haram, or entirely within it ; or partly within,
partly without.     Light may be thrown on this question by an angle      of

1

massive masonry, which has been found embedded in the rock towards
the north-west corner of the great court of the Mosk, between the raised
platform and that corner which presents along its north side a wall of
solid rock rising to a height of from twenty to twenty-five feet. Indeed,
the whole area in this quarter bears marks of the rock having been
worked down to its present level by artificial means ; and corroborates
the account given by Josephus of the operations of the Jews under
Simon the Maccabee, after having driven the Macedonian garrison
out of the castle built on the Temple-mount by Antiochus Epiphanes.
 He tells us that they not only demolished the castle, but rooted up the
very rock on which it was built, in order that they might never for the
future be subjected to like annoyance.         It was a great work, and occu
 pied them three years and six months, although they worked at it in
cessantly night and day.
       It is not likely, then, that this angle of solid masonry can have
 belonged to a building, not only destroyed to the foundation, but the
 very site of which was removed. It was more probably connected with
 the fortress Antonia of later times ; and, if so, may serve to explain a
 perplexing passage of Josephus, who, in speaking of the portents which
 preceded the destruction of Jerusalem, says that the Jews, by the
 destruction of Antonia, had made the Temple quadrangular ; while it
 was written in their oracles that the city should be taken when their
 Temple became quadrangular.           It is vain to inquire to what oracle he
 refers ; but it is obvious to remark that Antonia was not demolished
 by the Jews, for there is constant reference to it during the siege of
 Titus. Josephus can only refer to the destruction of some part of the
  buildings of Antonia contiguous to the Temple, and projecting into
  the area, the demolition of which made the enclosure quadrangular.
  The massive masonry lately discovered probably marks the south-east
 angle of this projection.
       That the greater part of the fortress Antonia stood without the
  Temple Close seems to be proved by another important work which has
  lately been brought to light.
       This is a subterranean passage of noble proportions, partly cut in
  rock, and partly constructed of very solid masonry, which joins the
 Haram enclosure near the north-west angle, just east of the minaret,
 at a depth of about twenty feet below the surface of the rocky pave
 ment of the court, or more than forty feet below the upper surface of
 the wall of rock, which, as has been already stated, bounds the Haram
 in this quarter.    The direction of this stupendous gallery is northward,
  bearing slightly to the west.      It extends in length 224 feet, passing
  under the Via Dolorosa.       It is 22 feet wide, 29 feet high ; covered in
  at the top with long slabs of stone.       There is a door in the side wall,
   17 feet high and 9 feet wide, blocked up with solid masonry ; and high
  up in the side walls a row of small openings, as for windows, which
  seem to be of later date than the gallery itself.        Two narrower pas
  sages open out of the main vault, one running east, the other west.
  At the south end of the passage, where it joins the Haram enclosure,

is  an ancient door, now blocked up ; but Signor Pierotti could dis
cover no corresponding door in the rocky wall or pavement above, by
which the vault might have had egress to the Temple Close. It              is,
therefore, very probably the entrance to Herod's secret passage, leading
to the eastern gate already noticed, the direction of which, as far as     it
can be determined by the parts already explored,       is   towards this door
way.
      The great gallery itself must certainly have belonged to the fortress
Antonia, or, perhaps, rather to its predecessor, the Baris, or castle of
the Asmonean princes, as     it   answers very closely to the description of
the dark subterranean passage which Josephus mentions as the scene of
the murder of Antigonus      by  the guards of his brother Aristobulus, under
the tragic circumstances       detailed  by the historian.   This passage was
called Strata's   Tower,   and  was  so closely  connected with the Baris that
 the sounds from the vault reached the ears of the high-priest, Aristo
bulus, who was lying ill in the castle.        It was doubtless covered way
                                                              a
 designed to connect one part of the fortress with another, for greater
 security in the case of siege.       A little beyond the northern extremity
 of this passage, but near the surface of the ground, Signor Pierotti
 accidentally tapped what appeared to be tank of rotten water, but
                                             a                              it
 continued to flow on, and has never ceased, thus proving itself to be an
 aqueduct, probably part of that great work of King Hezekiah, recorded
 in the 2nd Book of Chronicles xxxii.       3,   4,  30, and referred to in his
 eulogy in the Book of Ecclesiasticus, xlviii. 17.
      Another remarkable confirmation of the hypothesis that the fortress
 Antonia occupied the site determined by the subway just noticed,           is
 found in the situation of the Roman arch, commonly known as " the
 Arch of the Ecce Homo," which spans the Via Dolorosa about 90 feet
 west of the point where that street passes over the subterranean gallery.
 It had long been doubted whether the arch in question was a Roman
 arch. That doubt has now been removed by the accidental discovery
 of the north side portal of the Gateway.             It had been covered for
 centuries    by debris, and was accidentally brought to light by land a
  slip, occasioned      an excavation being made in the neighbourhood, for
                        by
 the foundation of buildings connected with the establishment of the
  " Filles de Sion." This portal unquestionably of Roman workman
                                      is
 ship, asis   also the larger arch;    and there was no doubt  a    correspond
  ing portal on the south side, which may still be discovered.        Thus the
  gateway would resemble those ancient arches which are still found in
  Rome, imitations of which were not unfrequent in the provinces — which
  also furnished models for Temple Bar and the Marble Arch         !
       Such
          a     gateway in this situation could be nothing else than the
  communication between the city and the fortress Antonia, or the
  successor    of that fortress, which may possibly have been erected
  when Jerusalem was restored by Hadrian, under the name of /Kli.i
  Capitolina.
       From this   it results that the house of the Turkish Pasha occupies
  the site of the official residence of the Roman Governor, and that the

              On the Ancient Lake- Habitations        of Switzerland.
After      explaining the circumstances which led to the discovery by Dr.
 Keller, of    the Pfahlbauten,* or Lake-habitations of Switzerland ; and
after referring to the account given by Herodotus, of the Pseonians,
 who dwelt on platforms over Lake Prasias, Mr. Lubbock proceeded
 to state that the Lake-villages of Switzerland might be divided into
 three classes : — Firstly, those in which all the instruments are made
 of stone and bone, and which are therefore said to belong to the
 Stone age ; secondly, those in which objects made of bronze also
 occur, and which therefore are said to belong to the Bronze age ; and
 thirdly, those in which implements of iron have been discovered.
 Of the first class at least fifty Lake-villages have been described ; the
 second class is even more numerous ; but of the third, only very
 few are known.
       On the larger lakes several of these curious villages have been
 discovered : thus, on the Lake of Bienne twenty are known ; on the
  Lake of Geneva, about twenty- four ; on the Lake of Constance, more
 than thirty ; and on that of Neufchatel, as many as forty-six.
       As a type of the Pfahlbauten belonging to the Stone age, Mr.
 Lubbock took the one at Wauwyl, which is a small station on a flat
 plain, on the railway from Sofingen, in the canton of Lucerne.
  Originally a lake, the growth of peat turned it into a marsh, which has
  now been drained.
       Here and there a few piles may be seen, projecting two or three
  feet above the general surface ; and on examining the peat at these
 spots, and comparing them with its structure elsewhere, it appears that
 when the plain was under water, the natives had made small artificial
 islands, by heaping together leaves, branches of trees, and mud, and

enclosing them by, as it were, walls of piles to prevent them from
being washed away.
     Mr. Lubbock had the advantage of visiting this interesting
spot with Col. Suter, MM. Suter, Morlot, and Fickart, on which
occasion   several ancient implements made of stone and bone were
obtained, besides numerous fragments of pottery, and many bones of
animals which had been used as food.

  The implements of bone                  are less numerous ; those found                      at
Wauwyl, as elsewhere, appear            to fall into four principal divisions.

Besides which are a few teeth, artificially perforated ; and one or two
harpoonlike instruments, making altogether nearly a hundred articles
made   of   bone.
    There are also a few objects made of wood ; but these, even if
originally numerous, would be difficult to distinguish from the sur
rounding peat, especially as it contains so many branches, and they
would also be very difficult to extract entire. Perhaps, therefore, imple
ments of wood may have been much more varied and common than
the collections would appear to indicate.
    It is impossible to give any numerical statistics about the pottery
on account of the fragmentary state in which it is found.     It is however
very  rude  and  coarse, containing grains  of quartz ; and there  is no evi
dence  that  the potter's wheel  was in use.
    We know nothing as yet about the manner in which the ancient
inhabitants of Wauwyl were clothed.       In some of the other settlements,
however, which belong also to what is called the Stone age, although
possibly to a later portion of        it,
                                   as for instance in the Pfahlbauten at
Robenhausen, on Lake Pfeffikon, and Wangen, on Lake Constance,
pieces of rude stuff made of flax and straw have been found.
    Similarly, Robenhausen and Wangen have supplied us with nu
merous specimens of wheat and barley, both as single grains and in
the ear, with pieces of apples and pears, and even with           few cakes      a
of bread or biscuit.

      The animal remains from Wauwyl have been examined by Professor
Rutiraeyer, of Basle, and include nearly thirty species, all belonging to
existing species, excepting the Bos primigenius ; and even this is per
haps represented by some of the races of our domestic oxen.
      The commonest species are the red deer, the domestic ox, and the
marsh boar, a variety which is supposed by Professor Rutimeyer to be
distinct from the common wild boar of Europe, and which he considers
 to have been wild at Wauwyl, though it seems to have been domesticated
 by the inhabitants of the later Pile-buildings. Human bones are very
 rare.    Indeed, in the very last memoir which has appeared on the sub
ject, M. Desor states that no single human skeleton has yet been obtained
 from any one of the numerous Pfahlbauten of the Stone age.
      The examination of the tumuli does not seem as yet to have thrown
 much light upon this part of the question. So far indeed as Denmark
 is concerned, the case is very different ; many skeletons have there been
 found in the great chambered tumuli, belonging to the Stone age. The
 skulls are small and round, altogether resembling those of the Lapps,
 and very different from those now most common in Europe, as well as
 from those which are found in interments of the Iron age.
       Whether the same was the case in Switzerland and Europe gene
 rally, still remains to be proved ; many archaeologists incline more or
 less strongly to the opinion, that at the Stone age our continent was
 inhabited by a race of men akin to the modern Laplanders, who have
 in the south been replaced by a superior and more civilized race.        Dr.
 Keller, however, appears to consider that the Pfahlbauten show a gra
 dual improvement, and not any such sudden changes.
       There are also in the Lake-habitations of Ihe Stone age some traces
 of commerce, or at least of barter. The flint, of which the flakes and
 arrowheads were formed, must have come from a distance, and the best
 pieces in all probability were imported from France.          Perhaps, how
  ever, this was not the result of any commerce, properly so called, but
  visits may have been made to the French quarries, just as Catlin tells
  us that the American tribes, from far and near, visited the red pipe-
  stone quarry of Coteau des Prairies.
       Some pieces of Mediterranean coral have been found at Concise,
  and of Baltic amber at Meilen.       But as both these settlements appear
  to have belonged to the transitional period, between the stone and the
  bronze, we must not lay too much stress on them.
       But the most important fact of this nature is the presence of
  axes made from nephrite. This rock is not known to occur in the Alps,
  or indeed in Switzerland, and the Swiss naturalists infer that it must
  have been introduced from the East.        Even  if,  however, this should
  eventually turn out to be correct, it   would not be   aconclusive proof of
  commerce properly so called, as the nephrite might have passed from
  hand to hand and from tribe to tribe by   a   sort of barter. Other facts
  of similar tendency are on record. Thus Messrs. Squier and Davis
   a
  tell us (p. 306) that in the tumuli of the Mississippi valley we find " side
  by side, in the same mounds, native copper from Lake Superior, mica

from the Alleghanies, shells from the Gulf, and obsidian (perhaps por
phyry) from Mexico." Good representations of the seacow, or manatee,
are found a thousand miles from the shores inhabited by that animal,
and shells of the large tropical Pyrula Perversa are found in the tumuli,
round the great lakes, two thousand miles from home.
     The Pfahlbauten at the Pont de Thiele, between the Lakes of
Bienne and Neufchatel, those at Lake Moosseedorf and at Lake
Pfeffikon, in fact most of those situated on small lakes or lagoons, are
more or less grown over with peat. On the contrary, in the large lakes
no peat grows.       At the entrance of the rivers, indeed, much mud is
of course accumulated ; the Lake of G eneva, for instance, once no doubt
extended for a considerable distance up the valley of the Rhone.       But
the gravel and mud brought down by that river are, as every one knows,
soon deposited, and the water of the lake is elsewhere beautifully
clear and pure.
     The lake itself is very deep, in parts as much as 980 feet, and the
banks are generally steep ; but round the margin there is in most places
a fringe of shallow water, due probably to the erosive action of the
waves, and known to the fishermen as the " blancfond," because the
lake is there of a pale greyish hue when contrasted with the bright
blue of the central, deeper water.
      It is on this " blancfond," and at depths of sometimes as much as
fifteen feet, that the Pfahlbauten were generally constructed.
     All that can now be seen are the tops of the piles, which project
but little above the bottom of the lakes, their upper parts having been
worn away by the action of the water.
     They are but seen in winter, when the water is both lower and
clearer ; but even in summer they are quite visible, if the water is still,
and may even be seen from the deck of a steamboat.            Mr. Lubbock
had visited several of the settlements on the Lake of Geneva, and had
himself obtained bits of pottery, &c , from them.
     Dwellings thus built over the water would not only protect their
inhabitants from the attacks of wild beasts, but would also serve as
fortifications ; still, though it is evident that the security thus given
would amply compensate for much extra labour, it still remains
difficult to understand in what manner the piles were driven into it.
     In many cases indeed settlements of the Stone age are characterized
by what are called "Steinbergs," that is to say, artificial heaps of
stones, &c., evidently brought by the natives to serve as a support to
the piles.    In fact, they found it easier to raise the bottom round the
piles, than to drive the piles into the bottom.
     Turning then to the Pfahlbauten belonging to the Bronze age, Mr.
Lubbock described the one at Nidau on the Lake of Bienne, whence a
very large and interesting collection has been obtained by Col. Schwab.
As a considerable number of objects made of stone have been found
here, it is possible that this place was inhabited during the Stone age.
It is, however, characterized by the great number of weapons, in
struments, and ornaments made of bronze, such as axes, lances, sickles,

 1863.]      on the  Ancient Lake-Habitation* of Switzerland.             33
 fish-hooks, bracelets, hairpins, earrings, &c., which are altogether nearly
 2000 in number.
      These objects were all cast, and the skill displayed in their manu
 facture, as well as the beauty of their forms and ornamentation, shows
 a considerable development of art.
     The discovery of a bar of tin at Estavayer, and at Morges of a
 mould for casting celts, proved that some at least of these objects were
 made in Switzerland, while evidence of a similar nature shows that
 other countries in Europe, as, for instance, Denmark, England, and
 Ireland, had also their own foundries.
     The similarity of form and ornamentation appears to indicate some
communication between different parts of Europe ; thus, one of the
 swords found in Switzerland is almost exactly like a specimen disco
 vered in Denmark.         But as Cornwall and Saxony are the only known
 European sources of tin, the mere presence of bronze is in itself a suf-
 6cient evidence not only of metallurgical skill, but also of commerce.
     With this immense number of objects in bronze discovered at
 Nidau, three articles of iron have been discovered. This is not suffi
cient evidence that the village was occupied during the Iron age.
 Indeed, the pile-dwellings       seem at this period to have greatly
diminished, and to have been succeeded by dwellings built on land.
     They were not, however, altogether abandoned.            The most re
 markable lake-dwelling of the Iron age, is that at Tene, in the Lake of
 Keufchatel, whence many objects in iron have been obtained. The
 most characteristic are large swords, which are in form and ornamen
tation entirely different both from those of the Bronze ago, and from
those used by the Romans.
     Here we meet also with baked pottery, of that kind generally
known as Roman.         Professor Desor, however, considers that both the
 Romans and the tribes living north of the Alps obtained a knowledge
of this art at a very early period, and perhaps from the Etruscans, by
whom it was certainly brought to great perfection.
     Swords, and other objects like those of the Tene, have been found
on a held off battle at a place called the Tiefenau, near Berne, with
Gaulish coins.       We shall not, therefore, probably be far wrong if we
consider that    the  Tene was a village of the Helvetians, occupied at a
period   before,  but   probably not many hundred years before, the great
irruption  of  the  Romans   into Northern Europe.
     Mr. Lubbock then referred to the statement by Hesiod, that there
was a time when men worked in bronze, and were ignorant of iron ;
and to the still more valuable evidence of Homer, who, though
acquainted with the use of iron, represented bronze as the common
material of arms, instruments, and vessels of various sorts.        Though
confirmed by the discoveries of Sir R. Colt Hoare, these statements
were, however, regarded by many archaeologists         as poetical myths ;
and though the scientific classification proposed by the Scandinavian
archaeologists was gradually gaining ground, it could not be said to be
universally adopted.

      It is scarcely necessary to observe that these three ages are to be
regarded as states of civilization rather than as actual chronological
horizons.     Western Europe seems to have passed from an age of stone
to one of bronze ; many nations have (thanks to commerce) risen at
once from stone to iron.        Again, while the inhabitants of Southern
Europe were already acquainted with the use of iron 3000 years ago,
at the time of the discovery of America the Mexicans were in an age
of bronze, the Northern American Indians in one of copper, while many
savage tribes are only in the Stone age even now.
      Moreover, it is not to be supposed that stone instruments were
altogether abandoned as soon as metal was introduced.        For some pur
poses stone was as good as bronze, or even iron.         In religious cere
 monies, also, many nations appear to have had a prejudice against the
introduction of a new substance.      Thus the Egyptians used stone knives
 in opening bodies which were to be embalmed. The Jews seem to
 have performed the act of circumcision in the same manner ; as we
 read in Exodus, that Zipporah, the wife of Moses, took a sharp stone
for that purpose.     The Mexicans, again, are stated to have used obsidian
 knives in the sacrifices to their idols.
       No doubt, also, metal was at first very precious, and was more or
 less confined to the rich.    There is also plenty of evidence derived
 from the tumuli of the coexistence of stone and bronze implements.
       Again, there must have been a period of transition between the
 Bronze and Iron ages. Soon, however, it would be found that for
 certain purposes iron had an overwhelming advantage over bronze.
 Thus when the two metals are found together, all cutting edges, all
 swords, knives, &c., are formed of iron, while ornaments are made of
 bronze. So great, indeed, is the advantage of iron as a weapon that
 we have but little evidence of the two metals having been used
 simultaneously for this purpose.
       As long, however, as these conclusions rested on the evidence
 derived from tumuli, many objections might be raised to them
       Much more satisfactory is that obtained from the kjokkenmoddings
 of Denmark. These dust-heaps of ancient times, though they teem
 with flint implements, have not yet yielded any trace of metals, and it
 is even questionable whether the more skilfully made stone implements
 are found in them.
       They tell, therefore, only one part of the story ; while the Pfahl-
 bauten of Switzerland, which are, in fact, subaqueous kjokkenmoddings,
 illustrate not only the later Stone age, but also that of Bronze, and,
  though but partially, that of Iron.
       Being strongly persuaded that the value of the evidence derived
  from the Swiss lakes was much enhanced by the great number of
  objects which had been found, Mr. Lubbock had taken every oppor
  tunity of counting the axes, &c., obtained at each locality.       In the
  following table, he has brought together the results, so far at least as
  regard six of the Pfahlbauten.                                        •

     He does not give this table as strictly correct, the smaller numbers
indeed, are, he believes, accurate, but the larger ones might doubtless
be increased.   For instance, in several places the simple flint-flakes,
heavy whetstones, and irregular      hammers were not all collected ;
again, in many cases no account had been kept of common objects
which had been given away. For these and other reasons, the table,
striking as it         less so than a more accurate one would have
                     is,     is
been.
     Again,   must be remembered that Moosseedorf and Nidau are
              it
within fifteenmiles of one another, and that the Pont de Thiele and
Nidau are on the borders of the same lake.
    But it   not only in the presence or absence of bronze that the
              is
Pfahlbauten differ from one another there are many other indications
                                                       ;
of progress. We cannot expect to find much evidence of this in
the implements of bone or stone, because they were gradually re
placed by bronze but, as has already been mentioned, the better forms
                         ;
of stone axe, and those which are perforated, are very rare, or
altogether absent in the stone age, none having been found at the
Pont de Thiele, at Moosseedorf, or at Wauwyl, and only two at
Wangen.
     Again,   it    not only
                    is            the mere presence of bronze, but by the
                                        by
beauty   and   variety of  the articles made out of      that we are so much

struck.    In collection of articles made at any of the stone age set
               a
tlements,    one cannot fail to remark the uniformity which prevails.
The wants of the artificers seem to have been few and simple. In the
Bronze age all this          altered. We find not only, as before, axes,
                                  is
arrows, and knives, but in addition swords, lances, sickles, earrings,
bracelets, pins, rings, and a variety of other articles.       Moreover,                   it   is
a  very remarkable fact, especially when we consider the great,          might        I
say the immense number of bronze celts which are found, that scarcely
two of them have been cast in the same mould.
     The pottery again tells the same tale. There            no evidence that
                                                                     is
the potter's wheel was known to the men of the Stone age, while there
is  proof that      was in use in the Bronze age.
                    it                                  Again, the materials
of  which   the Stone  age pottery      composed  are
                                                  is  very rough, and contain
large grains     of  quartz, while   that of the  Bronze   age    much more    is
carefully prepared. The ornaments of the two periods show also                                  a
 great contrast.     In the Stone age they consist of impressions made by
 the nail, or the finger, and sometimes         by a cord twisted round the
 soft clay. The lines are all straight, or if curved are very irregular,
 and badly drawn.        In the Bronze age all the patterns present in the
 Stone age are continued, but in addition we find circles and spirals                             ;
 while imitations of animals and plants are characteristic of the Iron
 age.

   Thus, then, we see that the distinction between the ages of stone
and bronze is by no means confined to the mere presence of metal.
Some may consider that the evidence is not yet sufficient to justify any
conclusion.      Still the nature and execution of the ornaments— the
manufacture of the pottery, the presence of the potter's wheel, the
greater variety of requirements as evidenced by the greater variety of
implements, the indications of more advanced husbandry, the diminu
tion of wild animals and the increase of tame ones — all indicate a
higher civilization for the inhabitants of Morges and Nidau, than for
those of Moosseedorf and Wauwyl.
    The speaker then pointed out, in a few words, the distinctive
features of the earlier stone, or drift period. The stone hatchets of this
age are invariably left rough, not one out of several thousands which
have now been discovered showing any trace of being polished ; while
                       At first wild, subsequently   domesticated.

38                            Mr.  J.  Lubbock                   [Feb. 27,
those of the second stone period, that to which the Swiss Lake-habi
tations belong, are as invariably ground.       Secondly, the greater anti
quity of the drift hatchets is indicated by the position in which they
are found; and, thirdly, by the remains of extinct mammalia, such as
the mammoth and the woolly-haired rhinoceros, with which they are
found.
     Thus then we can break up the history of the human race in Europe
into four more or less well-marked periods. First, the Drift or Mammoth
period ; secondly, the later Stone age, to which the Danish Kjokken-
moddings and some of the Swiss Pfahlbauten belong ; thirdly, the
Bronze age ; and fourthly, the Iron age.       These four ages will doubt
less ere long be again themselves subdivided.      Already we may distin
guish between a first and a second Iron age ; and the Kjokkenmoddings
certainly indicate a less advanced civilization than that represented by
the Pfahlbauten.       This, however, may possibly be accounted for by
their geographical position.
     There are two cases in which, by comparing the changes which had
taken place since the Roman period with those which have occurred
since the later Stone age, an approximate date (of from 5000 to 7000
years) has been obtained for the latter. In both these cases the speaker,
having been over the ground, could find no flaw in the argument. Such
calculations are, however, very uncertain ; but if they are confirmed by
similar ones made elsewhere, they may eventually lead us to something
like a correct chronology.
     Mr. Lubbock then concluded as follows : —
     " History, indeed, will not help us in our difficulty.  The record of
a nation's life could not be written until the discovery of letters,
themselves one of the most marvellous products of human genius.
No trace of them has yet been discovered in the Bronze age ; but even
assuming, which is not impossible, that writing was then discovered,
still this carries us back but a single step, and it is evidently as im
possible for a nation to record its own origin and the commencement of
its civilization, as it would be for any of us to describe from recollec
tion his own birth and infancy.
     " Have we, then, no alternative but to give up the past as hopeless ?
Is Stonehenge, for instance, never to be anything more to us than an
object of ignorant admiration, and is it destined eventually, as it would
then perhaps deserve, to be swallowed up by the advancing wave of
cultivation ? Must we, in the eloquent words of Palgrave, ' Give it
up, that speechless past ; whether fact or chronology, doctrine or
mythology ; whether in Europe, Asia, Africa, or America ; at Thebes
or Palenque, on Lycian shore or Salisbury Plain : lost is lost ; gone is
gone for ever.'
     " Surely this is not so. If, as is becoming more and more probable,
the law of causation      has held good throughout the history of our
world, if nature has remained the same, and the present has always
been the natural consequence of the past, then it follows that the past

1863.]           on the  Ancient Lake- Habitations of Switzerland.             39
has already written        its own history on the present, and the interpreta
tion   of the record is a question not of possibility, but of time and
perseverance.
      " But    for the present, we must content ourselves with much humbler
results.      It is much if the clouds of ignorance are in places clearing
away ; if from the summit which we occupy we can catch occasional
glimpses of the distant past far away beneath our feet.
      " So far as these Lake-habitations are concerned, and so far as one
short hour would permit,          I   have endeavoured to give you a faithful
account of the discoveries already made, and in doing so have confined
myself almost entirely to a simple statement of facts; fearing, lest
perhaps imagination, tempted by opportunity, might lead us away from
truth.     For imagination is a bad master, though a good servant ; and
yet it is almost as necessary to progress in science and the arts as heat
 is to life.
      " From the stamped bricks of Assyria to the modern printing-press
 seems but a step ; and yet mankind hovered on the brink of discovery
 for more than 3000 years.           So again the piles in the Swiss lakes had
long    been   known,    objects of antiquity had even been found among them ;
yet    these   were   in  themselves   but barren observations, and have might
so remained until now, if the genius of Dr. Keller had not supplied the
 spark which kindled the dead facts into a living science.
      " And yet science is considered by many, perhaps by most of us, as
 hard, dry, and unpoetical.          If the absolute necessity of teaching in our
 schools some few of the discoveries made in the last 1800 years, is day
by day more generally recognized, still it is rather regarded as an evil,
 than welcomed as a blessing, from the fear lest, in developing the
memory, we might tend perhaps to cramp the imagination. Yet science
is not only truer, but more sublime than mythology ; grander than
 the disreputable deities of the Greeks, or the old fairy tales of
 Europe.
       " Poets    have invented no monsters more wonderful than those which
 geology     has   revealed to us. The laws of nature are more powerful and
                                                                       '
 more subtle than any of the genii in the ' Arabian Nights ; and the
 philosopher who can place himself in harmony with nature, and avail
 himself of the opportunities by which he is surrounded, need envy
 neither Merlin his magic, nor Aladdin his lamp.
       "Can anything be more magnificent than the last triumph of
 chemistry, when, not content with the conquest of this world, she soars
  into the heavens, and by means of his own light, analyzes the sun
  himself?       Or turning once more finally, and but for a moment, to our
  immediate subject, surely his imagination must be dead indeed who
  feels no emotion at the spectacle of an ancient and long-forgotten
  people, after slumbering for centuries in the grave of oblivion, rising
  thus, as it were, to take once more that place which properly belongs to
  it in the history of the human race."

 On the Photographic         Transparency       of Bodies, and   on   the Photo
                graphic Spectra of the Elementary Bodies.
After a few preliminary remarks upon the triple nature of the force,
calorific, luminous, and chemical, associated together in the radiation
which emanates from luminous sources, the speaker stated his inten
tion of limiting himself in great measure to some recent investigations
upon the chemical rays.*
     It is well known that bodies which are transparent to light are not
equally so to radiant heat.          Glass, for example, which to the eye is
perfectly transparent and limpid, arrests a large portion of the rays -of
heat emitted by bodies which are not sufficiently hot to become
luminous.      Pure rock-salt, on the other hand, transmits rays of both
light  and  heat from all sources freely.         In like manner, in the case of
rays  which   produce   chemical     action,   corresponding effects have been
observed ; glass absorbing many of the chemical rays, whilst quartz
transmits such rays freely.
     The chemical rays emitted by luminous objects vary greatly both in
quantity and in quality, some sources of light emitting rays of much
higher refrangibility than others.          Thus, the flame of ordinary coal-
gas burned in admixture with air, so as to produce the blue light of a
smokeless gas flame, gives out scarcely any rays capable of affecting
an ordinary photographic plate ; whilst the same amount of gas, burned
    * The expressions here employed are simply used as descriptive of the effects
ordinarily produced by the different portions of the spectrum, not as necessarily
implying that the rays which produce the effects of heat, light, and chemical
action respectively are essentially different, except in the number and frequency
of the vibrations by which they are produced, the most refrangible rays being
produced by the shortest and most frequent vibrations.

 1863.]       on the  Photographic Transparency of Bodies.              43
in the ordinary manner for illumination, emits a very decided though
limited amount of rays capable of producing chemical action.          The
rays emanating from the intensely hot jet of the oxyhydrogen flame,
are nearly without action upon a sensitive surface of collodion ; whilst if
thrown upon a ball of lime, the light then emitted contains as large a
proportion of chemical rays as the solar light, and of very nearly the
same refrangibility.    But the most remarkable source of the chemical
rays is afforded by the light of the electric spark or of the voltaic arc,
the chemical spectrum of which is three or four times as long as the
chemical spectrum obtainable from the sun itself.
     1. Photographic    Transparency of various Media. — Amongst the
methods of testing the extent of chemical action of any given radiant
source, the most convenient is that which is dependent upon the
extent of photographic effect exerted upon a surface of collodion coated
with iodide of silver, on which the spectrum is allowed to fall.
     In no case does it appear that any non-luminous source can emit
chemical rays of sufficient intensity to traverse ordinary refracting
media ; and amongst the rays given off by various luminous objects, it
is found that the chemical effects upon the collodion plate are not per
ceptible in those portions upon which the first three-fourths of the
visible spectrum has fallen, but they commence powerfully in the last
fourth; and in the case of the electric spark are prolonged to an extent
equal to between four and five times the length of the visible portion.
     A diagram exhibiting the relative lengths of the visible solar spec
trum, and the photographic spectrum obtained from the electric spark
between silver points, showed this fact in a striking manner.
     It was known to those who have studied the spectrum, that many
colourless substances besides glass exert an absorptive action upon some
of these chemical rays ; but the subject had not hitherto received that
careful experimental examination which its importance seems to war
rant. Exact knowledge upon these points became requisite in the course
of an investigation upon the photographic spectra of the metals in
which the speaker was engaged.
     In the prosecution of these inquiries it was a desideratum to pro
cure some substance which should possess a higher dispersive power
than quartz, and which, whilst avoiding the double refraction of quartz,
should yet allow the free passage of the chemical rays.       The speaker
was hence led to try a variety of substances which, owing to their trans
parency to light, might reasonably be hoped to possess chemical trans
 parency also.
     The inquiry soon extended itself beyond the limits originally pro
posed, and ultimately embraced a large number of bodies in the solid,
liquid, and gaseous conditions.
     Before, however, proceeding to detail the results obtained, the
speaker alluded to the discovery of Professor Stokes, that many bodies
exist which, when placed in the invisible extra-violet, or more refran
gible portion of the spectrum, exhibit the remarkable power of absorbing

44                                Dr. W. A. Miller                  [March 6,
the rays of this portion, and radiating them forth again in a visible
form.    Bodies which possess this power Mr. Stokes termed fluorescent.
Now the chemical rays are exactly those which occasion fluorescence
most powerfully.    The light thus rendered visible           is,
                                                          however, very
feeble, compared with that of the ordinary luminous portions yet        ;       it
may be rendered distinctly visible to those who are sufficiently near by
allowing this chemically active portion of the spectrum to fall upon a
screen consisting of some fluorescent substance, such as one of the salts
of uranium, or     solution of oesculin, which latter was the material
                         a
employed on the present occasion.
     Returning then to the course of his own experiments, the speaker
stated that although he had found in rock-salt, fluor-spar, water, and
some few other substances, compounds which were almost as diactinic,
or chemically transparent as quartz, he had not succeeded in finding
anything which could be advantageously substituted for quartz in the
preparation of the prisms and lenses required in the investigations in
which he was engaged.
    Among the most remarkable results upon the photographic trans
parency of bodies which had been observed by the speaker in his re
searches, were the following —     :
     1.Colourless solids which are equally transparent to the visible
rays, vary greatly in permeability to the chemical rays.
    2. Bodies which are photographically transparent in the solid form,
preserve their transparency in the liquid and   the gaseous states.
                                                     in
    3. Colourless transparent solids which absorb the photographic rays,
preserve their absorptive action with greater or less intensity both in
the liquid and in the gaseous states.
     4.       Pure
             water     photographically
                             is          transparent, so that many
compounds which cannot be obtained in the solid form sufficiently
transparent for experiments, may be subjected to trial in solution in
water.
     The       mode in which the experiments were conducted was         the   fol
lowing —  :
     The          of light employed was the electric spark obtained
               source
between   two metallic wires, generally of fine silver, connected with the
terminals of the secondary wires of an induction coil, into the primary
circuit of which was introduced a condenser, and into the secondary
circuit   small Leyden jar. The light of the sparks was then allowed
          a
to fall upon    vertical slit, either before or after traversing
                     a                                              aslice or
stratum of the material of which the electric transparency was to be
tested   the transmitted light was then passed through
          ;                                                    quartz prism,

      The effects indicated in these tables were rendered visible to the
audience, by illuminating the photographic negative of the electric
sparks from silver points by the light of the electric lamp, and bringing
the image to a distinct focus upon the screen by means of a con
densing lens.
      Each photograph was obtained under circumstances varying only
in the nature of the transparent medium through which the rays of the
spark from the silver points were made to pass, before they were
allowed to fall upon the collodion plate. When absorption occurs, it is
 almost always exhibited upon the most refrangible rays ; but in the case
 of the coloured gases and vapours, chlorine, bromine, and iodine, the
 absorption differs from the general rule, and is by no means propor
 tioned to the depth of colour.      A column of chlorine with its yellowish
 green colour cuts off the rays of the less refrangible extremity through
 fully two-thirds of the spectrum ; the red vapour of bromine cuts off
 about one-sixth of the length of the spectrum, the absorbent action
 being limited to the less refrangible extremity, whilst the deep violet-
 coloured vapours of iodine allow the less refrangible rays to pass
 freely for the first fourth of the spectrum ; then a considerable absorp
 tion occurs, and afterwards a feeble renewal of the photographic action
 is exhibited towards the more refrangible end.
      Diactinic bases, when united with diactinic acids, usually furnished
 diactinic salts ; but such a result was not uniformly observed ; the
 silicates were none of them as transparent as silica itself in the form of
  rock crystal.     Again, hydrogen is eminently diactinic, and iodine
 vapour, notwithstanding its deep violet colour, is also largely diactinic ;
  but hydriodic acid gas is greatly inferior to either of them.
      The same substance, however, whatever may be its physical form,
  whether solid, liquid, or gaseous, preserves its character ; no chemically
  opaque solid, though transparent to light, becoming transparent pho

46                           Dr.  W.  A. Miller                 [March 6,
tographically by liquefaction or volatilization ; and no transparent,
solid being rendered chemically opaque by change of form.           Hence
it is obvious that this opacity or transparency is intimately connected
with the atomic or chemical character of the body, and not merely with
its state of aggregation.    Although the absorption of the chemical rays
varies greatly in the different gases, which therefore in this action dis
play an analogy to their effects upon radiant heat, yet those gases
which absorb the rays of heat most powerfully are often highly trans
parent to the chemical rays, as is seen in the case of aqueous vapour,
of carbonic acid, cyanogen, and olefiant gas, all of which are compound
substances, not chemical elements.         These observations were con
sidered by the speaker as opposed to the view of Dr. Tyndall, that
compounds, as compounds, act more energetically than elementary
bodies in absorbing the heat-rays, owing to the greater inertia of the
particles of compounds.        Any physical cause of this kind ought,
 however, to enable such bodies to act equally as absorbents of the
luminous and chemical rays.
     In the case of reflection from polished surfaces, the metals were
 found to vary in the quality of the rays reflected ; gold and lead,
 although not the most brilliant, reflecting the rays more uniformly
 than the brilliant white surfaces of silver and speculum metal.
     2. Photographic Spectra of the Elements. — But the most interest
 ing results are those obtained by examining the spectra produced by vary
 ing the nature of the metallic electrodes employed as terminals to the
 secondary wires of the induction coil.     Professor Wheatstone showed
 twenty-eight years ago that the visible spectrum of each metal is per
 fectly characteristic when electromagnetic sparks are transmitted
 between two surfaces of the metal ; and the same thing is equally true
 of the invisible portion of the spectrum.
      Even the various gaseous media become so intensely heated by the
 passage of the electric spark, that they furnish photographic spectra,
 each of which is characteristic of the body which occasions it ; and
 when the electric discharge of the secondary coil becomes intensified
 by use of the Leyden jar, the sparks not only produce the spectra due
  to the metals, but to the gaseous medium in which the electrodes are
 immersed ; so that a mixed spectrum is the result.       The spectra pro
 duced by the metals are characterized by bands, of which the
 extremities only are visible ; whilst the gaseous spectra yield con
 tinuous lines, which traverse the whole width of the spectrum. When
 a compound gas is made the medium of the electric discharge, the
 spectra produced are those of the elementary components of the gas.
 It seems as though at these intense temperatures chemical combina
 tions were impossible ; and oxygen and hydrogen, chlorine and the
 metals probably might all coexist in a separate form, though mecha
 nically intermingled.
      The spectrum produced by the ignition of a solid or a liquid
 always yields a continuous band of light, containing rays of all degrees

1863.]         on the Photographic Transparency     of Bodies.          47
of refrangibility   ; but the same body, when converted into vapour,
usually produces a spectrum consisting of a series of bright bands of
particular colours, separated from each other by intervals more or less
completely dark, gaseous bodies emitting rays of certain definite refran
gibility only.
     From the striped character of the photographic spectra, it is
obvious that the vibrations are emitted from the different metals in the
form of vapour, and not merely in that of detached particles projected
from the electrodes by disruptive discharge.
     This observation may give some idea of the intensely high tem
perature attained by the spark ; since it is uniformly observed that the
higher the temperature, the more refrangible are the vibrations.       We
are, indeed, furnished in this case with a rude, but still, under the
circumstances, with a valuable pyrometric means of estimating these
exalted temperatures.
     To give an illustration of the mode of applying the observation :
The hottest wind-furnace of ordinary construction yields a tempera
ture probably not much exceeding 4,500° F. By calculations founded
upon the amount of heat ascertained by Andrews and others to be
emitted during the combustion of a given weight of hydrogen, and the
experiments of Regnault upon the specific heat of oxygen, hydrogen,
and steam, it has been shown by Bunsen that the temperature of the
oxyhydrogen flame cannot exceed 14,580c F. The speaker stated that
he had obtained spectra by introducing lime and sulphate of magnesia
into the oxyhydrogen jet : these incombustible materials therefore
could not be heated by the burning gases to a higher point than
 14,600° F., but the spectra so obtained coincide in their photographic
lengths with that of the solar spectrum. Hence, the temperature of
the sun may be approximatively estimated to be not higher than that
of the oxyhydrogen flame. It certainly appears to be far below that
of the electric spark. Magnesium in the electric spark gives a
remarkably strong band just beyond the limits of the solar spectrum.
Now magnesium is as clearly proved to exist in the solar atmosphere
as any element, if we be admitted to have any such proof at all.
But inasmuch as the special band which characterizes magnesium at a
 high temperature in the electric spark is wanting in the solar spectrum,
it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the temperature of the solar
 atmosphere is below that generated by the electric spark.
     The speaker then adverted to KirchhofFs well-known theory of
 the origin of Fraunhofer's dark lines in the solar spectrum, based on
the observation that when any substance is heated or rendered lumi
nous, rays of a definite refrangibility are given out by it ; whilst the
same substance, vapour, or gas, has the power of absorbing rays of
 this identical refrangibility.    Now Kirchhoff supposes that in the
 luminous atmosphere of the sun the vapours of various metals are pre
 sent, each of which would give its characteristic system of bright lines ;
 but behind this incandescent atmosphere containing metallic vapour
 is the still more intensely heated solid or liquid nucleus of the sun,

 48    Dr. Miller      on   Photographic Transparency of Bodies.   [March 6,
 which         a brilliant continuous spectrum, containing rays of all
           emits
 degrees of refrangibility.   When the light of this intensely heated
 nucleus is transmitted through the incandescent   photosphere of the
 sun, the bright lines which would be produced by the pnotosphere are
 reversed,  and Fraunhofer's black lines are therefore the reversed
bright lines of which the spectrum due to the gaseous atmosphere of
the sun would consist if the intensely heated nucleus were no longer
 there.
     From his observations Kirchhoff concluded, by a comparison of
the bright lines in the spectra of various metals with the dark lines of
the solar spectrum, that potassium,       sodium, magnesium,   calcium,
iron, nickel, chromium, manganese, and possibly cobalt, were present
in the sun's atmosphere; and Angstrom, continuing the examination
into the blue and violet extremity, believes that he has shown the
existence of hydrogen, aluminum, and possibly of strontium and barium.
Diagrams were exhibited, showing some of the solar lines according
to the observations of Kirchhoff and Angstrom, from which it appears

     These observations on the solar spectrum give great interest to
 similar observations upon the stars, the light of which, however,
is  so feeble as to render the investigation of their spectra         atask
 of no ordinary delicacy. Fraunhofer examined four or five of the
 brightest stars, and considered that the light of Sirius and Castor
 had lines differing decidedly from that of the sun.           Capella and
 a. Orionis resembled   the solar light more closely.    Donati has since
 examined several of the brighter stars, and given    drawing of some of
                                                      a
 their lines. The speaker had recently, conjointly with his friend, Mr.
 Huggins, been pursuing the same investigation with the excellent
 eight-inch equatorial refractor of the latter, and they had obtained
some interesting     results, having measured the principal lines in
Sirius, Betelgeus, and Aldebaran,       diagram of which was exhibited,

been given by any previous observer.      He also projected on the screen
a   microscopic photograph of the spectrum of Sirius that his friend
and he had succeeded in obtaining.        The light of this star, from the
measurements of Sir J. Herschel and Mr. Bond,            little more than

 times the distance of Sirius, also gave a photograph, when its spectrum

                       On Fogs and Fog Signals.
During    the course of the inquiry made by the Royal Commission on
Lights, Buoys,    and Beacons, the attention of my colleagues and myself
was called to the fog signals which form part of the apparatus of
many lighthouses, and of all British light-ships.        In the report we
expressed our conviction,
                              " that they are not sufficiently powerful,
and recommend the provision of a more efficient warning in fog as
subject of investigation and experiment."           About the same time,
some scientific men in Ireland stirred in the matter, and induced the
British Association to appoint a committee, at the head of which is
the Rev. Dr. Robinson, of Armagh, to bring the importance of the
subject more directly under the notice of the legislature.            These
circumstances led me to turn my attention to fog ; and       I propose now
to lay before you some of the results arrived at, with reference both to
the meteorological phenomenon        itself, and to the means adopted for
preventing  its disastrous consequences among the vessels that sail along
our shores.
     I have received voluminous returns of the occurrence of fog at
about 250 stations, for which      I  am indebted to the kindness of the
three general Lighthouse Boards, — the Trinity House, the Northern
Commissioners of Lighthouses, and the Ballast Board of Dublin ; also
to the Board of Trade, through Admiral Fitz Roy ; and to Mr.

Glaisher.     I wish here also to express my thanks to several gentlemen
who have      aided me in the preparation of this discourse, especially
Mr. Alexander Cuningham, who has just read a paper on the subject
at the Royal Scottish Society of Arts, and to our friend Professor
Wheatstone.
                                    FOGS.
     A. fog is simply a cloud resting on the earth. In the first discourse
of  the present season, Professor Tyndall explained the formation of
clouds from the aqueous vapour in the atmosphere ; and defined a
cumulus as "the visible capital of an invisible column of saturated
air."    A  fog is the capital without the column.        It is the moisture
evaporating from the warm earth, or river, or sea, condensed at once
by the colder air.      Mr. Glaisher told us here how from his lofty
position in the balloon, he saw a fog following all the windings of the
Thames.      This is a frequent observation, and it reminded me of a
scene from the summit of the Righi one morning last summer.            There
lay in the valley of the Reuss a mist like a white sheet on the ground,
but as the sun began to exert his power, and a light breeze to spring
up, the uniform layer began to break into regular masses, and soon far
beneath us there stretched a cirrus cloud, identical in aspect with those
we so often see in the highest regions of the atmosphere.
     Fog, then, is composed of minute particles of water, most likely in
a globular form, for there seems to be no ground for the popular
notion of vesicles of vapour.     Smoke enters largely into the composi
tion of that peculiar yellow fog which visits London a few times each
year, — a fog of wonderful darkness and quietness, and strangely
 bewildering.
     This condensed vapour has a great effect in obstructing the passage
of light ; the sun himself cannot look through it. A slight mist seems
to attack principally the more refrangible rays of the spectrum, so that
the light appears redder than usual.       I once analysed with a spectro
scope the rays which reached Worthing from the great revolving light
on Beachy Head, twenty-eight miles distant, and found that those only
situated between Fraunhofer's         lines C and F were transmitted.
This was on what would be called a clear summer night. An objec
tion has been raised against the orange-red glass used in many of the
French lighthouses, that in misty weather all bright lights are reduced
to very nearly that colour, and thus the distinction is lost ; a misfortune
that could hardly happen with the deep-red glass employed for the red
lights of the British Isles.    When the sun shines through a cloud or
 mist, we do not detect those atmospheric lines which make their
appearance when his disk is near the horizon. Yet            I have observed
in London, when the sun at a considerable altitude loomed red through
 a slight fog, that the characteristic C 6, S, and i) were visible.
     There is, of course, every conceivable gradation between the
lightest haze and the densest fog, and it is a difficult matter to draw a line
 of distinction between fog and mist. The value of the meteorological

1863.]                  on   Fogs and Fog Signals.                       51
returns in my possession depends greatly on this, and there is reason to
fear, even from internal evidence, that one lighthouse keeper calls by
the name of fog what another keeper thinks sufficiently described as
mist or haze.      Yet these keepers have a certain general sentiment
and similarity in their way of thinking, and with many the practical
definition of a fog is when it is necessary to sound the signal. Among
amateur observers on land the greatest discrepancy prevails ; but
nautical men seem to have a general agreement as to what amount of
thickness is to give a claim to the designation fog.        For such obser
vations Mr. Cuningham suggests that a pole, painted vermilion,
should be set up at a hundred yards from the station, and that such an
amount of mistiness as renders it invisible should alone be named fog.
The colour of the pole should, of course, be in strong contrast to the
objects behind it. This definition is somewhere about that practically
adopted by seamen ; it has been accepted by Mr. Glaisher, and it is
to be hoped that it will be generally adopted by all observers.
    From the returns received, the following deductions may be
drawn : —
     I. While    many fogs are quite partial in their character, others
cover    a  large extent of country.      The irregular distribution of a
London fog is a matter of frequent observation. Thus, last Tuesday,
the day of the royal wedding, one of the densest yellow fogs obscured
Westminster, whilst at Bayswater there was nothing more than a
murky mist. The long-continued fog of November last in London,
extending from the 19th to the 25th, was observed also at Berkhamp-
stead, Oxford, and Banbury, but other parts of England seem to have
been clear.     The occurrence of fog at the lighthouse stations all round
the coast during the first six months of the year 1861 has been
especially studied, and the fogs of that April have been represented
on a map. Some of them cover large portions of the British Isles.
For instance, that of the 14th stretched all round Ireland, except the
south-west corner, crossed the Irish sea to the headlands of Wales
and the south -western isles and coasts of Scotland, and made its
appearance again across the mainland in the Firth of Forth.
    II.   Some months     are marked by fogs much more than others.
For instance, along     the   south coast of England, February and Sep
tember are comparatively free, while January and June are foggy
months.      November is notorious for fog in London, but does not
seem to deserve that character elsewhere.
    III.   Some years are much more visited by fogs than others.        For
instance, 1861 was freer than 1858 along most parts of the coast.
    IV.    Different localities are very variously visited by fog. England
does not deserve that pre-eminent character for mistiness which is attri
buted to it by the popular imagination of the Continent.          The value
of the returns in showing the relative distribution of fog in different
places is seriously affected by the different standards in the minds of
the observers, but the following points seem pretty clearly made out :
                                                                  e 2

A   fog is more uniformly     distributed over the surface of the sea than
on the adjoining coasts.     Fog is not particularly prevalent about sand
banks, or low headlands ; but where cliffs or high hills catch the south
west wind just after it has swept the ocean, :\s at the Isle of Wight,
the Start Point, Lundy Island, and the Rocks of Pembrokeshire, the
numbers run very high. The highest return is from Barra Head, the
southernmost point of the Hebrides, where winds surcharged with
moisture from the Gulf Stream strike the cold northern rocks, and
wrap them in cloud or fog.
                                FOG SIGNALS.
     As light only very imperfectly penetrates a fog, attempts have
been made to warn vessels of their approach to danger, or to acquaint
them with their position, by means of sound.       The fog signals actually
in use are as follows : — Bells are employed at many of the lighthouses,
and in the Irish light-ships, the finest, perhaps, being two near Dublin,
and that at the Copeland Island, in the Irish sea, which is rung by
machinery, and is said to have been heard thirteen miles off.       At the
end of the pier at Boulogne there is a large bell, in the centre of a
large parabolic reflector facing the sea. It is struck by three hammers
alternately, the motive power being a falling weight. Gongs are made
use of in all the light-vessels belonging to the Trinity House.      Guns
are fired on board the Kish light-ship, from the mountain above the
South Stack Lighthouse, at Fleetwood, and elsewhere.        A very power
ful steam-whistle has for some time been in operation at Partridge
Island, near St. John's, New Brunswick, a part of the world peculiarly
affected by fog.
     At the Skerries, near Holyhead, terns and other sea-birds are
encouraged, as their cries serve as a warning to vessels during fog ;
but unfortunately some rats escaped from the ' Regulus," which was
wrecked there about seven years ago, and they are destroying the
birds.   A   cat has been tried, but she preferred birds to rats.
     The comparative efficiency of these various methods is a very serious
question ; indeed, there are grave objections to the use of sound at all as
a fog signal.     The difficulties are as follows: — A sound indicates the
proximity, but not the exact direction, of a danger. In this respect it is
totally different from a light. Yet the mere warning is something ;
and probably a suitable ear-trumpet would give a better idea of the
direction than is obtained without it. There is evidence that vessels
have sometimes steered by a sound; for instance, — " In the winter of
                     '
 1860, the steamer     Iron Duke' having been drawn by the flood tide to
the northward past Howth, was attracted by the sound of the bell, and
steered by it safely towards Kingston, until the bell on the east pier of
that harbour told her of its proximity, and ultimately led her into
safety."    The Royal Commissioners on Lights made special inquiry
about the Boulogne bell, and found that some of the captains of
steamers frequenting that port could find their way in by the sound

of the bell, in thick weather    ; at least, in conjunction with the use of
the lead.
     An objection to the use of most of these fog signals is the fear that
they may be mistaken for other sounds, or other sounds mistaken for
them.    Bells are frequently being rung on shipboard ; the firing of
guns is the well-known sign of distress ; and steamers in a fog are in
the habit of whistling as they go along. Gongs do not seem open to
this objection ; and in the case of other sounds, it might be obviated
by having a definite system of repetition, as is done with the flashing
and revolving lights. My friend, the Rev. T. Pel ham Dale,* has indeed
suggested a means of signalling, in which musical notes are employed.
     Another difficulty is is,
                            that even loud sounds cannot be heard far to
windward      if breeze
                   a       blowing     but this
                                       ;           of less importance, as a

     But the great objection to sound as fog signal
                                               a                  is,
                                                            that fog stops  a

sound will not traverse      aheterogeneous     medium, such as air loaded
with mist. As to the fact of such signals being rendered inefficient by
the very thing which they are intended to penetrate, the testimony of
mariners       somewhat conflicting.
              is                          Mr. Alexander Cuningham, who
is the secretary of the Northern Commissioners of Lighthouses, says —
" Many years ago, having landed from the lighthouse tender on the

in the hope of reaching the vessel but before doing so, the fog shut
                                           ;
her completely from our view. We pulled in the direction (having                    a
compass) in which the tender was last seen but those who know the

rapidity and variety of the tides in that dangerous locality, will easily
be prepared to hear that our efforts were unsuccessful        We lay about
the spot for some time, firing our fowling-pieces, and at last pulled for
the shore.    Next morning the vessel came in sight and on comparing

of her; and they had been firing small six-pound carronades all
night, and we never heard them, nor did those on board hear our
guns."
   Yet,   on the other hand, we have accounts of bells being heard at
a distance of some miles during    fog, and the steam-whistle near St.

 conditions may therefore be far less obstructive than when the medium
 is more heterogeneous.
      Considering these objections to the use of sound as a fog signal,
  must we abandon it altogether ? We cannot do so, as we have nothing
 better to substitute.     We fall back upon the recommendation of the
 Royal    Commission,   that further experiments should be made, which it
 is hoped will be gradually adopted by the authorities, as the majority
 of the other scientific recommendations have been.
      Experiments should be performed on the manner and degree in
 which fog absorbs or destroys sounds of different pitch, or of different
 characters, — for instance, a sharp sound or a prolonged sound ; on the
 various means of producing loud sounds, as to their pitch, volume,
 convenience, costliness, &c. ; whether a repetition of the same sound,
 or some variation in note, octave, frequency, &c., be desirable ; on the
 influence exerted by the height above the sea at which the sound
 originates ; on the influence of a background, such as a tower, cliff, or
 hill, in reflecting the sound, or of a concave mirror ; on the best means
 of directing a sound to a particular azimuth, or of determining its
 direction when on board ship.
      Captains Close and Nisbet, of the Trinity Board, have made some
 experiments on one of these points at Holyhead Mountain, where a
 gun was fired from near the surface of the sea, and another at a con
siderable height, and the respective reports were listened to from
various distances at sea. They found the upper gun was heard best
for six miles, after which it lost its superiority.  But the most remark
able result was the irregularity of the noise from the lower gun, which,
at certain points in fact was not heard at all, though the flash was
 distinctly seen.
      Powerful means of producing sound, besides those already men
tioned, have been suggested.       Mr. Cowper has planned a large steam-
trumpet for lighthouse stations, which may be made to revolve. There
is something similar in America worked by Erichsen's engine, with
which is associated the name of Mr. Daboll. And Professor Holmes,
of the Magneto-Electric Light, has also a steam-trumpet, which can be
adapted for different notes, and gives a buzzing sound of wonderful
intensity.     Suggestions on this point were also made to the Royal
Commissioners by several scientific men.        Thus, horns were strongly
recommended        by more than one ; but Mr. Mallet prefers explosive
sounds ; and Sir John Herschel says : — " It would be worth trial, what
would be the effect of a battery of whistles, blown by high-pressure
steam, or by a combination of three, or several sets of three, pitched
exactly to harmonic intervals (key-note, third, fifth, and octave), but
all of a very high pitch, and with a rattle (analogous to the pea in a
common whistle), which intensifies the action on the auditory nerve."
Captain Ryder believes a gun might be constructed to produce the
very distinctive sound of an explosion, followed instantaneously by a
whistle.
     There is another and very promising field for experiment, the

transmission of sound through the water itself. The experiments of
M. Colladon on the Lake of Geneva proved the great distance to which
sound is transmitted through water, and the velocity and directness
of its course.*
      In his observations he employed a bell, let down into the water ;
but this is a bad instrument for signalling, as its vibrations are almost
instantly stopped.       Many arrangements would appear to be preferable.
The Syren, which was so called by its inventor, M. Cagniard de la
Tour, because it would sing under water, is well adapted to give any
note that is found desirable.f            Long glass tubes, vibrating longitu
dinally, are said to produce immense volumes of sound in water : and
other means might be devised.             As the sound remains in the water,
it would be necessary to make some communication between it and the
ear of the listener.      M. Colladon employed an apparatus like a spoon,
with a tube for handle. By this means a mariner might listen for
signals made at any important station, such as the Lizard Point, and
might not only hear them at a great distance, but determine approxi
mately their direction, unaffected by the state of the atmosphere above.

 When     a bar of steel has been magnetized, it has acquired a tendency
 to assume a definite position with respect to the Earth. Nothing is
 more widely known than this important fact, but at the same time
 there is nothing in Science more mysterious than its cause.             We may
 endeavour to explain it by asserting that the Earth acts as a magnet ;
 but whence it has acquired this magnetism, how it is distributed, and
 what are the causes of its many changes, are amongst the most per
 plexing and the most important of those problems in physical science
 which are yet unsolved.

56                         Mr. Balfour Stewart                 [March 20,
     The force with which the Earth acts upon the needle is directive
merely ; that is to say, the needle is neither attracted nor repelled as a
whole, but simply twisted round, and in this respect the Earth is
similar to a very powerful magnet, the pole of which is placed at a
great distance from the needle upon which it acts.
     If we keep a magnetic bar constantly suspended in the same place,
its position will be subject to many changes.     In the first place, there
is that change which goes on in the same direction for a great many
years together, in virtue of which a needle suspended in this place
200 years ago would have assumed a position very much different from
its present one.    Secondly, there is a change of which the period is
one year, and this is called the annual variation.      Thirdly, there is a
change of which the period is one day, and which is called the daily
variation.    Fourthly, there is a change which depends upon the
moon's hour angle ; and, fifthly, the needle is subject to sudden and
abru pt changes in position, which are called magnetic storms and which
form the subject of this discourse.     During the prevalence of these
unaccountable phenomena the needle is found to oscillate rapidly and
capriciously backwards and forwards, being now on the one side and
now on the other of its normal or undisturbed position.
     It should be here remarked, that the Physicist regards the needle
merely as a vane (similar to a wind-vane) which serves to render
visible the direction and intensity of that mysterious force which
operates through the Earth.     It is really the Earth's magnetism with
which he concerns himself.
     Gauss, who has done so much to further the science of magnetism,
showed, by means of a preconcerted system of observation, that mag
netic storms affected the needle at Gottingen and at other stations in
Europe at precisely the same moment of absolute time; and after the
establishment   of the colonial observatories, it was found by General
Sabine that the needle was affected in Toronto at precisely the moment
when it was disturbed at Gottingen.      Nor is it too much to say, with
our present knowledge, that these remarkable disturbances break out
at the same moment over every portion of our globe.
     Having thus shown that these phenomena are cosmical in their
character, the next point of interest is their connection with the sun.
This has been placed beyond doubt chiefly through the labours of
General Sabine, who found at Toronto and elsewhere that magnetic
disturbances obey a law of hours.      Mr. Broun also showed the same
thing from his observation of the needle at Makerstoun, in Scotland.
It may be instructive to point out how this proof was deduced from
the colonial observations ; and to make the matter plain, let us refer
to an imaginary case in the familiar science of meteorology.       Suppose
that, while an observer is watching his thermometer there is a sudden
influx of cold weather, and that it is wished to estimate the influence
of this upon the thermometer on a given day and at a given hour of
that day, what must the observer do?        He must endeavour to ascer
tain, by the best possible means, what indication the thermometer

1863.]                 on Magnetic   Disturbances.                     SI
would have afforded at that specified day and hour had there been no
cold weather. Comparing this with the actual height of the mercury,
and deducting the one from the other, he would clearly obtain a
measure of the effect of the cold weather upon the thermometer.
    A similar course was pursued by General Sabine in discussing the
colonial magnetic observations, with the object of deducing the laws
of disturbances. It was first necessary to ascertain by the best possible
means what position the magnet would have assumed at any particular
day and hour, had there been no disturbance.             Calling this the
normal value, the next course was to group together as disturbed, all
those positions of the magnet which differed from the normal by more
than a certain small quantity.     The necessity for this separation will
become evident when it is remarked that the disturbed and the regular
observations have different hourly turning-points, and obey very
different laws.     Thus a disentanglement was effected, which was
accomplished by the employment of a separating value. The selection
of this value is to some extent arbitrary, but it was shown by reference
to a diagram that the disturbance law at Kew was virtually the same,
whether this were deduced (in the case of the declination) from 95
days of principal disturbances or from all disturbed observations which
differ from the normal by more than :~!'•.'!. It was also shown from the
same diagram that easterly disturbances prevail at Kew during certain
hours of the day, and westerly disturbances at certain other hours, thus
exhibiting a daily law, and showing that disturbances are therefore
connected with our luminary.
   There is, however, a more interesting and mysterious connection
than this.    Professor Schwabe, of Dessau, has now for nearly forty
years been watching the disc of the sun, and recording the groups of
spots which have been visible, and he finds that these have a period
of maximum nearly every ten years, two of these periods being the years
1848, 1859.     Now it was likewise found by General Sabine, that the
aggregate value of magnetic disturbances at Toronto attained a maxi
mum in 1848, nor was he slow to remark that this was also Schwabe's
period of maximum sun-spots, and it was afterwards found, by obser
vations made at Kew, that 1859 (another of Schwabe's years) was
also a year of maximum magnetic disturbance. This fact is eminently
suggestive, and brings us at once into the presence of some great cosmical
bond, different from gravitation, adding at the same time additional
interest as well as mystery to these perplexing phenomena.
     These are the grounds on which we suspect the sun to be the agent
which causes magnetic disturbances, but there is also some reason to
believe that on one occasion our luminary was caught in the very act.
On the first of September, 1859, two astronomers, Messrs. Carrington
and Hodgson, were independently observing the sun's disc, which
exhibited at that time a very large spot, when about a quarter-past
eleven they noticed a very bright star of light suddenly break out over
the spot and move with great velocity across the sun's surface.
     On Mr. Carrington sending afterwards to Kew Observatory, at

 58                        Mr. Balfour Stewart                  [March 20,
which place the position of the magnet is recorded continuously by
photography, it was found that a magnetic disturbance had broken out
at the very moment when this singular appearance had been observed.
      The next point to be noticed is, that magnetic storms are always
accompanied by aurora and by earth currents. With regard to the
 latter of these phenomena, a single word of explanation may be neces
 sary.   Earth currents are currents of electricity which traverse the
 surface of our globe, a portion of which is caught up by the telegraphic
wires, which are often thereby seriously disturbed in their communica
 tions. A table was then referred to, which showed that aurorae and
 earth currents have the same ten-yearly period as sun-spots and mag
 netic disturbances, so that a bond of union exists between those four
 phenomena.
      The question next arises, What is the nature of this bond ? Now,
with respect to that which connects sun-spots with magnetic distur
 bances we can as yet form no conjecture ; but we may, perhaps, venture
an opinion regarding the nature of that which connects together
magnetic disturbances, aurorae, and earth currents.      And here we may
remark that this latter bond is the more definitely determined of the
two, since the three phenomena which it embraces invariably occur
together.
      In order to exhibit the evidence upon which this hypothesis rests,
it  is necessary to refer to what is done at the Kew Observatory.
      By means of an apparatus arranged by the late Mr. Welsh, the
values of the components of the earth's magnetism, are there recorded
continuously by photography. Now there'is a proposition which goes by
the name of the parallelopiped of forces and which asserts that if three
forces acting at a point be represented in magnitude, and in direction
by the three sides of a parallelopiped, the resultant of these forces shall
be represented in magnitude and direction by the diagonal of the
parallelopiped.    These three forces may be said to be components of
the whole resultant force, since the joint action of the three is the same
as that of the resultant.
      To refer to a familiar case, suppose that there is a gust of wind
which (as sometimes happens) is not horizontal, but blows downwards
in a slanting direction from above.          How shall we estimate the
direction and the force of this wind ? Let us have three pressure plates,
one north and south, one east and west, and one up and down ; then the
north and south component of the wind will be given by the first, the
east and west component by the second, and the up and down component
by the third, and exhibiting the indications of these three pressure-plates
by the threesides of a parallelopiped, the diagonal will represent the wind
in magnitude and in direction.
      Something of this kind must be done, if it be wished to record
the disturbing force which acts upon the needle.             Let there be
three magnets free to move, two in a horizontal plane and one in
a vertical direction ; one swinging freely and pointing to magnetic
north and south, one compelled by torsion to point to magnetic

east and    west, and a third balanced on a knife-edge so as to move
up and down ; the first will be sensitive to an east and west dis
turbing force, which will act at right angles to            it,
                                                             and tend to twist         it
round ;  the second will on the other hand be affected by a north and
south force, and the third by       a vertical force.      It easily seen how
                                                                  is
these three magnets will take the place of the three pressure plates,
in the meteorological problem.         Now if mirror be attached to each
                                                   a
of these magnets,    it may be made to reflect the image of          dot of light
                                                                       a
upon a sheet of photographic paper, so that a small motion of the
mirror shall cause       alarge motion of the dot, and if the paper itself
move by clock-work,      in a direction at right angles to that in which the
dot moves on the paper, the photographic impression of the dot during
a day's motion of the paper will be          a  curved line, and this being
obtained for each of the three magnets, we shall be able to record
continuously the changes which are taking place in the three components
of the earth's magnetic force.
     Reference was then made to a diagram in which these three curved
lines were exhibited for September 1-2, 1859; and                 was seen that
                                                                  it
about four o'clock in the early morning of September                   2,
                                                                        the three
components of the earth's magnetism at Kew were simultaneously and
abruptly disturbed, and were kept at one side of their normal or undis
turbed positions for many hours.        During this time there were vivid
aurora which extended over the greater part of the globe, and even to
as low a  latitude as Cuba, and strong earth currents were also observed by
Mr. C. V. Walker, on the various telegraphic lines. These currents were
found to change their direction every two or three minutes, going alter
nately from positive to negative, and back again to positive. It            there
                                                                             is
fore evident that currents varying in this manner could not have been the
cause of magnetic disturbances in which the needle was kept on one side
of its nominal position for many hours. But the curves of magnetic dis
turbance further exhibit sharp peaks and hollows, or wavelets, superim
posed upon the great disturbance wave, and these wavelets change their
direction every two or thre minutes, in which respect they are compa
rable with earth currents. May not these wavelets be connected with
earth currents and aurorae, and may not this connection be of the fol
lowing kind? A peak denotes          a small but rapid change of the earth's
magnetic force in one direction,       and a  hollow,     similar change in the
                                                            a
opposite direction.    Now    in a Ruhmkorff      coil
                                                  8    we   have — 1st, a soft iron
core, with a current circulating round       it; 2nd, an insulator round the
current   ; 3rd, a secondary coil above the insulator, containing perhaps
several miles of fine wire.      In this arrangement we have a discharge
between the terminals of the secondary coil every time contact with the
primary current     ismade, and one of an opposite character every time
this contact   is broken.
     But the chief use of the primary current          to reverse the magnetism
                                                       is
of the iron core, and could we reverse this, or even change                rapidly
                                                                            it
without    a  primary current, we should have the same effect, that               to
                                                                                  is
say, we should have a secondary current in one direction, when the mag

60                           Mr. Balfonr Stewart                  [March 20,
netism of the core was rapidly increased, and one an opposite direction,
when this was rapidly diminished.         An experiment was made, showing
the mode of action of the Ruhmkorff's coil, and the following comparison
was instituted between this instrument and our earth.            The body of
our earth maybe likened'to the soft iron core of a RuhmkorfFs machine,
in which one of the small curve-peaks already alluded to denotes a
rapid change of magnetism in one direction, and a hollow, a change of
the opposite      character.   The lower strata of the atmosphere again
resemble the insulator of the RuhinkorrFs machine, and the upper and
rarer strata, the secondary conductor ; again, the crust of the earth
being permeated with moisture, becomes a conductor, and may therefore
also be likened to the secondary coil.      Whenever therefore we have a
curve-rise, that is to say, a sudden change of the earth's magnetism in
one direction, we should have in the upper strata of the atmosphere
and in the crust of the earth currents of one kind ; and when we have
a curve-fall or a sudden change of magnetism in the opposite direction,
we should have similar currents of an opposite description.
     It  need hardly be remarked, that those currents which take place in
the upper strata of the atmosphere will form aurorae, while those in the
crust of the earth will constitute earth currents.
     Now, if this be the nature of that connection which subsists between
magnetic disturbances, earth currents, and aurorae, may we not extend
our inquiries, and ask, "     If the sun's action is able to create a terres
trial aurora, why may he not also create an aurora in his own atmo
sphere?      It  occurred independently to General Sabine, Professor
Challis, and the speaker, that the red flames visible during a total
eclipse may, indeed, be solar aurorae.        In support of this hypothesis
it may be remarked that, during the late total eclipse in Spain, Mr.
De la Rue, by means of the Kew photoheliograph, proved that these
red    flames belong to the sun, and that they extended               in one
case to the distance of 70,000 miles beyond his photosphere.            But,
considering the gravity of the sun, we are naturally unwilling to
suppose that there can be any considerable amount of atmosphere at
such a distance from his surface ; and we are therefore induced to
seek for an explanation of these red flames amongst those phenomena
which require the smallest possible amount of atmosphere for their
manifestation. Now the experiments of Mr. Gassiot, and the observed
height of the terrestrial aurora alike convince us that this meteor will
answer our requirements best.        And besides this, the curved appearance
of these red flames, and their high actinic power in virtue of which one
of them, not visible to the eye, was photographed by Mr. De la Rue,
are bonds of union between these and terrestrial aurorae.
     It has been remarked by General Sabine, that an auroral outburst
in the sun may perhaps be responded to simultaneously by the different
planets.    If  this be true, our whole solar system would seem to thrill
almost like a living being under the excitement of this mysterious force.
It has been likewise found by Mr. Gassiot, that electricity cannot pass
through a perfect vacuum, so that perhaps we have only to observe the

1863.]                  on Magnetic Disturbances.                            61
 greatest height attained by a terrestrial aurora and by a solar red flame,
 in order to be able to assign the limit, not only of our own atmosphere,
 but also of that of our luminary.
      One other point remains to be noticed in connection with magnetic
disturbances, and this  is, that there appear to be two separate disturbing
 forces, nearly opposite in character, both connected with the sun, which
act simultaneously upon the magnet       ; the position which the latter as
sumes being due to the combined effect of both.         This has been shown
to be true by General Sabine, who has observed that the curve which
exhibits the daily range of the east component of the disturbing force,
is  in many places very different in character from that which exhibits
the same for the west component.          And this difference between the
two curves  is   of one kind at one station, and of another kind at another
station.     This duality of the disturbing forces may also be observed
directly in the Kew disturbance-curves.        Hereit  was shown, by means
of models, kindly constructed by Mr. Beckley, and also by reference to
the parallelopiped of forces, that whenever the corresponding peaks
and hollows for the different components continue to bear          a definite
proportion to one another, these then denote the action of disturbing
                                                               a
force, varying in intensity, but always preserving the same type.
      A set of curves were exhibited in which this proportion held, and in
which the disturbing force, whose variations were denoted by the peaks
and hollows, was one which affected the north and south component
twice as much as the other two. It was then shown by reference to
the normal line, or line of no disturbance, that there was also in action
at that time another disturbing force, which was not however of the
same variable character as that which caused the peaks and hollows.
      The attention of foreign men of science has been much directed to
the problem of terrestrial magnetism, and five sets of magnetographs,
similar to those in operation at the Kew Observatory, have been already
procured    by   foreign governments. These, however, will be placed
in the northern hemisphere, and     it   is to be desired that some of our
colonies   in the  southern hemisphere may come forward in order that
by   the next epoch  of maximum    disturbance (1869), there may be such a
network of magnetic observatories as may enable us to obtain the
solution of this interesting and important problem.

of no less than thirty-two of these elements.          Glancing rapidly at the
already known metals, the speaker said that seven of these were known
to the ancients, and we have no knowledge of their first discovery. We
know, however, that many are found native, and the others are sepa
rated from their ores either by heat alone, or by heat and the simplest
chemical agencies.      Most of those of more recent discovery have been
obtained by exclusively chemical means, the exceptions being those, the
separation of which, by means of voltaic electricity, by Sir Humphry
Davy, makes the commencement of this century a marked epoch in the
history of chemistry, and also of the Royal Institution.         From the time
of Sir Humphry Davy no new method for the recognition of elements
had been discovered until the researches of Bunsen and Kirchhoff gave
to the scientific world a definite knowledge of analysis by means of the
spectrum. By this means Bunsen discovered the two new alkali metals
caesium and rubidium, and by the same means the speaker was led to
the discovery of Thallium.
    The special history of the discovery of the last-named metal offered
a curious parallelism to the discovery of selenium by Berzelius.           The
great Swedish chemist was engaged on the examination of a residue
from a sulphuric acid manufactory, in which he was induced to suspect
the presence of tellurium.        A complete examination proved to him
that tellurium was absent ; but in the course of his experiments he
succeeded    in separating a new element,          belonging to the sulphur
group,   to which he   gave   the   name  of  Selenium.     The speaker, three
years ago,  was  occupied   in  the  analysis of  a similar  residue from some
sulphuric acid works at Tilkerode, also with a view to the separation
of tellurium.    The sulphuric acid residue had originally been placed
at his disposal by Professor Hofmann, in the year 1850, for the pur
pose of extracting selenium from it.          In the distillation of the crude

1863.]                 on the Discovery    of Thallium.                        63
selenium, there was left behind in the retorts a residuum which a few
chemical tests led the speaker to conclude contained tellurium.              This
was placed aside for further examination, and remained unnoticed until,
in the beginning of the year 1861, it was re-examined with the object
of preparing tellurium from it. Not succeeding in finding evidences
of the presence of this metal by chemical means, the speaker had re
course to the recently discovered means of spectrum analysis ; but
instead of noticing the alternate bands of light and shade characteristic
of tellurium, he was surprised to observe a single green line of remark
able brilliancy and intensity, which had hitherto been unnoticed, and
was communicated by no known element which could have been present
in the residuum.       (The spectrum of thallium was here projected on the
screen, a 40-cell Grove's battery being used to produce the electric arc.
 Its green band appeared perfectly sharp and brilliant upon a dark
 background.)      Further researches soon proved to the speaker that he
 was, in fact, dealing with an entirely new element ; but the quantity
contained in the material under analysis was so minute that the com
 plete isolation was a matter of great difficulty.       In September, 1861,*
 however, and by means of the galvanic battery, he succeeded in preci
 pitating the metal in a pure form ; to which, in consequence of the
 green band it communicates to the spectrum and to flame, he had pre
 viously given the name of Thallium, from SaAAo'y, a bud, the colour of
 early vegetation most nearly resembling the shade of green it gives.
 The metal was shown to friends soon after isolation, and its nature
 freely communicated ; but no formal publication of this fact was made
 until the opening of the International Exhibition, on May 1, 1862,
 where, in a case deposited some days before, were displayed several
 grains of the new body, labelled and described as a heavy metal.
      By the kindness of numerous friends, among whom may be mentioned
  Dr. Thornthwaite, Professor Chandelon, and Mr. Peter Spence, and
 by the munificence of the Royal Society, he has since found more pro
 lific sources of the metal, and been able to work on a large scale.
       While speaking of the metallic nature of Thallium, the speaker
 noticed the fact of the observation of the green line and separation of
  the metal, on the 16th of May last, independently of himself, by a
 skilful Belgian chemist, M. Lamy, who deposited a specimen in the
  International Exhibition in June, 1862.
       Thallium, the speaker said, belongs to the class of heavy metals.
  Its specific gravity is 11'9, very nearly that of lead. In colour it most
  resembles cadmium.          It possesses considerable lustre, but quickly
  tarnishes in the atmosphere.       It is very soft, being easily scratched by
  lead. It is very malleable, and the speaker showed that it could easily
  be forced into wire, several lumps welding together in the cold into
  one solid rod.     It marks paper like plumbago, but the mark quickly
  disappears by the formation of a light-coloured oxide, being reproduced
  however by the action of a soluble sulphide. Thallium, the speaker

showed,    was strongly diamagnetic, being only inferior to bismuth in
this respect ; and Dr. Matthiessen had determined that its power of
conducting electricity was very near that of lead.       It is precipitated
from its solution by means of the battery in beautiful crystals, the form
of which has not yet been determined ; and when the experiment is
carefully conducted, these spread over the dish in branches like a de
licate seaweed, or with a stronger solution like the club-moss. The
atomic weight of thallium is about 203. Its chemical properties are
at first sight rather anomalous, and seem to justify the remark of M.
Dumas, that it is the ornithorhynchus of metals.     That eminent French
chemist ranks it with the alkaline metals, with which indeed it has
some common properties : but the speaker is inclined to class it with
the heavy metals, lead and silver, to which it seems more nearly allied
both by its chemical and physical properties : several of the chemical
reactions of thallium were shown in corroboration           of this view.
Like the metals potassium and sodium, it forms a soluble oxide which
is endowed with strongly alkaline properties ; like them too it is not
precipitated by sulphuretted hydrogen, nor in its lower state of oxida
tion by an alkali ; it also forms an insoluble platino-chloride, but here
the resemblance ceases.     All the other reactions are similar to those of
the heavy metals.     The soluble oxide is in reality also allied to the
oxides of silver and lead (which are both soluble in water and alkaline),
inasmuch as it has no affinity for water, being rendered anhydrous even
at the common temperature in a vacuum. It is readily precipitated in
the metallic form from its saline solutions by zinc. It forms an insoluble
peroxide, sulphide, iodide, bromide, chromate and sulphocyanide, and
a slightly soluble protochloride,       sesquichloride, ferrocyanide and
chlorate.
     The alloys of Thallium have not yet been much studied. Th euses
of the metal the speaker said he was hardly yet in a position to dwell
upon. At present it would appear only to confirm in the most striking
manner the value of spectrum analysis as a guide in chemical research.
As an agent for the production of colour in pyrotechny, it was only
equalled in brilliancy by the two other elements which give a mono
chromatic light, lithium and sodium. The speaker here illustrated the
monochromatic nature of the thallium light, by throwing the magnified
image of its electric arc on a bouquet of variously coloured flowers ;
and concluded by thanking the audience for the indulgence they had
extended to his first public discourse.

                  WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                        Friday, February    6,  1863.
        COLONEL     PHILIP JAMES YORKE, F.R.S. in        the Chair.
                     JAMES GLAISHER, Esq. F.R.S.
                 On Scientific Experiments     in Balloons.
 IN the introductory part of the discourse, Mr. Glaisher gave a brief
history of aerostation, from the discovery of the fire-balloon in the year
 1782, by the two brothers Montgolfier, noticing some of the principal
ascents made with fire-balloons.     He then spoke of the discovery of
Cavendish in 1776, viz. that hydrogen gas was fully ten times lighter
than common air ; when it immediately occurred to Dr. Black, of
 Edinburgh, that if so, a thin bladder filled with this gas ought to rise
of itself: yet a period of several years elapsed before this obvious
property was applied to the inflation of balloons ; not in fact till
the success of the fire-balloon was established.         He then spoke
of the more remarkable ascents and experiments which were made
with air-balloons within a few years of its discovery, and remarked,
that the result of the several experiments having proved that
the balloon would raise great weights in the air, and remain for a
long time thus suspended, caused a general desire to navigate the
lofty regions of the atmosphere, and to pursue meteorological and
other investigations in those regions, and the invention of the balloon
was looked upon as likely to be followed by great consequences.       He
then spoke of the different ascents which have been made in the
interests of science : the first of which was that of Mr. Boulton, well
known as the partner of the famous Watt, who constructed a balloon
to which a match and serpent were attached, that the gas might explode
in the air.   The object was to determine whether the reverberating
sound of thunder was caused by echo or by successive explosions ; the
point remained unsettled owing to the shouting of the people ; but it
was thought that the sound did resemble thunder.
    This experiment was made on December 26, 1784. No further
experiments were made, so far as he knew, till the beginning of the
present century, when in the years 1803 and 1804, Air. Holwrtson

66                           Mr.  J.  Glaisher                    [Feb. 6,
made three    ascents from St. Petersburg, for the purpose of making
magnetical   and  other experiments.
     On August 23, 1804, MM. Gay-Lussac and Biot ascended from
Paris for a similar purpose ; they attained an altitude of 13,000 feet,
and found no difference in their experiments in electricity, magnetism,
and galvanism from those made on the earth.
     On September 15, Gay-Lussac ascended alone to a height of
22,977 feet ; he found that the temperature declined from 82° to 15° ;
that the sky was deep blue ; that the time of horizontal vibration of a
magnet was shorter with elevation.
     In 1806, Carlo Brioschi, Astronomer-Royal at Naples, endeavoured
to ascend higher than G ay-Lussac ; the balloon burst, but its remnant
happily checked the rapidity of the descent.
     A  period of forty-four years followed, during which no systematic
attempts were made to take scientific observations by means of bal
loons.
     In 1850, MM. Bixio and Barral inflated a balloon with hydrogen
gas, in the gardens of the Observatory at Paris, with the intention
of ascending to a height of from 30,000 to 40,000 feet ; in their first
ascent they ascended to a height of 19,000 feet, and descended to the
earth in 47 minutes ; they passed through a mass of cloud 9000 feet in
thickness.
     In their second ascent, clouds were reached at 7000 or 8000 feet,
which proved to be 15,000 feet in thickness ; they never, in fact,
passed out of the clouds ; for when they were 23,000 feet high, they
began to descend, owing to a rent in the balloon.
     Mr. Welsh's experiments were made in the year 1852 : on August
 17 and 26, October 21, and November 10, the respective heights attained
in these were 19,500 feet, 19,100 feet, 12,640 feet, and 22,930 feet : a
great number of observations were made, from which the following
law regarding the decline of temperature with elevation was deduced : —
     " That the temperature of the air decreases uniformly with the
height above the earth's surface, until at a certain elevation, varying on
different days, the decrease is arrested, and for a space of 2000 or 3000
feet the temperature remains nearly constant, or even increases by a
small amount : the regular diminution being afterwards resumed and
generally maintained at a rate slightly less rapid than in the lower
part of the atmosphere, and commencing from a higher temperature
than would have existed but for the interruption noticed."
     These results, as well as those found by Gay-Lussac relative to the
decline of temperature with increase of elevation, appeared to confirm
 the law which theory, based upon observations upon mountain sides,
 assigns for the gradation of temperature ; viz. a decrease of one degree
 of temperature for every increase of 300 feet. Up to the present time
 therefore the high expectations entertained on the discovery of the
balloon have never been realized.
     The speaker then proceeded to state, that since the formation of
the British Association, grants of money have been made for the

1863.]           on Scientific  Experiments in Balloons.             67
purpose of pursuing these inquiries ; but with the exception of those
by Mr. Welsh, none have been made.
     In the year 1861, another grant of money was made, and a com
mittee appointed to carry out experiments by means of the balloon, and
the task of making these experiments was undertaken by the speaker.
     The primary objects of the experiments with which he was
entrusted were : —
     The determination of the temperature of the air and its hygro-
metrical states at different elevations up to five miles.
     To compare the readings of an aneroid barometer with those of a
mercurial barometer up to five miles.
     To determine the electrical state of the air.
     To determine the oxygenic state of the air by means of ozone
papers.
   To determine the time of vibration of a magnet on the earth, and at
different distances from it.
     To determine the temperature of the dew point by Daniell's Dew
Point Hygrometer, Regnault's Condensing Hygrometer, and by the
use of the Dry and Wet Bulb Thermometers as ordinarily used, and
by their use when under the influence of the aspirator, so that con
siderable volumes of air are made to pass over their bulbs, at
different elevations, as high as possible, but particularly up to those
 heights where man may be resident or where troops may be located,
as in the high lands and plains of India, with the view of ascertaining
what confidence may be placed in the use of the Dry and Wet Bulb
Thermometers, by comparison with the results as found from them and
with those found directly by Daniell's and Regnault's Hygrometers ;
and to compare the results as found from the two hygrometers
 together.
     To collect air at different elevations.
     To note the height and kind of clouds, their density and thickness
at different elevations.
     To determine the rate and directions of different currents in the
atmosphere.
     To make observations on sound.
     To note atmospherical phenomena in general, and to make general
observations.
   The speaker then described the method of managing a balloon, spoke
briefly of the several ascents already made, and then proceeded to
speak of some of the results.
     Speaking of the ascent on July 17, the departure of the tempera
ture from a regular progression was very remarkable.        Below the
cloud the decrease was nearly uniform ; on passing above it there was
an increase of 6° ; the decrease was then resumed, and the temperature
was 26° at 10,000 feet, and continued at this reading till 1 3,000 feet
had been passed ; a very remarkable increase then took place, and at
19,500 feet a temperature of 42° was registered, and then declined
rapidly to 16° at five miles. In descending, a disturbance from a
                                                             p2

68                                               Mr.       J.   Glaisher                                                    [Feb.   G,
 regular increase was met with at 24,000 feet, and continued to 17,000
 feet; at 13,000 feet clouds were reached and no observations were
 made below 10,000 feet.
      The temperature of the dew point approached that of the air in the
 cloud but did not touch        and then separated more and more until at
                                           it,
 the highest point there was almost an entire absence of moisture.
      On August 18, the temperature of the air decreased as usual on
leaving the ground, until at the height of 4000 feet the rapidity of the
 decrease was checked and         warm current of air was met with and
                                             a
continued to 1,500 feet the balloon then descended and passed through
                 1                     ;
the same warm current extending to the same limits, and again passed
through   it on its reascension at about the same height, and extending
to 14,000 feet, when the regular diminution was resumed and continued
to the highest point      on descending, the same warm current was met
                                 ;
with, and continued till the clouds were entered at 6500 feet, which
caused another interruption in the regular increase of temperature as
is usual on entering cloud.
      In the ascent on September        on passing out of the cloud there
                                                           5,
was an increase of temperature of 9°         and then no interruption was
                                                                      ;
met with till      height of 15,500 feet was reached, when
                   a                                             warm cur                                        a
rent of air was reached, and continued to 24,000 feet then          regular                       :                     a
decrease was experienced till the highest point was reached.
      On descending, the same warm current was encountered between
22,000 and 23,000 feet        and a similar interruption, but to a greater
                                       ;
amount, was experienced till the balloon had descended to about the
same height as       was first met with on ascending.
                      it                                   After this there
was no further interruption till the descent was completed.
      A table was then formed from all the observations, showing the
decrease of temperature for successive increases of elevation of 1000
feet.    The results are as follows —                      :

      These results differ considerably from those formed in a cloudy sky,
 and doubtless the difference between experiments carried on under a
 cloudless sky would differ still more.           They do not at all confirm the
 theory of a decline of 1° of temperature in 300 feet.

a partially clear sky ; and together show that a change takes place of
1° of temperature in 139 feet near the earth, and only in 1000 feet at
the height of 30,000 feet, and plainly indicates that the decline of 1° of
temperature must be abandoned.

    The laws of moisture here indicate a humidity near the ground
less by 15 with a partially clear sky, than in a cloudy sky ; starting
with 63 in the former state on the ground, increasing to 77 at 3000
feet high ; then nearly constant to 5000 feet, when it abruptly
decreased to 69 and 68 at 5000 and 6000 feet, and then decreased
nearly evenly at the rate of 5 in 1000 feet, till at 9000 feet and
 10,000 it was 52 ; the degree then constantly decreased till at a
height exceeding 25,000 feet it was less than 10, and it would seem
that at higher elevations there was an almost entire absence of water.
These seem to be the general laws ; but this regular diminution is
evidently often interrupted, and strata of moist air may exist, or be
passing at different elevations, even up to 20,000 feet, of some thick
ness.
     Electrical State of the Air. — In the ascent on July 17, the air was
found to be charged with positive electricity, becoming less in amount
with increased elevation, till at the height of 23,000 feet the amount
was too small for observation.       The instrument was broken in the
descent, and was not afterwards used.
     Time of Vibration of a Magnet. — The general result of all the
experiments      is,
                 that the magnet vibrates in    somewhat longer interval

      On the Propagation of Sound. — From observation made in the
different ascents, it was learnt that different notes and sounds pass more
readily through the air than others ; for instance, the barking of a dog
and the whistle of a railway engine have been heard at a height of more
than two miles, whilst the shouting of several thousand people cannot
be heard at the height of one mile.
      On the Oxygenic Condition of the Atmosphere. — On July 17, the
test papers by Moffat and Schonbein were untinged by colour through
out the journey ; and the same result was found during the ascent on
July 30th.
     On August 10, Mr. Glaisher received a letter from Dr. Moffat,
of Hawarden, expressing surprise at this result, inasmuch as it has
always been received as a theory, that ozone increases in quantity with
increased elevation.
     In consequence of this, Mr. Glaisher went to Dr. Moffat, at
Hawarden, and requested him to make some papers, which he did, and
these papers were used on August 18, together with some prepared
by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra, and some prepared according to
Schdnbein's formula ; and at 22,000 feet the coloration was 4 on a
scale whose deepest tinge is 10, whilst those prepared by Schonbein
were coloured to 1 on the same scale, and those by Negretti and Zambra
were uncoloured ; in consequence of this, the preparation of the papers
by Messrs. Negretti and Zambra has been stopped.
      Physiological Observations. — On July 17, before starting, the
number of Mr. Coxwell's pulsations were taken, and found to be 74
in one minute ; and Mr. Glaisher's were 76 in one minute.
      At a height of 17,000 feet, Mr. Glaisher's had increased to 100,
and Mr. Coxwell's to 84 ; and on reaching the ground, the number
 was 76 with both gentlemen.
      On August 21, no observations were taken before starting.        At
 the height of 1000 feet, the following results were obtained : —
                 Mr. Coxwell                    96 per minute.

      The pulsations of Capt. Percival were so weak that he could
  scarcely count them     ; whilst those of Mr. Coxwell he considers had
  increased in strength.

72       Mr. Glaisher   on Scientific Experiments in Balloons.     [Feb. 6,
      From these results it will be seen that diminished pressure exercises
a different influence upon different individuals.
      On July 17, at 19,000 feet the hands and lips were noted as being
 dark-blue, not the face.    At the height of four miles the palpitations
 of the heart were audible, and the breathing was affected.
      On August 18, the hands and face were blue at the height of
 23,000 feet.
      On September 5, at the height of about 29,000 feet Mr. Glaisher
 became unconscious, and at 35,000 feet Mr. Coxwell lost the use of
 his hands.    At 29,000 feet on descending, Mr. Glaisher began to re
 cover,   and at 25,000 feet the observations were resumed.
      The general results of these eight ascents are : —
      1st. That the temperature of the air does not decrease uniformly
 with the height above the earth's surface, and consequently the theory
 of a decrease of 1° of temperature for an increase of elevation of 300
 feet must be abandoned.      In fact, more than 1° declined in the first
 hundred feet when the sky was clear, and not so much as 1° in 1000
 feet a height exceeding five miles.
      These experiments are the first to yield any definite information on
 the subject ; more experiments are required to settle the law satis
 factorily, but its effect on the laws of refraction will be great : all the
 elevations of the balloon are to a certain extent erroneous, for it has
 never happened that the mean of the extremities has given the mean
 of the whole column of air.
      2nd. The degree of humidity decreased wonderfully with the height
 till at above 5 miles there was scarely any aqueous vapour at all.
       3rd. That an aneroid barometer can be made to read correctly, to
 the first place of decimals certainly, and to the second place of decimals
 probably, to a pressure as low as 7 inches.
       4th. That a dry and wet bulb thermometer can be used effectively
 up to any height on the earth's surface where man may be located.
       5th. That the balloon does afford a means of solving with advan
 tage many delicate questions    in physics.

After some introductory remarks on the growing importance of the
subject, the speaker proceeded to lay before his audience a series of
facts, obtained by close observation, which promise to become the
cause of the origin or increase of revenue to private individuals, and a
source of national wealth.*
      A good barn-door fowl produces about 120 eggs in a year. The

         Trout,  like salmon,  carry, on an average, 1000 eggs to every pound of their
  weight ; but this rule does not apply to trout under a pound.          Again, as regards
  other fish, the heavier they are the more eggs they carry. — From a specimen of
  the Lophius Pixaloritu (the angler-fish) sent to him from Brighton in February,
  1862, Mr. Buckland obtained a substance resembling a ribbon 6} yards in length,
  thickly studded with ova, about the size of turnip-seed— from which billions of
  angler-fish might have been produced.            The number of young oysters on the
  shell of the old one at spawning time is estimated at 1,800,000.

resembling figs in a box. The colour of the eggs varies, some being
white and others of a splendid coral-red colour ; all equally good.
The eggs are exceedingly hard and tough, and very elastic ; which
prevents them from being crushed or otherwise injured.
     How the Fish deposits her Spawn.— Birds build with twigs and other
vegetable material. The salmon and trout can make no use of these
materials, so they deposit their eggs among stones. Other fish, especially
sea-fish, make use of vegetable material ; either, as in the case of the
stickle-back, building a true nest, or else depositing the eggs upon the
fronds and leaves of the plants, somewhat after the manner of insects.
     When the fish (the salmon and trout) are about to spawn, they
choose, above all places, a shallow gravel bottom ; the reason being
that there shall be a more rapid flow of water, and hence a greater
supply of oxygen to the eggs themselves and also to the young ones
when born. The most natural breeding-grounds for the salmon are
small, rapid, mountain streams, deep pools being in the neighbour
hood, wherein they can rest and take shelter.      They, doubtless, ought
to have pools ; because a salmon does not deposit her ova at one and
the same time, but at intervals.    During these intervals she drops back
into the pool, and recruits her strength for further operations. From
this we may learn much as regards the increase of salmon by natural
means.* One knows the salmon's nest by observing in the bed of the
river a hillock, or mound of gravel, about a wheelbarrow full, and a
hollow sort of ditch in front of         it,
                                      as though some one had been scrap
ing  it up with his heel. At the spawning season the male salmon has
an enormous beak,         huge finger-like projection at the top of his
                          a
lower jaw.    [Two   preparations  of this were shown to demonstrate this
fact and also
     ;              coloured diagram, carefully drawn from nature, by
                     a

                                   is
growth from the bone below. It disappears, moreover, when the salmon
is not breeding. Mr. Buckland concludes that           simply an offensive
                                                          it   is
and defensive weapon, and       analogous to the horn of the deer.

of the eggs do not get properly impregnated at the time of spawning,
or not being caught by the gravel, are washed away constantly by the
stream.    Then down come the floods and overwhelm the nests with
mud and rubbish, or else sweep them bodily away, level to the bed of
    * This  is the meaning of the salmon making such vigorous efforts to get up
from the sea to the higher waters.    Instinct seems to tell them that the young will
die in shallow water; they therefore make superpiscine efforts to get up cataracts
and waterfalls, and attain the shallow brooks.      Give them free passage up, and
protect them when there, and they will increase and multiply exceedingly.           Mr.
Ashworth, in letter to Mr. Buckland, says — " We find, and
                 a                             :                    Ihave seen   it,that
the smallest streams of pure water are the safest, the most productive, and the very
places selected by the parent fish for depositing their ova;   and if protected for two
months in the winter (December and January), any river may be made productive
in which the weirs are made passable by ladders, and all natural and insurmount
able obstructions, such as rocks, and cascades, and falls, are made accessible, and in
which the waters are the purest."

 the river.    Here is a case in point : — Mr. Buist wrote in ' The Field,'
 March, 1863, "From eighteen salmon and twenty-grilse we had filled
our breeding-boxes with 275,000 ova.          Immediately after our ponds
were filled the rivers came out in great floods, which dispersed the
salmon, and, it is feared, that as these floods continue till the end of
December, the fine appearance of fish would come to little account
when left to all the contingencies of spawning in the rivers.     The 310
fish not spawned would all be ripe within ten days, so that from those
left to their natural course there would not have been so many fecun
dated eggs from the 310 as we have in the breeding-boxes from the
forty fish.    All these fish were caught on one ford where the Almond
joins the Tay." Then again we have droughts ; and the nests made
 when the water is high become bare and exposed to the air when the
 water goes down ; either the eggs die from this cause, or else the young
 when hatched out, having no water, " refuse to exist."      Great destruc
 tion of spawning fish is also caused by mill-wheels.
      2. Fish eat the eggs ; and these not only minor fish, but trout, who
 wait below the nest and scramble for the eggs.          Mr. Buckland has
 himself taken trout eggs from a trout's mouth.
      Mr. Ashworth states that he has taken no less than 500 peas (fish
 eggs) from the maw of one trout.        He placed these by themselves in a
 hatching-box, and most of them in due time produced young fish.
 Salmon, too, will eat their own eggs, and we used formerly to see
 salmon ova, preserved in salt, sold at the fishing-tackle shops for bait.
 This mode of fishing is so deadly, that it is now made illegal.
      3. Other enemies of fish are water-insects innumerable, especially
 the water-shrimp, the caddis-worm, the larva of the May-fly, the dragon
 fly, &c.    Messrs. Ashworth, of Galway, report that in one year 70,000
 salmon ova, deposited by them in a pure stream adjoining a plantation
 of fir-trees, were entirely destroyed by the larva of the May-fly.
      4. Human poachers. — At the time of spawning, the salmon or trout,
 usually as wild as a fox, becomes as tame as a barn-door fowl, and
 any little boy walking by the side of the stream can kill them with a
 stick ; they become the easy prey of the poachers, and millions of their
 eggs are destroyed which would otherwise have been deposited.         Tons
 weight are at this time captured and sent to Paris.         These fish are
 poisonous to Englishmen.         Mr. Ashworth's head-bailiff once ate a
  portion of one, and in consequence was made so ill that he was confined
  to his bed for two days, and he was a strong, powerful, healthy man.
  The British Fisheries Preservation Association are doing their best,
  by appeals and representations to Government authorities, both in
  England and France, to stop this destructive export of spawning fish.
      5. Birds, &c. — Mr. Buckland brought forward strong evidence to
  prove that the Water-ouzel and Dab-chick were rather the friends than
  the enemies of fish-culture, since they feed on the larva of insects.
  House-rats will greedily devour the ova, and will go into the water to
 get at them ; and it is said that the water-shrew eats the ova ; his teeth
  are insectivorous, but still he may eat fish-eggs.       Swans are most

destructive, particularly in ponds.       In the river Thames, they do
incalculable mischief to the fisheries, gobbling up the newly-laid spawn
with their long beaks and spoon-like bills.       Common ducks do the
same.
     Mr. Buckland's directions for successful Fish-Culture are here
given in detail : —
      On the Protection of the Eggs, and Hatching them by Artificial
Means. — Instead of allowing the ova to be deposited in the natural
nest, we catch the fish in a net, we take the eggs from her, we treat
them in the manner which was first discovered by two poor fishermen
(honour to their memory) and afterwards developed by M. Coste, pro
fessor of embryology at Paris.
      We have to provide an artificial nest, and an artificial mother.
The former consists of gravel placed in a narrow box, either of wood,
 earthenware, or zinc ; the latter consists of a stream of shallow water,
which shall be running night and day.
      A model of the boxes used by Mr. Ashworth was exhibited. It
 was made of elm, oak, or deal, and six feet long, eight inches deep,
 twelve inches wide, — an enlarged mignonette box in fact. The two
 requisites are a running stream and shallow water. You must fix the
 box according to your locality.     You can place it either in a narrow,
 fast-running ditch which you know will never fail you, or, better still,
 place it near a spring where you can regulate the flow of water by
 means of hatches, large or small.     You must guard both the entrance
 and the exit of the box with a bit of perforated zinc, the holes of which
 must be sufficiently large not to obstruct the current of water ; and
 you should also have a plate of perforated zinc fixed in any convenient
 place, a foot or two above the box, to stop the scum, &c., of the water.
 Above this may be placed an extra sentry, viz. a new birch-broom ;
 saw off the handle close to the twigs, and fix it with the loose ends of
 the twigs pointing up stream.      These twigs will catch the weeds and
 other mess that comes down with the water.         The cleaner the water
 you pass into the eggs, the better for them.       You should have wire
 covers, which can be padlocked to the boxes, to keep out the shrew-
 mice and rats, and the fingers of meddling boys ; and you should have
 boards ready to place over these to keep out the light during the incu
 bation of the ova. These boxes may be multiplied ad infinitum, so that
 the water that passes through No. 1 should fall into No. 2, and so on,
 like water falling down (only at the ends) from one step of a staircase
 on to the step below it.   The box should be a little inclined, to favour
 the flow of water ; and the water should have a fall from the end of one
  box into the head of another of a few inches.     You must take care so
 to level and arrange the boxes as that, should the stream from above
 fail, some water should always be left to cover the eggs.     If you have
 not convenience for placing the boxes in a parallel row, you can place
  them side by side, at right angles to the stream whence the water is
 derived, having a hatchway for each.
      Your boxes being all ready for putting down into the stream, get

some gravel.     River gravel will not do ; but dig it out of a gravel pit,
sift it through a sieve — the meshes of which are half an inch — and
when you have enough sifted, boil it for an hour or so in a copper till
it is quite clean. The boiling destroys the sporules of the vegetation,
and also the eggs of the minor water-beasts that eat the spawn.      Then
get the mason or the carpenter to fix the boxes in the stream, or better
do it yourself ; get the levels right by means of bricks, wedges of wood,
&c, and then wheel down the gravel to the place ; then, with a spade,
carefully deposit in the boxes your boiled half-inch sized gravel, to
the depth of about two or more inches.        You must then place a layer
of about one inch in thickness, or one and a half, of gravel stones — take
them as they come — each stone being about the size of a walnut.      The
reason of this stratification, is that the young fish, being hatched under
the big stones, shall not get down much below this level, being stopped
by the half-inch gravel.    Set your stream going for a few hours, and
see that it works properly, being always about two or three inches in
depth, and flowing perpetually.
    When you have got the eggs, carefully distribute them with a
spoon among the big stones under which they will naturally roll, —
and leave them alone.       The stream should be gentle and conti
nuous, but not fast enough to bother the eggs.       With all your pre-                 ,
cautions for keeping the stream clear, you will find a deposit settle
ou the eggs, and this to a greater or less extent.       To avoid this,
keep them dark ; put boards over the tops of the boxes, and,         you     if
please, get some common roofing slates, and place these on your
walnut-sized stones, taking care that the water shall flow freely under
them.     You will find the slates will catch the deposit which falls
from above downwards, and you can easily take them out and wash
them when dirty.      It     in my opinion,
                               is,             mistake, to actually bury

vegetation, and your boards and your slates will do all this.

 with the boiled half-inch gravel, so that two inches of water can be
 always running over them ; regulate your stream by means of stop
 cocks, and find a place for the waste water to run.            The water would
 be all the better for being filtered.         This is not absolutely necessary,
 if it is naturally pretty pure, but it is certainly advisable. Filter it
 through charcoal, gravel, sand, or any other simple and commodious
 material. The same water, if clean, may be used over and over again ;
 but fresh water       is,of course, preferable.•                                 .
      All things ready, place your ova either on the glass rods or on the
 gravel ;  have  a    bit of board ready, fitting the tops of the boxes accu
 rately, to keep out all the light (which      is   so favourable to vegetation),
 and look at the eggs every morning, to see how they are getting on.
 You should also support,          by means of stones or pegs fixed into the
 gravel,  bits  of  roofing  slates  over the eggs, to prevent the deposit, after
 the manner suggested for the out-of-door boxes.
      Some of the eggs die. The egg, instead of being                 bright pink
                                                                        a

      Do not disturb the eggs more than you can possibly help.                the       If
 deposit    isvery great, attend to your filter; carefully increase the
 stream of water, and in time you will be rewarded              byobserving that
the egg     is vivified.    You will know this by observing that two black
specks appear in the egg, which are the eyes of the future fish, and you
 will also see   a  faint line running around nearly three-quarters of the
egg, the body of the future salmon or trout.            When you see this, con
gratulate yourself, for the egg         isalive, and will probably hatch out all
right.
     The time of the eye appearing, and of the young fish hatching out,
depends entirely upon the temperature.              Temperature greatly affects
the development of the ova into the young fish.            It  is beautiful pro

vision of nature, that the young fish should not be hatched out too
soon, too early in the year, and acquire its mature growth before the
food on which     it  subsistsis    to be found, but that they should both be
produced simultaneously.            Keep therefore your temperature low, or
you will hatch your fish out too early in the season.               'The Field'
window began to hatch on the 16th of January, at the temperature of
52° to 55°.       The Zoological fish did not begin to hatch till Jan. 21,
the temperature being from 48° to 50°.              The temperature made all
this difference. The fish which take the longest time to hatch are
always the strongest fish of the two.

     This is the experience at Stormonfields as regards temperature, as
noted by Mr. Buist.       Of the 275,000 ova in our boxes, the whole are
now (March, 1863) quick and bursting into life; a great many of
them are already hatched, and the others are very healthy, and the
young fish may clearly be seen in them, and are bursting the shell
daily. In consequence of the fine open winter, the eggs have hatched
in our ponds in 115 days, and have done so corresponding to the days
on which the eggs were deposited.           Thus the eggs on the 13th of
November have hatched on the 8th of March, and have continued
doing so in the corresponding days.           In former seasons they have
 taken from 130 to 140 days, according to the temperature of the
water.      In spring water flowing from the rock in winter, where the
temperature is always equal, the eggs have been hatched in about 60
days.     The proper temperature of the water, both in and out of doors,
ought to range from 40D to 45°.        Mr. Ponder's observations tell him
that at this temperature it requires thirty-five days for the eyes to
 appear (i.e. that the fish is formed in the egg), and that they hatch
out fourteen days afterwards ; this same result has been obtained by
him for two seasons following with very little variation.     The first fish
again    hatched   out from   a  batch  are  the weakest, the last  are the
 healthiest ; when however they once begin to hatch they will come out
all in a mass, two, three, or four thousand of a morning.       The proper
temperature for trout and salmon eggs is 40° to 45°, and anything over
 50" is weakening.
       Young Fish. — When Mr. Buckland first received salmon and trout
eggs from Huningue, the eyes of the young fish were just visible as
two small jet-black specks — the sign that they will bear transport ; the
oil globules could also be seen in the substance of the egg, and the
tail of the fish could be observed moving from side to side with a rapid
 vibratory movement.         The young fish increased in size daily, and
every morning their growth was plainly perceptible ; more especially
 could be noticed the form of the head, and the darkening of the trans
 parent substance which would eventually be the body. He ascertained
 one fact. The eggs do not grow — i.e. they do not increase in circum
 ference or in diameter — but the fish inside them most certainly increases
 in bulk, till at last it becomes so large that the egg-shell suddenly
 bursts, and out comes the young fish.          We begin with a globule of
 albumen (or white of egg) ; we see within it a faint line, and two
 black spots ; day by day these become larger till the young fish is born.
 Time goes on ; the umbilical vesicle is absorbed, the colour appears on
  the scales, the long single crests which one observes at birth as running
 down the upper and lower parts of the body, resolve themselves, as it
 were by magic, into the various fins distinctive of the adult creature,
 and we have a perfect fish before us.
      It is most interesting to watch the egg at the moment of hatching.
 If  you happen to be gazing on a particular eg?, of a sudden you will
 see it split in twain at the part corresponding to the back of the fish ;
 you will then see a tiny head with black eyes and a long tail pop out,

 and you will see the new-born creature give several convulsive shudders
 in his attempts to quit himself from the now useless egg-shell.
      Mr. Ashworth gives the following observations as regards the
 increase of weight in the young salmon : — The fry, at three days old,
 is about two grains in weight ; at sixteen months old, it has increased
 to two ounces, or 480 times its first weight ; at twenty months old,
 after the smelt has been a few months in the sea, it has become a grilse
 of eight and a half pounds, it has increased sixty-eight times in three
 or four months ; at two years and eight months old it becomes a
 salmon of twelve to fifteen pounds in weight.          After which, its in
 creased rate of growth has not been ascertained ; but by the time it
 becomes thirty pounds in weight it has increased 115,200 times the
 weight it was at first.
      In the case of the fish, nature has packed up all the nourishment
 that it will want for some six or eight weeks in a neat little bag or
 parcel, which she has affixed to the body of the fish in such a manner
 that it shall be gradually absorbed into the general system ; the fish
 does not suck milk like a warm-blooded animal, so its lower jaw is not
 developed. What is then the most important organ to the young fish?
 He has numerous enemies, and it is his first object to get out of their
way. The eyes, therefore, are the organs which first arrive at per
 fection ; and they are indeed perfection in this minute, jelly-like
creature.     The eye is in perfect working order at the moment of birth,
 though the rest of the body is far from perfection.       The lining coats
of the eye, moreover, are already at birth painted with that beautiful
silver-and-gold lining which the angler will see if he cuts open the
 eye of the next fish he kills.    It is especially well seen in the eye of
 the cod.     This eye, however well suited for the purposes of avoiding
 danger, is by no means tolerant of light ; a fact which Mr. Buckland ob
served and immediately acted upon, for one day he found to his horror
                                                                '
that many of the young salmon (the first lot) in ' The Field apparatus
were beginning to die. He therefore got some bits of zinc and some
stones, and built miniature bridges in the tanks.           He touched the
salmon one by one, and three out of four of them swam away under
the bridges in a moment.        Subsequently for plates of zinc he substi
tuted bits of common slate, such as are used for roofing houses. Those
who rear young fish should, therefore, above all things, recollect the
necessity for making
                         " hides " for the fish.
     Deformities.
                  — Fish are sometimes born with deformities.           Mr.
Buckland, with the assistance of Professor Tyndall and his electric
lamp and microscope, exhibited on a screen a double fish — salmon
twins united, having one tail and one umbilical bag.         He also exhi
bited the figures of four or five young fish just hatched, full of
activity.
      Treatment of Young Fish. — All the young fish having hatched
out, Mr. Buckland's advice is certainly to leave them in the boxes till
the umbilical vesicle is absorbed.        They do not want any food, for
they are supported by the contents of the umbilical vesicle, and at this

 time above all others require protection.            It is at this time many
 young fish die from what is called " gill fever."           A tenacious white
 fungus   attaches  itself to  the  gills, and  in a short time completely ob
 structs the action.     There is no remedy for these diseases, except sepa
  rating the fish, that they shall not be overcrowded, causing the stream
 of water to be increased, and attending to the hides and general clean
  liness. By looking to these points you will save many fish, both in
 your outdoor and indoor boxes.
       When the umbilical bag is empty they will begin to feed by the
 mouth, and at this time if not fed they will peck at each other's tails.
  The French authorities recommend at this time that they should be
 fed with the boiled flesh of frogs powdered into minute bits. The
 Stormonfields authorities use boiled liver, powdering it in their
 hands, and throwing it in. Another food is the fresh roe of the sole,
 plaice, whiting, or other small sea-fish, not salted, or the least decayed.
  Mix it up with a stick in clean water, and put a little of the water
  among the fish.     They will also eat minute water-insects, red worms,
 flies, &c.
       Turning out Fish. — A great question now arises as to the period
 at which they should be let loose into the waters, which the rearer of
  them wishes to stock.     Mr. Ashworth expresses himself as being of the
 opinion that if they are turned out at once (i.e. when they begin to
  feed), they will, from various causes, be lost to the river.     Both he and
 the Stormonfields authorities always keep their young fry in ponds, and
  feed them till they put "on their jackets," i.e. assume the smolt coat,
 and go of their own accord to the sea. It must be recollected that the
 conditions of the waters of the regular salmon rivers are very different
 to those of the Thames.        But, however, Messrs. Ashworth and Buist
 are, no doubt, right in their opinions as practical men, in regard to the
 salmon. Mr. Ponder and Mr. Francis Francis are in favour of turning
 the fish out into the Thames at once — i. e. when they begin to feed :
 because if the fish is turned down in a state of babyhood, he has to
  " graduate through all his difficulties," and learns to shift for himself.
  Mr. Buckland's advice to experimenters as regards the Thames and
 other southern waters, is to turn out with a gentle hand the young fish
  on to quiet and undisturbed shallows in the main river ; or else into an
  ever Jioiting (not stagnant), broad, weed-containing pond or ditch,
  whence the young fry can escape into the stream when they please.
  It is also advisable to keep some of them in a ditch, containing from
  one to three feet deep of flowing (not rapid) water, for the sake of
  comparing them with the fish that have been turned out into the open.
  A water-cress bed is a capital place.
       Transport of Ova and Fish. — At Huningue the newly-taken eggs
 are placed in their hatching-boxes, and there allowed to develop them
 selves till the eyes of thejish are plainly seen in the egg.        Then, and
not till then, can you move the eggs.          If  you attempt to do so before
the eye is seen, they will most assuredly die.         Wait, therefore, till you
see the even developed      in  the eggs you wish to send away.
                                                                    g 2

84                         Mr. Frank Auchland                     [April 17,
     The following is the best mode of proceeding : — Procure some
wide-mouthed bottles, three or four inches high — common pickle-
bottles or tumblers will do very well ; — place at the bottom of the
bottle or tumbler a layer of fresh moss (this must have been well
washed previously), then dip it in clean cold water, and squeeze the
superfluous water out, so that the moss shall be wet, but not dripping.
Portions of rough sponge, the size of a walnut, well cleaned, are as
good packing as moss, and are cleaner (these must also, of course, be
damped).      Upon the layer of moss deposit a layer of your " eye-show
ing'" eggs, and arrange them so that they shall not touch one another.
Place another layer of moss, another layer of eggs, and so on till the
bottle is full ; but there must be no pressure anywhere. Pour out any
water that has collected at the bottom of the bottle, cover the top with a
bit of common paper, and stab some holes in it with a penknife. Your
bottles being all filled, get a stout but light box — arrange your bottles
in it in the most convenient position, and stuff them down quite tight
with moss that is dripping wet with water, put the cover on the box
and fasten it securely.     Then place this box inside another box, leav
ing   about two   or three inches  of interspace. Fill this up quite tight
with wet moss, and send them off by the quickest route of transport to
your friend.     If possible, give them in charge to a friend, or the guard
of the train, and avoid exposing them to heat or to cold. This is
the mode used at Huningue with so much success.            Directly the eggs
are received the moss should be picked out carefully with a pair of
forceps, and the eggs placed immediately in the apparatus ready to
receive them.
     The Young Fish can also be carried long distances, and this is in
almost any kind of vessel.      It is not necessary to keep these vessels
steady ; moderate splashing of the water helps to oxygenate it. Change
the water as often as you can, say every two or three hours ; and if
you see the fish getting sickly, blow air into the water by means of a
common pair of kitchen bellows, or by means of an ordinary shilling
pewter squirt : or use the admirable, simple, and inexpensive aerating
apparatus sold by Air. Wright, fishing tackle-maker, of 376, Strand,
which the transporters of live-bait for jack-fishing have found so
useful.
     To show what a great distance young fish will travel, Mr. Buckland
stated that he had received a few weeks since some young salmon from
Gothenburg, in Sweden. They arrived perfectly sound and well late
on Monday evening the 13th.          There were twenty-six live fish, and
one egg on the point of hatching out.          The vessel they came in is
simply a gigantic water-bottle.       These salmon, though very healthy at
first, died away one by one.      The heat of the mid-day sun upon the
boxes was fatal to them ; but they would have lived if they had been
placed in better and cooler water.
     Great efforts have been made to transport salmon to Australia,
and the Australian government has voted large sums of money for this
purpose. Mr. Buckland believes the key to success has been dis

  covered at last : it is " freezing the ova."     This is the question of the
  day in the transport of useful fish for long distances.
        What has been done, and what remains to be done. — We must, of
  course, give preference to the magnificent establishment at Huningue,
  near Basle, a noble example of what has been already done, by per
  severance and energy in a good cause.      In this wonderful establishment
 the eggs of fish are kept, and advanced in their hatching till they arrive
  at the period at which they will bear travel.      It is by these means that
  many rivers in France are actually repeopled with fish, employment
 given to hundreds of poor fishermen, and the food of the people greatly
 increased.    The fish cultivated are as follows : — 1. Truite commune.
 2. Truite saumonee.         3. Truite grande des lacs.         4. Saumon du
 Rhin. 5. Ombre chevalier (Charr). 6. Ombre commune (Grayling).
 7. Saumon du Danube.          8. Fera.    The number of eggs distributed
 is enormous.      In 1861, the total quantity of fish-eggs distributed was
 sixteen million, four hundred and forty thousand, four hundred.
       To several French scientific gentlemen the highest possible praise
 should be accorded by the English people — especially to M. Coste, who,
 having arranged a system for the artificial propagation of both marine
 and fresh-water fish,  is,as    were, the father of pisciculture
                                  it                             ;  and to that
 liberal-minded man, M. Coumes, the engineer of Huningue, who has
so liberally distributed many thousand eggs of fish throughout Her
 Majesty's dominions during the last season, and to whom we owe the
greatest acknowledgments, as well as to the French government, which
makes distributions of the eggs of the best kinds of fish gratuitously to
all the proprietors of rivers in France who will undertake to hatch and
protect them, and make        areturn of the quantity so produced.
      In England, Mr. Thomas Ashworth, of Cheadle, Cheshire, and his
brother, the owners of the Galway fishery, have literally repeopled
with salmon various streams that previously had no salmon in them, as
well as   a  district of their fishery of thirty miles long      by  ten wide.
They have also opened up great extent of water, viz. great number
                                  a                         a
of tributary streams from the Claregalway river up as high as Bally-
haunis. Messrs. Ashworth commenced artificial propagation of salmon
at Oughterard, in Galway, the same season that the French commenced
at Huningue, neither party being aware of what the other was doing
at the time.      At least 659,000 salmon ova were collected, impreg
nated, and transported into these rivers, in December, 1861, from the
adjoining streams of Claregalway, where the parent fish are found in
great abundance.
      The total cost of placing 770,000 salmon eggs in the fish nests or
hatching boxes, and of transporting the salmon, has been eighteen
pounds, in addition to the regular and weekly cost of his staff of water-
bailiffs and workmen.       The fisheries have benefited    by   Messrs. Ash-
worths' exertions to an enormous extent.        There are twenty fish now
to be seen, where there was one before.          The little fish go down to
the sea, and come back big fish, good, marketable food.
     Scotland also has done much for her fisheries.        The establishment

at Stormonfields, on the Tay, is now a household word, and the obser
vations, both practical and scientific, made by Messrs. Buist and Brown,
are of the greatest importance.
     In regard to the money value of salmon fisheries in the aggregate,
it is stated that England produces annually about ten thousand pounds
in money value ; Scotland nearly half a million of pounds ; and
Ireland about three hundred thousand pounds annually.*
     The extent of rivers in England is much greater than in Ireland, but
they do not produce more than about ten thousand pounds per annum.
There is a district in Yorkshire about 600 miles of rivers — the river
Ouse, the Derwent            (72 miles), Swale (71miles), Ure (61 miles),
Whurfe (75 miles), Midd (55 miles), &c.           These are all good, pure
rivers, with fine mountain streams, and extending over thousands of
square miles, and do not produce salmon worth one thousand pounds a

Hampton, 76,000 young fish (viz. 10,000 salmon, 50,000 trout, 3,000
charr, and 13,000 grayling), the ova having been presented by M.
 Coumes, the engineer of the establishment at Huningue, on behalf of
 the French government.
     Dr. P. L. Sclater and the authorities of the Zoological Society, have
devoted the entire end at their aquarium-house at the Gardens to the
demonstration of the science of fish-hatching.     The apparatus was ably
designed and arranged by A. D. Bartlett, Esq., Resident Superinten
dent of the Gardens, and a great number of fish has been hatched out
during the past few months.

                           On Luminous Meteors.
 The term meteoric, from the Greek ptru. Zpov, beyond the boundary,
or scope of particular examination, applies to all objects removed from
the surface of the Earth.     Neither Halos, however, Lightning, nor the
Aurora are properly included in the term " Luminous Meteors," since
the first are luminous by borrowed light, the second and third un
doubted manifestations of electricity.      The term is properly confined
to the problematical phenomena of shooting stars and fireballs, and the
kindred appearances of falling stones or aerolites. The prevalence of
electricity in the air presents one among the reputed causes of fireballs
and shooting stars, but affords no explanation of the repeated descent
of stones from the air of definite and constant lithological structure.
    In the year 1752, Franklin in America, and Dalibard in France,
extracted electricity from the air, of the same kind as ordinary machines
had hitherto supplied for their experiments. The electrical condition
of the atmosphere has been studied since that time by De Saussure and
other electricians, but without such a complete success as leaves nothing
to be desired.     Free negative electricity at the surface of the earth,
or positive in the highest strata of the air, is supposed to exist per
manently, producing by induction discharges of electricity from clouds
of a higher to those of a lower level suspended in the air. The calorific
and mechanical effects of the flash of lightning can be imitated on the
small scale by the electricity of machines.       Fulgurites, or lightning
tubes of glass powder, have been produced a quarter of an inch in
length and upwards.      Glass to the thickness of two inches has been
pierced by the electric spark, while the dispersion of oxalic acid crystals
by the discharge of the Leyden jar exemplifies in a striking manner the
explosive suddenness of the elevated temperature. The electrical
manifestation of a moving discharge, termed globe lightning, and said
to be occasionally observed, has alone defeated the imitative powers of
experimenters. This is the only phenomenon upon which an analogy
between fireballs or shooting stars and electrical displays in the lower
atmosphere has been maintained.       Should the fact of its occurrence be
proved to satisfaction, and its origin be discovered, the extreme rarity
of the air at heights in which meteors exhibit their brightest light for
bids the extension of the effect from the region of the clouds to that of
almost empty space.

88                               Mr. A. S. Herschel                       [April   24,
     From numerous accounts of fireballs the following appear to be the
characteristic features of their appearance.              A starlike point, of a
saffron or orange hue, moving with moderate speed, increases gradually,
or continues to advance for a considerable time with constant lustre.
More or less suddenly the point expands with a white or bluish light
of great intensity.         The expansion may even surpass the apparent
diameter of the moon, and the light and colour may become so powerful
as to cause a red and dull appearance of that satellite should the meteor
pass closely near her disc.         In this state the appearance of the meteor
is rarely globular ; but more commonly kite-shaped or pear-shaped ;
of a crescent form, followed by a straight or conical protracted train of
wings and tongues, or by a single short tail of light, less intense than
the crescent portion in advance.           In round and oval fireballs an enve
 lope of red sparks occasionally surrounds the head ; in all, the largest
of the sparks issuing from the rear of the nucleus form a dull-red exten
sion of the tail, and sharing partly in the motion of the meteor, pursue
the latter upon the track at various intervals, until the spectacle is
 past.    At other times they form in more or less detached clouds a
 permanent luminous streak, enduring many minutes, with curious vari
 ations of its form, after the disappearance of the meteor.                   In kite-
shaped or crescent-like meteors these parcels and clouds of light are
left, with a red glow, by the fading tongues of flame that follow on the
head.      They never extend widely to the sides, but like the smoke of
 flame attend sluggishly in the rear of the projectile in a track rarely
wider than a single degree of arc.•             At the moment of greatest ex
 pansion,   followers,   in  the  form  of flakes  and spheres of light, attend in
 pursuit of the meteor on the tail.              The head never divides itself
 laterally, into parts proceeding far with equal pace and brilliance.
 Lastly, the brilliant blue ball of a large meteor may vanish without
sparks or followers or train of light, but with a tremulous appearance
unravels a phosphorescent            long-enduring streak of white light, which
 remains to mark the path in which it moved. Or, in a few meteors of
the larger kind, no white or blue focus of the light, but without atmo
 spheric absorption, an orange or red hue is seen in all the parts of the
 figure just described. Their manner of disappearance is without any
fixed rule.      Fireballs either pass away gradually as if by the mere effect
of distance, or at the moment of greatest expansion break into parcels
    * " The production, continuance, gradual change of form, and descent and final
dissolution of these trails, may be familiarly but correctly illustrated by comparison
with the similar succession of phenomena characterising the trail of smoke and
soot issuing from the funnel of a steamship during its progress on its course, in
which also a rectilinear beam of finely divided solid matter separated from flame
and smoke, often several miles in length, becomes a persistent trail and gradually
changes into a waved or serpentine form.         In many cases the trail of a meteor
must have been originally a cylindrical beam, constituted as now explained, having
a diameter of many hundred yards, equal to or greater than that of the meteor
itself, and a length of many miles, deposited in an inclined direction at heights of
some miles above the earth's surface. — Original Note, by E. W. Brayley, Esq.,

of light like that of the meteor itself, rapidly fading into ruddy sparks.
They frequently collapse quickly to a single ruddy spark, or quite sud
denly disappear. At some points of the flight of a large meteor, and
not always at the termination of its course, violent concussions are pro
duced, audible over wide extents of country and occasioning sensible
tremors in the air. The following list of remarkable fireballs exem
plifies the principal characteristics here described, and invites attention

      In   the numbers of the last column a globe of ignited ordinary
 coal-gas one yard in diameter, at the distance of one mile, is sup
 posed to shine with the power of full moon, and the diameters of simi
 lar globes truly representing the light of the meteors is calculated
 from the original descriptions, and the known distances of the ob
 servers from the light.         As meteors have been known to produce
 dazzling effects by day, their light cannot be greatly inferior to that of
 burning gas, nor the diameters of the luminous globes greatly exceed
 ing the approximations here obtained. The figure of least resistance,
 originally proposed by Mr. Brayley, and also by Dr. Haidinger, of
 Vienna, for the true construction of a fireball, is that of a pear-shaped
 envelope of incandescent air springing from the foremost surface of a
 solid missile, and drawn with occasional nodes to a long distance in the
 rear. The flash perceived in a fire-syringe made of glass is illustrative
 of the luminous effect ascribed in this theory to the compression of the
 air, while the lime-light and the brilliant combustion of magnesium in
 oxygen gas are examples of the brilliance imparted by certain solid
 bodies to flames of very intense heat.          In the recent experiments of
 M. Ste. Claire Deville, on the dissociation of water, it was shewn that the
 heat of solid fuel is sufficient to destroy completely the chemical affinity
 of oxygen for hydrogen ; and the same conclusion is inferred by Dr.

combustion of sulphur produces luminous effects, even in air of the
greatest possible tenuity.         Other combustible elements (as originally
pointed out by Mr. Brayley) may enjoy the same property equally with
sulphur ; and as pyrophoric lead in air and pulverized antimony in
chlorine gas exhibit spontaneous inflammation, and even iron, like
charcoal, supports its own combustion, it appears not improbable that
 the whole of the elements           of a meteoric surface, dissociated from
 oxygen by     the  violence   of  the   heat, are scattered in a vaporous con
 dition around the path of a meteor, and glow with gradual recombustion
after its departure. A rekindling of the streak after the passage of a
shooting-star, and the flame which has occasionally been observed both
 in shooting-stars and in large fireballs to retreat along the course from
 the point of greatest expansion, appears to favour this explanation.
      Fireballs, like the following class of shooting stars, frequently
appear in groups, although not in such numbers as the smaller kind of
 meteors.     The following are remarkable epochs for their annual return.
 The 2nd of January ; 29th of July ; 3rd of August, and the 9th to
 the 12th of August; the 8th to the 14th of November; and 8th to
 llth of December. (R. P. Greg.)
      In 1727 shooting-stars were proposed to the Royal Society, by
 Mr. G. Lynn, for the geographical determination of longitudes, with
 the remark that these had never appeared to him below the clouds, and
 that their height was probably as great as that calculated by Edmund
 Halley, for the great meteor of 1719. In 1798, two students, Ben-
 zenberg and Brandes, in the German university of Gottingen, attempted
 the problem proposed by Mr. Lynn, to determine their heights and
 velocities.     Observing in April from a base of five English miles, and
 in September from a base of ten English miles apart, the average
 hourly frequency of their observations, and again of those undertaken
 in 1823 and 1824 (before the periodicities of August and November
 were suspected), are shown by the table following : —

      It   appears by the succeeding table, that a remarkable numerical
intensity has occurred annually upon the 10th of August, since the
time when attention was directed to these observations. In 1762,
Musschenbroek ascribed the prevalence in Belgium of August shoot
ing-stars to summer exhalations of sulphur from the earth.                            This
theory received support by the results ultimately obtained by Brandes
and Benzenberg, which included an ascent, like that of a rocket,
in the instance of a single shooting-star.                  The very same points of
commencement           and disappearance of a shooting-star, cannot in fact be
observed at two widely separated stations.                 Nevertheless, the straight
line which intersects mathematically all the four recorded lines of
sight in such observations as those of Benzenberg and Brandes is a
determinate trajectory of the meteor ; but corrections of a single degree
applied to the observations transversely to the calculated trajectory
may so lower its termination (or elevate the commencement), as to
convert an apparently ascending into a really descending flight of the
meteor.       On these principles Bessel in 1833 assigned limits of probable
error to the calculated results of Brandes and Benzenberg.                            The
before-mentioned result was disproved, and the difficulty of ascending
meteors     is removed apparently for ever from the path of a cosmical.
theory of their origin.           The observations of Benzenberg and Brandes,
as well as those more recently undertaken, assign variable heights
from 20 to 100 miles above the surface of the earth for their disap
pearance, and 15 to 40 miles a second for the limits of their velocity.

1863.]                        on Luminous      Meteors.                       93
     The storm of    stars observed by Humboldt and Bonpland, at Cumana,
on the 12th-   1 3th   November, 1799 ; and the recurrence of the identical
phenomenon       in   1833    in North America, led Professor Denison
Olmsted, of New York, to compare observations of six successive years,
1831-36; and to propose, for the theory of the evident periodicity of
the storm, the possible passage of the earth at this juncture through
the outskirts of a zone of asteroids, composing the disc of the zodiacal
light.   Increase and decrease of the phenomenon in successive years
he compared to the yearly and four-yearly returns of eclipses of the
sun. To test the asteroidal theory of Professor Olmsted, Dr. Wartman,
of the Observatory at Geneva, watched throughout the whole of the
following epochal night (1837), in the cloudy air of that season,
for the descent beneath the clouds of a single aerolitic particle, without
success, although the shower was reported to him to have been seen on
the same night at other more favoured localities.          Subsequently to the
remarks of Musschenbroek before cited, T. Marie Ign. Forster, in
England, drew attention to the storm of shooting-stars, August 10th,
1811, and to the records of his father on their general prevalence
in August. The same remark was made by Dr. Burney, in 1820, on
the meteorological        records of several preceding years, made at the
Royal Academy of Gosport ; and in 1827, Mr. T. Forster published
from a MS. preserved in the library of Corp. Christ. College, Cam
bridge (the work of a monk in the preceding century), a
                                                                      " Calendar

" meteorode " distinguish the 10th and 18th of August as in the original
MS., and are the embodiment of a Roman Catholic tradition, that
St. Lawrence, on the anniver.-ary of his martyrdom, the 10th of August,
sheds yearly burning tears ; and perhaps of the astonishment created
by the great meteor of August the 18th, 1783.                   M. Quetelet, in
 December, 1 836, aware of the unconcealed periodicity of the November
shower, asked of the Academy of Sciences of Paris, if the second week
in August were not like that of November, an annual epoch of the
recurrence of shooting-stars.          The elder son of M. Arago, with one
assistant, at Paris, counted in a single hour on the following 10th of
August, 101 shooting-stars. The conjecture of M. Quetelet was thus
confirmed, and it has not since deceived the yearly expectations of
observers.     Simultaneously with M. Quetelet, Mr. E. C. Herrick, of
 Newhaven (Connecticut), following the views of Professor Olmsted,
 indicated the probability of a cosmical phenomenon in August, and
 with great industry collected instances, where an eruption of Vesuvius,
 a hurricane at Barhadoes, and other accidental circumstances had led
observers to record the lOth of August, in all parts of the globe, as
 remarkable for shooting-stars.         The researches of Professor Derrick
 had the merit of pointing out, unassisted, the day of the return, which
 has not since required correction.         Secondary to periodicity, an argu
ment for the    cosmical    origin  of  these  showers is found in their fixed
uranographical region       of  emanation.     Like the shadows from a straight
candle-shade,     the  whole   of the parallel  paths appear to diverge from a

single point, which has its place unchanged among the stars during the
whole continuance of the shower.                  In November, the radiant point
rises above the horizon at midnight, in the Lion ; in August it belongs
to the circumpolar stars, in AR 50°, N. Decl°- 51°, and were the relative
velocities of the particles through the earth's atmosphere exactly
determined, the eliptical dimensions of the cosmical zones about the
sun might be readily calculated, and their periodic time concluded.
A similar stream, with a radiant in corona, is noticed in the mornings
of April 21st ; and the 2nd of January, the 29thof July, 19th of October,
and 7th of December, have been named by Messrs. Quetelet and
Julius Schmidt as prolific in shooting-stars. The different features
of shooting-stars, like those of fireballs, are not numerous, nor do they
appear to militate against the theory of their small-planetary or
 asteroidal character.
      Since the great fall of stones at Sienna, in Italy, in 1794, followed
by    others   at Wold-cottage, Sales, and Benares, and at length by that of
Aigle, no doubt remained of the facts which required scientific explana
tion ; and copious collections of examples are now found in the largest
mineralogical museums.              Our own national collection contains 111
specimens of stones, and 79 masses of iron, known or reputed to have
fallen from the air ; and differs in this respect by only 18 to 25 localities
from the large original collection of these minerals at Vienna.                         The
falls of aerolites are attended by luminous phenomena in no way dis
tinguishable from the class of larger fireballs.                 Although accounts are
not so precise as to justify the conclusion of their identity, a review of
numerous observations since the great fall of Sienna raises a strong
presumption that the light of silent and detonationg fireballs is caused
by the flight of small aerolites with high velocity towards the earth.

       It appears from these accounts that fireballs scattering aerolites
produce an audible concussion before the precipitation of the stones
upon the ground.               The volume of compressed air transported in
front of a meteorite is perhaps sufficient by its liberation to con
vey an audible report from the almost empty spaces in which the

concussions occur, but the obstruction of the denser air delays the
catastrophe of the meteor's fall upon the earth until the thunderclap has
already announced the blow of its arrival in the atmosphere.            In the
catalogue   of  1400  meteors  collected  by Mr. Greg,    22 per  cent,   were
attended by aerolitic falls.     From various combinations of velocity
and dimensions the disappearance       of so large a proportion of fireballs
may    be  explained by   dissipation  in the air ; and of some, by loss
upon the surface of the earth.
     Connected with this view of the origin of fireballs is the minera-
logical examination of aerolites and aerosiderites.          The stones of
Stannern were in their external features studied by Von Schreibers,
and Widmanstatten developed crystalline structure by etching polished
surfaces of meteoric iron ; Rose, Wohler, and other chemists have
analysed a large number both of aerolites and aerosiderites ; and most
recently Professor Maskelyne has been occupied in a minute study of
their ingredients in thin sections of their substance, and by crystallo-
graphic measurements of some of their constituent minerals.            It fol
lows from the analyses, and from these microscopical investigations, that
olivines, varieties of augite, eustatite, anorthite, and other as yet
undetermined silicates, besides nickeliferous iron, metallic and pyritic,
form the materials of the stones, and are mingled in crystals or sphe
rules in a tufaceous but crystalline magma.       Their structure, however,
is not paralleled by any known geological rocks.       Schreibersite, a sin
gular phosphide of iron and nickel, is found in these stones, as elastic
yellowish crystalline laminae, and also appears, by its resistance to the
action of acids, to assist in the production of the Widmanstiittian
figures seen in the nickel-iron alloy.    It points to a scarcity of oxygen
in the native region of the stones.      Carbon and many metals, but no
new element, are found among the mineral constituents.          A hydrocar
bon in the stones of Alais, Kaba, and Bokkeveld, but no certain proof
of organic remains have been hitherto detected.        The black enamel-
like glaze which envelops perfect stones is proof of sudden and
momentary exposure to flame of intense heat, since the time when
the meteorites were broken from their native rocks, and hurled upon
                                    "
the earth. The lunar " ballistic      theory of their origin is exposed to
the objection of enormous volcanic activity necessary for a single
accurate aim with aerolitic velocities, no doubt greatly exceeding those
of circumterrestrial orbits. Such volcanic action is not perceived in
the neighbourhood of the centre of the moon's visible disc.              Their
course is therefore more probably of a planetary nature and orbitual
about the sun.
     The crepuscular atmosphere in which meteors are luminous, has
been called by M. Quetelet the stable atmosphere, distinguished by
dryness and immutability from the unstable atmosphere below, in which
rain is prepared, and storms burst forth and commingle the parts.
Positive electricity he conjectures to reside upon the lower, and negative
electricity upon the upper portions of this lofty atmosphere, which by
librations about the centre of its figure may cause the known magnetic

disturbances and variations of the needle.              At the base of this region
M. Quetelet supposes the aurora to have its place ; banks and arches of
light being formed horizontally near its lowest confines and streamers
from these shooting upwards, to relieve from time to time the varying
tensions in the stratum.             In this view, negative horizontal currents,
following     the   sun,   explain  the  southward drift of the auroral arch, and
luminous discharges towards the upward pole of the dipping-needle
occasion a canopy of converging beams arising from the arch.                   Dr.
 Plucker has indeed shown that in gases moderately dilated, luminous
currents obey the rotatory influence of the magnet, but that in extremely
rare gas the discharge is stationary and confined to the direction of the
 magnetic lines of force.
      The phenomena of luminous meteors and the aurora are thus
 allied to one another by their appearance at the outer confines of the
 air, and well directed observations of their particulars are a source of
 instruction at once to the astronomer and the meteorologist.               But in
 our present uncertainty of the material, and of the physical and
 mechanical constitution of these extreme boundaries of air, projects of
 observation must aim at results very difficult to anticipate or to define,
  and the words of Benzenberg himself still ring in our ears, " Such
  a question will have time."

                 WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,

           On Japanese Art— illustrated by Native Examples.
Of all the marvels of Art      and Industry collected at the International
Exhibition in 1862, none excited greater attention or admiration from
the reflective visitor than the contributions of Asia, including as they
did the productions of India, Turkey, China, and Japan, and also of a
host of islands — the inhabitants of which seem alike gifted with Art
powers, indigenous to the soil on which they grow, as the gorgeous
plants of the tropics flourish independently of care or culture :  I allude
particularly to that marvellous perception of form and colour, founded
upon the laws of nature, and demonstrable by the aid of science or the
rules of art, that seems the heritage of all Asiatics.
    To the Dutch we are much indebted for keeping alight the feeble
flame, the spark of European intercourse, that has never been allowed
to die out, greatly to the benefit of all.     Through this channel many
things reached the court of the Tycoon, as others found their way, via
the Netherlands,     into Europe ; yet the Hollander seems to have
profited little by the aesthetic lessons of Japan.    The Cabinet Royal
de Curiosites at the Hague, though a great source of attraction to
strangers, is certainly not so interesting or instructive as it might be
made ; scarcely rivalling the Musie Siebold at Leyden.          In matters
of applied art the Dutch have not a refined taste ; they have a good
school of genre in painting, though none of either architecture or
ornament.
    In contrasting the arts of China and Japan, what strikes one forci
bly is the marked difference of labour, — the Japanese aiming to produce
the greatest   possible effect at the least expenditure of trouble, whilst
the Chinese make pains a principal virtue ; they toil and spin, but lack
inventive power, working from instinct rather than from the dictates of
reason, — a fault with all Asiatics, in greater or lesser degree — degrees
that seem to reach their climax as they near the coast, and are lost in
the great ocean, or are tided over to the numerous islands, there to be
modified, translated, and adapted to other wants.
    The Japanese court in the International Exhibition, though some
what crowded, was beautifully arranged by Sir Rutherford Alcock, to
                                                                h 2

100                              Mr.   J.  Leighton                      [May   1,
whom we are indebted for the collection of objects, as also those admir
able volumes, " The Capital of the Tycoon." Would that our envoys
in remote corners of the world had done likewise, for          I feel sure that in
the islands of Formosa, Java, and Ceylon, are an infinity of objects of
the rarest interest to Europeans.
     The people of Japan, whilst they seek safety in seclusion, seem by
no means to be blind to outward influence ; to learning from any source :
with all their love of feudalism and seclusion, the Japanese appear much
more free in thought than their neighbours the Chinese, being a people
who, though bound by strong tradition, are ever ready to learn, as
many of their arts and manufactures clearly demonstrate.                European
influence is to be found in their fire-arms and ships ; it has taught them
linear perspective, as it will many other sciences ; in fact, the horses
that now shamble in shoes of straw, will gallop in iron, since Japanese
chargers have been tipped with that metal, in imitation of some steeds
that have found their way across the ocean.              To teach and be taught
ought   to  be the  mission  of man,  but  let our teachings be those of peace ;
let us not, like the Americans, make presents of artillery, and give
instruction in its use ; if we are to send them engines, let them be fire-
engines, to prevent destruction — let element subdue element, or be
subjugated to their use — in the locomotive, though          I fear the railroad,
from natural causes, may be difficult, if not impossible, in Japan.
     I   commence with Architecture,           because building is the primary
office of man — construction came before decoration — though one can
                         hardly exist without the other ; the man who con
                         structs a deal box produces a pretty ornament, at
                         the same time making a dove-tail, doubly beautiful,
because it grows out of the construction ; thus construction and decor
ation go together.
     As architects, the Japanese have many difficulties to contend with ;
they build as their fathers built
                                        — not from conservative feeling alone,
like the Chinese, but because the elements are against them.                 Man
may    raise  up,  but  the  elements   in  Japan   can raze down,   earthquakes
being of frequent occurrence there, rendering a wooden construction
necessary, — buildings that in ordinary hardly rise above the dignity of
a Swiss chalet of the most plain proportions : the gabel finals and ridge
tiles being, perhaps, the principal features of erections, rarely higher
than two stories, with galleries and verandahs — the doors and divisions
of rooms composed of sliding-shutters — the whole edifice resting upon
a foundation of stone supported upon legs of wood, somewhat as a four-
post bedstead stands ; this form being best suited to resist concussions
caused by the trembling earth.
     The temples and gateways are of timber, with massive tent-
shaped roofs, like the homes of the Tartars and Chinese, but with
many details purely Indian ; some of the edifices, as they stand upon
their stone bases, reminding one strongly of the Assyrian restorations
at Sydenham Palace ; indeed, it is very curious to find many types
from the ancient Egyptian, Assyrian, and Greek, perpetuated in the

 1863.]                       on Japanese  Art.                         101
works    of these remarkable people ; how they came to be embalmed in
 a  living art of the present day it would require deep research to
 prove, — a subject for the antiquarian, who looks backward, rather
 than the man of science who looks forward : though men of the past
 and future alike teach the present.
      In my outlines a is taken from a tomb, hundreds of which are to
 be found in their cemeteries ; a treatment of the sacred bean and
 lotus, so common in ancient Egypt, as
also in India, the great seat of the Bud
 dhist faith.    Figs. 1 and 3 are purely
 classic. The Greek fret and echinus, or                      I3JSIS1
egg and tongue moulding, are both used
 in China and Japan, key patterns being
 the most popular.        Fig. 2, in which
scrolls are united in a bud, is also com
mon, though more Assyrian than either
of the others. These forms, with many
beautiful renderings of the Anthemion, comprise their principal an
tique types.
     As workers in stone, the Japanese are decidedly clever ; though
the nature of the foundations will not permit of nine-storied pagodas,
they do wonders with the material ; having a timber architecture —
they imitate wood in stone (instead of stone in wood and plaster, as
we are apt to do) ; as shown in a photograph of a semicircular bridge
in stone — the struts, planks, mortices, and all being as if of timber,
copied.
      In their architecture and sculpture devoted to the purposes of
religion, the Japanese seek the aid of symmetry
to give dignity, a majesty obtainable by no other
means, a rigidity carried to the greatest extent
in the works of the ancient Egyptians, though
the Greeks and Romans were well aware of its
powers. In ornamenting their secular objects,
the Japanese seem studiously to avoid exact
repetition or a counterpart of lines, or, if they
find them, do all they can by means of decoration to destroy an exact
division or repetition of any portion.     All other nations seek symmetry
on principle, save these people and the Chinese, though the latter in
lesser degree.
     By way of illustration,   I may say they shun an equality of parts, or
rather the appearance of an equal
ity of parts, weighing with the
steelyard u instead of the scales
A. Justice with them -is not even-
handed ; and, though they give
weight in another way, they do
not do so by diametrical division.

       The arts of Japan  may be said, in an eminent degree, to depend
upon the picturesque, though rarely to reach the pictorial, that       to              is
say, they never produce       picture, because the principal element of
                                    a
pictorial art   wanting
                  is       light and shade — cloak with us that covers

compositions of Flaxman owe none of their world-wide fame to shade
or colour.    In their works may be observed the effects of light and
dark, somewhat akin to that of chiaroscuro, rendered with much truth
to Nature, and a dignified simplicity that many of our artists would
find    difficult to imitate.
       it
       In Japan  we are told there are no academies of Art, nor have the
artists any status above that of the cunning craftsman              hopeful  ;   a
thing, perhaps, for the future — Nature's students standing the less
chance of being ffited, lionized, or spoiled.
     For powers of drawing, native examples vary greatly, though all
are deeply interesting to the art-student, who may learn from the
humblest specimens.         The larger coloured examples being very
                        remarkable for    certain typical rendering of the

                        perspective has taught the Japanese artist to draw
                        faces in three-quarter view, and so vain does he
appear of the power as rarely to deviate from it. Apart from defective
drawing of heads, hands, and feet, the examples are very interest
ing, showing much good proportion, action, and drawing of drapery                           ;
whilst in colour they are very suggestive, some of the hues and patterns
being handsome in the extreme.
     The landscapes are very quaint, aerial perspective seeming beyond
their powers, except in one or two cases where white mists have been

attempted, as also rain, fog, and snow.      In depicting                clouds the
Japanese artist seems sorely puzzled — the tinted ribbons               they stretch
across the heavens looking like labels for inscriptions                 rather than
floating vapours.
     The smaller samples, cut from their books, are full                of fun     and
first-rate drawing, being quite
in spirit equal to anything
done here in the present day ;

and marvellously little effort.

in colours show what the
Japanese think of us and our ladies ; crinoline of the amplest being
faithfully depicted, as also beards, chimney-pot hats, and other pecu
liarities of the Western race.    One of a lady in wide hoops, mounted
on the wrong side of a native charger, is inexpressibly droll, showing
what we may expect to behold if ever that sketch-book, so freely used
 last season by a member of the two-sworded embassy, should be pub
lished.    Then shall we see London society as others see us, though                 I
give the preference to native art on native subjects, particularly where
there is action ; for curiously some of the best are figures in movement
— porters lifting, balancing, and carrying their loads ; an acrobat
poising his companion, a juggler ; street-boys full of mischief or weep
ing over broken dishes ; mechanics at work ; ladies bathing ; and
indeed a hundred-and-one phases of social and animal life : the lower
portion of the creation are finely rendered, particularly birds in flight,
 ducks, geese, and cranes being hit off with wonderful precision by no
ordinary marksman.
      In composition they are good, two or more figures uniting in the
 production of admirable lines ; though, like the early artists of other
 nations, the Japanese make their point of sight very high, all figures
 being as if looked down upon.
      In colour, as a nation, they are very judicious, rarely producing
discords, either in their attempts at picture-making or applied art — a
 thing that can hardly be said of either English or French.                        The
 British manufacturers, traders, and 'people in general, have but little
 love of colour, though her painters and architects appreciate it highly.
 In France this is au contraire — her manufacturers and traders claim
 colour as an inheritance, but her painters disregard            it,
                                                                  or place    it   asa

to the future historian of art.
    In art applied to manufactures, the Japanese stand very high, their
versatility of thought being remarkable ; rarely repeating anything by
rule of thumb, or copying without some modifications.             How different
to the Chinese, where a tailor will reproduce a garment for you stitch
for stitch, patches included ; or porcelain fabricants copy china vases,
cracks, rivets and all, effects and defects likewise.           In their manu
factures they studiously avoid symmetry (as                  I

condense the greatest variety in the smallest space, and, whilst they
conventionalize, worship Nature in the utmost ; some of their ways
being marvellously droll to us. This       I will illustrate in the decoration
of a very common box, brought me by Sir R. Alcock. You will per

a  few remarks on engraving, printing, and paper-making,       Iwill close
my list.
     As engravers upon wood and metal, the Chinese are known to
have been skilled long before civilization had dawned upon England,
or even Europe had dreamed of tomes in black letter       but few, year
                                                           ;             a
ago, would have ventured,   I    think, to claim the priority of colour-
printing for Japan   ; yet this may be the case   ;for in no instance do
their specimens bear evidence of having been copied from anything
done in the Western World, being hand proofs, worked in flat tints,
without a press;   secondaries or tertiaries in very few instances being
produced by working colour upon colour, as with us, who use no out
line to indicate form.
     Truly may we say there  is  nothing new under the sun, and par
ticularly under the red sun of Japan       for here we have two recent
                                           ;

inventions    superseded, one being graduated or rainbow-printing,         and
the  other some method by which blocks or prints can be reduced.
      If the printing excites our wonder, what shall we say to the paper,
for certainly we have nothing like that article, which plays so important
a part in Japanese life, serving a hundred purposes unknown to us,
keeping out the wind and weather from man and mansion, the windows
and coats alike being made of that substance, which bears little re
semblance to the rag papers of other parts — our own included.             We
import materials for paper manufacture from Japan, but not such as
a native would use : the bark of the paper mulberry being much
tougher than refuse rags, he wisely retains the former, but vends the
latter.    The toughness and pliability of paper from Japan is surpris
ing, especially in the thinner sorts, as, when held up to the light, it
appears full of holes, the woolly fibre of which it is composed being
distinctly seen.      It is very light and absorbent, printer's ink penetrat
ing   the  fabric,  which,  from that cause, has to be made double when
bound up in a volume.          How unlike our straw paper, so unpleasantly
brittle, and disagreeably dirty when printed upon, ink merely lying on
the surface : making one despair of seeing straw paper take the place
of the finest morocco leather, like the wonderful samples shown in the
 Exhibition, 1862, or do duty for the most delicate cambric, in the
shape of pocket-handkerchiefs, as paper does in Niphon.
      Verily the Japanese are a clever people ; and earnestly do     I    hope
they may be richer and happier for their intercourse with Europe,
though     Idoubt  it,  in some respects.    A people so sensitive will copy
many of our defects, as the natives of British India have done, degrad
ing themselves to meet the wants of European taste, as we all saw in
 the Indian department of the late Exhibition, which contained       a   great
deal of misapplied ornament, in the shape of Louis Quatorze carpets,
 impossible chairs, and tables the very tops of which were richly, but
 inappropriately, carved some of the presentation plate being abomina
                         ;
 ble, as Dr. Forbes Watson fully admitted, when he consulted me as to
 the objects of art he should send out as aids to instruction in the native
 schools.  I    advised him, as
                              I      would advise art missionaries to Japan,
 not to propose or dictate to  a    people our superiors in so many things  ;
 to supply them with objects of science rather than objects of art   ;   teach
 them perspective, the laws of proportion, and of colour (if you can)      ;
 supply them with photographs, but let Nature teach them art — teach
 not until you have learned.
      With these words would have concluded these humble opinions,
                         I
  but feel I  have yet another remark to make      ; namely, one of warning
  to collectors of articles from Japan, to be careful in the selection of
  objects — where all are quaint and curious, quality sometimes escapes
  observation  ;  and,
                   I      would here make known the regret  I    feel that we
  have no collection of the best products of these remarkable people, not
a   cabinet of curiosities alone, but a gathering of the ordinary articles of
  the country, selected  by    some men of judgment and taste, acquainted
  with our wants, who could explain things and their uses.          A know

 ledge of the ingenious aids to education, books, toys, and instruments,
 apart from their processes and machines, would be the inheritance of a
 large estate, an estate that we shall doubtless see the fertility of when
 we can find, in central Paris, a Musie Japonais, that we may copy
 secondhand, as we usually do.
      I  am informed by Sir Rutherford Alcock, to whom      I am indebted
 for many facts, that a really good collection of works, illustrating the
 arts and industry of Japan, could be obtained for one thousand pounds,
 and    I would ask what that sum regards to a nation that makes the
 world its market-place, and England its home ?

      Sir Roderick I. Murchison, K.C.B. D.C.L. F.R.S. Vice-
                              President, in the Chair.

            OOSSULTlHO CHEMlST OF THE ROTAL AGRlCULTURAL    SOClETY OF EKGLAND.
   On some Chemical          and Physical Properties of Soils, and                   the
                 Productive Powers of the Soils of England.
 In all fertile soils we find variable quantities of organic matter — ready-
 formed ammonia, nitric acid, potash, soda, lime, magnesia, oxides of
iron, chlorine, phosphoric, sulphuric, and silicic acids ; in short, all the
 mineral matters which are found in the ashes of plants. These minerals,
or ash-constituents, it need scarcely be observed, are not merely acci
dental but essential materials, without a proper supply of which no
plant can grow luxuriantly and come to full maturity.                      In one sense
all are equally important ; for the absence or deficiency in the soil of
one, be it lime or potash, phosphoric or silicic acid, is detrimental to
the luxuriant development of the vegetable organism.                       No one who
has given the slightest consideration to this subject will hesitate to give
assent to this mineral theory.
     It is natural to connect the productiveness of soils with the pro
portion of ash-constituents of plants which they contain ; but although
in some cases a soil may be unproductive on account of the absence
or deficiency of lime or potash or phosphoric or any other mineral
matter which enters into the composition of plants, in the majority of

1863.]                         on the Properties   of Soils.                         Ill
        the chemical analysis       of different soils   affords   little or no indica
tion   of their relative productive powers.
     The combinations in which the mineral constituents of plants exist
in the soil, their unequal or uniform distribution in the surface, the
composition and physical condition of the subsoil, the relative depth of
both, the porosity of the land, and especially the power of absorbing
and retaining, as well as modifying in a variety of ways the crude
manuring agents which are applied to the land, unquestionably are
intimately connected with the great variations which we notice in the
agricultural capabilities of different soils.
     Before the publication of Liebig's celebrated " Chemistry in its
Application to Agriculture," a work which has given the death-blow
to the humus theory, the fertility or barrenness of a soil was generally
considered to depend entirely upon its physical properties and the pre
sence or deficiency of humus. Soon after the publication of Liebig's
writings, scientific men fell into the opposite extreme, and expected
the bare chemical analysis of a soil and the ash-analyses of plants would
enable them to discover at once the means of restoring the fertility of
land, or to improve it by certain purely mineral manuring mixtures,
and to grow on      it,irrespective of its natural adaptation to the growth
of particular crops, any kind and almost every amount of agricultural
produce.
     These unphilosophical views have rendered agricultural chemistry
less popular than formerly, but also more scientific and more directly
useful to the enlightened agriculturist.
     A new direction to chemico-agricultural inquiries was given about
ten years ago by Professor Way's highly important researches on the
absorptive powers of soils for manure.        Professor Way's investigations
 originated in an observation of Mr. Thompson, of Kirby Hall, York,
who found that soils have the faculty of separating ammonia from its
solution.
     On passing solutions of ammonia through different soils, Way found
that all possess the power of retaining ammonia, some more, some less.
He also observed that potash, lime, magnesia, and phosphoric acid are
absorbed       by
                all soils to   considerable extent.
                               a
     Still more important are his experiments, which prove that cultivated
soils not only absorb free alkalies and acids, but have likewise the
power of separating ammonia, potash, and other bases from their saline
combinations.
     Professor Way principally operated with simple salts                may:   it
therefore be urged, that          by no means follows, as a necessary con
                                   it
sequence, that because        soil absorbs ammonia when
                               a                             solution of sul
                                                                   a
phate of ammonia           passed through it, the same absorption will take
                          is
place when an ammoniacal salt mixed with some dozen other sub
stances   isfiltered through it.
 I     therefore operated with complex liquids, and already, in 1857,
published several filtration experiments in the Journal of the Royal
 Agricultural Society.

112                                      Dr. A. Voelcker                                     [May 8,
      These and many subsequent experiments have shown that all soils
not only possess the power of absorbing and retaining potash, ammonia,
phosphoric and silicic acid, and other mineral matters, but also of
modifying in the most varied way the composition of complex saline
solutions which are passed through them.

same kind of liquid manure through two very different soils :—

      The preceding analytical results, amongst other particulars, show : —
      1. That the calcareous clay soil absorbed                       about six times as much
ammonia from the liquid manure, as the sterile sandy soil.
      2. That the liquid manure in contact with the calcareous clay soil,
becomes        much richer in lime ; whilst during its passage through the
sandy soil, it becomes purer in lime.
      3. That the calcareous soil absorbed much more potash than the
sandy soil.
      4. That chloride of sodium, in conformity with the results of other
observers, was not absorbed to any extent by either soil.
      5. That both soils removed from the liquid most of the phosphoric
acid.
      6.  That      the   liquid in    passing through         the calcareous         soil becomes

poorer     ;  and, on the other hand, in passing through the sandy soil be
comes      richer in soluble silica.
      The property of soils to store up food for plants is thus not con
fined to one particular       kind of fertilizing matter, but it applies to them
all, and manifests itself in a way which is modified by the composition
of the soil.
       In these, and in all other experiments which         I have since made,
the ammonia, potash, phosphoric acid, and other fertilizing matters
contained in a solution were never completely absorbed by any soil,
however weak or concentrated the solutions were that were filtered
through the soil.        Indeed, if the solution of saline matters which are
brought       into  contact with soil are very dilute, scarcely any absorption
of ammonia, potash, or phosphoric acid takes place.
       Sewage of towns, on account of the very diluted condition in which
 this liquid is usually found, in percolating through a soil scarcely leaves
 any of its soluble constituents in the soil in a fixed or less soluble form,
 although the soil possesses in a high degree the power of absorbing and
 retaining soluble fertilizing matters.
        All soluble saline matters, however useful or necessary they may
 be, impede the rapid growth of plants if they are presented too abun
  dantly or in too concentrated a solution to the roots of plants.            One
  of the functions of the soil appears to be to transform such readily
  soluble compounds into combinations so little soluble in water, that
  they pass in common life as insoluble, but which are still sufficiently
  soluble to supply the growing plant with the necessary amount of
   mineral food in a state of solution.
        This beautiful power of soils thus not only effectually prevents the
  waste in fertilizing matters which heavy rains would otherwise occasion,
   but also rectifies in a great measure any misapplication which may be
   made of concentrated soluble fertilizers.
        The power of soils to modify manuring matters depends in a great
   measure on the chemical composition of the soil, and also on the con
   centration of the liquid and the quantity of soluble fertilizing matters
   which is incorporated with that portion of the soil which is penetrated
   by the roots of plants.        Hence the effect which one and the same
    manure is capable of producing varies greatly in different soils, and
    also with a rainy or dry season.
        The office of the soil is not merely to supply mineral food to plants,
    but also to manufacture, so to say, crude food into a condition fit for
    assimilation ; to prevent injury to the living plant by too large an accu
    mulation of soluble matters in the surface soil ; to store up for future
    use such an excess ; to diffuse it equally in that portion of the land
    reached by the roots of plants ; and to modify it in conformity with the
    requirements of our crops, in a manner differing with each description
    of land.
         Respecting    the causes of the    absorbing   properties  of soils,  the
     opinions   of chemists are divided.

114           Dr. A. Voelcker    on the Produetive  Powers         [May   8,
     Liebig regards this power as analogous to, if not identical with the
physical power which charcoal possesses in retaining colouring mat
ters, and consequently considers the soluble fertilizing matters which
are brought into contact and absorbed either wholly or partially by
the surface soil, as present in what he calls a physical state of com
bination.
     Professor Way, on the other hand, believes the absorption to be
due to the presence of certain double silicates of alumina in the soil.
Thus, for instance, the double silicate of alumina and soda when brought
into contact with lime, according to Way, parts with its soda and takes
up lime.     When the double silicate of alumina and lime thus formed
is brought into contact with magnesia, lime passes into solution, and a
double silicate of alumina and magnesia is formed ; this in its turn is
decomposed by a salt of potash ; and the double silicate of alumina
and potash by a salt of ammonia ; thus finally, a double silicate of
alumina and ammonia is produced.
     Such displacements indeed took place on repeating Way's experi
ments : but when a preparation made after Professor Way's directions,
and containing silica, alumina, and ammonia, is mixed with an excess
of a solution containing a salt of potash, ammonia passes into the solution
and potash is absorbed by the preparation.      From a similar preparation
containing silica, alumina, and potash, an excess of a solution of a lime
salt removes potash, and lime becomes absorbed.
                        I
     But as in no case have been able to notice a substitution of one
base for another in equivalent proportions, and no double silicate of a
definite composition can be produced by Mr. Way's plan of operation,
and the existence of such definite compounds in soils has never been
demonstrated,    I would suggest a different cause or causes which are in
operation when potash, ammonia, and other fertilizing matters are fixed
in the soil.
                                                            I
     The absorption of soluble fertilizing matters by soils believe may
readily be explained by a reference to well-known chemical facts. The
absorption of soluble phosphates or phosphoric acid is readily explained
by the affinity which carbonate of lime, oxide of iron, and alumina,
which occur in every fertile soil, possess for phosphoric acid.
     In the absorption of potash and ammonia, I am of opinion that
 the hydrated oxides of iron and alumina in the soil have a great share.
 Like all bases of the formula R, O8, these oxides in a hydrated con
dition, in relation to strong alkalies, are weak acids, in consequence of
which they have a tendency to unite with potash or ammonia under
favourable circumstances.
     The absorption of ammonia, potash, and of phosphoric acid by
soils accords with well-known chemical facts ; and as these sub
 stances are by far the most important fertilizing agents, it may be
 maintained that the principal absorptive properties of soils are due to
 chemical and not to purely physical causes.
     The mechanical or physical condition of soils, however, affects
 very materially their productive powers ; and it is only in a soil in a

1863.]                       of the Soils of England.                        1   15
 proper physical condition that the chemical properties can properly
 manifest themselves.
     Great stress is laid by Liebig, as it is indeed by all good farmers,
 on the mechanical cultivation of the land.          Liebig directs special
attention to the physical state of combination, as he calls          it,
                                                                   in which
 the mineral matters must exist in the surface soil, in order that they
 may be of utility to the plant.     Whatever may be the precise meaning
of the term " physical state of combination," or whether we assume
 that mineral food must be presented to plants in solution, or in some
other mysterious form variously represented in Liebig's " Laws of
 Husbandry," certainly mineral food cannot be of any service to plants
except   it be present in the surface soil in an available form.         The
word " available," perhaps conveys as correct         meaning as the more
                                                       a
 novel and less graphic expression, " physical state of combination."
     In such an available condition mineral food cannot be brought
into the surface soil, unless water can freely percolate through the
land.    This is effected by various mechanical means, such as subsoil-
 ing, trench-ploughing, surface stirring, &c. By all these means the
 porosity, and with     its capillary attraction,
                        it                        isimproved.    As soon as
continued dry and warmer weather sets in and vegetation makes                    a
 fresh start, the mineral food prepared previously in the lower strata
of the soil begins to move in an upward direction. With the evapora
tion of moisture from the surface, fresh food     is conveyed into the sur
 face soil by capillary attraction, and thus the fertility of the latter         is
again restored.     The appearance of nitre, and similar saline efflores
cences on the surface of soils during long-continued dry weather,
sufficiently shows the display of capillary attraction.
     This explains why the exhausted surface of land, abounding at               a
greater depth in mineral riches, remains unproductive when          rests on
                                                                     it

 materially restore the fertility of the surface if        not accompanied
                                                           it   is
 by repeated ploughings, subsoiling, and similar mechanical operations,
 tending to increase its porosity and why in a well-cultivated clay-

soil vegetation     most luxuriant when the intervals between wet and
                   is

     Looking at the different soils of England, we meet with two ex
tremes, — naturally barren sands and rich fertile clays.     Between these
two extremes we find all gradations        ; some partaking more of the
characters of the one class, and others more of the properties of rich
clay land.
     Many originally barren soils, by dint of abundant manuring, the
cultivation of green crops, which are consumed on the land by fatten
ing sheep, by the purchase of oil-cakes and other kinds of concentrated
food, and the increased production of home-made manure, have been
brought into a high state of cultivation.         But although in this im
proved condition they yield large crops of wheat, barley, and roots,             it
can hardly be said that their permanent fertility has been materially
increased.    Left to themselves, they soon again become unproductive,
                                                                     i   2

and therefore require constantly a renewal of those constituents which
are removed in the crops grown on such land.        High farming, in refer
ence to light sandy soils, restores to the land infinitely more mineral
matter of the most valuable kind than is removed in the corn-crops
sold off the farm. As regards such land, high farming cannot there
fore be called a system of robbery.
      Deep, rich clay-soils, on the other hand, often contain, practically
speaking, an inexhaustible supply of potash, phosphoric acid, magnesia,
soluble silica, &c. The amount of mineral matter taken from such
land by a long succession of the most exhausting crops is quite insigni
ficant in comparison to that existing in twelve or eighteen inches of
soil.
      The actual state of fertility of land, however, does not so much
depend upon the absolute amount of mineral plant-food in a given
depth of soil, as upon the proportion which exists in the surface in an
available condition, or as Liebig calls it a " physical state of com
bination."
      Mechanical cultivation, thejudicious use of ammoniacal manures,
the restoration of particular mineral matters which, like phosphoric
acid, are most speedily removed from the surface and alternate crop
ping, are some of the means of repairing the fertility of the surface.
      On light sandy soils, deficient in potash, phosphoric acid, and other
mineral matters, ammoniacal salts or-nitrate of soda should be avoided ;
but on soils abounding in mineral food, such dressings may be used
with great advantage.
      Ammoniacal salts certainly increase the solubility of mineral mat
ters and promote their diffusion in the soil.    Still, making all allowance
for this, they appear to have a special effect on some crops and not on
others.     Thus cereals are improved by them, but not clover or beans.
In a series of most valuable experiments by Messrs. Lawes and Gilbert,
the plots continually manured with mineral matters produced only a
slightly increased crop of wheat, nor was the produce increased to any
extent in those years in which mineral manures were put on the land
every alternate year ; whereas in the years in which ammoniacal salts
were applied alternately one year and mineral matters the following,
a very great increase in the wheat crop was obtained, which was like
wise the case when ammoniacal salts were continuously used year after
year.
      With regard to the relative importance of the various fertilizing
matters, it may be stated that ammonia or nitrates unquestionably are
 most useful substances, which the intelligent farmer may turn into
profitable account, and the unreasoning one often abuses in a high
 degree.
      But as the atmosphere as well as the rain invariably contain both
ammonia and nitric acid, and as all cultivated soils contain both ready-
formed ammonia and nitrogenized organic matters, which on gradual
decomposition furnish ammonia or nitric acid or both, the application
to the soil of nitrates or ammoniacal salts is not of the same essential

primary importance as that of those mineral matters in which the
land is deficient.    Magnesia, lime, silica, sulphuric acid, chloride of
sodium, and even potash, are either present in most soils in great
abundance, or if deficient in particular soils, may be economically
incorporated with them in the shape of marl, burnt clay, or gypsum,
by the consumption of purchased food on the land. All these mineral
matters have much less value than phosphoric acid, which is but
sparingly distributed in most soils, and is largely required by all
plants.      Accordingly the removal of phosphoric acid from the land
leads more rapidly to partial exhaustion, especially of naturally poor
soils, than the removal of any other ash-constituent.             Fortunately
modern science and commercial enterprise have brought to light the
fact, that large deposits of phosphatic materials occur far more
abundantly in various parts of the world, than was supposed not many
years ago.
      [Of the phosphatic materials actually used in England for the
manufacture of artificial manures, the following were exhibited : —
South American bone-ash ; Cambridgeshire and Suffolk coprolites ;
apatite from Norway ; phosphorite from Estremadura ; Sombrero, or
rock guano, and phosphatic crusts, from Monk's Island, Jarvis
 Island, Baker Island, and various other small islets in the Caribbaean
 Sea.J
     Should the supply of Peruvian guano come to an end, which it will
before many years, English agriculturists will still continue to reap the
benefits which commercial enterprise, manufacturing skill and capital,
 more extended agricultural knowledge, steam-power applied to the
 cultivation of the land, intelligent labour and applied science have
 already conferred upon this highly-favoured country.
      Conclusive proofs can be given, showing that so far from being in
 a progressive state of exhaustion, the productiveness of the soils of
 England has wonderfully increased during the last fifty years ; and that
 the deplorable but hitherto unavoidable loss which the sanitary laws
 of a civilized country necessitate, is perfectly insignificant in comparison
 with the immense amount of mineral riches in the great majority of
 soils, and with the abundant restoration of fertilizing matters to natur
 ally poor land.

                      On      the      Molecule       of Water.
DOES the molecule    of water consist of              a single combining proportion
of hydrogen having      the relative weight 1 , united with a single com
bining proportion of     oxygen having the relative weight 8, or does it
consist of two combining proportions of hydrogen having each the
relative weight 1, united with a single combining proportion of oxygen
having the relative weight 16? In other words, ought the molecule
of water to be represented by the formula HO', in which O' stands
for 8 parts by weight of oxygen, or by the formula H,O", in which
O" stands for 16 parts by weight of oxygen?                    The question is entirely
one of fact.   If the hydrogen of water is experimentally indivisible, it
necessarily constitutes an indivisible proportion, or atomic proportion,
or so called atom. If, on the other hand, it is experimentally divisible
into two equal parts, it must consist of at least two atomic proportions,
or two atoms.
     Similar questions with regard to the molecular formulae of other
compounds have been decided with an almost absolute unanimity.
Thus chlorhydric or muriatic acid gas consists of 1 part by weight
of hydrogen united with 35'5 parts by weight of chlorine, and its
molecule is represented by the formula HC1, in which H stands for a
single combining proportion of hydrogen, and Cl for a single combining
 proportion of chlorine, having 35i times the weight of the single
 combining proportion of hydrogen.
     Phosphoretted hydrogen gas consists of 1 part by weight of hy
 drogen united with 10-3 parts by weight of phosphorus.                  Its molecule,
 however, is not represented by the formula HP', in which H stands for
a single combining proportion of
                                          hydrogen having the relative weight 1,
 and 1" for a single
                       combining proportion of phosphorus having the

relative weight 10-3 ; but by the formula H8P'", in which H8 stands for
three separable proportions of hydrogen having each the relative
weight 1, and P'" for a single indivisible proportion of phosphorus
having the relative weight 31.
      Silicated hydrogen gas consists of 1 part by weight of hydrogen
united with 7 parts by weight of silicon.       Its molecule, however, is
not represented by the formula HSi', in which Si' stands for 7 parts of
silicon ; or yet by the formula HaSi"', in which Si'" stands for 21 parts
of silicon, as the resemblance in properties between silicated and phos-
phoretted hydrogen might seem to require ; but by the formula
H,Si"", in which H4 stands for four separable proportions of hydrogen
having each the relative weight 1, while Si"" stands for a single indi
visible proportion of silicon having the relative weight 28.
      Why then do chemists represent chlorhydric acid, and its prototype
fluorhydric acid, as each containing one combining proportion of hy
drogen ; phosphoretted hydrogen, and its prototype ammonia, as each
containing three combining proportions of hydrogen ; and silicated
hydrogen, and its prototype marsh-gas, as each containing four com
bining proportions of hydrogen ? For all are agreed that in the
molecules of fluorhydric acid and chlorhydric acid there is one part of
hydrogen united with 19 parts of fluorine, and 35'5 parts of chlorine
respectively ; that in the molecules of ammonia and phosphoretted
hydrogen there are three parts of hydrogen united with 14 parts of
nitrogen, and 31 parts of phosphorus respectively; and that in the
molecules of marsh-gas and silicated hydrogen there are four parts of
hydrogen united with 12 parts of carbon, and 28 parts of silicon
respectively.
      The reasons by which chemists are induced to be so seemingly in
consequent are very numerous, and some of them very recondite ; but
the reason of greatest weight and most obvious character is drawn
from the phenomena of substitution ; by which is meant the change
effected in the composition of various bodies, by the abstraction of
certain of their constituent elements, and the introduction of certain
other elements or groupings in their stead.         Thus we have sodium-
alcohol,    in which a portion of  the hydrogen of common  alcohol is sub
stituted by its equivalent of sodium ; bromaniline, in which a portion
of the hydrogen of common aniline is substituted by its equivalent of
bromine ; nitrophenol, in which a portion of the hydrogen of common
phenol is substituted by its equivalent of peroxide of nitrogen ; and
so in very many other instances.           Now the conclusions deducible
from the phenomena of substitution, whether elementary or compound,
direct or indirect, obvious or latent, are, as will presently appear, of
the greatest importance in determining the molecular formulae of com
pound bodies.
      It is evident, for instance, that the molecule of marsh-gas must
contain four proportions of hydrogen, because we are able to replace
J, }, j, and | of its hydrogen by four successive substitutions, to pro
duce a series of bodies differing from one another by a regular gradation

of properties.    Thus the final product of the action of chlorine upon
marsh-gas is a compound in which all the hydrogen of marsh-gas is
replaced by its equivalent of chlorine ; so that if we consider the mole
cule of marsh-gas to consist of one combining proportion of hydrogen
united with 3 parts by weight of carbon, then the molecule of its
chloro-derivative will consist of one combining proportion of chlorine
united with 3 parts by weight of carbon ; or if we represent the mole
cule of marsh-gas to consist of four combining proportions of hydrogen
united with 12 parts by weight of carbon, then the molecule of its
chloro-derivative must consist of four combining proportions of chlorine
united with 1 2 parts by weight of carbon ; as shown in the following
table:—
                 C'=   3                           C"" =   12

     Now exactly intermediate between the original hydride and the
 final chloride is a body which contains hydrogen and chlorine in equi
 valent proportions, and which consequently cannot be represented with
 less than 6 parts by weight of carbon, and may of course be represented
 with 12 parts; while intermediate between this body and marsh-gas
 on the one hand, and between it and chloride of carbon on the other,
 are two additional compounds, the one containing three combining
 proportions of hydrogen and one combining proportion of chlorine, the
 other containing three combining proportions of chlorine and one com
 bining proportion of hydrogen, and both of them consequently incapable
  of being represented with less than 12 parts by weight of carbon.
  There are thus two sets of formulae presented for selection ; the one re
  presenting the above-mentioned compounds with unequal quantities of
  carbon by the simplest possible individual formulae, the other repre
  senting them with an equal quantity of constituent carbon by the
  simplest possible series of formulae ; and a little consideration has led
  chemists to the unanimous opinion that the formulae in the second
  column do, while those in the first column do not, express the actual
  correlations of the bodies represented.     For these bodies manifest in
  every respect a regular seriation of properties, such as necessarily would
  be the case if their molecules differed from one another only by a
  gradually increasing substitution of chlorine for hydrogen ; but such as
  could not be the case if the constituent carbon of their respective
  molecules varied in the ratio of 3 to 12, or even of 3 to 6. Moreover,
  by adopting the formula H,C"" for marsh-gas we perceive at once
  why in its chloro-derivatives the hydrogen and chlorine should always
  stand to one another in the relation of fourths.    But if marsh-gas is to

1863.]                    on the Molecule of Water.                   121
be represented by the formula HC, and its chloro-derivatives regarded
as compounds of HC with C1C, there is no reason why we should not
have compounds of I HC' with 2 or 5, or 6 of C1C, or of 2 HC with
3 C1C', &c., in which the hydrogen would stand to the chlorine in the
relation of a third, or of two-thirds, or of a fifth, or of a sixth, &c.
But with the tetrahydric model, corresponding to the formula H4C"",
and represented below, the successive displacement of the hydrogen of
marsh-gas in fourths, and in no other proportion, becomes perfectly
intelligible, thus : —
                      C1H.C        C1.H.C        C18HC        C1,C
      By the action of chlorine upon marsh-gas, there are produced in
 succession monochloromethene, in which one-fourth of the hydrogen
 is displaced by chlorine ; then dichloromethene, in which two-fourths
 of the hydrogen are displaced by chlorine ; then trichloromethene or
 chloroform, in which three-fourths of the hydrogen are displaced by
 chlorine; and lastly, tetrachloromethene, in which all four- fourths of
 the hydrogen are displaced by chlorine.      If, then, we take 1 relative
 part of hydrogen as the least indivisible proportion of hydrogen that
 can enter into a combination, it is evident that the molecule of marsh-
 gas must contain four such parts, or four combining proportions, or, in
 common parlance, four atoms of hydrogen.
      The case of ammonia is even more striking than that of marsh-gas.
  When we effect the substitution of some element or grouping for the
  hydrogen of ammonia, the substituted and remaining hydrogen are not
  related to one another in fourths, as happens with marsh-gas, but
  always in thirds. When, for instance, potassium is heated in ammonia,
  there is produced the compound known as potassamide, which consists
  of one combining proportion of potassium, and two combining propor
  tions of hydrogen — one-third of potassium and two-thirds of hydrogen
  — united with 14 parts by weight of nitrogen. Again, when ammonia
  is acted on by iodine, there is produced the very explosive body known
  as diniodamide, which consists of two combining proportions of iodine
  and one combining proportion of hydrogen — two-thirds of iodine and
  one-third of hydrogen — united with 14 parts by weight of nitrogen.
  While if we act upon ammonia by excess of chlorine, we obtain the
  highly-dangerous compound known as trichloramide or chloride of
  nitrogen, in which all the hydrogen of ammonia is replaced by chlorine.
   But the most satisfactory evidence of the trihydric character of am
  monia is afforded by Hofmann's experiments on the volatile organic

bases, in which he succeeded in replacing one-third, two-thirds, and
three-thirds of the hydrogen of ammonia by one and the same radicle,

     The composition of ethylamine       and diethylamine cannot possibly
be expressed    with  less than 14 parts by weight of nitrogen, whilst that
of ammonia     and  triethylamine  might  be represented with one-third of
that quantity, or with 4' 7 parts.     But all four bodies present such a
marked resemblance to one another, and such a regular gradation of
properties, as could not be the case unless their respective molecules
were strictly comparable in constitution.       For instance, their boiling
points and vapour-densities increase by a regular progression, accord
ing to the regular increase in the substitution of ethyl for hydrogen ;
whereas it is certain that the boiling point and vapour-density of a
body containing but one proportion of ethyl and 4- 7 parts of nitrogen
would bear no relation of series to the boiling points and vapour-
densities of bodies containing three proportions of conjoint hydrogen
and ethyl united with 14 parts by weight of nitrogen.          Moreover, by
adopting the trihydric model for ammonia, corresponding to the formula
H,N"', we perceive at once why the replacement of its hydrogen must
take place in thirds ; or, in other words, why we cannot obtain ammonias
in which one-half or one-fourth of the hydrogen is replaced by equi
valent substitution, but only those in which one- third or two-thirds is
so replaced ; thus : —

             ammonias are known to chemists in which two-thirds of the
hydrogen are replaced by one, and the remaining third of hydrogen by
some other radicle ; or in which all three thirds are replaced by three
different radicles, as instanced by diethyl-phenylamine EtjPhN'", and
methyl-ethyl-phenylamine MeElPhN'", for example.
     Seeing, then, that there are bodies, such as marsh-gas and silicated
hydrogen, of which the hydrogen is replaceable in fourths at four
successive stages, and which are consequently        represented with four
atoms of hydrogen ; and that there are other bodies, such as ammonia

and phosphoretted hydrogen, of which the hydrogen is replaceable
in thirds at three successive stages, and which are consequently repre
sented with three atoms of hydrogen, — it is not a priori improbable that
there may be yet other bodies, such as water and sulphydric acid, in
which the hydrogen is replaceable in halves at two successive stages,
and which must consequently be represented            with two atoms of
hydrogen.      If  we act upon water by excess of metallic sodium, for
instance, we obtain the compound known as oxide of sodium ; and
accordingly as we represent the molecule of water by the formula
HO', in which O' stands for 8 parts by weight of oxygen, or by the
formula H,O", in which O" stands for 16 parts by weight of oxygen, so
must we represent oxide of sodium by the formula NaO', or Na,O";
thus : —
                O'  = 8                              O" =  16

           (8)          Na 0'                    Na,O"
      But exactly intermediate between water and oxide of sodium, we
 have the very definite compound known as hydrate of sodium, which
consists of one combining proportion of sodium and one combining
 proportion of hydrogen united with 16 parts by weight of oxygen, and
 which cannot be represented save with 16 parts by weight of oxygen.
 Now, just as the three intermediate bodies between marsh-gas and
chloride of carbon force us to represent these extreme bodies with 12
 parts of carbon, so that all five may appear as members of one and the
same series ; just as the two intermediate bodies between ammonia and
 triethylamine force us to represent these extreme bodies with 14 parts
 of nitrogen, so that all four may appear as members of one and the
 same series ; so must the intermediate body between water and oxide
 of sodium force us to represent these extreme bodies with 16 parts of
 oxygen, so that all three may appear as members of one and the same
 series.    If marsh-gas and chloride of carbon must be represented by
 formulae similar to those of their intermediate bodies, and consequently
 with four atoms of hydrogen and chlorine respectively ; if ammonia
 and triethylamine must be represented     by formulae analogous to those
 of their intermediate bodies, and consequently with three atoms of
 hydrogen and of chlorine respectively ; then water and oxide of sodium
 must be represented by formulae analogous to that of their intermediate
 body, and consequently with two atoms of hydrogen and of sodium
 respectively. In the intermediate carbon-bodies, the remaining and
 replaced hydrogen form fourths of the whole ; in the intermediate
 nitrogen bodies, the remaining and replaced hydrogen form thirds of
  the whole ; while in the intermediate oxygen compound, the remaining
  and replaced hydrogen form halves of the whole.           Hence, if the
  molecule of marsh-gas is to be represented by a tetrahydric model, and

124                             Dr. W. Odling                     IMay IS,
that of ammonia by a trihydric model, then the molecule of            water
must be represented by a dihydric model ; thus : —
                                    *
                H,0"

When water is       acted upon by metallic sodium, one equivalent of
sodium expels one equivalent of hydrogen, to form the well-defined
body hydrate of sodium, and the action proceeds no further.              But
 when melted hydrate of sodium, at a temperature approaching that of
 redness, is acted upon by metallic sodium, a second equivalent of
 sodium turns out a second equivalent of hydrogen, to produce oxide of
 sodium. This replacement of the hydrogen of water by sodium at two
successive stages, — the first stage of replacement taking place at ordinary
 temperatures, and the second stage at a dull red heat, — is even better
 defined than the replacement of the hydrogen of ammonia by ethyl at
 three successive stages, and than the replacement of the hydrogen of
 marsh-gas by chlorine at four successive stages.
      But the formation of ether from water by Williamson's process,
 affords a still closer resemblance to Hofmann' s formation of triethy-
 lamine from ammonia. Water H,0", when acted upon by potassium,
 yields hydrate of potassium, or potassic water KHO".           Hydrate of
 potassium acted upon by iodide of ethyl yields alcohol, or ethylated
 water EtHO". Alcohol acted upon by potassium yields potassium-
 alcohol, or ethylated potassic water EtKO".       Potassium-alcohol acted
on by iodide of methyl yields the first mixed ether, or methylated ethyl-
 water EtMeO" ; and when acted upon by iodide of ethyl yields
 common ether, or ethylated ethyl-water Et,0".          None of the inter
 mediate bodies can be represented save with 16 parts of oxygen, and
 hence the terminal bodies being members of the same series, must be
 also represented with 16 parts of oxygen.          The intimate relations
 and analogies of ethylated methyl-water EtMeO" and diethylated water
 Et,0", as regards modes of formation, modes of decomposition, boil
 ing point, vapour-density, &c, will not allow the molecule of the
 mixed ether to be represented with 16 parts, and that of the common
 ether with only 8 parts of oxygen ; any more than the relations and
 analogies of ethyl-methyl-phenylamine EtMePhN'" and triethylamine
 Et,N" will allow the molecule of the former compound to be repre
 sented with 14 parts, and that of the latter with only 4-7 parts of
 nitrogen.
      With regard to chlorhydric acid, there is no intermediate stage in
 the replacement of its hydrogen ; the substitution taking place at once
 or not at all. We have, for instance, chloride of hydrogen HC1, chloride
 of ethyl EtCl, and chloride of sodium NaCl, but no intermediate

bodies ; whence the representation of chlorhydric        acid by the simple
uionhydric model, thus : —
                      HC1                            NaCl
    In addition to the above-mentioned chemical parallel, there is one
very remarkable physical relation subsisting between marsh-gas,
ammonia, water, and chlorhydric acid, namely, that all four molecules
occupy the same bulk.        Two cubic feet, for instance, of chlorhydric
acid-gas HC1, yield 1 cubic foot of hydrogen and 1 cubic foot of
chlorine.     Two cubic feet of steam H,O, yield 2 cubic feet of
hydrogen and 1 cubic foot of oxygen. Two cubic feet of ammonia
H,N, yield 3 cubic feet of hydrogen and 1 cubic foot of nitrogen ;
while two cubic feet of marsh-gas H4C, yield 4 cubic feet of hy
drogen and a quantity of carbon of which the gaseous volume has
not been and cannot be ascertained.          With equal volumes of all four
gases,  the  marsh-gas   contains  four times   as much, the ammonia three
times as much, and the steam twice as much hydrogen as the chlor
hydric acid.
     Many other arguments may be adduced to show that the mole
cular weight of water is 18, corresponding to the formula H,O", and
not 9, corresponding to the formula HO'.            Thus water is concerned
as the agent or product of some chemical reaction more frequently
than any other body with which chemists are acquainted ; but in no
well-defined reaction do we ever find the reacting or resulting water
expressible by 9 parts, or three times 9 parts, or five times 9 parts,
&c., but in every case by 18 parts, or some multiple of 18 parts, as
instanced    in the following examples, which might be increased in

       Again, in the great majority of direct compounds which water forms
  with other bodies, the combining water necessarily constitutes 18 parts,
  or some multiple of 18 parts ; and when two or more bodies differ from
  one another by the quantities of water they respectively contain, the
  differential quantity always amounts to 18 parts or some multiple of
  18 parts, thus : —

      Several chemists, during what may be termed the transitional stage
 of their views, were     accustomed to represent the molecule of water by
 the formula H,O'S, in which O' stands for 8 parts of oxygen, instead
 of by the formula H,O", in which O" stands for 16 parts by weight of
 oxygen.      But the use of this formula really showed an imperfect
 appreciation of the grounds upon which the abandonment of the
 simpler formula HO' was based ; for if the molecule of water is to
 be represented with two proportions of hydrogen, because its hydrogen
 is divisible into two parts, invertendo it must be represented with but
 one proportion of oxygen, because its oxygen is indivisible.         Now that
 the oxygen of water is indivisible is acknowledged alike by those who
 use the formula H,O" and those who use, or rather used, the formula
 H,O'8 ; and such being the case, the representation of the oxygen of
 water by the expression O', is quite unwarrantable, for the conception
 of two inseparable proportions of oxygen having each the value 8,
amounts after all to that of a single indivisible proportion of oxygen
having the value 16.
      That the oxygen not only of water but of all other well-defined
oxygenated molecules always amounts to 16 parts, or some multiple of
 16 parts, is abundantly evident.          For the composition alone of the
great majority of oxygenated bodies, prevents them from being repre
sented save with 16 or some multiple of 16 parts of oxygen, jugt as
the composition of chloroform prevents its being represented save
with 12 parts of carbon ; and as the composition of ethylamine prevents
its being represented save with 14 parts of nitrogen.           With regard to
the remaining oxygenated         bodies, their  mere  composition would allow
them    to be represented    with  only  8 or  some  odd multiple of 8 parts of
oxygen,    but  their   several  relations  to  other  bodies belonging to the
more numerous class prevents them from being represented with so

     all a quantity ; just as the relation of triethylamine to ethylamine
and diethylamine prevents it from being represented with less than
14 parts of nitrogen, though from its mere composition it might be
represented with only 4' 7 parts of nitrogen.
      From this it follows, that when two or more bodies differ in com
position from one another by the proportions of oxygen they respec
tively contain, that difference always amounts to 16 parts, or some
multiple of 16 parts, as shown in the following series : —
              HC1             HC1             Chlorhydric acid.
              H CI 0',        HC10"           Hypochlorous acid

              HCIC,           H CI 0".        Perchloric acid.
              C4KH40'.        CKH.O".         Acid succinate.

              C.KU.O',,       C.KH.O".        Acid tartrate.
      Throughout there is no difference of 8 parts of     oxygen or    of any
odd multiple of 8 parts of oxygen, between the              successive  com
 pounds.
      It follows also that whenever oxygen, with or without some other
 element, is added to or taken from a compound, the oxygen so added
 or eliminated must always be represented by 16, or some multiple
 of 16 parts, as instanced in the following decompositions, representing
 the liberation of oxygen from nitrate, permanganate, and chlorate of
 potassium respectively : —
                     KNO, =                 KNO,          + O"       or   O',

       Let  the decompositions be expressed how they may, the oxygen
 displaced cannot appear as 8 parts, or any odd multiple of 8 parts ; and
 ¦o in hundreds of other instances.
      The representation of the molecule of water by the formula 11,0
 was proposed by Gay-Lussac, advocated by Berzelius, and employed by-
  Davy more than fifty years ago.     Its revival is due to Gerhardt, who

 of chemistry, since brought to a higher state of development by the

The Rev. JOHN BARLOW, M.A. F.R.S. Vice-President, in               the Chair.
                     PROFESSOR     ROSCOE,   B.A. F.C.S.
       On  the  Direct Measurement of      the  Sun's Chemical Action.
THE life of the animal may be described chemically as a process of
oxidation : the tissues of his body are continually undergoing combus
tion ; he is constantly breathing out carbonic acid gas, and thus dete
riorating the ocean of air at the bottom of which he lives and moves ;
so that, were not a counteracting influence at work, he would, during
each moment of his existence, be working his own destruction.              This
counteracting influence is exerted by vegetables, whose life is chemically
characterised by a change opposite to that of the animal, that, namely,
of deoxidation or reduction. Animals take up oxygen and give off
carbonic acid ; plants reverse the process, they take up carbonic acid
and give off oxygen ; and thus the balance of atmospheric life is kept
always true.
  •
     The animal derives its power from the forces locked up in the

1863."]      on the Measurement of the Sun's Chemical Action.           129
vegetable organisms which constitute its food, and of which it builds
up its tissues.    When they are destroyed by the action of the atmospheric
oxygen, these forces become evident either in motion of the masses,
constituting mechanical action, or in the motions of the particles con
stituting heat, or other manifestations of energy. The animal cannot
create force ; he can only direct its application : he cannot move a
muscle without a certain given quantity of force being changed, without
a certain portion of his tissues undergoing oxidation, an amount which
is regulated by the grand principle of the conservation of force — so
that the total energy which the animal exhibits is regulated by the same
laws which apply to the work of the steam or electro-magnetic engine.
Every pound of carbon burnt to carbonic acid in the animal body
evolves heat enough to raise the temperature of 8080 lbs. of water
 1° centigrade, or can produce a mechanical effect sufficient to raise
2784 tons one foot high.
      The source of the power of the animal is evident : it lives upon the
force which has been accumulated by the plant. The animal world
cannot continually withdraw energy from the plant, unless the latter
receives as continual a supply.       The source of this energy is the sun ;
the plant sucks up or absorbs the rapidly vibrating solar radiations and
stores them up to be given out again in the various forms of energy
when the vegetable tissue is destroyed by oxidation.
      It is only in the presence of the sunlight that the true function of
 plant life can be exercised.       It is the sunlight which, acting on the
green colouring     matter  of leaves, decomposes the carbonic acid of the
air into its constituent elements, enabling the plant thus to assimilate
the carbon and to turn the free oxygen back into the air.
      Only those of the solar rays which vibrate the most rapidly are able
 thus to tear the particles of carbon and oxygen asunder, or to effect
chemical change ; and these most refrangible or violet rays have, there
fore, been called the chemical rays — not that there is any difference
 in kind between these and the other solar radiations ; they all differ
 only in wave-length and in intensity of vibration.
      These blue rays then, falling on the green portions of plants, are
 absorbed to do work ; their rapid vibrations are used up to set free
 the carbon and oxygen, and the heat equivalent to these absorbed
 vibrations is again given off when the carbon thus produced is burnt.
      The speaker illustrated the chemical activity of the blue rays, and
 the inactivity of the red rays, by showing that a bulb filled with
 chlorine and hydrogen explodes when exposed to an intense blue light,
 but is unacted upon by an equally bright red light.
      The measurement of the amount of these chemically active rays
 falling at a given time upon a given spot, must be of the highest
 meteorological interest, as their variation forms a most important
 element in the changing plant- and animal-producing power of a
 country.
      Three years ago (March 2, I860) the speaker brought forward the
  results of a series of experiments undertaken by Professor Bunsen and

  himself, for the purpose of obtaining a means of accurately measuring
 the chemical action of sunlight.
      The measure consisted in the quantity of hydrochloric acid formed
 by the action of light upon a mixture of equal volumes of chlorine and
 hydrogen gases.        The authors succeeded in arranging a most accurate
 and reliable chemical photometer, by help of which the laws regulating
 the chemical action of light were investigated, and the distribution of
 direct and diffuse sunlight upon the earth's surface determined when
 the sky is unclouded.*         The delicate nature of the instrument, which
 the sensitive substance rendered necessary, precludes the general use
 of this chlorine and hydrogen photometer, and the method is likewise
 inapplicable when we wish to measure the total effect produced by the
 varying cloud and sunshine of our changing climate.
      The object of the present research, carried on by Professor Bunsen
 and the speaker, has been to invent an easy and reliable mode of
measuring the daily variation in the sun's chemical intensity which
shall be applicable to regular meteorological registration.
      Thermometric observations, giving the mean monthly or yearly
temperature of a country, by no means yield all the data required for
the estimation of the true climatology of the place, or of its plant- and
animal-producing capabilities.           For this purpose we require to have
not only the amount of solar heat directly or indirectly reaching the
spot ; but likewise the amount of chemically active solar light which
falls there.     This is strikingly seen when we compare the mean an
nual temperature of Thorshavn (Faroe Islands) with that of Carlisle.
                                                                 Temp. Fab.   Diff.

In these two situations the mean annual temperature is nearly equal,
but the quantity of sunlight falling upon these two places differs most
widely, and we have a corresponding difference in the true climatologi-
cal relations. Owing to the constant moisture and cloudy state of the
atmosphere, which the sun's chemical rays cannot penetrate, the flora
of the Faroes and Shetlands is of the most limited description, only
the most hardy variety of shrubs and no trees flourishing ; whilst at
Carlisle we have the most luxuriant vegetation accompanying a more
sunny sky. Thus, too, the mean summer temperature of Rejkiavik in
Iceland is only 3°'8 Fah. below that of Edinburgh, whilst the difference
between the mean summer temperature of Edinburgh and London is
5°'4 Fah.       Yet in Iceland no tree grows ; whilst between London and
Edinburgh, we notice no marked difference as regards the development
of vegetable life. Hence we see that places upon the same isothermal
do not necessarily possess a truly corresponding climate ; this can only
be attained when, amongst other conditions, the places are situated
upon the curve of equal mean chemical intensity.

1863.]       m  the Measurement    of the Sun's Chemical Action.       131
     Although many fruitless attempts have been made to construct
photometers by a comparison of the blackness produced by sunlight
upon photographic paper, it was found that in this way the desired end
could be attained by attention to certain essential conditions.
     For this purpose it was necessary to construct an apparatus in
which photographic sensitized paper could be exposed to the sunlight
for definite times measured by small fractions of a second. This
instrument consists      essentially of a pendulum vibrating         about
j-seconds, by whose oscillation a sheet of darkened mica is withdrawn
from, and brought back over, a horizontal strip of paper prepared
with chloride of silver, and fixed in a constant position relative to the
pendulum and sheet of mica. The time during which each point in
the length of the strip is exposed is different, and the time of exposure
for each point can be calculated when the length and position of the strip,
and the duration and amplitude of the pendulum's vibration are given.
     The strip of sensitive paper presents, after exposure, a gradual
diminution of shade from dark to light, and for each shade the time
of exposure is known. In order that such a graduated strip may serve
as a means of measuring the chemical action of light, we require : —
     1. To know the relation existing between the several tints and the
intensity of the light necessary to produce such tints.
     2. To construct sensitive paper which shall always possess the
same degree of sensitiveness, and can easily be prepared when required.
     It was found, by a long series of experiments, that it was possible,
by adhering strictly to a certain method of manipulation, to prepare
standard papers which, when made, possess a constant degree of sensi
tiveness ; so that if the same light falls upon them, the papers are
always coloured to the same tint.
     Experiment likewise showed that the tint attained by such a paper
was constant when the quantity of light falling upon it also remained
constant ; so that light of the intensity 50 falling upon the paper for
the time 1, produced the same blackening effect as light of the inten
sity 1 falling upon it for the time 50.
     Knowing this law, which regulates the degree of shade of the
paper, and having a surface of a perfectly constant degree of sensitive
ness, it is easy to obtain absolute measurements of the chemical action
of light. For this purpose an arbitrary unit of measurement is chosen,
by making a standard tint or paint which can be easily and exactly
reproduced at any time.
     The quantity of light which shall, in a second or the unit of time,
produce a blackening effect on the standard photographic paper equal
to that of the standard tint, is said to have the chemical intensity 1.
If  the time needed to produce this same tint is found by experiment
with the pendulum-photometer to be 2 seconds, then the chemical
intensity is one-half, and so on.
     All that is needed, in order to obtain accurate measurements of
the chemical action of diffuse daylight or sunlight, is to be able to find
the time necessary to effect a blackening of the normal paper equal in
                                                                K 2

shade    to the standard tint.   This is done by means of the graduated
strip   made  in  the pendulum-photometer.
     For the purpose of accurately comparing these tints, the ordinary
daylight or even lamplight cannot be used, as a change would
thereby be produced on the sensitive paper.         A  light which does not
act chemically must be used ; such a light is the monochromatic soda-
flame.     The light from this flame possesses another advantage, namely,
that the unavoidable differences of colour are not seen ; variation in
shade alone being perceptible.       The speaker exhibited the accuracy of
this method of observing coincidence in shade by means of a large
model of the instrument.
     By help of this soda-flame the coincidence of shade of the gradu
ated strip with the standard tint can be read off with the greatest pre
cision. This fact, as well as the possibility of preparing a constant
sensitive paper, is seen by reference to the following tables, extracted
from the detailed paper printed in the Philosophical Transactions
for 1863.
     Papers variously prepared were exposed for the same time to the
same light.
     Each reading is the mean of several observations ; identity in the
numbers shows identity in the shade, and, therefore, the constant sensi
tiveness of the papers.
     The standard paper is prepared by soaking photographic paper in a
solution of common salt of given strength (3 to 100), and then allowing
it to lie upon the surface of a silver solution (12 KO8Ag to 100 of
water).      When the strength of salt solution varies, the sensitiveness
of the paper alters very rapidly. Variation in the strength of the
silver-bath produces, on the contrary, but little change in the sensitive
ness of the paper.       Different qualities of paper and alterations of
atmospheric moisture and temperature do not affect the sensitiveness
of the paper.

     All these papers were silvered in a solution containing                     12 parts    of

     In order to measure the chemical intensity of the daylight at any
time, all that is needed is to expose a strip of standard paper in the
pendulum-photometer for a given number of vibrations, and then to
find upon the strip, thus exposed, the point at which a shade equal to
the standard tint has been produced.                  Reference to a table gives the
time of exposure necessary to produce this tint, and the reciprocal of
this time represents the intensity of the acting light.                        If   the time
necessary were 3 seconds, the chemical intensity would be J ; if the
time were     i  second, the intensity would be 2.                 In this way curves of
daily chemical intensity were exhibited, which show the variation
caused by clouds, or by the changing altitude of the sun. These curves
show maxima and minima exactly corresponding to the appearance and
disappearance of the sun behind a cloud.                   The difference between the
sun's chemical intensity in summer and winter is thus also clearly
depicted.
     Based upon the principles of the pendulum-photometer, a much
simpler method of making these measurements has been arranged, as
follows.     A graduated strip made in the pendulum -photometer is fixed
in hyposulphite of soda, and pasted upon a board furnished with a
scale.    The shades of certain points on this fixed strip are compared
with the shades on given points upon a graduated strip prepared in the
usual way, and not fixed in hyposulphite.                       The fixed strip is thus
calibrated in terms of the unit of measurement, and it may then be
used as a means of measuring the chemical action of light.                              Small
pieces  of   the  standard    paper    are  then    exposed     for  a  given    time   to the
light which it is desired to measure, until the shade approaches that of
a part of the fixed strip.         The point of exact coincidence is then read
off by the soda flame as usual. In this way a piece of standard paper
of 1 square-inch of area will serve for 20 separate determinations, and
the whole arrangement for exposure may be carried in the pocket.

 on   May     15th, 1863, made with this small instrument, fully bears out the
 accuracy and ease with which these measurements can be made, and the
 results of his experiments induced the speaker to express a hope that
 before long these instruments may be introduced into meteorological
  observatories.
       The determination of the chemical brightness of the various por
 tions of the sun's disc is an interesting application of this new method
 of photometric measurements.
       By help of a camera placed on a 3-inch refractor, the speaker
 allowed the image of the sun — of about 4 inches in diameter— to fall
 upon the standard paper.               The sun-picture thus obtained presents in
 teresting features; in the first place, the chemical intensity of the
 central portions are 3-5 times as great as that of the portions on the
 limb.       A difference of this kind, in the case of the luminous and
 calorific rays, has already been observed by astronomers, and it is
 doubtless caused by the absorption effected by the solar atmosphere.
       The following results were obtained by measuring the chemical
 brightness at various points on the sun's disc, on May 9th, 1863 ; from
these numbers it will be seen that the luminous intensity varies very
irregularly.

      Bright patches of considerable area were seen on the picture ;
these patches, which were not caused by irregularity in the paper or in
the lenses, are probably owing to the presence of clouds in the luminous
atmosphere of the sun, and they may probably have some intimate con
nection with the well-known phenomena of the red prominences seen
during the solar eclipse.
      The speaker concluded by stating that he hoped, with the assist
ance of his friend Mr. Baxendell, to make a series of regular observa
tions of the variation of the chemical intensities of many points on the
sun's surface.

PROFESSOR MAX MULLER began by exhibiting four volumes of his
edition of the text of the Rig -Veda, together with the commentary of
Sayanacharya.      He stated that his attention had first been drawn to
the importance of this work when attending, in the years 1846 and
 1847, the lectures of the late Eugene Burnouf at the College de
France.     It was Burnouf, together with Dr. Goldstiicker, now Pro
fessor of Sanskrit at University College, who encouraged            him to
undertake the task of editing the Rig - Veda — a work which had never
been printed before either in India or in Europe, though it occupies
in the history of Sanskrit literature the same position which the Old
Testament occupies in the history of the Jews, the New Testament in
the history of modern Europe, the Koran in the history of Moham
medanism. After collecting the necessary materials at Paris, in the
 Library of the East India House in London, and in the Bodleian
Library at Oxford, he was enabled, through the patronage of the East
 India Company, to publish the first volume in 1849, the second in
 1853, and the third in 1856.      After the extinction of the political
powers of the East India Company, Government continued to sanction
the grant, and Her Majesty accepted the dedication of the fourth
volume, published in 1862.      This edition of the Rig -Veda contains,
besides the original text of the sacred hymns of the Brahmans, a com
mentary in Sanskrit by Sayanacharya.        This learned theologian wrote
about 1400 a.d., whereas the ancient hymns which he professes to
expound are referred to the fourteenth century R.C. His commentary
is a vast compilation from earlier works, some of which — as, for
instance, the Glosses of Yaska — date from the sixth century R.C.
     Veda, the name given by the Brahmans to the whole of their sacred
literature, means originally knowing, or knowledge, and is derived from
 the same root which appears in the Greek oloa, I know, the Gothic
 naif, I know ; the English to wit and wise.    It is considered, according
 to the theological views of the Brahmans, to have been divinely re
 vealed, and is distinguished under the name of Sruli (literally hearing)
 from all other works, which, however sacred and authoritative, are
 admitted to have been composed by human authors, and are compre
 hended under the name of Smriti, or tradition.        The Laws of Manu,
 for instance, are considered only as Smriti, and if on any point they
 could be proved to be at variance with a single passage of the Veda

136                        Professor Max Mutter                    [May 29,
they would at once be overruled.        In no country has the theory of
revelation been so minutely elaborated as in India ; and in order to
exclude as much as possible the human element, which, in the per
ception of divine truth by a human understanding, must come in at
some point or other, the Brahmans imagined a graduated scale of
beings intermediate between the divine and the human, participating
less and less in the divine, and more and more in the human nature,
till at last the original perception or vision of the inspired Rishis had
reached a purely human level, and had, without loss or injury, become
the property of ordinary mortals. The Veda, however, was not allowed
to enjoy for any length of time the undisturbed possession of these
carefully elaborated claims. The Buddhists and many other heretical
sects sprang up and denied the divine character of the Vedas, as well
as the sacred privileges of the Brahmans, which rested on the autho
rity of these works. They attacked the Vedas as " the incoherent
rhapsodies of knaves and buffoons ;" they denied
                                                       " that there was
                                                                        any
agreement     among the learned in the interpretation of revelation and
tradition ;" and they pointed to passages which even the Brahmans
themselves had been obliged to admit as meaningless or as interpolated.
In the third century B.C. Buddhism became the state religion of India
in the place of Brahmanism, and the Buddhists then claimed the same
inspired character for their own sacred books which the founders of
the religion of Buddha had so violently attacked when claimed by the
Brahmans in favour of the Veda. About the seventh century a.d.
a reaction took place.     Buddhism had to yield to Brahmanism, and at
the present moment there is no Buddhist left in India Proper ; while
the orthodox Hindu again believes that the Vedas were an immediate
revelation granted before the beginning of time to certain inspired
saints, and containing all that is necessary to his salvation.
     The Veda is not one single book. It comprises four collections of
hymns, called the Sanhitas of the Rig - Veda, the Yajur -Veda, the
S6ma - Veda, and the Atharva - Veda. The Atharva - Veda, though it
contains fragments of ancient poetry, is a collection of more modern
date. It contains chiefly incantations, magic spells, propitiatory hymns,
and large extracts from the other Vedas.     The earliest authorities speak
only of three Vedas, which are called the Trayt or Triad. Among these,
again, a great distinction must be made between the Rig- Veda on the
one side and the Yajur and Sdma Vedas on the other.            The last two
collections of hymns are mere prayer-books, arranged according to the
order of certain sacrifices, and intended to be used by certain classes
of priests : — the Rig- Veda is an historical collection.   There are four
classes of priests required for the performances of great sacrifices.
The first comprises the Adhraryns, or manual labourers who have to
prepare the sacrificial ground, to dress the altar, and slay the victim.
These, as being less educated, are only required to mutter certain
hymns and formulas, which hymns and formulas in the order in which
they are to be recited, are put together in what is called the Sanhita
of the Yajur - Veda. The Udgatars, or choristers, form the second
class, and the hymns which they have to chant are again put together

1863.]      on the Vedas, or the Sacred Books     of the Hindus.         137
in proper order in the Sanhitd of the Sdma - Veda. But while the
hymns to be muttered and chanted by these two classes of priests have
been carefully collected in two breviaries, the poetical portions, which
had to be recited by a third class, the Hotars, were not reduced to
the same form, but the Hotars had to learn by heart the whole of the
ancient sacred poetry that had been saved by oral tradition, and incor
porated in the books of the Rig - Veda. Many of these poems were
never intended for sacrificial purposes, and the Hotars had, therefore, to
learn from their sacrificial manuals which of these hymns and verses had
to be employed by them at certain parts of the sacrifices, while, at the
same time, they became the depositaries       of the whole of the popular
and sacred poetry of their ancestors.       Nearly all the poetical portions
which the other two classes of priests have to mutter or to chant are to
be found in the Rig - Veda, which is therefore to us the Veda par
excellence, and the only document in the earliest literature of India
which can claim an historical character. The fourth class of priests
are the Brahmans, properly so called, the overseers of the whole sacri
fice, who, while they generally remain silent spectators, have only to
interfere when any mistake has been committed. They must be ac
quainted with the duties of the other three classes of priests, and they
derive their knowledge chiefly from large prose treatises — hence called
the Brdk-'nanas, or the books of the Brahmans— in which the ritual
is explained in full detail, and old sayings are preserved to illustrate
the origin and the mysterious meaning of every part of the Vedic
sacrifices.
     The Rig - Veda — a collection resembling the Psalms, and, in some
 respects, the Percy Relics — is divided into ten books or Mandalas,
each supposed to have been the property of one of the great Brah-
 manic families of India.     It has been preserved to the present day by
oral tradition as well as by manuscripts.        Manuscripts, however, are
in India of very modern date ; and if the Rig- Veda claims to be the
oldest book in the literature of the Aryan race — older than Homer,
 the Zendavesta,    the Cuneiform Inscriptions,      Ennius, or Ulfilas — we
 want strong arguments in support of such claims. The speaker stated
 that he had himself entertained grave doubts as to the antiquity of the
  Veda, and that its preservation during a thousand years by means of
 oral tradition only was enough to stagger those who were acquainted
 merely with the literary history of Greece and Rome. Yet it is a fact
 that, even at present, candidates      for orders in India learn the Rig-
  Veda by heart, not from MSS., but from the mouth of a Guru under
 whose direction they spend the whole of their youth from the eighth to
 the thirtieth year.    They do nothing else during all that time but
 learn by heart ; and if we want to know how accurately the human
 memory can retain a whole literature — more accurately, in fact, than
 either paper or parchment — India, even at the present day, with the
 old system of Brahmanic discipline relaxed and breaking up, will
furnish the most startling evidence.        That the Veda is not quite a
modern forgery      can  be   proved  by  The  Travels of Hiotien-thsang, a
Buddhist pilgrim      who   travelled  from  China   to India in the years

138                      Professor   Max Muller                   [May 29,
629-645, and who, in his diary translated from Chinese into French
by Stanislas Julien, gives the names of the four Vedas, mentions some
grammatical forms peculiar to the Vedic Sanskrit, and states that at
his time young Brahmans spent all their time, from the seventh to the
thirtieth year of their age, in learning these sacred texts.        At the
time when Hiouen-thsang was travelling in India, Buddhism was
clearly on the decline. But Buddhism was originally a reaction against
Brahmanism, and chiefly against the exclusive privileges which the
Brahmans claimed, and which from the beginning were represented by
them as based on their revealed writings, and hence beyond the reach
of human attacks.       Buddhism, whatever the date of its founder,
became the state religion of India under As'oka, the Constantine of
India, in the middle of the third century R.C. This As'oka was the
third king of a new dynasty founded by Chandragupta, the well-known
contemporary of Alexander and Seleucus, about 315 B.C. The pre
ceding dynasty was that of Nandas, and it is under that dynasty that
the traditions of the Brahmans place a number of distinguished scho
lars whose treatises on the Veda we still possess. Thus, in the same
manner as the Septuagint translation proves the existence of the Old
Testament during the third century R.C., although the oldest Hebrew
 MSS. date only from the tenth century after Christ, so the works of
Katyayana in the fourth century R.C., which give us the number
of the hymns, the verses, words, and syllables of the Rig - Veda, prove
that at this time the Veda existed in exactly the same form in which
we possess it.     The number of hymns is 1028, that of the verses
varies from 10,402 to 10,622, that of the words is 153,826, that of the
syllables, 432,000. These Rabbinical studies on the Veda seem to
date from about 600 R.C., and they are embodied in works called
Sutras or threads, all composed in the most brief, enigmatic, and almost
algebraic style. This literature of Sutras is preceded by another class of
writings, the Brahmanas, composed in a very prolix and tedious style,
and containing lengthy lucubrations on the sacrifices and on the duties
of the different classes of priests.  Each of the three or four Vedas, or
each of the three or four classes of priests, has its own Brahmanas and
its own Sutras ; and as the Brahmanas are presupposed by the Sutras,
while no Sutra is ever quoted by the Brahmanas, it is clear that the
period of Brahmana literature must have preceded the period of the
 Sutra literature.   There are, however, old and new Brahmanas, and
 there are in the BraJimanas themselves long lists of teachers who
handed down old Brahmanas or composed new ones, so that it seems
impossible to accommodate        the whole of that literature in less than
two centuries, from about 800 to 600 R.C. Before, however, a single
 Brahmana could have been composed, it was not only necessary that
there should have been one collection of ancient hymns, like that
contained in the ten books of the Rig - Veda, but the three or
four classes of priests must have been established, the manual
labourers and the choristers must have had their special prayer-books,
and these prayer-books must have undergone certain changes, be
cause the Brahmanas presuppose         different editions or sahhas of each

  1863.]    on the Vedas, or the Sacred Books      of the Hindus.         139
 prayer-book.     Professor Mil Her supposes that the work of collecting
 the prayers for the different classes of priests, and of adding new
 hymns and formulas for purely sacrificial purposes, belonged to the
 tenth century R.C., and that three generations more would be required
 to account for the various readings adopted in the prayer-books by
 different sects, and invested with a kind of sacred authority previously
 to the composition of even the earliest among the Brahmanas.              If
 therefore the years from about 1000 to 800 R.C. are assigned to this
 collective age, the time before 1000 R.C. must be set apart for the free
 and natural growth of what was then national and religious, but not yet
sacred and sacrificial poetry.    How far back this period extends it is
impossible to tell ; it is enough if the hymns of the Rig - Veda can be
traced to 1000 R.C.
      Much in the chronological arrangement of the three periods of Vedic
literature that are supposed to have followed after that of the original
growth of the hymns must of necessity be hypothetical, and has been put
forward rather to invite than to silence criticism.     In order to discover
truth, the speaker remarked, we must be truthful ourselves, and must
welcome those who point out our errors as heartily as those who ap
 prove and confirm our discoveries. What seems, however, to speak
strongly in favour of the historical character of the three periods of Vedic
literature is the uniformity of style which marks the productions of each.
In modern literature we find, at one and the same time, different styles
of prose and poetry cultivated by one and the same author. A Goethe
writes tragedy, comedy, satire, lyrical poetry, and scientific prose ;
but we find nothing like this in primitive literature.       The individual
is there much less prominent, and the poet's character disappears in
the general character of the layer of literature to which he belongs.
It is the discovery of such large layers of literature following each
other in regular succession which inspires the critical historian with
confidence in the truly historical character of the successive literary
productions of ancient India.       As in Greece there is an epic age of
literature, where we should look in vain for prose or dramatic poetry ;
as in that country we never meet with real elegiac poetry before the
end of the eighth century, nor with iambics before the same date ;
as even in more modern times rhymed heroic poetry sets in in England
with the Norman conquest, and in Germany the Minnesanger rise and
set with the Swabian dynasty — so, only in a much more decided manner,
we see in the ancient and spontaneous literature of India, an age of
poets followed by an age of collectors and imitators, that age to be
succeeded by an age of theological prose writers, and this last by an
age of writers of scientific manuals.   New wants produced new supplies,
and nothing sprang up or was allowed to live, in prose or poetry, except
 what was really wanted.       If the works of poets, collectors, imitators,
theologians, and teachers were all mixed up together — if the Brahmanas
quoted the Sutras, and the hymns alluded to the BrdJimanas —an
historical restoration of the Vedic literature of India would be
almost an impossibility.       We should suspect artificial influences,
and look with small confidence on the historical character of such a

 140               Professor Max   Jfutter on the Vedcu.              [May 29,
literary agglomerate. The exact age of the Veda may be scarcely
less difficult to determine than that of the jawbone of Abbeville ; but he
who would question its antiquity must explain how the layers of litera
 ture were formed that are super-imposed over the original stratum of
 the poetry of the Rishis ; he who would suspect a literary forgery must
 show how, when, and for what purpose the 1000 hymns of the Rig- Veda
 could have been forged, and have become the basis of the religious,
moral, political, and literary life of the ancient inhabitants of India.
     Professor Muller concluded by reading some extracts from the
 Rig - Veda, and referred his audience to the second edition of his
History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature for further information on the
subject. He pointed out that the work of translating, or rather deci
 phering, the whole of the Rig- Veda would require many more years,
 and could only be achieved by the active co-operation of many scholars.
 The chief results hitherto obtained from the discovery of the Vedic
literature of India consist in the new and unexpected light which has
suddenly been shed on the earliest and darkest periods in the growth
of the human mind. The true and natural sources of religious faith
have been laid bare ; and the original character of polytheism, and
the spread of mythological phraseology among the ancestors of the
 Aryan race, have ceased to be matters of mere speculation, and have
entered into the domain of historical research.            As a relic of this
earliest age in the history of language and religion, the Veda stands
unparalleled in the literature of the whole Aryan race.                What in
Homer and Hesiod appears as a distant past is here still present, and
the childhood of our race is revealed to our eyes once more in clear
and simple outlines.      A result still more important is the help which
 missionaries in India have derived from the publication of the Veda
in their intercourse with the most learned and most influential among
the Brahmans.       As long as the Veda was unpublished, the Brahmans
maintained that whatever the missionaries told them was contained
in their Vedas. Now, the missionary can ask for chapter and verse,
and refute the Brahmans from their own bible.           To attack Brahman-
ism without a knowledge of the Veda was like attacking Mohammed
anism without a knowledge of the Koran.             The speaker finished by
expressing    his conviction that no country  is so  ripe for the introduction
of genuine Christianity as India. There are many things in the Veda
which, if properly explained, the Brahmans should be allowed, nay en
couraged, to hold fast.      But the present state of popular religion in
India is a mere anachronism, and an insult to the memory of the great
religious teachers whom India produced in the days of her greatness.
The most earnest and thoughtful among the Brahmans have them
selves begun to feel this ; and the conversion of one such man as the
excellent Nilakantha Goreh, the son of one of the most influential
Brahmans at Benares — a man who sacrificed everything for the sake of
Christ — is a sign of the times that ought to be as encouraging to our
missionaries abroad and their friends at home as the conversion of Saul
and the sufferings of the early Martyrs.

mian beds, or of the Hippurite limestone, and include no important
masses of other formations.         All these rocks are marine deposits; and
the first question to be considered with respect to the development of
mountains out of them, is the kind of change they must undergo in
being dried.       Whether prolonged through vast periods of time, or
hastened by heat and pressure, the drying and solidification of such
rocks involved their contraction, and usually, in consequence, their
being traversed throughout by minute fissures.           Under certain con
ditions of pressure, these fissures take the aspect of slaty cleavage ;
under others, they become irregular cracks, dividing all the substance
of the stone.      If   these are not filled, the rock would become a mere
heap of debris, and be incapable of establishing itself in any bold form.
This is provided against by a metamorphic action, which either arranges
the particles of the rock, throughout, in new and more crystalline con
ditions, or else causes some of them to separate from the rest, to
traverse the body of the rock, and arrange themselves in its fissures ;
thus forming a cement, usually of finer and purer substance than the
rest of the stone.        In either case the action tends continually to the
purification and segregation of the elements of the stone.        The energy
of such action depends on accidental circumstances.            First, on the
attractions of the component elements among themselves ; secondly,
on every change of external temperature and relation.         So that moun
tains are at different periods in different stages of health (so to call it)
or disease.     We have mountains of a languid temperament, mountains
with checked circulations, mountains in nervous fevers, mountains in
atrophy and decline.
     This change in the structure of existing rocks is traceable through
continuous gradations, so that a black mud or calcareous slime is im
perceptibly modified into a magnificently hard and crystalline substance,
enclosing nests of beryl, topaz, and sapphire, and veined with gold.
But it cannot be determined how far, or in what localities, these changes
are yet arrested ; in the plurality of instances they are evidently yet
in progress.     It appears rational to suppose that as each rock approaches
to its perfect type the change becomes slower ; its perfection being
continually neared, but never reached ; its change being liable also to
interruption or reversal by new geological phenomena.          In the process
of this change, rocks expand or contract ; and, in portions, their multi
tudinous fissures give them a ductility or viscosity like that of glacier-
ice on a larger scale.        So that many formations are best to be con
ceived as glaciers, or frozen fields of crag, whose depth is to be measured
in miles instead of fathoms ; whose crevasses are filled with solvent

flame,  with vapour, with gelatinous flint, or with crystallizing elements
of mingled natures ;  the whole mass changing its dimensions and flowing
into new channels, though by gradations which cannot be measured,
and in periods of time of which human life forms no appreciable unit.
     II. Formation. — Mountains are to be arranged, with respect to
their structure, under two great classes — those which are cut out of
the beds of which they are composed, and those which are formed by
the convolution or contortion of the beds themselves. The Savoy moun
tains are chiefly of this latter class.    When stratified formations are
contorted, it is usually either by pressure from below, which raises one
part of the formation above the rest ; or by lateral pressure, which reduces
the whole formation into a series of waves. The ascending pressure may
be limited in its sphere of operation ; the lateral one necessarily affects
extensive tracts of country, and the eminences it produces vanish only
by degrees, like the waves left in the wake of a ship. The Savoy
mountains have undergone both these kinds of violence in very complex
modes and at different periods, so that it becomes almost impossible to
trace separately and completely the operation of any given force at a
given point.
   The speaker's intention was to have analyzed, as far as possible, the
action of the forming forces in one wave of simple elevation, the Mont
Saleve ; and in another of lateral compression, the Mont Brezon : but
the investigation of the Mont Saleve had presented unexpected diffi
culty.    Its facade had been always considered to be formed by
vertical beds, raised into that position during the tertiary periods; the
speaker's investigations had, on the contrary, led him to conclude that
the appearance of vertical beds was owing to a peculiarly sharp and
distinct cleavage, at right angles with the beds, but nearly parallel to
their strike, elsewhere similarly manifested in the Jurassic series of
Savoy, and showing itself on the fronts of most of the precipices formed
of that rock. The attention of geologists was invited to the determin
ation of this question.
     The compressed wave of the Brezon, more complex in arrangement,
was more clearly defined.       A section of it was given, showing the
reversed position of the Hippurite limestone in the summit and lower
precipices. This limestone wave was shown to be one of a great series,
running parallel with the Alps, and constituting an unduiatory district,
chiefly composed of chalk beds, separated from the higher limestone
district of the Jura and lias by a long trench or moat, filled with
members of the tertiary series — chiefly nummulite limestones and flysch.
This trench might be followed from Faverges, at the head of the lake
of Annecy, across Savoy. It separated Mont Vergi from the Mont
Dorons, and the Dent d' Oche from the Dent du Midi ; then entered
Switzerland, separating the Moleson from the Diablerets ; passed on
through the districts of Thun and Brientz, and, dividing itself into
two, caused the zigzagged form of the lake of Lucerne.         The principal
branch then passed between the high Semis and the Glarnisch, and

1863.]      on the Forms    of the Stratified Alps of Savoy.            145
broke into confusion in the Tyrol. On the north side of this trench the
chalk beds were often vertical, or cast into repeated folds, of which the
escarpments were mostly turned away from the Alps ; but on the
south side of the trench, the Jurassic, Triassic, and Carboniferous beds,
though much distorted, showed a prevailing tendency to lean towards
the Alps, and turn their escarpments to the central chain.
    Both these systems of mountains are intersected by transverse valleys,
owing their origin, in the first instance, to a series of transverse curvi
linear fractures, which affect the forms even of every minor ridge, and
produce its principal ravines and boldest rocks, even where no distinctly
excavated valleys exist.    Thus, the Mont Vergi and the Aiguilles of
Salouvre are only fragmentary remains of a range of horizontal beds,
once continuous, but broken by this transverse system of curvilinean
cleavage, and worn or weathered into separate summits.
     The means of this ultimate sculpture or weathering were lastly to
be considered.
     III.  Sculpture. — The final reductions of mountain form are owing
either to disintegration, or to the action of water, in the condition of
rain, rivers, or ice ; aided by frost and other circumstances of tem
perature and atmosphere.
     All important existing forms are owing to disintegration, or the
action of water. That of ice had been curiously overrated. As an
instrument of sculpture, ice is much less powerful than water ; the ap
parently energetic effects of it being merely the exponents of disintegra
tion.    A glacier did not produce its moraine, but sustained and exposed
the fragments which fell on its surface, pulverizing these by keeping
them in motion, but producing very unimportant effects on the rock
below ; the roundings and striation produced by ice were superficial ;
while a torrent penetrated into every angle and cranny, undermining
and wearing continually, and carrying stones, at the lowest estimate, six
hundred thousand times as fast as the glacier.    Had the quantity of rain
which has fallen on Mont Blanc in the form of snow, (and descended in
the ravines as ice,) fallen as rain, and descended in torrents, the ravines
 would have been much deeper than they are now, and the glacier may
so far be considered as exercising a protective influence.    But its power
of carriage is unlimited, and when masses of earth or rock are once
 loosened,  the glacier carries them away, and exposes fresh surfaces.
 Generally, the work of water and ice is in mountain surgery like that
of lancet and sponge — one for incision, the other for ablution. No
 excavation by ice was possible on a large scale, any more than by a
stream of honey ; and its various actions, with their limitations, were
 only to be understood by keeping always clearly in view the great law
 of its motion as a viscous substance, determined by Professor James
 Forbes.
     The existing forms of the Alps are, therefore, traceable chiefly to
 denudation as they rose from the sea, followed by more or less violent
 aqueous action, partly arrested during the glacial periods, while the
                                                                 '

produced diluvium was carried away into the valley of the Rhine or
into the North Sea.      One very important result of denudation had not
yet been sufficiently regarded ; namely, that when portions of a thick
bed (as the Rudisten-kalk) had been entirely removed, the weight of
the remaining masses, pressing unequally on the inferior beds, would,
when these were soft (as the Neocomian marls), press them up into
arched conditions, like those of the floors of coal-mines in what the miners
called "creeps." Many anomalous positions of the beds of Spatangen-
kalk in the district of the Lake of Annecy were in all probability owing
to this cause : they might be studied advantageously in the sloping base
of the great Rochers de Lanfon, which, disintegrating in curved, nearly
vertical flakes, each a thousand feet in height, were nevertheless a mere
outlying remnant of the great horizontal formation of the Parmelan,
and formed, like  it, of very thin horizontal beds of Rudisten-kalk, im
posed on shaly masses of Neocomian, modified by their pressure.        More
complex forms of harder rock were wrought by the streams and rains
into fantastic outlines ; and the transverse gorges were cut deep where
they had been first traced by fault or distortion.       The analysis of this
aqueous action would alone require       aseries of discourses  but the sum

of the facts was that the best and most interesting portions of the
mountains were just those which were finally left, the centres and joints
as it  were of the Alpine anatomy.          Immeasurable periods of time
would be required to wear these away and to all appearances, during
                                             ;
the process of their destruction, others were rising to take their place,
and forms of perhaps far more nobly-organized mountain would witness
the collateral progress of humanity.

        An   Account     of   some Researches on       Radiant Heat.
IN his former researches on the radiation and absorption of heat by
gaseous matter, the speaker compared different gases and vapours at                 a
common thickness with each other     one part of his present object was
                                       ;
to compare different thicknesses of the same gaseous body with each

1863.]             on some Researches on    Radiant Heat.               147
other as to their action upon radiant heat.      A few years ago he would
be deemed a bold man who would attempt to measure the action of an
inch, or indeed of many feet of a gas, on radiant heat; but the present
experiments commence with plates of gas only O'Ol of an inch in thick
ness, and extend to thicknesses of 49'4 inches.         Thus, the greatest
thickness is to the least nearly in the ratio of 1 to 5000. The appa
ratus employed for the smaller thicknesses was a hollow cylinder, one
end of which was closed by a plate of rock-salt.         Into this fitted a
second cylinder, with its end also closed by a plate of the salt.       One
cylinder moved within the other like a piston, and by this means the
two plates of salt could be brought into flat contact with each other,
or could be separated to any required distance.      The distance between
the plates was measured by a vernier.       The cylinder was placed hori
zontal, being suitably connected with a source of heat.          This latter
consisted of a plate of copper, against which a steady sheet of flame
was caused to play.
      The absorption of radiant heat by carbonic oxide, carbonic acid,
nitrous oxide, and olefiant gas was determined with this apparatus, and
such differences as might be anticipated from former researches were
found.     Olefiant gas maintained its great superiority over the other
 gases at all thicknesses.   A layer of this gas, not more than O'Ol of an
 inch in thickness, intercepted about 1 per cent, of the total radiation ;
 and the delicacy of the apparatus may be inferred from the fact that this
absorption — great, relative to the thickness of the layer of gas, but
 small absolutely — corresponded to a deflection of 1 1 degrees of the
 galvanometer.      (It would be certainly possible to measure the action
 of a layer of this gas of less thickness than the paper on which these
  words are printed.)      A layer of olefiant gas, 2 inches in thickness,
  intercepts nearly  30  per cent. of the entire radiation.   The influence
  of a diathermic envelope surrounding a planet may be strikingly illus
  trated by reference to this gas. A shell of olefiant gas, 2 inches thick,
  surrounding the earth, would offer no appreciable hindrance to the
  solar rays in their earthward course ; but it would intercept, and in
  great part return, 30 per cent, of the terrestrial radiation : under such
  a canopy the surface of the earth would probably be raised to a stifling
  temperature. A layer of the gas, 3-10ths of an inch thick, intercepts
   11-5 per cent, of the whole radiation.        Such a layer, if diffused
  through a stratum of air 10 feet thick, would be far more attenuated
  than the aqueous vapour actually diffused through the air; still it
  would produce an absorption greater than that which the speaker had
  assigned to the atmospheric vapour within 10 feet of the earth's
  surface.   In the presence of such facts, the arguments which we might
   be disposed to base on the smallness of the quantity of atmospheric
   vapour are entirely devoid of weight.
       In measuring the action of larger thicknesses of gas, the following
   method was pursued : — A brass cylinder, 49'4 inches in length, had its
   two ends stopped with plates of rock salt, and a suitable source of heat
   placed at one end ; the rays from this source passed through the tube,

   148                        Professor   TyndaU                  [June  12,
  and were received by a thermo-electric pile placed at its opposite end l
   this radiation was exactly neutralized by the heat emitted from a cube
  of boiling water and incident on the opposite face of the pile. The
  interception of any portion of the heat emanating from the source by
  a gas or vapour introduced into the tube destroyed the equilibrium
  previously existing, and the amount intercepted was declared by the
  galvanometer.       The thickness traversed by the calorific rays was
  varied in the following way : — The tube was divided into two distinct
  compartments by the introduction of a third plate of rock salt.       Let
  us agree to call the compartment most distant from the pile thefirst
  chamber, and that adjacent to the pile the second chamber.            The
  experiments began with the first chamber short and the second
  chamber long, and ended with the first chamber long and the second
  chamber short. The alteration consisted solely in the shifting of the
  intermediate plate of salt, which lengthened      the first chamber and
  diminished the second one by the same quantity ; the sum of the
  lengths of both chambers being the constant quantity, 49'4 inches.
       The absorption effected in the first chamber acting alone was
  first determined ; then the absorption effected in the second chamber
  acting alone ; and, finally, the absorption effected when both the
  chambers were occupied by the gas or vapour. This arrangement
  enabled the speaker to check his experiments, and also to examine the
  effect of the sifting which occurred in the first chamber on the absorp
  tion of the second one. The thermal coloration of the various gases
  was rendered strikingly manifest by these experiments.       For the vast
  majority of the rays, for example, carbonic oxide and carbonic acid are
  transparent. Placing a stratum of carbonic oxide, 8 inches in length, in
  front of a column of the same gas, 41'4 inches long, these 8 inches
 intercepted 6 per cent, of the whole radiation ; placed behind a
 column, 41 '4 inches long, the absorption of the same 8 inches was
 sensibly nil. So also with carbonic acid ; 8 inches in front absorbed
 6i per cent., while placed behind the effect was almost zero. Similar
 remarks apply to the other gases, the reason manifestly being that
 when the 8-inch stratum is in front, it stops the main portion of the
 rays which give it its thermal colour, while, when it is placed behind,
 these same rays have been almost wholly withdrawn, and to the remain
 ing 94 per cent., or thereabouts, of the radiation the gases are sensibly
 transparent.
       An extension of this reasoning enables us at once to conclude,
 that the sum of the absorptions of the two chambers taken sepa
rately must always be greater than the absorption effected by
a single column of the gas of a length equal to the sum of the two
chambers.       This conclusion is illustrated in a striking manner by
the experiments ; and it is further found that when the mean of the sums
of the absorptions is divided by the absorption of the sum, the quotient
is sensibly the same for all gases.     It may also be inferred from con
siderations similar to the foregoing, that the sum of the absorptions must
diminish, and approximate to the absorption of the sum, as the two

 1863.]             on some Researcties    on Radiant Heat,              149
 chambers become more unequal in length, and that the sum of the
 absorptions of the two chambers is a maximum, when the medial rock-
 salt plate divides the long tube into two equal compartments.
      In these days a special interest attaches itself to the radiation of
any gas through itself or through any other gas having the same period
 of vibration.     The speaker referred to the results of an elaborate
 series of experiments on this interesting question.      The experimental
 tube, 49'4 inches long, was divided into two compartments by a parti
 tion of rock-salt. All external sources of heat were abolished, and the
 pile, furnished with its conical reflector, stood at the end of the tube.
 The compartment nearest the pile contained the gas which was to act
as absorber, while that most distant from the pile held the gas which
 was to act as radiator.   It is known that the destruction of the motion
of a sensible mass of matter is always accompanied by the evolution of
heat.    A weight falling to the earth, and a ball striking a target, are
 heated on collision.    The same is true for atoms, and in the present
experiments the gas in the radiating chamber was heated by the collision
 of its own particles against the inner surface of the tube when they
 rushed in to fill the vacuum. The radiation was, in fact, what the
speaker had named
                        " dynamic radiation."      The lengths of the two
chambers were varied, the radiating column being lengthened and the
absorbing one shortened at one and the same time ; the sum of both
was always the constant length 49-4 inches.
     The experiments with the vapours were thus executed.         Both the
chambers into which the tube was divided were, in the first place, oc
cupied by the vapour to be examined ; the usual pressure being l-60th
of an atmosphere.      The entrance of the vapour was so slow, and its
quantity so small, that the radiation due to the warming of the vapour
by its own collision was insensible.      The needle being at zero, dry air
was allowed to enter the chamber most distant from the pile.           This
air became heated dynamically, communicated its heat to the vapour,
and the latter immediately discharged the heat thus communicated to
it against the pile. It is quite evident, that not only does this case
resemble, but that it is actually of the same mechanical character as
that in which a vibrating tuning-fork is brought into contact with a
surface of some extent.      The fork, which before was inaudible, be
comes at once a copious source of sound.       What the sounding-board is
to the fork, the compound molecule is to the elementary atom.          The
tuning-fork vibrating alone     is in the  condition of the atom  radiating
alone, the sound of the one and the heat of the other being alike insen
sible.   But in association with sulphuric or acetic ether-vapour the
elementary atom is in the condition of the tuning-fork applied to its
sound-board, communicating through the molecule motion to the lumi-
niferous ether, as the fork through the board communicates its motion
to the air.
     The experiments demonstrate the great opacity of a gas to radia
tions from the same gas.      They also show in a very striking manner
the influence of attenuation in the case of vapour.         The individual

150                      Extra Evening Meeting.                   [June 23,
molecules of a vapour may be powerful absorbers and radiators, but in
thin strata they constitute an open sieve through which a large quan
tity of radiant heat may pass. In such thin strata, therefore, the vapours,
as used in our experiments, were generally found far less energetic than
the gases, while in thick strata the same vapours showed an energy
greatly superior to the same gases. The gases, it will be remembered,
were always employed at a pressure of one atmosphere.
     A few striking experiments were referred to in illustration of the
influence of a paper lining, or a coat of varnish or lampblack, within
the experimental tube. In dynamic radiation it is not possible to do
entirely away with the action of the interior surface of the tube itself.
When the tube is of brass and well polished within, the entrance of the
air produces a deflection of7'5 degrees, this being due to the emission
from the warmed surface of the tube.        A lining of paper two feet long
raises the radiation sufficiently to drive the needle through an arc of
80 degrees, while a ring of paper H inches long placed within the tube
radiates sufficient to urge the needle through an arc of 56 degrees.
     The speaker finally examined the diathermancy of the liquids from
which his vapours were derived, and the result leaves no shadow of a
doubt upon the mind, that both absorption and radiation are molecu
lar phenomena, irrespective of the state of aggregation.      If any vapour
is a strong absorber and radiator, the liquid whence it comes is also a
strong absorber and radiator. The molecule carries its power, or want
of power, through all its states of aggregation. The order of absorp
tion in liquids and vapours is precisely the same ; and the speaker
looked forward with hope to the application of these results to other
portions of the domain of thermotics.

A taper            by M. Donny (' Memoires de l'Acad^mie Royale de
Bruxelles,' 1843) makes known the fact hat in proportion as water
is deprived of air, the character of its ebullition changes, becoming

more    and   more abrupt, and boiling like sulphuric acid with snu-
bresauts,   and that between each burst of vapour the water reaches a
temperature above its boiling point. To effect this, it is necessary
that the water be boiled in a tube with a narrow orifice, through which
the vapour issues ; if it be boiled in an open vessel, it continually re
absorbs air and boils in the ordinary way.
     In my experiments on the decomposition of water by heat, found I
that with the oxy-hydrogen gas given off from ignited platinum plunged
into water, there was always a greater or less quantity of nitrogen
mixed ; this    I could never entirely get rid of, and  I was thus led into
a more careful examination of the phenomenon of boiling water, and
set before myself this problem — what will be the effect of heat on
water perfectly deprived of air or gas?
     Two copper wires were placed parallel to each other through the
neck of a Florence flask, so as nearly to touch the bottom, joining the
lower ends of these was a fine platinum wire, about       li inch long, and
bent horizontally into a curve. Distilled water, which had been well
boiled and cooled under the receiver of an air-pump, was poured into
this flask so as to fill about one-fourth of its capacity. It was then
placed under the receiver of an air-pump, and one of the copper wires
brought in contact with a metallic plate covering the receiver, the
other bent backwards over the neck of the flask, and its end made to
rest on the pump plate.      By this means, when the terminal wires from
a voltaic battery were made to touch, the one the upper and the other
the lower plate, the platinum wire would be heated, and the boiling
continued indefinitely in the vacuum of a very excellent air-pump.
The effect was very curious ; the water did not boil in the ordinary
manner, but at intervals a burst of vapour took place, dashing the
water against the sides of the flask, some escaping into the receiver.
(There was a projection at the central orifice of the pump-plate to
prevent this overflow getting into the exhausting tube.)
     After each sudden burst of vapour, the water became perfectly
tranquil, without a symptom of ebullition until the next burst took
 place.   These sudden bursts occurred at measured intervals, so nearly
equal in time, that, had it not been for the escape from the flask, at
 each burst, of a certain portion of water, the apparatus might have
served as a timepiece.
     This experiment, though instructive, did not definitely answer the
 question   I had proposed, as   I could not of course ascertain whether
 there was some minute residuum of gas which would form the nucleus
 for each ebullition ; and I proceeded with others. A tube of glass, 5 feet
long and -(',,ths inch internal diameter, was bent into a V shape ; into one
 end a loop of platinum wire was hermetically sealed with great care,
 and the portion of it in the interior of the tube was platinized.    ^Vhen
 the tube had been well washed, distilled water, which had been purged
 of air as before, was poured into it to the depth of 8 inches, and the
 rest of the tube filled with olive oil; when the V was inverted, the
 open end of the tube was placed in a vessel of olive oil, so that there

 160                         Mr. W. R. Grove                      [Jan.  22,
would be 8 inches of water resting on the platinum wire, separated
from the external air by a column of 4 feet 4 inches of oil.            The
projecting extremities of the platinum wire were now connected with
the terminals of a voltaic battery and the water heated ; some air was
freed and ascended to the level of the tube — this was made to escape
by carefully inverting the tube so as not to let the oil mix with the
water — and the experiment continued. After a certain time the boiling
assumed a uniform character, not by such sudden bursts as in the
Florence flask experiment, but with larger and more distinct bursts of
ebullition than in its first boiling.
     The object of platinizing the wire was to present more points for
tne ebullition, and to prevent soubresauts as much as possible.
     The experiment was continued for many hours, and in some repe
titions of it for days.    After the boiling had assumed a uniform cha
racter, the progress of the vapour was carefully watched, and as each
burst of vapour condensed in the oil, which was kept cool, it left a
minute bead of gas, which ascended through the oil to the bend of the
tube : a bubble was formed here which did not seem at all absorbed
by the oil. This was analyzed by a eudiometer, which       I will presently
describe, and proved to be nitrogen.      The beads of gas, when viewed
through a lens and micrometer scale at the same height in the tube,
appeared as nearly as may be of the same size.       No bubble of vapour
was condensed completely, or without leaving this residual bubble. The
experiment was frequently repeated, and continued until the water was
so nearly boiled away, that the oil, when disturbed by the boiling,
nearly touched the platinum wire; here it was necessarily stopped.
     To avoid any question about the boiling being by electrical means,
similar experiments were made with a tube, without a platinum wire,
closed at its extremity, and the boiling was produced by a spirit-lamp.
The effects were the same, but the experiment was more difficult and
imperfect, as the bursts of vapour were more sudden, and the duration
of the intervals more irregular.
     The beads of gas were extremely minute, just visible to the naked eye,
but were made visible to the audience by means of the electric lamp.
     In these experiments there was no pure boiling of water, i. e. no
rupture of cohesion of the molecules of water itself, but the water was
boiled, to use II. Denny's expression, by evaporation against a surface
of  gas.
     It is hardly conceivable that air could penetrate through such a
column of oil, the more so as the oil did not perceptibly absorb the
nitrogen freed by the boiling water and resting in the bend of the tube ;
but to meet this conjectural difficulty, the following experiment was
made.     A tube, 1 foot long and f\iths inch internal diameter, bent into
a slight angle, had a bulb of J-inch diameter blown on it at the angle ;
this angle was about 3 inches from one end and 9 from the other ; a
loop of platinum wire was sealed into the shorter leg, and the whole tube
and bulb filled with and immersed into
                                            mercury ; water, distilled and
purged of air as before, was allowed to fill the short leg, and bv care

fully adjusting the inclination, the water could be boiled so as to allow
bubbles to ascend into the bulb and displace the mercury.       The effect
was the same as with the oil experiment, no ebullition without leaving
a bead of gas ; the gas collected in the bulb, and was cut off by what
may be termed a valve of mercury, from the boiling water, then
allowed to escape, and so on ; the experiment was continued for many
days, and the bubbles analyzed from time to time; they proved, as
before, to be nitrogen; and, as before, continued indefinitely.
     A similar experiment was made without the platinum wire, and
though, from the greater difficulties, the experiment was not so satis
factory, the result was the same.
     As the mercury of the common barometer will keep air out of its
vacuum for years, if not for centuries, there could be no absorption
here from the external atmosphere, and I think I am fairly entitled to
conclude from the above experiments — which I believe went far beyond
any that have been recorded — that no one has yet seen the phenomenon
of pure water boiling, — i.e. of the disruption of the liquid particles cf
the oxy-hydrogen compound so as to produce vapour which will, when
condensed, become water, leaving no permanent gas.        Possibly, in my
experiment of the decomposition of water by ignited platinum, it may
be that the sudden application of intense heat, and in some quantity,
so forces asunder the molecules that, not having sufficient nitrogen
dissolved to supply them with a nucleus for evaporation, the integral
molecules are severed, and decomposition takes place.      If  this be so,
and it seems to me by no means a far-fetched theory, there is probably
no such thing as boiling, properly so called, and the effect of heat on
liquids in which there is no dissolved gas may be to decompose them.
     Considerations such as these led me to try the effect of boiling on
an elementary liquid, and bromine occurred as the most promising one
to work upon ; as bromine could not be boiled in contact with water,
oil, or mercury, the following plan was ultimately devised.        A tube,
4 feet long :ind -u,ths inch diameter, had a platinum loop sealed into
one closed extremity ; bromine was poured into the tube to the height
of 4 inches ; the open end of the tube was then drawn out to a fine
point by the blow-pipe, leaving a small orifice; the bromine was then
heated by a spirit-lamp ; and when all the air was expelled, and a jet
of bromine vapour issued from the point of the tube, it was sealed by
the blow-pipe.     There was then, when the bromine vapour had con
densed, a vacuum in the tube above the bromine.       The platinum loop
was now heated by a voltaic battery, and the bromine boiled : this was
continued for some time, care being taken that the boiling should not
be too violent.   At the end of a certain period — from half-an-hour to
an hour  — the platinum loop gave way, being corroded by the bromine ;
the quantity of this had slightly decreased.     On breaking off, under
water, the point of the tube, the water mounted and showed a notable
quantity of permanent gas, which on analysis proved to be pure oxygen.
 As much as a quarter of a cubic inch was collected at one experiment.
The platinum wire, which had severed at the middle, was covered with

 voltaic spark in oxygen in a small tube over lime-water ; it seemed to
 give a slight opalescence to the liquid, but the quantity was so small
 that the experiment was not to be relied on.        No definite change was
 perceptible in the bromine ; it seemed to be a little darker in colour
 and had a few black specks floating in        whichit,judged to be minute

 quickly acted on than with the bromine, and the glass of the tube
 around  it  to some extent.
      Melted phosphorus was exposed to the heat of the voltaic dis
ruptive discharge     by taking this between platinum points in       tube of     a
phosphorus, similarly to an experiment of Davy's, but with better
means of experimenting         ;  considerable quantity of phosphuretted
                                   a
hydrogen was given off, amounting in several experiments to more than
a cubic inch.
     A similar experiment was made with melted sulphur, and sul
 phuretted hydrogen was given off, but not in such quantities as the
phosphuretted hydrogen.        I  tried in vain to carry on these experi
ments beyond      a  certain point    the substance became pasty, mixed
                                       ;
with platinum from the arc, and from the difficulty of working with
the same freedom as when they were fresh, the glass tubes were always
 broken after     acertain time.   Had      time for working on the subject

bubble of oxyhydrogen gas is freed and disseminated through the
vapour, recombination being probably prevented by this dilution ; but,
however long the experiment may be continued, no increased quantity
of the gas is obtained, all beyond this minute quantity being recom-
bined.    If, however, the bubble of gas be collected, by allowing the
vapour to cool, and then expelled, a fresh portion is decomposed, and
so on.
    So with the phosphorus in the experiments in the air-pump and
with the burning-glass ; if any gas is liberated it is probably imme
diately recombined with the phosphorus ; possibly a minute residuum
might escape recombination, but the circumstances of the experiment
did not admit of this being collected, as the gas was with the aqueous
vapour.
    When, on the other hand, the gas freed is immediately cut off from
the source of heat, as when the spark is taken in liquids, an indefinite
quantity can be obtained.
    Decomposition and the elimination of gas may thus take place by
the application of intense heat to a point in a liquid, or also in gas or
vapours ; but, in the latter case, it is more likely to be masked by the
quantity of gas or vaponr throngh which it is disseminated.
    I  believe there are very few gases in which some alteration does
not take place by the application of the intense heat of the voltaic arc
or electric spark.   If  the arc be taken between platinum points in dry
oxygen-gas over mercury, the gas diminishes indefinitely, until the
mercury rises, and by reaching the point where the arc takes place,
puts an end to the experiment.      I  have caused as much as a cubic inch
of oxygen to disappear by this means.        I at one time thought this was
due to the oxidation of the platinum ; but the high heat renders this
improbable, and the deposit formed on the interior of the glass tube in
which the experiment is made has all the properties of platinum -black ;
so if the spark from a Ruhmkorf coil be taken in the vapour of water
for several days, a portion of gas is freed which is pure hydrogen, the
oxygen freed being probably changed into ozone, and dissolved by the
water in this case, while in the former it combined with the mercury.
     I have alluded to the eudiometer by which         I analyzed the gases
obtained in these experiments ; it was formed simply of a tube of glass,
frequently not above 2£ millimetres in diameter, with a loop of wire
hermetically sealed into one end, the other having an open bell-mouth.
By a platinum wire a small bubble of the gas to be examined could be
got up through water or mercury into the closed end of the tube, and
by the addition of a bubble of oxygen or hydrogen gas, a very accurate
analysis of very minute quantities of gas could be made :       I have ana
lyzed by this means quantities no larger than a partridge-shot.
     I need hardly allude to results on the compound liquids, such as
oils and hydrocarbons, as the fact that permanent gas is given off in
boiling such liquids would not be unexpected ; but the above experi
ments seem to show that boiling is by no means necessarily                the
phenomenon      that has  generally   been  supposed,   viz. a separation  of

(except   with  the metals,  on which   there  is no evidence) no one has
seen the phenomenon       of pure boiling without permanent gas being
freed, and that what is ordinarily termed boiling arises from the extri
cation of a bubble of permanent gas either by chemical decomposition
of the liquid, or by the separation of some gas associated in minute
quantity with the liquid, and from which human means have hitherto
failed to purge it; this bubble once extricated, the vapour of the
liquid expands       or, to use the appropriate phrase of M. Donny, the

     The circumstances of the experiments with bromine, phosphorus,

done with water, but as far as       went the result was similar.

     When an intense heat, such as that from the electric spark or
voltaic arc,     isapplied to permanent gas, there are, in the greater
number of cases, signs either of chemical decomposition or of molecular
change ;   thus compound gases, such as hydrocarbons, ammonia, the
oxides of nitrogen, and many others are decomposed.             Phosphorus in
vapour     ischanged to allotropic phosphorus, oxygen to ozone, which,
according to present experience, may be viewed as allotropic oxygen.
There may be many cases where, as with aqueous vapour,                    small             a

     All these facts show that the effect of intense heat applied to
liquids and  gases is much less simple, and presents greater interest to
the chemist than has generally been supposed.        In far the greater
number of cases, possibly in all, it is not mere expansion into vapour
which is produced by intense heat, but there is a chemical or mole
cular change.       Had circumstances permitted             I    should have carried
these experiments further, and endeavoured                  to find an experimentum
cruets on the subject.          There are difficulties with such substances as
bromine, phosphorus, &c., arising from their action on the substances
used to contain and heat them, which are not easy to vanquish, and
those who may feel inclined to repeat my experiments will find these
difficulties greater than they appear in narration ; but I do not think
they are insuperable, and hope that, in the hands of those who are
fortunate enough to have time at their disposal, they may be overcome.

 wire was placed in      a   larger tube of oil, to lessen the risk of cracking
 the glass. After some days' experimenting, though the sealing remained
 perfect,  a   slight portion of carbon was found in the interior liquid.

 hydrogen     on  the   air dissolved    in the water. After         atime the deflection
 abated, and the needle returned to zero, all the oxygen of the air

Amongst      the circumstances that have profoundly influenced the pre
sent physical condition of our earth, the action of ancient glaciers upon
a  scale of almost inconceivable magnitude has been gradually but
irresistibly forcing itself upon the notice of philosophers since their
attention was first called to                   by
                                   Venetz and Esmark.

by the snows of winter.     In our own country the researches of Buck-
land, and especially of Ramsay, have clearly shown that the Highlands
of Scotland, the mountains of Wales and Cumberland, and the lime
stone crags of Yorkshire, abound in these roches moutonnts,        which
leave no doubt that the valleys of those mountain ranges were once
filled with glaciers of dimensions unsurpassed, if even equalled, by
those which at the present day stream down the sides of their gigantic
Swiss rivals.   Nor was this perpetual ice of a former age confined to
localities where no such phenomenon is now seen, but numerous obser
vations have established that the glaciers of the present age, existing
in Switzerland, Norway, and elsewhere, are but the nearly dried-up
streamlets   of ancient ice rivers of enormous size.      These glaciers
have eroded the Alpine valleys, of which they once held possession,
have carved out the lochs and kyles of Scotland, as well as the
grander fjords of Norway, and have contributed in a most essential
manner to the present aspect of our mountain scenery.            Ramsay
and Tyndall have recently called attention to this action of ancient
glaciers, and have contended with considerable plausibility,           the
former that the lake basins, the latter that the valleys of the
Alps, have been thus, in great part, scooped out. In no part of the
world, perhaps, can the phenomena of the glacial epoch be more
advantageously studied than in Norway, where the ice-scarred coasts
and fjords are still fully exposed    to the eye of the observer, side
by side with the ocean, which furnished the crystalline material
that formerly covered them.       Two thousand miles of coast, from
Christiania   to the North Cape, afford almost uninterrupted evi
dence of the vast ice operations which, during the epoch in question,
moulded nearly every feature of this remarkable country.         Starting
from Christiania, the traveller cannot fail to remark the peculiar
appearance of the gneiss and granite rocks composing the coast, as
well as the innumerable islands which, forming a great natural break
water, protect the shore from the heavy seas rolling in from the
Atlantic. These rocks, here rarely rising to the height of 800 or
900 feet, present nothing of that sharp and rugged outline which
generally characterizes such formations. On the contrary, they are
smoothed even to their summits, all their angles worn off, and every
trace of boldness and asperity effaced.  To the casual and uninstructed
observer the action of the sea suggests itself as a sufficient cause of
these appearances ; but it does not require much scrutiny to be con
vinced that the ocean waves have had little to do with this smooth
ing and polishing of the coast, since it is the surfaces sloping towards
the land that are most acted upon, whilst in some places, where the
rock descends precipitously towards the sea, and is subject to the dash
of the waves, it has been protected from the abrading action, and
presents merely a weathered surface.
     Rounding the promontory of the Naze and proceeding northward,
the coast presents, with slight exceptions, the same general features
until the Arctic circle is approached, when the character of the scenery

rather suddenly changes.         The rocky hills acquire the dignity of
mountains, and tower up in rugged, sharp, and fantastic peaks, con
trasting strongly with the rounded summits of the lower latitudes.
But these arctic peaks owe their immunity from the abrading action of
ice solely to their height ; around their bases, and even high up their
sides, the slow surges of the moving glacial sea have made their
 unmistakable marks, grinding, and even undercutting, them into most
extraordinary forms, as fine instances of which may be mentioned the
Seven Sisters, and Torghatten, with its singular tunnel, just south of
the Arctic circle ; the Horseman, standing on the circle ; and the moun
tains of the Folden and Vestfjords, north of it ; the latter having been
justly described by the Rev. R. Everest, as resembling the jaws of an
immense shark.*
     To account for the advent and subsequent disappearance of such
vast masses of ice, various hypotheses have been propounded.              It has
been suggested that the temperature of space is not uniform, and that
our solar system, in performing its proper motion among the stars,
sometimes passes through regions of comparatively low temperature :
according to this hypothesis, the glacial epoch occurred during the
passage of our system through such a cold portion of space.                Some
have imagined that the heat emitted by the sun is subject to variation,
and that the glacial epoch happened during what may be termed a cold
solar period.      Others, again, believe that a different distribution of
land and water would render the climate of certain localities colder
than it is at present, and would thus sufficiently account for the phe
nomena of the glacial epoch.        Finally, Professor Kamtz considers that
at the time of the glacial period the mountains were much higher 'than
at present — Mount Blanc 20,000 feet for instance — the secondary and
tertiary formations having been since eroded from their summits.
     The two last assumptions are attended with formidable geological
difficulties, especially when it is considered that the phenomena of the
epoch in question extended over the entire surface of the globe ; they
have therefore never acquired more than a very partial acceptance.
With regard to the two first-named hypotheses, my colleague, Professor
Tyndall, has recently shown that they are founded upon an entirely
erroneous conception of the conditions necessary to the phenomena
sought to be explained. The formation of glaciers is a true process of
distillation, requiring heat as much as cold for its due performance.
The produce of a still would be diminished, not increased, by an
absolute reduction of temperature. A greater differentiation of tem
perature is what is required to stimulate the operation into greater
activity. Professor Tyndall does not suggest any cause for such exalted
differentiation during the glacial epoch ; but he proves conclusively
that both hypotheses, besides being totally unsupported by cosmical

facts, are not only incompetent to constitute such a cause, but also
assume a condition of things which would cut off the glaciers at their
source, by diminishing the evaporation upon which their existence
essentially depends.
     The speaker divided the great natural glacial apparatus into three
parts — viz. the evaporator, the condenser, and the receiver.                   The
 part performed by the ocean as the evaporator is too obvious to need
description.     The two remaining portions of the apparatus, however,
are generally confounded with each other.                The mountains are in
reality the receivers, or icebearers, and are only in a subordinate sense
condensers.      The true condenser is the dry air of the upper region of
the atmosphere, which permits of the free radiation into space of the
heat from aqueous vapour.*
     All the hypotheses hitherto propounded having therefore failed,
in the light of recent research, to account for the conditions which
brought about the glacial epoch, the speaker felt less reluctance in
advancing a new theory, which had gradually elaborated itself out
of the impressions he had received during a recent visit to Norway.
 Any such theory must take cognizance of the following points in the
 history of the glacial epoch.          1st, That its effects were felt over the
entire globe. 2nd, That it occurred at a geologically recent period.
 3rd, That it was preceded by a period of indefinite duration, in which
glacial action was either altogether wanting, or was at least com
paratively insignificant.       4th, That during its continuance atmospheric
precipitation was much greater, and the height of the snow-line con
siderably less than at present.        5th, That it was followed by a period
 extending to the present time, when glacial action became again insig
nificant.
     All these conditions he believed to be the natural sequences of
 the gradual secular cooling of the surface of our globe. The sole cause
of tke filteiiouitna of the glacial epoch was a higher temperature of the
ocean than that which obtains at present.
     He then examined the grounds upon which this hypothesis is based.
Numerous observations of the augmentation of temperature, at in
creasing depths from the surface of the earth, no longer leave room
for doubt that the vast mass of materials constituting the interior of
our globe is at the present moment at a temperature far higher than
that of the surface.       If  this be so, the conclusion is almost inevitable,
that at earlier periods of the earth's history this high temperature
must, at all events at depths comparatively little removed from the
surface, have been still higher, and that consequently the temperature
of the surface itself must in former ages have been much more in-

jet of dry steam to pass in front of, and at a distance of two feet from, a thermo
electric pile; the galvanometer connected with the latter promptly showed a large
deflection  for heat, proving that the pile was receiving radiant heat from the
aqueous vapour.     A jet of air heated in the same manner and projected in front of
the pile produced no such effect.

 fluenced    by the internal heat than is the case at the present day.
 Tracing   thus back the thermal history of our earth, it is conceivable
 that the waters of the ocean once existed as aqueous vapour in our
 atmosphere — a condition which it is imagined obtains at the present
 day in Jupiter, Venus, and other planets, whose superior size or closer
 proximity to the sun may be supposed to have retarded the refrigera
 tion of their surfaces.    From the period, therefore, when the cooling
 of the earth's crust permitted the ocean to assume the liquid condition,
 its waters have gradually cooled from the boiling point down to the
 present temperature, whilst the land has also undergone a similar pro
 cess of refrigeration.    It was during the later stages of this cooling
 operation that the glacial epoch occurred. For this assumption, how
 ever, it is necessary to establish that the rate of cooling of the land
 and of the ocean surfaces was unequal, otherwise the more rapid
 evaporation of the ocean due to increased temperature would be more
 or less neutralized by the impaired efficiency of the proportionately warm
 icebearers.    The speaker then proceeded to describe the results of his
 numerous experiments, which conclusively proved that, under the con
 ditions contemplated, the land would cool more rapidly than the sea.
 This effect is brought about principally by two causes, viz. the
 great specific heat of water compared with granite and other rocks,
 and the comparative facility with which radiant heat escapes from
 granite through moist air. The amounts of heat associated with equal
 weights of water and granite are as 5 to 1 in favour of the former, or,
if equal volumes be taken, the water requires to lose twice as much
heat as the granite in order to cool through the same number of
degrees : but it is in regard to the escape of radiant heat from their
surfaces that the superior retention of warmth by the oceanic waters
is most strongly marked.         The readiness with which radiant heat
escapes from equal surfaces of water and granite at the same tempera
ture through perfectly dry air is nearly equal ; but so soon as aqueous
vapour is interposed in the path of these rays, the conditions become
wonderfully altered ; the escape of heat from both is interrupted, but
its radiation from the water is retarded in by far the greatest degree.
This extraordinary intranscalency of aqueous vapour to rays issuing
from water has just been conclusively proved in the physical laboratory
of this Institution by researches made by Professor Tyndall, and not
yet published.      The difference between granite and water arising
from this cause becomes vastly augmented when it is considered
that the icebearing surfaces occupy an elevated position above the
level of the sea, consequently the mantle of aqueous vapour which
their radiant heat had to penetrate must have been much more at
tenuated than the comparatively dense shell lying between them and
the surface of the ocean.     Thus the obscure rays of heat streamed into
space from the icebearing surfaces with comparatively little inter
ruption, whilst the radiation from the sea was as effectually retarded
as if the latter had been protected with a thick envelope of non
conducting material.

     Whether we take into consideration, therefore, the conductivity of
water and granite, their specific heats, or, finally, the respective facili
ties with which they can, under the cosmical conditions contemplated,
throw off their heat into space, we find everywhere a state of things
tending much more to the conservation of the heat of the water than to
the retention of that of the land ; and this of course applies also, muta-
lii mutandis, to the retention of that heat which is received from solar
radiation.     The luminous heat-rays of the sun pass freely through
aqueous   vapour,    and are absorbed by both granitic and oceanic surfaces,
but, once absorbed, these rays issue forth again as obscure heat of two
different qualities, or rates of vibration.              To use Tyndall's beautiful
explanation of the phenomenon, the vibrations of the liquid water
molecules are of such rapidity as can be best taken up and absorbed
by the same molecules in the vaporous condition.                  But granite is a very
complex substance, and fewer of the heat oscillations of its atoms are in
unison with those of aqueous vapour : hence the heat vibrations of
granite disturb       the molecules of aqueous vapour in their passage
through the atmosphere in a less degree, and consequently the granitic
rays are less absorbed.
     Thus, whilst the ocean retained a temperature considerably higher
 than at present, the icebearers had undergone a considerably greater
refrigeration.    The evaporation from the ocean would therefore, at the
period contemplated, be greater than it is at present, whilst the capa
bilities of the icebearers,        as such, would not be perceptibly less.
Moreover,    it is   evident   that,    during the whole of the cooling period,
the ocean must have been receiving heat from its floor, and thus have
acted as a carrier of warmth from the comparatively profound portions
of the earth's crust to the oceanic surface.               It thus resembled a mass
of water contained in an evaporating basin, placed over a very slow
and   gradually declining fire. Under such conditions its cooling was
protracted   through a vast period, allowing sufficient time, between a
temperature inimical to animal life and the commencement                        of the
glacial epoch, to permit of the development and decay of those forms
of animal life which existed in the preglacial seas.
     The rate of evaporation of water at different temperatures and
under various circumstances was determined by Dalton, whose results
 are embodied     in the following table.            The evaporation took place in
 each case from a circular surface 6 inches in diameter : —

172                        Professor  Frankland                    [Jan. 29,
We have no sufficient data to calculate     the present mean temperature
of the ocean, but in lat. 69° 40' off the   coast of Norway, at noon on a
remarkably hot summer's day, Professor Forbes found the temperature
to be 46'5° Fahr.      The assumption of 40° Fahr. as the mean tempera
ture off the coast of Norway, would therefore probably be in excess
of the truth. Now taking the mean cf Dalton's results obtained at
35° and 45°, and comparing it with the mean of his results at 55° and
65°, it will be seen that an increase of 20° in the temperature of the
ocean off the coast of Norway would double the evaporation from a
given surface.       Such an increased evaporation, accompanied         as it
necessarily    must be by a corresponding precipitation, would suffice
to supply the higher portions of the land with that gigantic ice-
burthen which groaned down the mountain slopes during the glacial
epoch.
      But would not the increased oceanic temperature tend to augment
the mean temperature of the atmosphere           even at considerable ele
vations, and thus raise the snow-line and reduce the area of perpetual
snow ? In answering this question, the speaker showed that the limit
of perpetual snow does not depend so much upon the mean temperature
of the atmosphere at that particular elevation, as upon the amount
 of snow accumulating during the cold season. Under the equator,
 the mean temperature of the snow-line is 35° F. ; in the Alps and
 Pyrenees, about 25° ; and in lat. 68°, in Norway, it is only 21°.      Thus
 the mean temperature of the snow-line rises as we approach the equator,
 which means that the snow-line itself descends below its normal height,
 owing principally to augmented oceanic evaporation accompanied by in
 creased atmospheric precipitation. The deluges of rain which fall within
 the tropics far surpass the rainfall in the temperate and frigid zones, and
 doubtless the fall of snow upon intertropical mountains is proportion
 ately great. The important influence which the amount of precipitation
 exercises upon the lower limit of perpetual snow is beautifully exem
 plified at the fine waterfall of Tysse Strenger, near the head of the
 Hardanger Fjord, and was first noticed by Mr. M. Williams.              The
 spray from this fall, being frozen in winter, covers the valley for nearly
 half a mile with a stratum of snow and ice, so thick as to defy the solar
  rays of summer to melt it ; thus lowering the snow-line by more than
  2,000 feet.    The speaker had also seen in the Sor Fjord, under similar
  abnormal conditions, a mass of snow lying in the month of August
  last within 10 feet of the level of the sea, although the normal snow
  line is there at least 4,500 feet above the sea-level. That the height
  of the snow-line is essentially dependent upon the amount of pre
  cipitation, and not upon mean temperature, is evident from a com
  parison of its height on the coast and in the interior of the Scandinavian
  peninsula, as given by Forbes in the following table, compiled partly
  from his own observations and partly from those of Von Buch,
  Naumann, and others.

      Thug the difference between the height of the snow-line near the
coast, where,    owing to the impact of the gulf-stream, the winter is
mild but the atmospheric precipitation great, and in the interior, where
the climate is severe but the air comparatively dry, amounts in some
cases to as much as 1,050 feet, or nearly one-fourth of the total height.
Such is the depressing effect of greater precipitation as regards the
limit of perpetual snow; nor must it be forgotten that copious pre
cipitation is altogether incompatible with great summer-heat.                 The
 incessantly   clouded sky cuts off the solar rays, and moderates the
 summer temperature.          It is a trite observation, that a wet summer is
always a cold one.          The mean temperature of the land in contiguity
with such extensive surfaces of snow could also not fail to be con-
liderably reduced ; for although the actual amount of heat in activity
at the surface of the earth was greater during the glacial period than
subsequently, yet the cold of winter became stored up in masses of
falling snow, which in melting absorbed the heat of the succeeding
summer, and thus reduced          both the mean and summer temperature of
the land, especially of such portions of it as were not situated greatly
below the snow-line.          The common notion, therefore, that the glacial
epoch was a cold one, is correct, although heat, not cold, was the cause
of that epoch.         This apparent paradox, that heat should be the cause
of cold, finds its parallel in the ice-making machines which were in
operation at the last Great Exhibition.               In those machines which pro
duced from 2 to 12 tons of ice per ton of coal, the glacial produce was
directly proportional to the amount of heat developed by the com
 bustion of coal.
      But it is evident that this lowering of the snow-line by increased
oceanic temperature could only occur within certain limits ; for although
 tbe^nean temperature of the snow-line might rise from 21°, its present
 position in Norway, to 35°, its height under the equator, and perhaps
 even still higher, without any elevation of the snow-line itself; yet a
 further rise of mean temperature, which would result from a continued
 augmentation of oceanic heat, could not fail to elevate the snow-line
 itself, and eventually to chase the last portions of snow even from the
 loftiest mountain peaks.         A process the inverse of this has gone on
 in nature, leading gradually to the glacial epoch, and eventually to the
 present meteorological condition of our globe. Whilst the ocean main

174                         Professor Frankland                   [Jan. 29,
tained a high temperature, the snow-line floated above the summits,
possibly even of the most lofty mountains ; but with the reduction of
oceanic temperature it gradually descended, enveloping peak after peak
in a perennial mantle, until during the glacial epoch it attained its
lowest depression, whence it again rose, owing to diminished evapo
ration, to its present position.
     The speaker considered, that, inasmuch as recent researches had
rendered     all previous hypotheses regarding the glacial epoch abso
lutely   untenable,  the one for which he now contended could not be
said to come into antagonism with any other views. It also further
commended itself by requiring the assumption of no natural convulsion
or catastrophe, no vast or sudden upheavals or depressions, and no
change in the thermal relations of our earth to the sun or to space.
On the contrary, it insisted that the glacial epoch was normally and
gradually evolved from a thermal condition of the interior of our
globe, which could scarcely be said to be any longer the subject of
controversy.
     In conclusion, this hypothesis suggests the probability that the
other bodies belonging to our solar system have either already passed
through a similar epoch or are destined still to encounter it.        With
the exception of the polar ice of Mars we have hitherto obtained no
certain glimpse into the thermal or meteorological condition of the
planets : neither is the physical state of their surfaces accessible to
our best telescopes.      It is otherwise however with the moon, whose
distance is not too great to prevent the visibility of comparatively
minute details. A careful observation of the lunar surface for more
than a year with a silvered-glass reflector of 7 inches aperture and of
good defining power, had created in the speaker's mind an impression
 that our satellite had, like its primary, also passed through a glacial
 epoch, and that several at least of the valleys, rills, and streaks of the
lunar surface were not improbably due to former glacial action. Not
withstanding the excellent definition of modern telescopes, it could not
 be expected that other than the most gigantic of the characteristic
 details of an ancient glacier bed would be rendered visible.        Under
 favourable circumstances the terminal moraine of a glacier attains to
 enormous dimensions ; and consequently, of all the marks of a glacial
 valley, this would be the one most likely to be first perceived. Two
 such terminal moraines, one of them a double one, appeared to him to
 be traceable upon the moon's surface.      The first was situated near the
 termination of that remarkable streak which commences near the base
 of Tycho, and passing under the south-eastern wall of Bullialdus, into
 the ring of which it appears to cut, is gradually lost after passing
 crater 216 (Lubinietzky). Exactly opposite the last crater, and extend
 ing nearly across the streak in question, are two ridges forming the arcs
 of circles, whose centres are not coincident and whose external curvature
 is towards the north. Beyond the second ridge a talus slopes gradually
 down northwards to the general level of the lunar surface, the whole
 presenting an appearance reminding the observer of the concentric

period during which that portion of the moon's surface is illuminated,
but it is only about the third day after the first quarter and at the cor
responding phase of the waning moon (when the sun's rays, falling
nearly horizontally, throw the details of this part of the surface into
strong relief) that these appearances suggest the explanation now
offered.
     The other ridge, answering to a terminal moraine, occurs at the
northern extremity of that magnificent valley which runs past the
eastern edge of Kheita.        This ridge is nearly semicircular, and is
considerably elevated, both above the northern termination of the
valley, and the general surface of the moon.         It may be seen about
four days after new and full moon, but the position of the observer,
with regard to the lights and shadows, renders its appearance in the
rays of the rising sun by far the most striking.
     With regard to the probability of former glacial, or even aqueous,
agency on the surface of the moon, difficulties of an apparently very
formidable character present themselves.         There is not only now no
evidence whatever of the presence of water in any one of its three
forms, at the lunar surface ; but, on the contrary, all seleniographic
observations tend to prove its absence.          Nevertheless, the idea of
former aqueous agency in the moon is by no means new.               It was
entertained by Gruithuisen and others.           But if water at one time
existed on the surface of the moon, whither has it disappeared ?     If we
assume, in accordance with the nebular hypothesis, that the portions of
matter composing respectively the earth and the moon onc» possessed
an equally elevated temperature, it almost necessarily follows that the
moon, owing to the comparative smallness of its mass, would cool much
more rapidly than the earth ; for whilst the volume of the moon is
only about -,'uth, its surface is nearly i\th, that of the earth.
     This cooling of the mass of the moon must, according to all
analogy, have been attended with contraction, which can scarcely be
conceived as occurring without the development of a cavernous
structure in the interior.      Much of this cavernous structure would
doubtless communicate by means of fissures with the surface, and thus
there would be provided an internal receptacle for the ocean, from the
depths of which even the burning sun of the long lunar day would be
totally unable to dislodge more than traces of aqueous vapour. A globe
of wax was exhibited which had been cast under water ; it was highly
cellular, and the water had been forced into the hollow spaces, com
pletely filling them. Assuming the solid mass of the moon to contract
on cooling at the same rate as granite, its refrigeration through only
 180" F. would create cellular space equal to nearly 14^- millions of
cubic miles, which would be more than sufficient to engulf the whole
of the lunar ocean, supposing it to bear the same proportion to the
mass of the moon as our own ocean bears to that of the earth.
    If  such be the present condition of the moon, we can scarcely avoid
 the conclusion that a liquid ocean can only exist upon the surface of a

planet, so long as the latter retains a high internal temperature. The
moon then becomes to us a prophetic picture of the ultimate fate
which awaits our earth, when, deprived of an external ocean and of
all but a monthly rotation upon its axis,* it shall revolve round the
sun an arid and lifeless wilderness, — alternately scorched by the
protracted glare of a cloudless sun, and chilled by the intense cold of
an arctic night.

motion of the earth upon its axis. And although it has been proved that since the
time of Hipparchus the length of the terrestrial day has not increased by the Tfath
part of a second, yet this fact obviously leaves untouched the conclusion to which
Mayer's reasoning leads.

                          On  the Science   of History.
                                   I
 LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, — have undertaken to speak to you this
evening on what is called the Science of History.             I fear it is a dry
subject ; and there seems, indeed, something incongruous in the very
connection of such words as Science and History. It is as if we were
to talk of the colour of sound, or the longitude of the rule-of-three.
 Where it is so difficult to make out the truth on the commonest dis
puted fact in matters passing under our very eyes, how can we talk of
a science in things long past, which come to us only through books ?
It often seems to me as if History was like a child's box of letters,
with which we can spell any word we please.             We have only to pick
out such letters as we want, arrange them as we like, and say nothing
about those which do not suit our purpose.
     I  will try to make the thing intelligible, and        I  will try not to
weary you     ; but  I am  doubtful   of my  success either way. First, how
ever, I wish to say a word or two about the eminent person whose
name is connected with this way of looking at History, and whose pre
mature death struck us all with such a sudden sorrow.            Many of you,
perhaps, recollect Mr. Buckle as he stood not so long ago in this
place ; for he spoke more than an hour without a note — never repeat
ing himself, never wasting words; laying out his matter as easily and as
pleasantly as if he had been talking to us at his own fireside. We
might think what we pleased of Mr. Buckle's views, but it was plain
enough that he was a man of uncommon power ; and he had qualities
also — qualities to which he, perhaps, himself attached little value : as
rare as they were admirable.
     Most of us, when we have hit on something which we are pleased
to think important and original, feel as if we should burst with it.
We come out into the book-market with our wares in hand, and ask
for thanks and recognition.       Mr. Buckle, at an early age, conceived
the thought     which  made  him  famous, but he took the measure of his
abilities.   He knew that whenever he pleased he could command per
sonal distinction, but he cared more for his subject than for himself.
He was contented to work with patient reticence, unknown and unheard

of. for twenty years ; and then, at middle life, he produced a work
which called the attention of Europe.       Nay, of all places in the world,
he fluttered the dovecotes of the Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg.
     t.ioethe says somewhere, that as soon as a man has done anything
remarkable, there seems to be a general conspiracy to prevent him
from doing it again.     He is feasted, feted, caressed ; his time is stolen
from him by breakfasts, dinners, societies, idle businesses of a thousand
kinds.     Mr. Buckle had his share of all this ; but there are also more
dangerous enemies that wait upon success like his.          He had scarcely
won for himself the place which he deserved, than his health was found
shattered    by his labours.   He had but time to show us how large a
man he was — time just to sketch the outlines of his philosophy, and he
passed away as suddenly as he appeared.         He went abroad to recover
strength for his work, but his work was done with and over.         He died
of a fever at Damascus, vexed only that he was compelled to leave it
uncompleted.      Almost his last conscious words were, •• My book, my

                                            He went away as he had lived,
nobly careless of himself, and thinking only of the thing which he had
undertaken to do.
      But his labour had not been thrown away. Disagree with him as
we might, the effect which he had already produced was unmistakable,
and it is not likely to pass away.      What he said was not essentially
new.      Some such interpretation of human things is as early as the
beginning of thought. But Mr. Buckle, on the one hand, had the art
 which belongs to men of genius ; he could present his opinions with
 peculiar distinctness ; and, on the other hand, there is much in the
mode of thought at present current among us for which those opinions
 have an unusual fascination.    They do not please us, but they excite
and irritate us. \Ve are angry with them ; and we betray, in being so,
an uneasy misgiving that there may be more truth in those opinions
 than we like to allow.
    Mr. Buckle's general theory was something of this kind : When
 human creatures began first to look about them in the world they
 lived in, there seemed to be no order in anything.         Days and nights
 were not the same length. The air was sometimes hot and sometimes
 cold.    Some of the stars rose and set like the sun ; some were almost
 motionless in the sky ; some described circles round a central star
 above the north horizon.       The planets went on principles of their
 own ; and in the elements there seemed nothing but caprice.            Sun
 and moon would at times go out in eclipse.           Sometimes the earth
 itself would shake under their feet ; and they could only suppose that
 earth and air and sky and water were inhabited and managed by
 creatures as wayward as themselves.
      'Iime went on, and the disorder began to arrange itself. Certain
 influences seemed beneficent to men, others malignant and destructive,
 and the world was supposed to be animated by good spirits and evil
 spirits, who were continually fighting against each other ; in outward
 nature and in human creatures themselves.        Finally, as men observed

 182                          Mr.  J. A.  Froude                    [Feb.  5,
more and imagined less, these interpretations gave way also. Phenomena
the most opposite in effect were seen to be the result of the same natural
law. The fire did not burn the house down if the owners of it were
careful, but remained on the earth and boiled the pot ; nor did it seem
more inclined to burn a bad man's house down than a good man's, pro
vided the badness did not take the form of negligence. The phenomena
of nature were found for the most part to proceed in an orderly, regular
way, and their variations to be such as could be counted upon.        From
observing    the order of things,  the step  was  easy to cause   and effect.
An eclipse, instead of being a sign of the anger of Heaven, was found
the necessary and innocent result of the relative position of sun, moon,
and earth. The comets became bodies in space, unrelated to the beings
who had imagined that all creation was watching them and their doings.
By degrees caprice, volition, all symptoms of arbitrary action, disap
peared out of the universe ; and almost every phenomenon in earth or
heaven was found attributable to some law, either understood or per
ceived to exist. Thus nature was reclaimed from the imagination. The
first fantastic conception of things gave way before the moral ; the
moral in turn gave way before the natural ; and at last there was left
but one small tract of jungle where the theory of law had failed to
penetrate, the doings and characters of human creatures themselves.
     There, and only there, amidst the conflicts of reason and emotion,
conscience and desire, spiritual forces were still conceived to exist.
 Cause and effect were not traceable when there was a free volition to
disturb the connection.     In all other things, from a given set of con
ditions, the consequences necessarily followed.        With man, the word
 law changed its meaning ; and instead of a fixed order, which he
could not choose but follow, it became a moral precept which he might
disobey   if he dared.
     This it  was which   Mr. Buckle disbelieved. The economy which
prevailed throughout nature, he thought it very unlikely should admit
of this exception. He considered that human beings acted necessarily
from the impulse of outward circumstances upon their mental and bodily
condition at any given moment.         Every man, he said, acted from a
motive ; and his conduct was determined by the motive which affected
him most powerfully.       Every man naturally desires what he supposes
to be good for him ; but to do well, he must know well.          He will eat
poison, so long as he does not know that it is poison.          Let him see
that it will kill him, and he will not touch it. It was no question
of moral right and wrong. Once let him be thoroughly made to feel
that the thing is destructive, and he will leave it alone by the law
of his nature. His virtues are the result of knowledge ; his faults
the necessary consequence of the want of it.        A boy desires to draw.
He knows nothing about it ; he draws men like trees or houses, with
their centre of gravity in the air.       He makes mistakes because he
knows no better. We do not blame him. Till he is better taught
he cannot help it.     But his instruction begins.   He arrives at straight
lines ; then at solids ; then at curves.       He learns perspective, and

light and   shade.   He observes more accurately the forms which he
wishes to represent.    He perceives effects, and he perceives the means
by  which  they  are  produced.   He has learned what to do ; and, in
part, he has learned how to do it. His after-progress will depend on
the amount of force which his nature possesses; but all this is as
natural as the growth of an acorn. You do not preach to the acorn
that it is its duty to become a large tree ; you do not preach to the
art-pupil that it is his duty to become a Holbein.       You plant your
acorn in favourable soil, where it can have light and air, and be shel
tered from the wind ; you remove the superfluous branches, you train
the strength into the leading shoots.     The acorn will then become as
fine a tree as it has vital force to become.     The difference between
men and other things is only in the largeness and vanity of man's
capacities ; and in this special capacity, that he alone has the power of
observing the circumstances favourable to his own growth, and can apply
them for himself.    Yet, again, with this condition, — that he is not, as
is commonly supposed, free to choose whether he will make use of these
appliances or not.     When he knows what is good for him, he will
choose it ; and he will judge what is good for him by the circum
stances which have made him what he is.
     And what he would do, he always had done.         His history had been
a natural growth as much as the growth of the acorn.          His improve
ment had followed the progress of his knowledge ; and, by a comparison
of his outward circumstances with the condition of his mind, his whole
proceedings on this planet, his creeds and constitutions, his good deeds
and his bad, his arts and his sciences, his empires and his revo
lutions, would be found all to arrange themselves into clear relations
of cause and effect.
     If, when Mr. Buckle pressed his conclusions, we objected the
difficulty of finding what the truth about past times really was, he
would admit it candidly as far as concerned individuals ; but there was
not the same difficulty, he said, with masses of men.       We might dis
agree about the characters of Julius or Tiberius Cffisar, but we could
know well enough the Romans of the Empire.         We had their literature
to tell us how they thought ; we had their laws to tell us how they
governed ; we had the broad face of the world, the huge mountainous
outline of their general doings upon           to tell us how they acted.
                                                   it,
He believed     it was all reducible to laws, and could be made as
intelligible as the growth of the chalk cliffs or the coal measures.
    And thus consistently Mr. Buckle cared little for individuals. He
did not believe (as some one has said) that the history of mankind               is
the history of its great men.  Great men with him were but larger
atoms, obeying the same impulses with the rest, only perhaps a trifle
more erratic.   With them or without them, the course of things would
have been much the same.
    As   an illustration   of   the truth   of    his view, he would   point to the

184                       Mr.   J.   A. Froude                           [Feb.    5,
new science of Political Economy.     Here already was a large area of
human activity in which natural laws were found to act unerringly.
Men had gone on for centuries trying to regulate trade on moral
principles.   They would fix wages according to some imaginary rule
of fairness ; they would fix prices by what they considered things
ought to cost ; they encouraged one trade, or discouraged another, for
moral reasons.    They might as well have tried to work a steam-engine
on moral principles. The great statesmen whose names were connected
with these enterprises might have as well legislated that water should
run up-hill.    There were natural laws, fixed in the conditions of
things ; and to contend against them was the old battle of the Titans
against the gods.
     As it was with political economy, so it was with all other forms of
human activity ; and as the true laws of political economy explained
the troubles which people fell into in old times, because they were
ignorant of them, so the true laws of human nature, as soon as we
knew them, would explain the mistakes in more serious matters, and
enable us to manage better for the future.       Geographical position,
climate, air, soil, and the like, had their several influences.      The
northern nations are hardy and industrious, because they must till the
earth if they would eat the fruits of      it,
                                          and because the temperature
is too low to make an idle life enjoyable.     In the south, the soil             is
more productive, while less food       wanted and fewer clothes and
                                      is                                     ;
in the exquisite air, exertion  is  not needed to make the sense of
existence delightful.   Therefore, in the south, we find men lazy and
indolent.
     True, there are difficulties in these views the home of the languid
                                                   ;
Italian was the home also of the sternest race of whom the story of
mankind retains     arecord.     And again, when we are told that the
Spaniards were superstitious, because Spain was        country of earth

quakes, we remember Japan, the spot in all the world where earth
quakes are most frequent, and where at the same time there            the    is
most serene disbelief in any supernatural agency whatsoever.
    Moreover,   if men grow into what they are by natural laws, they
cannot help being what they are  ; and      they cannot help being what
                                           if
they are,   good deal will have to be altered in our general view of
            a
things.
    That, however, in these theories there         great deal of truth
                                                   is

quite certain   were there but
                ;                a hope that those who maintain them
would be contented with that admission. A man born in        Mahometan
                                                                a
country grows up     aMahometan  ; in a Catholic country,      Catholic
                                                                    a             ;
in   aProtestant country, a Protestant.       His opinions are like his
language he learns to think as he learns to speak

to suppose him responsible for being what nature makes him.          We
take pains to educate children.     There         good education and
                                                  is   a                          a
bad education   ;there are rules well ascertained          by
                                                        which characters
are influenced, and, clearly enough,   it    no mere matter for
                                             is                     boy's    a
free will whether he turns out well or ill.    We try to train him into

good habits ; we keep him out of the way of temptations ; we see that
he is well taught; we mix kindness and strictness; we surround him
with every good influence we can command. These are what are
termed the advantages of a good education ; and if we fail to provide
those under our care with it, and if they go wrong, the responsibility
we feel is as much ours as theirs.     This is at once an admission of the
power over us of outward circumstances.
      In the same way, we allow for the strength of temptations, and
the like.
      In general, it is perfectly obvious that men do necessarily absorb,
out of the influence in which they grow up, what gives a complexion
 to their whole after-character.
       When historians have to relate great social or speculative changes,
the overthrow of a monarchy or the establishment            of a creed, they
do but half their duty if they merely relate the events.      In an account,
for instance, of the rise of Mahometanism, it is not enough to describe
the character of the Prophet, the ends which he set before him, the
 means which he made use of, and the effect which he produced ; the
 historian must show what there was in the condition of the Eastern races
 which enabled Mahomet to act upon them so powerfully ; their exist
 ing beliefs, their existing moral and political condition.
       In our estimate of the past, and in our calculations of the future —
 in the judgments which we pass upon one another, measuring respon
 sibility, not by the thing done, but by the opportunities which people
 have had of knowing better or worse — in the efforts which we make to
 keep our children from bad associations         or friends — we admit that
 external circumstances have a powerful effect in making men what
 they are.
       But are circumstances everything?       That is the whole question.
 A science of history, if it is more than a misleading name, implies that
 the relation between cause and effect holds in human things as in all
 others, that the origin of human actions is not to be looked for in
 mysterious properties of the mind, but in influences which are palpable
  and ponderable.
        When natural causes are liable to be set aside and neutralized by
  what is called volition, the word Science is out of place.     If it is free
  to a man to choose what he will do or not do, there is no science of
  him.     If there is a science of him, there is no free choice, and the
  praise or blame with which we regard one another is impertinent and
  out of place.
        I am trespassing upon these ethical grounds, because unless do,  I
  the subject cannot be made intelligible.     Mankind is but an aggregate
  of individuals — History is but the record of individual action, and what
  is true of the part, is true of the whole.
        We feel keenly about such things, and when the logic becomes
  perplexing, we are apt to grow rhetorical about them.           It is a bad
  plan however. Whatever the truth may be, it is best that we should

hearts as cool as we can.

                                we had the whole case before us — if we
were taken, like Leibnitz's Tarquin, into the council chamber of
nature, and were shown what we really were, where we came from,
and where we were going, however unpleasant it might be for some of
us to find ourselves, like Tarquin, made into villains, from the subtle
necessities of " the best of all possible worlds ; " nevertheless  some
such theory as Mr. Buckle's might possibly turn out to be true.
Likely enough, there is some great " equation of the universe " when
the value of the unknown quantities can be determined.      But we must
treat things in relation to our own powers and position ; and the
question              is,
              whether the sweep of those vast curves can be measured
by the intellect of creatures of  day like ourselves.

Macrocosmos, but his heart fails him before he ventures that tremendous
experiment, and he summons before him, instead, the spirit of his own
planet. There he feels himself at home.     The stream of life and the
storm of action, the everlasting ocean of existence, the web and
the woof, and the roaring loom of time       he gazes upon     :   and in                it,

him. But the majestic vision fades, and          voice comes to him —

" Thou art fellow with the spirits which thy mind can grasp — not

and the groups      of stars which inlaid the floor of heaven were the
glittering trophies of the loves and wars of the Pantheon, so long there
 was no science of Astronomy.         There was fancy, imagination, poetry,
 perhaps reverence, but no science.       As soon, however, as it was ob
 served that the stars retained their relative places, that the times of
 their rising and setting varied with the seasons, that sun, moon, and
 planets moved among them in a plane, and the belt of the Zodiac was
 marked out and divided, then a new order of things began.         Traces of
 the earlier stage remained in the names of the signs and constellations,
just as the Scandinavian mythology survives now in the names of the
 days of the week : but for all that, the understanding was now at work
 on the thing ; Science had begun, and the first triumph of it was the
 power of foretelling the future ; eclipses were perceived to recur in
 cycles of nineteen years, and philosophers were able to say when an
 eclipse was to be looked for.       The periods of the planets were deter
 mined. Theories were invented to account for their eccentricities ;
 and, false as those theories might be, the position of the planets could
 be calculated with moderate certainty by them.          The very first result
 of the science, in its most imperfect stage, was a power of foresight ;
 and this was possible before any one true astronomical law had been
 discovered.
      We should not therefore question the possibility of a science of
 history, because the explanations of its phenomena were rudimentary
 or imperfect ; that they might be, and might long continue to be, and
 yet enough might be done to show that there was such a thing, and
 that it was not entirely without use. But how was it that in those rude
 days, with small knowledge of mathematics, and with no better instru
 ments than flat walls and dial plates, those first astronomers made
 progress so considerable?        Because, I suppose, the phenomena which
 they were observing recurred, for the most part, within moderate
 intervals ; so that they could collect large experience within the
 compass of their natural lives : because days and months and years
 were measurable periods, and within them the more simple phenomena
 perpetually repeated themselves.
      But how would it have been    if,  instead of turning on its axis once
 in twenty-four hours, the earth had taken         year about

                                               if
 thanit   is, and for the initial steps of astronomy there had been nothing
 to depend upon except observations recorded in history            How long
                                                                     ?

 occurred to any one that, in what they saw night after night, there
 was any kind of order at all   ?
      We can see to some extent how       itwould have been, by the present
 state of those parts of the science which in fact depend on remote re
 corded observations. The movements of the comets are still extremely
 uncertain.     The times of their return can be calculated only with the
greatest vagueness.
    And yet such      a   hypothesis as   I     have    suggested   would     but    in
                                                                       o    2

 adequately express the position in which we are in fact placed towards
 history.   There the phenomena never repeat themselves.            There we
 are dependent wholly on the record of things said to have happened
 once, but which never happen or can happen a second time.             There
 no experiment is possible ; we can watch for no recurring fact to test
 the worth of our conjectures.       It has been suggested, fancifully, that
 if we consider the universe to be infinite, time is the same as eternity,
 and that the past is perpetually present.        Light takes nine years to
 come to us from Sirius ; those rays which we may see to-night when
 we leave this place, left Sirius nine years ago ; and could the inhabit
 ants of Sirius see the earth at this moment, they would see the English
 army in the trenches before Sebastopol ; Florence Nightingale watch
 ing at Scutari over the wounded at Inkermann ; and the peace of
                            •'
 England undisturbed by        Essays and Reviews."
     As the stars recede into distance, so time recedes with them, and
 there may be, and probably are, stars from which Noah might be seen
 stepping into the ark, Eve listening to the temptation of the serpent,
 or that older race, who ate the oysters and left the shell-heaps behind
 them, when the Baltic was an open sea.
     Could we but compare notes, something might be done ; but of this
there is no present hope, and without it there will be no science of
history.    Eclipses, recorded in ancient books, can be verified by calcu
lation, and lost dates can be recovered by them, and we can foresee by
 the laws which they follow when there will be eclipses again.         Will a
 time ever be when the lost secret of the foundation of Rome can be
 recovered by historic laws?      If  not, where is our science?   It may be
said that this is a particular fact, that we can deal satisfactorily with
general phenomena affecting eras and cycles.           Well, then let us take
some general phenomenon.        Mahometanism, for instance, or Buddhism.
Those are large enough. Can you imagine a science which would have
 foretold such movements as those? The state of things out of which
they rose is obscure ; but suppose it not obscure, can you conceive
that, with any amount of historical insight into the old Oriental beliefs,
you could have seen that they were about to transform themselves into
those particular forms and no other ?
     It is not enough to say, that, after the fact, you can understand
partially how Mahometanism came to be.                 All historians worth
the name have told us something about that ; but when we talk of
science, we mean something with more ambitious pretences, we mean
something which can foresee as well as explain ; and, thus looked at,
to state the problem is to show its absurdity.      ...  As little could the
wisest man have foreseen this mighty revolution, as thirty years ago
such a thing as Mormonism could have been anticipated in America ;
as little as it could have been foreseen that table-turning and spirit-
rapping would have been an outcome of the scientific culture of
England in the nineteenth century.

among its elements a certain detestable superstition, so he called            it,
rising up amidst the off-scouring of the Jews, which was named
Christianity.   Could Tacitus have looked forward nine centuries to
the Rome of Gregory VII., could he have beheld the representative of
the majesty of the Caesars holding the stirrup of the Pontiff of that
vile and execrated sect, the spectacle would scarcely have appeared to
him the fulfilment of      rational expectation, an intelligible result of
                                  a
the causes in operation round him. Tacitus, indeed, was born before
the science of history     but would M. Comte have seen any more

scientific explanation of that.
    First, for the facts themselves. They come to us through the minds
of those who recorded them, neither machines nor angels, but fallible
creatures, with human passions and prejudices. Tacitus and Thucy-
dides were perhaps the ablest men who ever gave themselves to writing
history    the ablest, and also the most incapable of conscious falsehood.
           ;
Yet even now, after all these centuries, the truth of what they relate
is called in question. Good reasons can be given to show that neither
of them can be confidently trusted.                 If
                                            we doubt with these, whom are
we to believe?
    Or again, let the facts be granted. To revert again to my simile of
the box of letters, you have but to select such facts as suit you, you
have but to leave alone those which do not suit you, and let your
theory of history be what      will, you can find no difficulty in providing
                                       it

   190                         Mr.  J. A.  Froude                     [Feb. 5,
  provide you with abundant illustrations of anything which you may
  wish to believe.
       " What is history," said Napoleon, " but a fiction agreed upon ? "
  " My friend," said Faust to the student, who was growing enthusiastic
  about the spirit of past ages ; " my friend, the times which are gone
  are a book with seven seals ; and what you call the spirit of past ages
  is but the spirit of this or that good gentleman in whose mind those
  ages are reflected."
       One lesson, and only one, history may be said to repeat with dis
  tinctness; that the world is built somehow on moral foundations; that,
  in the long run, it is well with the good ; in the long run, it is ill with
  the wicked.    But this is no science ; it is no more than the old doctrine
  taught long ago by the Hebrew prophets.          The theories of M. Comte
  and his disciples advance us, after all, not a step beyond the trodden
 and familiar ground.       If men are not entirely animals, they are at
 least half animals, and are subject in this aspect of them to the con
 ditions of animals. So far as those parts of man's doings are concerned
 which neither have nor need have anything moral about them, so far
 the laws of him are calculable.       There are laws for his digestion, and
 laws of the means by which his digestive organs are supplied with
 matter. But pass beyond them, and where are we?            In a world where
 it would be as easy to calculate men's actions by laws like those of
 positive philosophy as to measure the orbit of Neptune with a foot-
 rule, or weigh Sirius in a grocer's scale.
      And it is not difficult to see why this should be. The first prin
 ciple on which the theory of a science of history can be plausibly
 argued, is that all actions whatsoever arise from self-interest.      It may
 be enlightened self-interest ; it may be unenlightened ; but it is
 assumed as an axiom, that every man, in whatever he does, is aiming
 at something which he considers will promote his happiness.              His
 conduct is not determined by his will ; it is determined by the object
 of his desire.     Adam Smith, in laying the foundations of political
 economy, expressly eliminates every other motive. He does not say
that men never act on other motives ; still less that they never ought
 to act on other motives ; but merely that, as far as the arts of pro
duction are concerned and of buying and selling, the action of self-
interest may be counted upon as uniform.            What Adam Smith says
of political economy, Mr. Buckle would extend over the whole circle
of human activity.
      Now, that which especially distinguishes a high order of man from
a low order of man — that which constitutes human goodness, human
greatness, human nobleness — is surely not the degree of enlightenment
with which they pursue their own advantage ; but it is self-forgetful-
ness — it is self-sacrifice — it is the disregard of personal pleasure,
personal indulgence, personal advantages remote or present, because
some other line of conduct is more right.
     We are sometimes told that this is but another way of expressing

1864.     J                       on the Science   of History.                      191
the same thing ; that when a man prefers doing what is right, it is
only because to do right gives him a higher satisfaction.      It appears
to me, on the contrary, to be a difference in the very heart and nature
of things.   The martyr goes to the stake, the patriot to the scaffold,
not with a view to any future reward to themselves, but because it is a
glory to fling away their lives for truth and freedom ; and so through
all phases of existence, to the small details of common life, the beauti
ful character is the unselfish character.      Those whom we most love
and admire are those to whom the thought of self seems never to
occur ; who do simply and with no ulterior aim — with no thought
whether it will be pleasant to themselves or unpleasant — that which is
good, and right, and generous.
    Is this still selfishness, only more enlightened?             I
                                                         do not think so.
The essence of true nobility is neglect of self.      Let the thought of
self pass in, and the beauty of a great action \» gone — like the bloom
from a soiled flower.        Surely it is a paradox to speak of the self-
interest of a martyr who dies for a cause, the triumph of which he will
never enjoy ; and the greatest of that great company in all ages would
have done what they did, had their personal prospects        closed with
the grave.    Nay, there have been those so zealous for some glorious
cause, as to wish themselves blotted out of the book of Heaven if the
      cause
       of Heaven could succeed.
     And out of this mysterious quality, whatever                be, arise the
                                                                      it
higher relations of human life, the higher modes of human obligation.
Kant, the philosopher, used to say that there were two things which
overwhelmed him with awe as he thought of them.              One was the star-
sown deep of space, without limit and without end               the other was
                                                                      ;
right   and  wrong.    Right,   the   sacrifice of self  to good   wrong, the
                                                                           ;
sacrifice of good to self; — not graduated objects of desire, to which we
are determined by the degrees of our knowledge, but wide asunder as
pole and pole, as light and darkness.         One, the object of infinite love        ;
the other, the object of infinite detestation      and scorn. It         in this
                                                                               is
marvellous power         men to do wrong —
                             in                        an old story, but none
                                                       (it   is
the less true for that) —           in this power to do wrong — wrong or
                                     it   is
right, as     lies somehow with ourselves to choose — that the impossi
              it
 bility stands of forming scientific calculations of what men will do
 before the fact, or scientific explanations of what they have done after
the  fact.         If
               men were consistently selfish, you might analyze their
motives      they were consistently noble, they would express in their
              ;   if
conduct the laws of the highest perfection. But so long as two natures
are mixed together, and the strange creature which results from the
combination       now under one influence and now under another, so

they are not the most interesting.             They have their reward in the

we   grow ; and in the infinite multiplicity of elements of which that
air is now composed, it is for ever matter of conjecture what the minds
will be like which expand under its influence.
     From  the England of Fielding and Richardson to the England
of Miss  Austen, from the England of Miss Austen to the England of
Railways and Free-trade, how vast the change ; yet perhaps Sir
Charles Grandison would not seem so strange to us now, as one of
ourselves would seem to our great-grandchildren.  The world moves
faster and faster ; and the interval will probably be considerably
greater.
      The temper of each new generation is a continual surprise.        The
fates  delight to contradict our most confident expectations. Gibbon
believed that the era of conquerors was at an end.         Had he lived out
the full life of man, he would have seen Europe              at the feet of
Napoleon.        But a few years ago we believed the world had grown too
civilized for war, and the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park was to be the
inauguration of a new era.       Battles, bloody as Napoleon's, are now
the familiar tale of every day ; and the arts which have made greatest
progress are the arts of destruction.         What next ? We may strain
our eyes into the future, which lies beyond this waning century ; but
never was conjecture more at fault.        It is blank darkness, which even
the imagination fails to people.
      What, then, is the use of History ? and what are its lessons ?   If it
can tell us little of the past, and nothing of the future, why waste our
 time over so barren a study ?
      First, it is a voice for ever sounding across the centuries the laws
 of right and wrong.       Opinions alter, manners change, creeds rise and
 fall, but the moral law is written on the tablets of eternity.   For every
 false word or unrighteous deed, for cruelty and oppression, for lust or
 vanity, the price has to be paid at last : not always by the chief
 offenders,    but paid by some one. Justice and truth alone endure
 and live.      Injustice and falsehood   may be long-lived, but doomsday
 comes at last to them, in French           revolutions and other terrible
ways.
        That is one lesson   of History.   Another   is,
                                                       that we should draw
no horoscopes    that we should
                 ;                         little, for what we expect will
                                      expect
not come to pass.   Revolutions,    reformations — those vast movements
 into which heroes and saints have flung themselves, in the belief that
 they were the dawn of the millennium — have not borne the fruit
 which they looked for.    Millenniums are still far away. These great
 convulsions leave the world changed — perhaps improved, — but not
 improved as the actors in them hoped          itwould be.    Luther would
  have gone to work with less heart, could he have foreseen the Thirty
  Years' War, and     the distance the theology of Tubingen.

  ton might have hesitated to draw the sword against England, could he
  have seen the country which he made as we see      itnow.
      The most reasonable anticipations fail us — antecedents the most
  apposite mislead us ; because the conditions of human problems never

repeat themselves.  Some new feature alters everything — some feature
which we detect only in its after-operation.
     But this, it may be said, is but a meagre outcome. Can the long
records of humanity, with all its joys and sorrows, its sufferings and its
conquests, teach us no more than this?       Let us approach the subject
from another side.
      Ifyou were asked to point out the special features in which Shake
speare's plays are so transcendently excellent, you would mention,
perhaps, among others, this, that his stories are not put together,
and his characters are not conceived, to illustrate any particular law or
principle.    They teach many lessons, but not any one prominent above
another ; and when we have drawn from them all the direct instruc
tion which they contain, there remains still something unresolved —
something which the artist gives, and which the philosopher cannot
give.
     It is in this characteristic that we are accustomed to say Shake
speare's supreme truth lies. He represents real life. His dramas teach as
life teaches — neither less nor more. He builds his fabrics as nature does,
on right and wrong ; but he does not struggle to make nature more
systematic than she is.      In the subtle interflow of good and evil — in
the unmerited sufferings of innocence — in the disproportion of penalties
to desert — in the seeming blindness with which justice, in attempting
to assert itself, overwhelms innocent and guilty in a common ruin —
Shakspeare is true to real experience.       The mystery of life he leaves
as he finds it ; and, in his most tremendous positions, he is addressing
rather the intellectual emotions than the understanding,— knowing well
that the understanding in such things is at fault, and the sage as
ignorant as the child.
     Only the highest order of genius can represent nature thus. An
inferior artist produces, if he tries                it,
                                              something entirely immoral,
where good and evil are names, and nobility of disposition        supposed     is
to show itself in the absolute disregard of them.      Otherwise, if he    a                  is
better kind of man, he will force on nature         didactic purpose. He
                                                              a
composes what are called moral tales, which may edify the conscience,
but only mislead the intellect.

The French king, in ' Lear,' was to be got rid of; Cordelia was to
marry Edgar, and Lear himself was to be rewarded for his sufferings
by a golden old age.  They could not bear that Hamlet should suffer
for the sins of Claudius.   The wicked king was to die, and the
wicked mother ; and Hamlet and Ophelia were to make a match of                       it,
  and live happily ever after. A common novelist would have arranged
it   so and you would have had your comfortable moral that wicked
     ;
  ness was fitly punished, and virtue had its due reward, and all would
  have been well.      But Shakespeare would not have           so.

  knew that crime was not so simple in its consequences, or Providence
  so paternal.    He was contented to take the truth from life and the     ;

 and reflect on the superior advantages of an age of schools and news
 papers.         If
                the bare facts of the story had come down to us from                 a
 chronicler, and an ordinary writer of the nineteenth century had had
 to relate them, his account, we may depend upon                it,
                                                               would have been
 put together upon one or other of these principles.            Yet, by the side
 of that unfolding of the secrets of the prison-house of the soul, what
 lean and shrivelled anatomies the best of such descriptions would
 seem!
      Shakespeare himself,       Isuppose, could not have given us         theory
                                                                           a
of what he meant — he gave us the thing itself on which we might
make whatever theories we pleased.
      Or again, look at Homer.
      The Iliad         from two to three thousand years older than          Mac
                      '
             '            is                                                   '
beth,' and yet        it  as fresh as
                           is           if  had been written yesterday.
                                             it                               We
have there no lessons save in the emotions which rise              us as we read.
                                                                      in

views about this or that you can scarcely tell indeed whether his

sympathies are Greek or Trojan          ;but he represents to us faithfully the
men and women among whom he lived.                He sang the Tale of Troy,
he touched his lyre, he drained the golden beaker in the halls of men
like those on whom he was conferring immortality. And thus, although
no Agamemnon, king of men, ever led Grecian fleet to Ilium, though
                                                  a
no Priam sought the midnight tent of Achilles, though Ulysses and

196                            Mr.  J. A. Fronde                     [Feb. 5,
Diomed and Nestor were but names, and Helen but a dream, yet,
through Homer's power of representing men and women, those old
Greeks will still stand out from amidst the darkness of the ancient
world with a sharpness of outline which belongs to no period of history,
except the most recent.         For the mere hard purposes of history the
' Iliad ' and '           '
                            are  the most effective books which ever were
                Odyssey
written. We see the Hall of Menelaus, we see the garden of Alcinous,
we see Nausicaa among her maidens on the shore, we see the mellow
monarch sitting with ivory sceptre in the Market-place dealing out
genial justice.    Or again, when the wild mood is on, we can hear the
crash of the spears, the rattle of the armour as the heroes fall, and
the plunging of the horses among the slain. We could enter the palace
of an old Ionian lord, we know what we should see there, we know the
words in which he would address us.           We could meet Hector as a
friend.    If  we could choose a companion to spend an evening with
over a fireside, it would be the man of many counsels, the husband of
Penelope.
     I  am not going into the vexed question whether History or Poetry
is the more true.      It has been sometimes said that Poetry is the more
true, because it can make things more like what our moral sense would
prefer they should be.       We hear of poetic justice and the like, as     if
nature and fact were not just enough.
      I entirely dissent from that view. So far as Poetry attempts to
improve on truth in that way, so far it abandons truth, and is false to
itself. Even literal facts, exactly as they were, a great poet will prefer
when he can get them. Shakespeare in the historical plays is studious,
wherever possible, to give the very words which he finds to have been
used ; and it shows how wisely he was guided in this, that those magni
ficent speeches of Wolsey are taken exactly, with no more change than
the metre made necessary, from Cavendish's Life.          Marlborough read
Shakespeare     for English history, and read nothing else.        The poet
only is not bound, when it is inconvenient, to what may be called the
accidents of facts. It was enough for Shakespeare to know that Prince
Hal in his youth had lived among loose companions, and the tavern in
 Eastcheap came in to fill out his picture; although Mrs. Quickly and
Falstaff, and Poins and Bardolph were more likely to have been fallen
in with by Shakespeare himself at the Mermaid, than to have been
comrades of the true Prince Henry.          It was enough for Shakespeare
to draw real men, and the situation, whatever it might be, would sit
easy on them. In this sense only it is that Poetry is truer than History,
that it can make a picture more complete.          It may take liberties with
time and space, and give the action distinctness by throwing it into
more manageable       compass.
     But it  may not alter the real conditions of things, or represent life
as other than it is.     The greatness of the poet depends on his being
true to nature, without insisting that nature shall theorize with him,
without making her more just, more philosophical, more moral than

 1864.]                   on the Science of History.                     197
reality j and, in difficult matters, leaving much to reflection which
cannot be explained.
      And if this be true of Poetry, if Homer and Shakespeare are what
they are, from the absence of everything didactic about them, may we
not thus learn something of what history should be, and in what sense
it should aspire to teach ?
     If   Poetry must not theorize, much less should the historian theo
rize, whose obligations to be true to fact are even greater than the
poet's.     If the drama is grandest when the action is least explicable by
laws, because then it best resembles life, then history will be grandest
also under the same conditions. ' Macbeth,' were it literally true, would
be perfect history ; and so far as the historian can approach to that
kind of model, so far as he can let his story tell itself in the deeds and
words of those who act it out, so far is he most successful.      His work
is no longer the vapour of his own brain, which a breath will scatter;
it is the thing itself, which will have interest for all time. A   thousand
theories may be formed about it — spiritual theories, Pantheistic theories,
cause and effect theories ; but each age will have its own philosophy
of history, and all these in turn will fail and die. Hegel falls out of
date, Schlegel falls out of date, and Comte in good time will fall out
of date.     The thought about the thing must change as we change, but
the thing itself can never change; and a history is durable or perish
able as it contains more or least of the writer's own speculation.      The
splendid intellect of Gibbon for the most part kept him true to
the right course in this ; yet the philosophical chapters for which he
has been most admired or censured          may hereafter be thought the
least interesting in his work.      The time has been when they would
not have been comprehended ; the time may come when they will seem
commonplace.
     It may be said, that in requiring history to be written like a
 drama, we require an impossibility.
      For history to be written with the complete form of a drama, doubt
less is impossible ; but there are periods, and these the periods, for
the most part, of greatest interest to mankind, the history of which
may be so written that the actors shall reveal their characters in their
own words ; where mind can be seen matched against mind, and the
 great passions of the epoch not simply be described as existing, but
 be exhibited at their white heat in the souls and hearts possessed by
 them.     There are all the elements of drama — drama of the highest
 order — where the huge forces of the times are as the Grecian destiny,
 and the power of the man is seen either stemming the stream till it
 overwhelms him, or ruling while he seems to yield to it.
      It is nature's drama — not Shakespeare's — but a drama none the
 less.
      So at least it seems to me.   Wherever possible, let us not be told
 ABorr this man or that.        Let us hear the man himself speak ; let us
 see him act, and let us be left to form our own opinions about him.

He    must not only lay the facts before them — he must tell them what
he himself thinks about those facts.            In my opinion this is precisely
what he ought not to do. Bishop Butler says somewhere, that the
best book which could be written would be a book consisting only of
premises, from which the readers should draw conclusions for them
selves.    The highest poetry is that very thing, and the highest history
 ought to be; and then we shall no more ask for a theory of this or
                                                                               '

there will continue to be ; but the fashions of them will change, as our
habits of thought will change.           Each new philosopher will find his
chief employment in showing that before him no one understood any
thing.    But the drama of history is imperishable, and the lessons of
it will be like what we learn from Homer or Shakespeare — lessons for
which we have no words.
      The address of history is less to the understanding than to the
higher emotions : we learn in it to sympathize with what is great and
good ; we learn to hate what is base.          In the anomalies of fortune we
feel the mystery of our mortal existence, and in the companionship of the
illustrious natures who have shaped the fortunes of the world, we escape
from the littlenesses which cling to the round of common life, and
our minds are tuned in a higher and nobler key.

      For the rest, and for those large questions which touched in con
nection with Mr. Buckle, we live in times of change, and none can tell
what will be after us. What opinions — what convictions — the infant of
to-day will find prevailing on the earth, if he and it live out together to
the middle of another century, only a very bold man would undertake
to conjecture ! " The time will come," said Lichtenberg, in scorn at the
materializing tendencies of modern thought; "the time will come when
the belief in God will be as the tale with which old women frighten
children ; when the world will be a machine, the ether a gas, and God
will be a force." But whether the end be seventy years hence, or seven
hundred — be the close of the mortal history of humanity as far distant
in the future as its shadowy beginnings seem now to lie behind us —
this only we may foretell with confidence, — that the riddle of man's
nature will remain unsolved.          There will be that in him yet which
physical laws will fail to explain — that something, whatever it be, in
himself and in the world, which science cannot fathom, and which
suggests the unknown possibilities of his origin and his destiny.

                                 in the Chair.
                       J.   ALFRED WANKLYN,             Esq.
                    PROFESSOR 0V CHEMISTRY, LONDON INSTITUTION,
                 On the Synthesis        of Organic Bodies.
ON this tray you will see a collection of well-known substances.*    Com
pare these substances with one another, and you will be struck with
their dissimilarities.    Some are solids and crystalline and brittle,
others are liquids which are more fluid than water.       Some are without
colours; others are highly coloured, and are used for dyeing.        Some
are sweet, others are bitter ; some have delightful perfumes, others
have dreadful smells ; some are wholesome food, others the most
powerful poisons known to man.
    In spite of this wonderful diversity in their properties, all the
specimens on this tray are compounds of carbon, with a very few
elements.    Carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are the only
elements which occur in this collection of substances.      Some of these
substances contain carbon and hydrogen ; some contain carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen ; some, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, and some again
contain carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. But not one of the
specimens on this tray contains anything besides these four elements.
     There is no difficulty in resolving any one of these substances into
its ultimate elements.      This sugar,')' for example, on being heated to
redness in a tube, leaves a black deposit which is carbon, whilst a
liquid which is water distils over.             If
                                               we were to electrolyse this
liquid, we should obtain hydrogen and oxygen, and so we should
exhibit carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen obtained from sugar.          Again,
   * A tray, with a number of organic        bodies     lying   upon   it,   was before   the
speaker.
  1   Cane sugar was heated to redness in   a   tube.

200                         Professor    Wanklyn                  [Feb.   12,
instead of heating this sugar in the tube without allowing the air free
access to it, we might burn it in excess of oxygen.       If  we were to do
so, we should    obtain  carbonic  acid  and  water, and, moreover,   all the
carbon    in the sugar  would  assume   the form  of carbonic  acid, and   all
the hydrogen the form of water.            So we can obtain carbon and
hydrogen, either in the free state, or in the very common and well-
known forms of combination as carbonic acid and water. Nitrogen,
when it is present, can be made to assume the form of free nitrogen.
For that purpose, all that is requisite is to heat the substance to red
ness with excess of oxygen, and to adopt certain precautions to avoid
the production of oxide of nitrogen.
     Thus, the pulling to pieces of these substances on the tray is a
matter of very little difficulty : more than fifty years ago chemists
could do that — but how to put the pieces together again is a much more
difficult task.
     Sugar consists of 72 parts by weight of carbon. 11 parts of hydrogen,
and 88 parts of oxygen.       We may bring together carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen in these proportions, and shake them up together, or heat
them or cool them, and yet we shall never get them to combine so as
to form sugar.       Alcohol consists of 24 parts of carbon, 6 parts of
hydrogen,    and  16  parts of oxygen, but no alcohol ever results from
making such a mixture.       Neither sugar nor alcohol can exist at the
temperature to which it is requisite to raise our mixture of carbon,
hydrogen, and oxygen, in order to get chemical action to set in.           At
ordinary temperature the organic elements will not enter into combi
nation, whilst at high temperatures they combine, it is true, but yield
 comparatively very few compounds.
     It was long after chemists had effected the analysis of organic
bodies before they learnt how to effect the synthesis of even one of
them, and hence the belief sprung up that organic products, such as
those on our tray, were intrinsically different from mineral products.
Whilst stones, water, and the like were regarded as having their ultimate
particles held together by mere dead forces, sugar, alcohol, &c., were
regarded as being held together by vital forces, as being in short, in
some subordinate way, alive.
     Now, no more positive refutation of this notion can be imagined
than the artificial construction of substances, in every respect, like
those obtained from the animal and vegetable kingdoms, and hence
some of the philosophical interest attached to the problem which forms
the subject of this discourse.
     The first definite example of the construction of an organic body
from inorganic materials was given by Wohler, in 1828, when he made
the organic base urea from cyanate of ammonia.
     Let us trace the steps of this process.      Cyanide of potassium — a
body which can exist at a red heat (some cyanide of potassium was
exhibited in the form of tabular masses which had been fused), and
which can moreover be formed directly from its constituents (carbon,
nitrogen, and potassium) — was oxydized by means of peroxide of

 1864.]                on tfte Synthesis of Organic Bodies.                201
manganese at a low red heat, and so cyanate of potash was obtained.
 The cyanate of potash was next converted into cyanate of ammonia by
double decomposition with sulphate of ammonia.               Thus cyanate of
ammonia was produced from its elements by a process which, although
indirect, still did not involve the action of either a plant or an
animal.      Cyanate of ammonia becomes urea, when its solution in
water is simply evaporated to dryness.
    It was curious that the first organic body to be constructed should
have been a nitrogenous compound.
    lu 1831, three years after this important discovery of Wohler's,
formic acid — the first term of the fatty acid series — was obtained from
inorganic materials by Velouze.              The process was this: — Hydro
cyanic  acid,   a body capable of being obtained from inorganic materials,
was heated either with strong alkalies or acids, and was so made to react
upon the elements of water as follows : —
       Hydrocyanic  Acid.                                   Formic Acid.
         C N H             +   2  Ht O    = N H,        +   CMiTo,
and yielded formic acid.
    It  does not appear that this research of Pelouze's attracted that
attention which it deserved.          This we must attribute to the circum
stance, that at this period the position of formic acid in the organic
series was not recognized.
    The next step of importance in organic synthesis was taken by
Kolbe in 184,5.          It was the synthesis of acetic acid, the second term
of the fatty series. Kolbe's process was this: — Sulphide of carbon,
obtained by the direct combination of carbon with sulphur at a red
heat, was submitted to the action of chlorine at a red heat, by which
means certain compounds of carbon and chlorine were obtained.              One
of the compounds, C, C1,, was then acted upon by chlorine in the pre
sence of water, and tri-chlor-acetic acid resulted.
     Having thus got tri-chlor-acetic acid by thoroughly inorganic
means, Kolbe availed himself of the observation which had been
made     of Melsens — that treatment of tri-chlor-acetic acid with
potassium-amalgam and water converted it into acetic acid.
     Kolbe was fully sensible of the scope and importance of his
discovery. The following passage occurs in his paper, published in
'
  Liebig's Annalen,' for 1845 : — " From the foregoing observations
we deduce the interesting fact that acetic acid, hitherto known
only as a product of the oxidation of organic materials, can be
built up by almost direct synthesis from its elements.             Sulphide of
carbon, chloride of carbon, and chlorine are the agents which,
along with water, accomplish the transformation of carbon into acetic
acid.    If we could only transform acetic acid into alcohol, and out of
the latter could obtain sugar and starch, then we should be enabled to
build up these common vegetable principles, by the so-called artificial
method, from their most ultimate elements." Thus it appears that
Kolbe looked forward to the building up of organic bodies in general,

 and that he was quite alive to the fact that the synthesis of acetic acid
 completed the synthesis of the derivations of acetic acid.
      Among these derivations may be enumerated acetone, the product
 of the destructive distillation of acetates ; marsh gas, obtained by
distilling an acetate with a caustic alkali ; ethylene, obtained by
 Bunsen by heating kakodyl, which itself results by the action of
 arsenious    acid upon an acetate.       The electrolysis of acetic acid,
which Kolbe accomplished a few years afterwards, yielded methyl and
oxide of methyl, which latter, in its turn, could be transformed into
any other methylic compound.
      Marsh gas was moreover prepared by Regnault, by treating C C\t
with nascent hydrogen ; and the common methylic compounds appear
to have been produced by Dumas from marsh gas, the chloride of
methyl having been obtained by Dumas by the action of chlorine upon
marsh gas.
      Before 1854, all the foregoing syntheses were fully completed,
i. e.  there was no step missing between the elements themselves and
the most complex compound reached ; but. in addition to these com
plete and definite syntheses, there had also been a good deal of building
up of an incomplete or of a less definite character before 1854.
      It was known, in a general way, that organic bodies of tolerably
simple composition sometimes gave complex products on destructive
distillation.    Thus, alcohol was known to give naphthaline, benzol, and
carbonic acid when it was pressed through a red-hot tube.          Formiates
were also known to yield hydro-carbons when they were subjected to
destructive distillation.     The precise dates of these different obser
vations I cannot give, but hand-books of chemistry, published before
18.54, contain a statement of the facts.
      A few years after 1820 — before Wohler's celebrated Synthesis of
Urea, a very remarkable instance of passage from a simpler to a more
complex compound was given by Faraday and llennell.           This example
is placed along with the indefinite syntheses because it was generally
disbelieved in by chemists, and only within the last few years, when it
was confirmed by Berthelot, received the general assent.       Faraday and
Hennell found that olefiant gas was absorbed by sulphuric acid and gave
sulpho-vinic acid, from which of course alcohol and the ethers might
be procured.      Liebig denied what Faraday and Hennell had asserted,
and the latter did not insist upon the correctness of their work, and did
not take the necessary steps for ensuring the reception of their results.
      Shortly before 1854, a most capital addition to the art of organic
synthesis was borrowed from the doctrine of the Homologous Scries.
I  will endeavour to explain it.
      Organic bodies repeat themselves : thus common alcohol has a
whole series of representatives, differing from it in formula by n (C Ht),
but resembling it very closely in chemical functions.          Alcohol, and
these   its representatives, constitute a homologous series.   Everyone of
these representatives    (homologues)   of alcohol possesses a  set of ethers
and other derivatives, just as common alcohol possesses its ethers and

 1864.]             on the Syntlieiis     of Organic U.xiies.                203
derivatives.     With certain limitations, it is true that whatever reaction
can be accomplished with one alcohol can be accomplished with any
other alcohol of the series.
     Synthesis by series will then be easily understood by an example : —
Suppose we obtain a building-up by starting with common alcohol, we
should infer that an analogous building-up could be made by starting
with any other alcohol of the series.
     Here follows a table of the homologous series of alcohols, and of
the homologous acids which are related to them : —
      Methyl alcohol           C H,0           C n8O,           Formic Acid

     A good example of synthesis by series was furnished by Frankland
and Kol be, who showed that various cyanides of the alcohol-radicles
yield the next higher acid in the series when they are digested with an
alcoholic solution of potash, thus : —
                       Cyanide of Methyl.      Acetic Add.
                         C H8C N        l_)
                                          —

                          + 2 H,O       (    I + N H,
     The effect of the alkali is to cause decomposition of water by means
of  the cyanide, and the reaction very closely resembles Pelouze's, of
 which mention has already been made.
     By means of this synthesis, which is general to the whole series,
chemists acquired a method of ascending from any given alcohol to
the acid belonging to next higher alcohol.              It will be evident, how
ever, that this step, important though it was, did not suffice to enable
chemists to march regularly up the ladder.                 The step from acetic
acid to alcohol — from an acid to an alcohol of the same carbon-
condensation, was wanting.
     This synthesis by series was an incomplete synthesis ; there was a
gap requiring to be filled up, in order that the regular march might
be made up the vinic series.
     From the foregoing, it will be seen that by the year 1854 very
considerable progress had been made in the building-up of organic
bodies from their ultimate elements.
     We now pass on to the consideration of the period comprising the
last ten years, from 1854 up to the present time.
     During this period we have had new methods of accomplishing
some of the syntheses which had been effected previously.                  Tims,

formic acid, which, as we have seen, had been formed from inorganic
materials so long ago as 1831, was built up by Berthelot by means of
carbonic oxide and caustic potash, —
                                     CO     +      KHO    =   CHKO,
and again                   Kolbe,
                      by using carbonic acid, moisture, and
                       by                                                                         sodium
(the moisture and sodium giving nascent hydrogen), —
                                 C   O8   +   H + Na = C H Na O,
Again also,  the passage from an alcohol to the next higher acid was
repeated.   Carbonic acid and a compound of an alcohol-radicle with
an alkali-metal coalesced, and formed a salt of a fatty acid thus : —
                                     Sodium-ethyl.                  Propionate   of Soda.
                        C   0,   +   Na C, Hs             =
    Still these reactions, however interesting they might be, were not
new syntheses ; they were only new methods of effecting old syntheses.
    The great problem, how to step from one alcohol to that next
above       it,
          has received    general solution from Mendius.
                                     a                    Mendiusused
cyanogen    compounds,    those hydrocyanic ethers which had already
done such good service to organic synthesis, and exposed them to the
action of nascent hydrogen, and so obtained amides of alcohol-radicles
higher than the alcohol-radicles started from. The reaction bears a
close similarity to the one which takes place between the cyanides and
alcoholic solution of potash, and which, as will be remembered, enabled
us to pass from the alcohol to the acid next above.
    Here     a scheme to show the parallel —
                  is                                           :

    Mendius was able to commence                   even with    hydrocyanic acid.        The
steps in his synthesis are these : —
                     HYDROCYANIC            ACID    TO METHYLAMINE.

Methylamine, by means of nitrous acid to methyl-alcohol : methyl-
alcohol to cyanide of methyl, well-known processes being employed to
effect this :
                     CYANIDE       OP   METHYL          TO   ETHYLAMINE.
     (2)                C    N C H. +            H4 =   C, H, N H,
    From ethylamine it is easy to get cyanide of ethyl, from which, by
a third repetition, we arrive at the propylic stage : —
     (3)               C N C, H, + 1I, = C, Hr                  N H,
   Thus the vinic series may be ascended ; thus there is reason to think
we may begin with so simple a body as prussic acid, and step by step
proceed from one alcohol to the next above                     it,
                                                    until we reach the fats
and the waxes.      There are other methods of effecting the synthesis of
the alcohol series, but none of them seem to be so complete and
satisfactory as this — Berthelot has obtained alcohols by adding the
                        :
elements of water to the olefines, and some of the defines he has
obtained by the destructive distillation of formiates         but      ;  an   it   is
open question— how many olefines can be got                    by
                                                    heating the formiates                 ?
And, at any rate, there       no precision in the preparation of olefines
                                   is
from formiates.
    A very neat and beautiful way of preparing one define, viz. com
mon olefiant gas       is,
                       however, due to Berthelot.     He exposes charcoal
to the action of hydrogen at    very high temperature — the temperature
                                        a
of the electric arc, and then union takes place, resulting in the formation
of Acetylene     :
Acetylene exposed to the action of nascent                      hydrogen in an alkaline
liquid gives olefiant gas —    :
                                   C.H.+ H,= C,H,
    Friedel and Wurtz have converted aldehydes and ketones into
alcohols    the action of nascent hydrogen, and thence there arises
            by
another method of ascending the vinic series, and besides there are a
number of other reactions which are capable of more or less general
employment for the purpose of building up the alcoholic series, but
which we have not time to particularize.
    The alcohols having been got, many other important organic
compounds follow, and there      good reason for believing that with
                                            is

the progress of the science all will be derived from them, so that
the series of the alcohols will constitute a kind of backbone to'organic
chemistry.
     Most modern organic researches are capable of being looked at
from a synthetical aspect, for they generally disclose how to devise some
organic bodies from compounds which either themselves are, or will be,
capable of complete synthesis.        Glycerine, the base of the fats, has
been derived from the propylic series, having been obtained, by Wurtz,
by a somewhat circuitous process from propylene — the define of that
series.
     The    sugars have not been, as yet, unequivocally produced, but they
will    be,  for their connection with the hexylic series is now placed
beyond a doubt. The production of glycerides from glycerine and
fatty acids is the proof that the natural fats are within our grasp. The
aromatic series with its many derivations, among which may be men
tioned the wonderful aniline dyes which rival those got more immedi
ately from the animal and vegetable kingdoms, becomes accessible to
synthesis through common alcohol, which on being heated to redness
gives benzol and carbolic acid — members of the aromatic series.
     Wurtz's compound ammonias, and above all, the immense and
wonderful development of the class of compound ammonias arising
from the labours of'llofmann are the pledge that the natural alkaloids —
quinine, morphine, strychnine, and their congeners will one day be
within our reach.
     Glycocoll, produced by Perkin and Duppa from acetic acid, and
the bases of the juice of flesh, which have been recently formed by
Vollhardt and Hofmann, assure us that albumen — that essential ingre
dient of our food— will not elude us.
     Why should those medicines and foods which we find in nature be
the most useful which are possible ?       Would it not rather be strange
if they were ?
     Hereafter, perhaps, medicines as much more potent than quinine, as
quinine is than the extracts of the commonest herb that grows wild,
may be the produce of our laboratories.

                               in the Chair.
                       W. S. Savory, Esq. F.R.S.
 On    Dreaming and Somnambulism, in relation          to  the  Functions   of
                           certain Nerve-centres.
In the first portion of the discourse a sketch was given of the general
plan of construction of the nervous system, from the simplest to the
most complex forms.       Then the different kinds of reflex action were
alluded to, and the several centres indicated which, with greater or less
certainty, are known to be concerned in their production.           Thus the
simplest and most universal form of reflex action, called excito-motor,
being not necessarily attended        by sensation or consciousness,      was
referred to the spinal cord and medulla oblongata.             Sensori-motor
actions, those which involve sensation or consciousness, but which do
not necessarily arouse ideas, were referred to certain ganglia beyond,
such as the optic thalami — the corpora striata being perhaps concerned
in motion — and the olfactory, optic, auditory, and gustatory ganglia ;
these in all probability collectively constituting what is called the sen-
sorium, each kind of sensation being produced through its own proper
ganglion.     Lastly, those acts which involve ideas, and which are there
fore called ideo-motor, were referred to the cerebrum.
      The production of what are called subjective sensations was
accounted for by the fact, that if an impression be made upon any part
of a sensitive nerve, even if in the centre to which it passes, thesen-
soriura perceiving that impression, refers it not to the part of the
nerve which is impressed, but to its periphery, to the part to which
the filaments are distributed.
      Then sleep was described as a state of rest of the sensorium and
cerebral lobes.    Its leading phenomena are the result of the suspension
of their functions — the suspension of consciousness and of the mental
faculties generally.     Sleep is to the brain what rest is to every organ
of the body.
      Of Dreaming it was said,
      When sleep is partial or imperfect the functions of those ganglia,
 whose rest is sleep, will not be entirely suspended.      They will remain,
 in some measure, active.      Impressions will still be recognized by the
 cerebral hemispheres,    and  will give rise to ideas.     Thus dreams are

208                         Mr.   W. S. Savory                    [Feb.  19,
produced.       Dreams, therefore, are the result of imperfect exercise of
the hemispheres when in a state of partial repose.      There may be total
absence of consciousness    of external things, and yet withal a state of
mental activity, varying greatly in degree and duration.
      Dreams then occur when sleep is not profound.      They cannot arise
during complete repose.
      There is no sufficient reason to deny the existence of a period of
complete unconsciousness, of complete suspension of the mental facul
ties.    Doubtless the brain, like other organs, is at times in absolute
repose.     While dreaming, sleep must be considered imperfect.
      Again, if the general view here expressed be the correct one, that
dreaming is the natural condition of imperfect repose, there is no good
reason for denying the supervention of dreams at any period of sleep.
      There can be little doubt that dreams are very transient ; but the
evidence of the extreme rapidity which has been assigned to all of them
is defective.     Of course the duration of dreams bears no comparison
to that of the events and circumstances which they picture ; but looking
at the relation of dreaming to somnambulism, their frequent con
currence, the period occupied by day-dreams, and the time that
disturbed sleep and other indications of dreaming will sometimes last,
it is perhaps more reasonable to conclude that some dreams are not so
instantaneous as many imagine.
      It is highly probable that all animals with cerebral hemispheres
dream.      This conclusion, which naturally follows on the view here
taken of the nature of dreams, is confirmed by observation.
      When impressions reach the cerebral hemispheres they arouse ideas.
Impressions may be objective, arising from without, what we call real ;
or subjective, arising from within, what we call fancies.     The exciting
cause of dreams then may come from without or from within.
      As the chief feature of sleep is a state of unconsciousness, so in
general the remarkable feature of dreaming appears to be an absence
of the power of will over the current of thought and over action.
Thus ideas are aroused in rapid succession without guidance or correc
tion, but no volitional acts are accomplished. Hence the frequent in
coherence and inconsistency of dreams.       Of course there are all degrees
of this. Dreams may be and often are consistent and rational, whether
 from the more complete exercise of the cerebral lobes or from the
nature of the impressions which excite them ; but oftentimes they are
characterized by a strange want of regulation and co-ordination of the
 ideas which represent them.      When, therefore, we dream what we call
 nonsense, it is because there is a partial or complete absence of volun
 tary control over the current of thought, and because we cannot com
 pare our conceptions and ideas with surrounding objects and circum
 stances and thus correct them.
      The extent to which the ideas that constitute dreams are coherent
 depends probably in great measure upon whether they are habitual or
  strange to the waking state.    When the will is not alert old ideas are
 more apt to be orderly than new ones, for the former may fall into

1864      ]            on Dreaming and Somnambulism.                       209
their accustomed sequence, whereas the latter have not even habit to
arrange them.        Everyone knows, for instance, how an idea excited by
an impression may forthwith arouse a train of others which have been
before associated with it.       Thus for the most part dreams are rational
in proportion as they arise out of existing circumstances.
       In comparing then the condition of the mind in dreaming with its
 active state while awake, we are led to notice these distinguishing
 features   : —
       The will  is in abeyance.    It ceases to control, or rather to direct,
 the   current of thought.
       The correcting influence of external impressions is suspended.
       Impressions conveyed to the brain, when awake, excite ideas which
 are, for the most part, in a healthy mind, subjected to the regulating
 influence of the will ; and if they give rise to acls, these are voluntary
 and rational.      But when the influence of the will is suspended, and it
 ceases to direct the current of thought, the acts which such ideas thus
 produced may at once excite are often strikingly irrational or altogether
 absurd.      Such examples may be seen in persons intoxicated by alcohol,
  chloroform, or laughing gas.
        As in these cases, so, and in the same way, it is doubtless possible
  sometimes t o lead the ideas during sleep, when not profound, by means
  of external impressions, and even to determine their nature. Thus
  gloomy ideas may be suggested by a dull tone of the voice, while
  cheerful ones may be aroused by lively sounds.          In the same way the
  ideas may l>e adapted to certain conditions in which a person may be
  placed.     Every work on the subject contains some illustrations of this.
        And just as a dream may be started by an external impression, so
  an impression made upon any of the senses during a dream will often
  times fall into the current of ideas then flowing through the mind.
  Thus a noise may become the report of fire-arms, or the shout of a
  multitude, or a peal of bells, or something else, according to the subject
   of the dream.
        The nature of dreams in their relation to the absence of the correcting
   influence of surrounding circumstances is well illustrated by the effect
   of darkness and silence on delirium.       The phantoms which then arise,
   the correcting influence of external circumstances being shut out, will
   often at once disappear in the presence of light, or at the sound of a
   well-known voice.
         There is a peculiar condition of the mind often occurring in some
    persons which is well expressed by the phrase, day-dreaming.         In this
    state the ideas are allowed to flow on without control.       They are not
    restrained by any effort of the will.      In the worst form they are not
    even co-ordinated.     One idea suggests another, and so on, until the
    thoughts have wandered far away from the original subject.         Nothing
    is seen but the visions of fancy.     The most improbable, nay, impos
    sible, prospects are conjured up and contemplated either as present
     or future realities, and no attempt is made to check or control the
     most extravagant or erroneous conclusions.        Here, however, at least

210                         Mr. W. S. Sutory                      [Feb. 19,
at the outset, there is an indisposition rather than an inability to
reason.
     When in this state, a person is said to build castles in the air. The
mind is wholly withdrawn from the consideration of external and
surrounding circumstances, and revels in the luxuriance of its thoughts.
 This is really a dreaming state, although, owing to the activity of the
sensorium, day-dreams are more readily corrected by external circum
stances.
     Indeed, if we attend at all to the state of our mind, we must
 observe that it varies widely, and during a considerable portion of our
waking hours, in many persons, especially in the young, its condition
is not far removed from that of day-dreaming.      When we are not at
work, when the attention is not fixed, during periods of leisure, the
intellect is wont to escape insensibly from the control and direction of
 the will, and to wander far on into the regions of thought, one idea
suggesting another, which forthwith takes its place.     One step further,
and the influence of surrounding circumstances is almost shut out, and
the imagination revels without restraint.      Then we may be said to
dream.
     Day-dreaming or reverie, and the dreams of sleep, are connected
by a peculiar phase of dreaming, which sometimes occurs when the
sleep is unusually light, or more often when we are awakening out of
sleep.    In this state the sensorium is more or less active. We are
conscious.    It is characterized, moreover, by a partial and imperfect
control over the current of thought, and a voluntary effort, in some
degree successful,    is made to prolong agreeable ideas, and to dispel
gloomy ones. This condition must be familiar to everyone as occurring
at the dawn of day, before rising.
     Again, everyone knows that a dream out of which we have
awakened is very liable to recur if we soon fall asleep again. Such
cases tend to establish the relation between our sleeping and waking
thoughts. By watching and analyzing the phenomena, we can observe
how insensibly they pass into each other, the vision of our sleep rising
into ascendancy as the influence of external impressions and-of the will
is withdrawn.
     Of Somnambulism.
     Now, just as dreams may be regarded as due to partial activity of
the cerebral lobes when in a state of imperfect repose, so may the
condition termed Somnambulism be regarded as essentially the result
of a state of more or less complete activity of the sensorium, the
hemispheres beyond being nevertheless at rest.
     In what may be called the purest form of somnambulism various
acts may be accomplished in the most perfect manner, as the direct
result of impressions, without any evidence of the intervention of ideas.
     But although in somnambulism impressions do not necessarily
arouse ideas, yet they nevertheless produce sensations and determine
sensori-motor acts. That they reach the sensorium and are not merely

1864.]              on  Dreaming and Somnambulism.                       211
excito-motor in their nature, is evident from their results. Sounds are
sometimes heard and objects recognized by the sight and touch.
      The term somnambulism appears to be very loosely employed. In
its most common acceptation        a combination of dreaming and som
nambulism is implied.        Perhaps, indeed, this is the most common
form of somnambulism.         Not only is the sensorium active, but the
hemispheres themselves are partially awake. But although the descrip
tion usually given of somnambulism would imply an active state of
the cerebral hemispheres as well as of the sensorium, would include a
state which is essentially that of dreaming — so that somnambulism is
described as an " acted dream "—yet while admitting that this more
complicated condition may be a common one, it is in the highest degree
important to recognize the fact, that a state may occur in which some
or all of the sensorial centres are active, the cerebrum itself being
nevertheless in a state of complete repose, the actions which result
 being simply sensori-motor, or instinctive ones.        Thus no ideas are
aroused, and nothing is remembered.        This may be described as the
 simplest and purest form of somnambulism.
      It seems, then, that the clearest and most correct idea will be
 obtained of these two states, and of their relation to each other, by
 regarding them as manifestations of various degrees of activity of those
 centres which in profound sleep pass into a state of complete repose :
 that either alone may be active while the other is at rest, or both together
 in imperfect sleep, may exhibit all degrees of partial activity in various
 proportion, short of that thorough and complete exercise of their
 functions when wide awake.
      It appears that this view will afford an insight into certain facts
 which do not otherwise admit of explanation.
      Dreaming is more frequent than somnambulism, because of all
 portions of the nervous system the cerebral lobes are the most sensitive
 to variations in the quantity and quality of blood circulating through
  them.    Witness the effects of alcohol, ether, and chloroform.
      Somnambulism is more common in the young, because then the
 sensorial centres are more prone to activity.      With regard to dreams,
  the rule is less general, being influenced by habits of mental exercise.
      The remembrance of dreams, not of somnambulistic acts. It is
  important to note the absence of memory in somnambulism.                 It
  appears that acts purely somnambulistic are never remembered             or
  recalled. This seems to point to their nature. They find their parallel
  in instinctive actions.
      The dexterity and accuracy of somnambulistic acts, for example,
  of muscular movements in walking.         Perhaps, in this case, the cere
  bellum is awake also.
      The somnambulist walks across a narrow plank, over a frightful
  chasm, steadily, and without fear. Why ? Because the act is a sensori
  motor one. and no idea is called into play. For the same reason a
  person wide awake may accomplish the same feat in the same manner,
  if the danger be concealed from him. if he have no idea of it. In

212              Mr. W. S. Savory     on   Dreaming,   fyc.          [Feb.         19,
the former case he may see    it, but has no idea of it. In the latter he
has no idea of it  because he cannot see it.
     In this view of the matter, therefore, the actions of the somnam
bulist are essentially of the nature of instinctive ones.          A careful
analysis  of  them  will  show  that they possess  this  character.   In the
simplest   and   purest  form  of somnambulism    as  in  the simplest and
purest examples of instinctive acts, there   not any satisfactory evidence
                                            is
of the operation of the intellectual powers. In either case         seen the
                                                                   is
adaptation of means to ends, but there       isno evidence of the inter
vention of ideas, of the calculation of consequences, of reason.        This
difference, however, must be noted in the two cases. The operations
of instinct are invariably associated with an active and acute state of
the senses.    In somnambulism all the senses are not commonly in full
activity.
     Summarily, then, these several states may be thus contrasted —      :
     In profound sleep there are no acts beyond excito-motor ones,
and even these are reduced.
     In somnambulism there are, beyond these, sensori-motor acts.
    In dreaming, ideas are aroused.
    Dreaming, or    a combination of the two, must be distinguished
from purely   somnambulistic   acts.  Perhaps in the most common form
of somnambulism dreaming is, to       a  greater or less extent, combined
with it. Thus somnambulism      ispresented under various forms, accord
ing to the absolute and relative degree of activity of the different senses,
and the condition of the cerebral lobes.    All forms occur from merely
turning in sleep, to walking, talking, writing, and so forth.
    And as in somnambulism some degree of activity of the cerebral
lobes may be associated with an active state of the sensorium, so in
dreaming some degree of activity of the sensorium may be combined
with an active state of the cerebral lobes.
    In those cases of so-called somnambulism, in which acts are per
formed which involve    a  considerable exercise of the mental powers,
the simply somnambulistic state must be combined with vivid dreaming.
In this combination so many of the faculties are more or -less active,
so few, if any, completely at rest, that the individual        more awake
                                                              is

Mr. Prestwich remarked upon the imputation of rashness, and even
of credulity, which discoveries such as that of the flint implements often
entailed upon geologists.         He contended that geologists were, on the
contrary, generally disposed to be incredulous.               At one time they
 believed that Fishes were no older than the Carboniferous strata ; that
 Reptiles first appeared during the Liassic period ; and that Mammalia
 could not be traced beyond the Tertiary strata ; and it was a long time
 before they were satisfied that Fishes go back to the Silurian, Reptiles
 to the Carboniferous,*      and Mammalia to the Triassic period.       And so
 with Man. Ten years ago there was scarcely a geologist in this country
 who would not have deemed the occurrence of the works of man in any
 beds older than the recent Alluvium impossible. The discoveries made
 by Tournal and Christol in the south of France, thirty years since, of
  the remains of man associated with those of extinct mammalia, were
  rejected by geologists unanimously ; nor were the analogous discoveries
  of Schmerling in Belgium more favourably received ; whilst Frere's
  remarkable notice, so far back as 1797, of the discovery, at Hoxne, in
  SuiTolk, of flint weapons mixed up with the bones of large extinct
                                                                         /
   animals, was allowed to lie dormant for sixty years.
        Even so late as 1855, a communication by the Torquay Natural
   History Society, respecting the occurrence of worked flints with the
   fossil bones in Kent's Cave, — a fact already, years before, noticed by
   the Rev. Mr. M'Enery and by Mr. Godwin-Austen, — was deemed, by
   the Geological Society, too improbable for publication.
       Mr. Prestwich doubted whether, prior to 1858 and 1859, there were
   twenty men of science in Europe who would have admitted the possibility
   of the contemporaneity of man and of the extinct mammalia.            He in
    stanced Dr. Grant as one of the small number who, on abstract principles,
                         * Possibly to the Old Red Sandstone.

  214                Mr.  J.  Preslwich on the  Position,  lye.       [Feb.  26,
  treated the question as an open one.      lie also noticed the tone of confi
  dent disbelief with which the asserted occurrence of flint implements in
  certain geological deposits in the Somme valley was spoken of when
  he made inquiries respecting this subject in Paris in 1856 and 1857,
  and which for a time turned him from the inquiry.              Such instances
  might be multiplied.       The speaker did not bring them forward as indi
  cating any perverse opposition, but to show how reluctant geologists
  were to abandon the belief generally held on this subject without the
  clearest proofs, and close and careful search on their part. Such, he
  remarked, is the inevitable progress of all discovery. Facts deemed
 contradictory to received theory are often long rejected, some as clearly
  failing in proof, others as non-proven. Evidence is hesitatingly received,
 and has to force its way through a resisting stratum of incredulity ;
  but, as in the searching resistance offered by close tissues in the sepa
 ration of mercury from its dross, that portion which passes through
 issues the brighter and purer the more difficult the transit, and the
 stronger the pressure exercised.
     Allusion was then made to the distinguished palaeontologist. Dr.
 Falconer— one man of science at least in this country with whom the
 conviction that the remains of man might be traced back to periods
 greatly antecedent to our ordinary records, had grown, during a long
 course of years, from probabilities suggested by Eastern research, into
 certainty established by extensive investigation among the European
 fossil-bone caves.     Referring to his late exploration of Brixham Cave
 in 1858, the attention which the well-certified discovery of flint imple
 ments in undoubted association with the remains of extinct mammalia
 and of reindeer attracted amongst geologists was remarked upon.            The
 speaker visited the cave in company with Mr. Pengelly, and was much
 struck with the force of the evidence, though, for various reasons, he
 considered that cave evidence alone was not sufficient.         Urged by Dr.
 Falconer to go and examine the geological evidence respecting the flint
 implements in the valley of the Somme, he afterwards paid his long-
 intended visit to Abbeville (where he, on the very first day, was fortu
 nate enough to find three worked flints at Menchecourt).              He was
joined, on the next day, at Amiens, by his friend Mr. John Evans. The
geological evidence, and the character of the Flint Implements, satisfied
them both that here again was an undoubted case of contemporaneity of
 the works of man with the remains of the extinct Mammalia.             All the
author has since     seen  on  many subsequent   visits to the  Somme   valley,
sometimes alone, but more frequently in company with other geologists,
has tended to confirm his first opinion.       He then proceeded to notice
some of the phenomena            he had seen, and to give his conclusions
respecting them.       He had intended to have described the several loca
lities in France and England at which flint implements had been found,
but found that time would not allow his going beyond Amiens.               This
 was the less important, as Mr. Lubbock had so recently given an able
account in the same room of most of these places ; and his auditors
were probably most of them acquainted with the more general account

1864.]              of the Quaternary Flint I|nfilemenls.               215
                                                              '
given by Sir Charles Lyell in his recent work on the            Antiquity of
Man.'
      Mr. Prestwich then went on      to describe the remarkable discovery
of M. Boucher de Perthes, and        how much honour and credit were due
 to him for his untiring perseverance, in face of general discouragement,
for a period of twenty years, and for twelve years after the publication
of his    elaborate work, 'Antiquites Celtiques et Antediluviennes.'     In
 cited by this work, Dr. Uigollot, an antiquary of Amiens, discovered
 Flint Implements in great numbers near that town ; but his careful
 memoir on the subject, although it attracted the momentary attention of
 some French geologists, was allowed to drop comparatively unnoticed.
 Geologists admitted the antiquity of the beds, and antiquaries admitted
 the workmanship of the implements ; but neither would own to a con
joint interest and belief in them.
       Before entering upon the details of the sections, Mr. Prestwich
 proceeded to make a few remarks upon the conditions under which the
 flint-implement-bearing beds were found, and how their importance and
 the time they represent were to be judged of.        He observed that sea-
formed deposits afforded massive and tangible monuments of the length
of time required for their accumulation. But on land, time passes, and
 builds no such monuments of its duration.        The sand and shingle beds
of a rapid river would be little, if at all, thicker now than a thousand
years ago, for, instead of accumulating in the channel of that river,
they are incessantly removed, and carried eventually out to sea, where
 they contribute to the formation of the great sedimentary deposits con
stantly going on there.      The time represented by river deposits (apart
 from the recent silty alluvia) is not therefore to be measured by their
 thickness; and we must not attach the less importance to the beds con
 taining the Flint Implements, because, being formed by river action,
 they are necessarily small, fragmentary, and superficial.      But while in
 the sea the accumulation of matter has formed a relative measure of
 time, on land the extent of denudation resulting from the removal of a
 portion of that matter supplies an obverse scale.       In the former case
 the lapse of time is chronicled by constantly accruing deposits, whereas
 in the latter case the deposits cannot exceed a certain thickness.    They
 are constant quantities, and their dimensions are no measure of their
 age.     The only test of their age consists in their organic remains, and
 in the depth of the valleys below the terraces on which portions of them
 are lodged.      In speaking of river action, the author does not refer to
 the slow and sluggish streams of this country, but to the more active
 streams of countries of greater rainfall, or to old conditions of former
 periods.
       Mr. Prestwich then proceeded to refer to a large pictorial section
 of the celebrated pit at St. Acheul, near Amiens. The artist had not
  visited Amiens, but had skilfully contrived to give a sufficiently accu
  rate representation of the town and valley, for the purpose of showing
  the general relation which the ground there bore to the surrounding
  district.   The details of the pit were, however, all given from actual

216                       Mr.   J. Preslwich   on the Position, $c.         [Feb.   26,
survey by the speaker. The surface of the ground at the pit is 100 feet
above the level of the Somme, which flows in the valley at the foot of
the hill.     The valley itself is about one mile broad. The hills on
either side, rising to a height of 200 to 300 feet, consist of chalk, with
a few and distant cappings of tertiary strata.
     On platforms of various breadths, generally on the top of low hills
adjoining the valley, patches of gravel occur at intervals more or less
long from the lower to the upper end of the valley, whilst a more connected
series of gravel beds skirts the base of the valley.         The chief portion
of the valley        however, occupied by alluvial beds, beneath which
                    is,
the last-mentioned gravels with their brick-earth, pass.
     The higher level gravels rarely contain organic remains.           The pit
at St. Acheul affords        singularly good example of these beds, and
                                 a                                                   is
unusually rich in organic remains, and also in flint implements.

     These beds repose upon a base of chalk.        The site having been long
occupied as Gallo-Roman cetneiery, the upper brick-earth
               a                                                           inter

sected with pits and graves — in some there are stone, or rather hard chalk,
coffins, whilst in others the nails and iron-work alone remain, the wood
having entirely decayed away.          These portions of disturbed ground are
easily recognized           by
                           their darker colour, their contents, but more
especially     bythe break they produce in the stratification of the beds.
 So long as the ground         undisturbed the lines of the brick-earth, the
                                  is
lamination of the sands, and the rough bedding of the gravel are con
tinued in horizontal planes without break.            Any interference from
above breaks these lines and mixes the different beds, and renders the
disturbance at once apparent.         In the absence of any such indications
it    to be assumed the fossils and the flint implements are
     is                                                             undisturbed

ground    .
     The Flint Implements are found scattered irregularly through the
gravel, but they are more numerous in the lower part.               It has been
estimated that there       one implement to one cubic yard of gravel. They
                            is
occur singly, and as far as we know, lying flat.          The spot where one
was found in situ by Mr. Flower was pointed out                the section, and
                                                                  in
also the spot where the speaker and Mr. Evans extracted one.               These
worked flints partake of all the mineral characters of the gravel — the
result of contemporaneous dep isition. Some retain their original dark
colour, others are stained yellow and brown — some have their outer
surface converted to          bright white — many are incrusted with thin
                                 a
patches   of carbonate  of lime — and many again exhibit dendritic markings

— all being conditions in perfect harmony with the mass of broken
subangular flints composing the body of the gravel, of which they are,
in fact, component parts, showing one and the other like characters of
age.       Several hundred specimens of flint implements from this pit have
passed under the speaker's inspection ; thirty selected specimens were
exhibited, showing the principal forms which prevailed, and in which
the workmanship and design were most apparent.                        Few can feel any
doubt who inspect a series of this nature.                It is not so much evidence
of art and skill that we look for, but primarily of design. The speaker
did not dwell on this point, which is now generally accepted.                       It   has
been well treated by Mr. Evans and others.
      The fossils consist of perfect and uninjured, though very friable,
land and fresh-water shells in the following proportion, and of bones,
mostly broken, and teeth of the following animals. The list is neces

      Proceeding          to interrogate the section with a view to determine the
 causes which          led to the formation of these beds, the nature of the
 climate which then prevailed and their age, the following conclusions
 were deduced : —
       1. The mineral ingredients of the gravel are chiefly broken flints
 derived from the chalk of the district in general, but with these there
 occur fragments and blocks of tertiary sandstone and tertiary fossils,
  which could only have come from places 10 to 20 miles higher up the
  valley.       Therefore the agency, whatever it was, that brought the debris
  here must have proceeded              in a direction down the present valley, the
  tertiary     dtSbris   being    found along that line as far as the sea. Further,
  the cause could not have been a general one extending beyond the
  present hydrographical basin, for none of the older rock debris from
  the valley of the Oise, which is only separated by a water-shed six miles
  broad from that of the Somme, passes from it into the latter valley.
        2. The presence of freshwater shells in some of the intercalated
  beds, many such as live in clear and rapid streams, indicate a probable
   fluviatile origin for these deposits.
      Vol. IV. (No. 39.)                                                          «

218               Mr.  J. Preslunch on  the Position, $c.         [Feb. 26,
     3. The mammalian remains and land shells give evidence of dry
land.    The occasional occurrence of bones in the position they hold
 during life show that the carcases and limbs of animals were dropped
into the old shingle before they were freed from their integuments, or
within a short time after death — whilst the perfect state of preservation
of the land shells is an indication of their not having been trans
ported far.
     All these characters tend to prove that these beds are to be referred
to old river action. This, however, must have taken place when the
river occupied a level about 100 feet higher than it does now. It is
true that similar gravels, containing similar mammalian remains and
also flint implements, occur at lower levels (40 feet) in the valley,
whence it is inferred that similar causes were in operation when these
also were deposited.      But it is plain that the two could not have
been deposited at the same time.     For the deposition of the high-level
gravels on the supposition that the valley had been previously excavated,
would have required a river at some times filling a channel more than
a mile wide, and 100 feet deep — a state of things not to be accounted
for under any circumstances. The alternative therefore of a river
flowing at the higher level and gradually excavating its channel is
adopted.
     The character of the climate may be inferred from the fauna. The
land and freshwater shells are of species now living in France, but they
also range as far north as Russia, Finland, and Siberia.          They are
therefore such as, though occurring in temperate climates, are capable
of existing in high northern latitudes. The animal remains furnish
more positive testimony. The woolly Mammoth and Rhinoceros were
fitted by their coating to endure the rigours of a cold climate, such as
Russia and Siberia, where their remains abound, and where they seem to
have fed on the vegetation common to such latitudes.           A species of
Tiger now lives in Central Asia, and is often tracked and hunted down
in the winter on the snow and frozen lakes of that region. The Rein
deer, of which we have the remains in the valley of the Somme, and the
Musk Ox, which occurs in the same deposits in the valley of the Thames,
indicate still more clearly the northern tendencies of this group. There
is a difficulty about the Hippopotamus, but the elephant and rhino
ceros originally presented    the same difficulty ; and there seems no
reason why in this case also the extinct species should not be found to
have been fitted to live in a severe climate.
     These conclusions are corroborated by the physical phenomena.
Mr. Prestwich pointed on the large section to numerous blocks of sand
stone but little worn, and varying in weight from  \ to 5 tons, which could
hardly have been carried and deposited, as now found, by water alone.
He also showed various contortions in the upper beds of gravel (whilst
the lower ones were hardly disturbed), and in the laminated sands
overlying them.     These he attributed to ice-action.      The blocks, to
transport from places higher up the valley on ice-floes at the breaking
up of the ice in the spring, and the contortions to the grounding of ice

1864.]            of the Quaternary Flint Implements.                    219
floes on the soft sand and loose gravel, impinging into them and piling
up the gravel, as now occurs on the banks of some of the Canadian
rivers.   He pointed especially to the pendant masses of brick-earth
isolated in the upper part of the sands, and which he attributed to
angular masses of ice brought down in flood time, grounding on the
brick-earth and pushing a portion of it into the underlying beds of
sand, where, as the ice gradually melted, it would be left, caught, and
squeezed in by the sand pressing itself into place again.
     The two classes of evidence are, therefore, conformable.       It
                                                                     is in
harmony also with the existence of the large beds of brick-earth or
Loess overlying the gravel, and which is doubtlessly the deposit of the
old river during floods, usual in a severe climate at the time of the
melting of the winter snows.      The winter climate may probably have
been as rigorous as that of Northern        Russia or Northern Canada.
Such a climate would not be any bar to the presence of man, whose
works are found in these old shingle beds.     It is true that none of his
remains have yet been found in these deposits, but they are found in
caves of the same age. The abundance of animal remains is the almost
inevitable consequence of a country subject to great river floods, by
which large numbers of animals are always destroyed and swept down ;
man, on the contrary, guards against such risks. Along the Northern
American rivers of the present day, although the remains of the buffalo
and other animals occur in profusion, the remains of man are scarcely
ever met with.     There is every reason to expect that this further and
desirable proof may be forthcoming at no long distance of time.
     Lastly, the speaker stated that the present river Somme only
carries down fine silt and mud, whereas the old river transported
large masses of coarse shingle ; therefore, it is to be inferred that the
old river was one of much greater power than the present one.
 During floods especially, its power must have been very great ; with
greater transporting power the river would possess greater excavating
power ; at the same time the disintegration of rocks, especially such
soft rocks as the chalk of this district, produced by severe cold, com
 bined with the effects of ground ice lifting up from the bed of the
 river large quantities of the shingle, would hasten the deepening of the
 valley.   As it deepened, terraces of shingle have been left at places
on the slopes.    Itmay be difficult to imagine a river with so limited a
collecting   ground filling a valley a mile wide, but this the speaker
supposes to have been the case only during floods, and that the ordinary
channel of the river was very much smaller.         He instanced a case in
India where Dr. Hooker mentions a river which was only 80 yards wide
when he crossed    it,but which after the rains covered  a   channel 3 miles
wide, and  ran 10  to  12 feet  deep.    The   melting  of  the snow  in  the
spring produces   the   same  result  in arctic regions  as  heavy and   con
tinued rains in southern regions.
    Mr. Prestwich next exhibited      a   diagram to show what he con
ceived to be the different phases of the phenomena,         from the period
when the beds of St. Acheul were formed, until the valley assumed

     banks of St. Acheul. — In this the bed of the river was occupied
     with large shingle banks, which were left dry during the time the
     river was low.     Mr. Prestwich supposes these to have been resorted
     to by early man, in consequence of the number of large flints they
     contained, for making flint implements on the spot.           This may be one
    of the reasons why they are so numerous at St. Acheul, which was
    shown to be one of those old shingle banks preserved from that time.
    Ice-floes dropped large blocks of sandstone into the shingle. A space
    shut off in part by a shingle bank would account for the more tranquil
    accumulation of the middle sand beds of St. Acheul, and for the more
    numerous shells living then.- undisturbed. During floods the river rose
    probably to a height of 20 to 30 feet above its ordinary level, as shown
    by the brick-earth (without gravel) deposited higher up the hill on the
    road to Cagny.      The next stage showed —
         2. The gravel beds of St. Acheul after they were left dry, except
    during floods. — Here the valley had been excavated to several feet
    below the level of the St. Acheul beds, but during floods the river still
   extended over them and deposited the brick-earth.            Ice-floes grounded
   and indented the upper beds of sand and gravel, causing contortion of
   the strata.
         3. The river at the time of the formation of the low-level gravel
   beds of St. Roch and Amiens. — The valley had now deepened to the
   extent of 50 to 60 feet below the level of St. Acheul, and the low-
   level gravels of St. Roch were deposited under similar conditions, only
   that ice-action is not so strongly marked.         It is in these beds that the
  remains of the Hippopotamus first appear.           The flint implements found
  in them are of a somewhat different type to those of the higher level
  gravels.      The flake form is more prevalent.
        4. The low-level gravel of St. Roch, left dry except during floods.
  — Here we have a repetition of the same state of things as found at
  St. Acheul ; the shingle being covered up during floods by brick-
  earth or loess.
        5. The valley at the present period. — The progress of excavation
  shows the valley deepened to its full extent.         The river has lost its old
 power,     its flood  waters   now  rising only 2 to 3 feet, and its channel
 being restricted      within   a very narrow compass.        The old and rough
 channel left at the end of the Quaternary period is covered to the
 depth of 10 to 20 feet by fine alluvial soil and peat.              All the great
 pachyderms       have  become    extinct, but  the  reindeer,   bison, and great
 fossil ox survived during part of the more modern time.                Almost all
the small and fragile land and freshwater shells have continued in
uninterrupted descent to the present day.           This fact seems almost con
clusive against any general cataclysm having passed over the surface.
This concordance between the physical features and the contemporary
life, and the capability the hypothesis here offered gives of explaining

1864.]           of the Quaternary Flint Implements.                      221
each and every one     of   the phenomena,    affords strong presumptive proof
of its truth.
     Before concluding, Mr. Prestwich observed that he might be ex
pected to say a few words respecting the age of the Flint Implements.
Two questions were involved in this: One, the length of time elapsed
since the close of the period of the extinct mammalia ; the other, how
far back into that period the flint implements can be traced.       In the
description of the sections, it had been previously pointed out, that the
Quaternary period could probably be brought down immediately to the
time when our valleys began their modern accumulation of silt and
peat. The period of time, therefore, first to be measured, is that which
has been required for the formation of these latter deposits.      On this
point   there is considerable  difference of opinion amongst geologists.
The occasion did not afford time to enter into the details of the question,
and the speaker therefore contented himself with an expression of
opinion offered with reserve. He considered that more time and better
data were required to make a sure estimate; nevertheless, he was
satisfied that the evidence, as it exists, does not warrant the extreme
length of time so frequently supposed. — The recent alluvia covering
the latest quaternary deposits of our valleys are rarely more than 40
feet thick, — in most cases not more than 20 feet.    The rate of accu
mulation, though it may often be slow, is very variable.       A
                                                               Roman road
in the valley of the Lea was found covered by 2 feet only of alluvium.
Another such road in Cambridgeshire was covered with 5 feet of
alluvium.     The entire depth of the alluvium was not, however, ascer
tained in either case. M. Rozet gives another instance of a Roman road,
which he considers to have been kept in repair until about the eighth cen
tury, traversing the valley of the Dheune. Its paved and even surface is
now covered by 1 2i inches of alluvial soil. A little lower down the valley,
this alluvium, which is very uniform, has been ascertained to be about
 13 feet thick.   This he estimates would have required for its accumu
lation about 10,000 years.      The alluvial soil reposes there immediately
on the so-called diluvium.      The rapidity with which the alluvial soil
will accumulate under favourable conditions is often very much greater.
In places, thick beds of alluvium and of peat have been formed since
the Roman occupation.        Looking at these facts, and at the general
fact, that, as a rule, in the valleys of the Somme and of the Thames for
example, the Roman, British, or Gaulish remains are found at a depth
from the surface bearing a considerable proportion to the entire thick
ness of the alluvium, the probability        is,
                                             that the commencement     of the
alluvial deposits is  not to be carried back indefinitely.
     One reason for believing the accumulation of the silty alluvium of
our valleys to have been more rapid at one time than now,          that these
                                                                   is
valleys, left rude and rugged at the end of the Quaternary period, would
be subject to more frequent floods until their inequalities were filled up
and levelled. Mr. Prestwich concluded by observing that — ''For these
and various other reasons    I  am confirmed in the opinion   I  expressed in
 1859, that the evidence, as    itstood, seemed to me as much to necessitate

222      Mr.  J. Prestwich  on Quaternary    Flint Implements.     [Feb. 26,
the bringing forward of the extinct animals towards our own time, as
 the carrying back of man in geological time. In making that observation
 I had chiefly in view the distance of time at which the last of the great
 extinct mammalia disappeared.      If there should have been, between the
modern valley alluvia and the latest quaternary beds, some intervening
period of time of which we are ignorant, that distance may be materially
prolonged. If, on the contrary, they followed in immediate succession,
and 1 think we have evidence that such was the case, for there seems
reason to believe that some of the large pachyderms still existed at the
commencement       of the alluvial period, whilst we know that many of
the ruminants lived on uninterruptedly from one period to the other,
I  do not, for my part, see any geological reasons why the great extinct
mammalia should not have lived down to comparatively recent times,
possibly not further back than 8,000 to 10,000 years.
     " But  this only brings us to the threshold of that dim and mysterious
antiquity in which first appear those rudely-wrought flints, — those
evident works of design — those palpable shadowings of man.            Here
our chronology fails us altogether.      If we look at our broad and long
valleys, and then at the comparatively small streams now winding
through them, and suppose these streams to have been the same in past
times as they now are, we could hardly avoid the conclusion that the
time required to produce such excavations with such means must be
almost incalculable.     But if the view here proposed be correct, it would
follow that with rivers so large in proportion to those now occupying
the same valleys, with floods of a force now unknown in the same
districts, with a cold so severe as to shatter the rocks, and to hasten the
removal of their debris, we should have, I contend, agencies in operation
so far exceeding in power any now acting in these countries, that it is
impossible to apply the same rules to the two periods. The changes
described must have progressed with a rapidity of which we, at the
present day. can in these latitudes hardly form an adequate conception.
     " But although I would shorten the Quaternary period by the extent
of the differences here alluded to, it still remains of great length and
importance, stretching back into a far remote antiquity, and it is far
into this period that we have traced these works of man.        Although at
present we are without a scale or measure to determine that antiquity, we
need not abandon the hope, that, by continued and careful observation,
we may eventually succeed in forming some comparative estimate of it.
The first men who, after traversing the plains of Lombard)', approached
the Alps, could scarcely have failed to realize their vast dimensions,
although without the means to determine their exact height ; so we,
from the relative magnitude of the phenomena and the variation of life,
can sufficiently well realize the remoteness of the time in question,
although we do not yet possess the data whereby to measure its dura
tion, and determine its exact distance from our own time."

SIR HENRY HOLLAND,          Bart.   M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. Vice-President,
                                in the Chair.

    On    the Discrimination of Organic Bodies          by their  Optical
                                  Properties.
The    chemist who deals with the chemistry of inorganic substances has
ordinarily under his hands bodies endowed with very definite reactions,
and possessing great stability, so as to permit of the employment of
energetic reagents.     Accordingly he may afford to dispense with the
aids supplied by the optical properties of bodies, though even to him
they might be of material assistance.         The properties alluded to are
such as can be applied to the scrutiny of organic substances ; and
therefore the examination of the bright lines in flames and incandescent
vapours is not considered. This application of optical observation,
though not new in principle (for it was clearly enunciated by Mr. Fox
Talbot more than thirty years ago), was hardly followed out in relation
to chemistry, and remained almost unknown to chemists until the pub
lication of the researches of Professors Bunsen and Kirchhoff, in con
sequence of which it has now become universal.
     But while the chemist who attends to inorganic compounds may
confine himself without much loss to the generally-recognized modes of
research, it is to his cost that the organic chemist, especially one who
occupies himself with proximate analysis, neglects the immense assist
ance which in many cases would be afforded him by optical examination
of the substances under his hands.          It is true that the method is of
limited application, for a great number of substances possess no
marked optical characters ; but when such substances do present them
selves, their optical characters afford facilities for their chemical study
of which chemists generally have at present little conception.
     Two distinct objects may be had in view in seeking for such inform
ation as optics can supply relative to the characters of a chemical
substance.    Among the vast number of substances which chemists have
now succeeded in isolating or preparing, and which in many cases
have been but little studied, it often becomes a question whether two
substances,    obtained in different ways, are or are not identical.      In
such cases an optical comparison of the bodies will either add to the
evidence of their identity, the force of the additional evidence being
greater or less according as their optical characters are more or less
marked, or will establish a difference between substances which might
otherwise erroneously have been supposed to be identical.

     The detection of mixtures by the microscopic examination of intermingled
crystals properly belongs to the first head, the question which the observer pro
poses to himself, being, in fact, whether the pure substances forming the individual
crystals are or are not identical.

1864.]        Organic Bodies     by their    Optical Properties.           225
      To judge from the two examples just given, it might be supposed
that the observation of the colour would give almost as much in
formation as analysis by the prism. To show how far this is from
being the case, two fluids very similar in colour, port-wine and a so
lution of blood, were next examined. The former merely caused a
general absorption of the more refrangible rays ; the latter exhibited
two well-marked dark bands in the yellow and green.                These bands,
first noticed by Hoppe, are eminently characteristic of blood, and
afford a good example of the facilities which optical examination
affords for following a substance which possesses distinctive characters
of this nature. On adding to a solution of blood a particular salt of
copper (any ordinary copper salt, with the addition of a tartrate to
prevent precipitation, and then carbonate of soda), a fluid was obtained
utterly unlike blood in colour, but showing the characteristic bands of
blood, while at the same time a good deal of the red was absorbed, as
it would have been by the copper salt alone.          On adding, on the other
 hand, acetic acid to a solution of blood, the colour was merely changed
 to a browner red, without any precipitate being produced.               Never
 theless, in the spectrum of this fluid the bands of blood had wholly
 vanished, while another set of bands less intense, but still very cha
 racteristic, made their appearance.         This alone, however, does not
 decide whether the colouring matter is decomposed or not by the acid ;
 for as blood is an alkaline fluid, the change might be supposed to
 be merely analogous to the reddening of litmus.                 To decide the
 question, we must examine the spectrum when the fluid is again
 rendered alkaline, suppose by ammonia, which does not affect the
 absorption bands of blood. The direct addition of ammonia to the
 acid mixture causes a dense precipitate, which contains the colouring
 matter, which may, however, be separated by the use merely of acetic
 acid and ether, of which the former was already used, and the latter
 does not affect t he colouring matter of blood.        This solution gives the
 same characteristic spectrum as blood to           which   acetic acid has been
 added ; but   now  there is no difficulty  in  obtaining  the  colouring matter
 in an ammoniacal solution.      In the spectrum of this solution, the sharp
 absorption bands of blood do not appear, but instead thereof there is a
 single band a little nearer to the red, and comparatively vague [this
 was shown on a screen]. This difference of spectra decides the question,
 and proves that haematin (the colouring matter prepared by acid, &c.)
 is,  as Hoppe stated,a   product of decomposition.
       The spectrum of blood maybe turned to account still further in
 relation to the chemical nature of that substance.               The colouring
  matter contains, as  is  well known,   a     large quantity of iron and
                                                                      ;      it
  might be supposed that the colour was due to some salt of iron,
  more especially as some salts of peroxide of iron, sulphocyanide for
  instance, havea   blood-red colour.      But there is  found strong general
                                                              a
  resemblance    between salts of the same metallic oxide as regards the

  show   a remarkable system of bands of absorption in the more refran

 gible part of the spectrum.       The number and position of the bands
 differ a little from one salt to another ; but there is the strongest family
 likeness between the different salts.     Salts of sesquioxide of iron in a
 similar manner have a family likeness in the vagueness of the ab
 sorption, which creeps on from one part of the spectrum to another
 without presenting any rapid transitions from comparative trans
 parency to opacity and the converse.           [The spectrum of sulpho-
 cyanide of peroxide of iron was shown for the sake of contrasting with
 blood.]     Hence the appearance of such a peculiar system of bands of
 absorption in blood would negative the supposition that its colour is
 due to a salt of iron as such, even had we no other means of deciding.
 The assemblage of the facts with which we are acquainted seems to show
that the colouring matter is some complex compound of the five elements,
oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and iron, which under the action
of acids and otherwise, splits into haematiu and a protein substance.
     This example was dwelt on, not for its own sake, but because
general methods are most readily apprehended in their application to
particular examples.      To show one example of the discrimination
which may be effected by the prism, the spectra were exhibited of the
two kinds of red glass which (not to mention certain inferior kinds) are
in common use, and which are coloured, one by gold, and the other by
suboxide of copper. Both kinds exhibit a single band of absorption
near the yellow or green ; but the band of the gold glass is situated
very sensibly nearer to the blue end of the spectrum than that of the
copper glass.
     In the experiments actually shown, a battery of fifty cells and complex
apparatus were employed, involving much trouble and expense.              But
this was only required for projecting the spectra on a screen, so as to be
visible to a whole audience.     To see them, nothing more is required than
to place the fluid to be examined (contained, suppose) in a test tube,
behind a slit, and to view it through a small prism applied to the naked
eye, different strengths of solution being tried in succession.        In this
way the bands may be seen by anyone in far greater perfection than
when, for the purpose of a lecture, they are thrown on a screen.
     In order to be able to examine the peculiarities which a substance
may possess in the mode in which it absorbs light, it is not essential that
the substance should be in solution, and viewed by transmission.
Thus, for example, when a pure spectrum is thrown on a sheet of paper
painted with blood, the same bands are seen in the yellow and green
region as when the light is transmitted through a solution of blood,
and the spectrum thrown on a white screen.          This indicates that the
colour of such a paper is in fact due to absorption, although the paper
is viewed by reflected light.       Indeed, by far the greater number of
coloured objects which are presented to us, such as green leaves,
flowers, dyed cloths, though ordinarly seen by reflection, owe their
colour to absorption.     The light by which they are seen        is,    true,
                                                                        it   is
reflected, but it   is not in reflection that the preferential selection of
certain kinds of rays     made which causes the objects to appear coloured.
                         is

Take, for example, red cloth.      A small portion of the incident light is
reflected at the outer surfaces of the fibres, and this portion, if it could
be observed alone, would be found to be colourless.       The greater part
of the light penetrates into the fibres, when it immediately begins to
suffer absorption on the part of the colouring matter.      On arriving at
the second surface of the fibre, a portion is reflected and a portion
passes on, to be afterwards reflected from, or absorbed by, fibres lying
more deeply. At each reflection the various kinds of light are reflected
in as nearly as possible the same proportion ; but in passing across the
fibres, in going and returning, they suffer very unequal absorption on
the part of the colouring matter, so that in the aggregate of the light
perceived the different components of white light are present in propor
tions widely different from those they bear to each other in white light
itself, and the result is a vivid colouring.
      There are, however, cases in which the different components of white
light are reflected with different degrees of intensity, and the light be
comes coloured by regular reflection.      G old and copper may be referred
to as examples.     In ordinary language we speak of a soldier's coat as
red, and gold as yellow.      But these colours belong to the substances in
two totally different senses. In the former case the colouring is due to
absorption, in the latter case to reflection. In the same sense, physically
speaking, in which a soldier's coat is red, gold is not yellow but blue or
green. Such is, in fact, the colour of gold by transmission, and there
fore as the result of absorption, as is seen in the case of gold leaf, which
transmits a bluish green light, or of a weak solution of chloride of gold
after the addition of protosulphate of iron, when the precipitated me
 tallic gold remains in suspension in a finely-divided state, and causes
the mixture to have a blue appearance           when seen by transmitted
light.    In this case we see that while the substance copiously reflects
and intensely absorbs rays of all kinds, it more copiously reflects the
less refrangible rays, with respect to which it is more intensely
opaque.
      All metals are, however, highly opaque with regard to rays of all
 colours.   But certain non-metallic substances present themselves which
are at the same time intensely opaque with regard to one part of the
 spectrum, and only moderately opaque or even pretty transparent with
 regard to another part.       Carthamime, murexide, platino-cyanide of
 magnesium may be mentioned as examples.            Such substances reflect
 copiously, like a metal, those rays with respect to which they are in
 tensely opaque, but more feebly, like a vitreous substance, those rays
for which they are tolerably transparent. Hence, when white light is
 incident upon them the regularly-reflected light is coloured, often
 vividly, those colours preponderating which the substance is capable of
absorbing with intense avidity.        But perhaps the most remarkable
example known of the connection           between intense absorption and
copious reflection occurs in the case of crystals of permanganate of
potash.    These crystals have a metallic appearance, and reflect a greenish
 light. They are too dark to allow the transmitted light to be examined ;

228              Professor  Stokes on the  Discrimination of     [March 4,
and even when they are pulverized, the fine purple powder they yield is
too dark for convenient analysis of the transmitted light.          But the
splendid purple solution which they yield may be diluted at pleasure,
and the analysis of the light transmitted by it presents no difficulty.
The solution absorbs principally the green part of the spectrum ;
and when it is not too strong, or used in too great thickness, five
bands of absorption, indicating minima of transparency, make their
appearance [these were shown on a screen].           Now, when the green
light reflected from the crystals is analyzed by a prism, there are
observed bright bands, indicating maxima of reflecting power, corre
sponding in position to the dark bands in the light transmitted by the
solution. The fifth bright band, indeed, can hardly, if at all, be made
out, but the corresponding dark band is both less strong than the
others and occurs in a fainter part of the spectrum.       When the light
is reflected at a suitable angle, and is analyzed both by a Jvicol's prism,
placed with its principal section in the plane of incidence, and by an
ordinary prism, the whole spectrum is reduced to the bands just men
tioned. The Nicol's prism would under these circumstances extinguish
the light reflected from a vitreous substance, and transmit a large part
of the light reflected from a metal. Hence we see that as the refrangi-
bility of the light gradually increases, the substance changes repeatedly,
as regards the character of its reflecting power, from vitreous to me
tallic and back again, as the solution (and therefore it may be presumed
the substance itself) changes from moderately to intensely opaque, and
conversely.
     These considerations leave little doubt as to the chemical state of
the copper present in a certain glass which was exhibited.      This glass
was coloured only in a very thin stratum on one face. By transmission
it cut off a great deal of light, and was bluish. By reflection, especially
when the colourless face was next the eye, it showed a reddish light
visible in all directions, and having the appearance of coming from a
fine precipitate, though it was not resolved by the microscope, at least
with the power tried. It evidently came from a failure in an attempt to
make one of the ordinary red glasses coloured by suboxide of copper,
and the only question was as to the state in which the copper was
present.    It could not be oxide, for the quantity was too small to
account for the blueness, and in fact the glass became sensibly colourless
in the outer flame of a blowpipe. Analysis of the transmitted light by
the prism showed a small band of absorption in the place of the band
seen in those copper-red glasses which are not too deep, and therefore
a small portion of copper was present in the state of suboxide, i.e. a
silicate of that base. The rest was doubtless present as metallic copper,
arising from over-reduction in the manufacture, and accordingly the
blue colour, which would have been purer if the suboxide had been
away, indicates the true colour of copper by transmitted light, quite in
conformity with what we have seen in the case of gold.           Hence, in
both metals alike, the absorbing and the reflecting powers are, on the
whole, greater for the less than for the more refrangible colours, the

law of variation with refrangibility being of             course somewhat different
in the two cases.
       Time would not permit of more than a very brief reference to the
second property to which the speaker had referred as useful in tracing
substances in impure solutions — that of fluorescence.               The phenomenon
of fluorescence consists in this, that certain substances, when placed
in rays of one refrangibility, emit during the time of exposure com
 pound light of lower refrangibility.              W hen a pure fluorescent sub
stance (as distinguished from a mixture) is examined in a pure
spectrum, it is found that on passing from the extreme red to the
 violet and beyond, the fluorescence commences at a certain point of the
 spectrum, varying from one substance to another, and continues from
 thence onwards, more or less strongly in one part or another according
 to the particular substance.           The colour of the fluorescent light is
 found to be nearly constant throughout the spectrum. Hence, when in
 a solution presented to us, and examined in a pure spectrum, we notice
 the fluorescence taking, as it were, a fresh start, with a different colour,
  we may be pretty sure that we have to deal with a mixture of two
  fluorescent substances.
       It might be inferred d priori, that fluorescence at any particular
  part of the spectrum would necessarily be accompanied by absorption,
 since otherwise there would be a creation of vis viva ; and experience
  shows that rapid absorption (such as corresponds to a well-marked
 minimum of transparency indicated by a determinate band of absorp
 tion in the transmitted light) is accompanied              by copious fluorescence.
 But experience has hitherto also shown, what could not have been
 predicted, and may not be universally true, * that conversely, absorp
 tion is accompanied, in the case of a fluorescent substance, by fluorescence.
       From what precedes it follows that the colour of the fluorescent
 light of a solution, even when the incident light is white, or merely
sifted by absorption, may be a useful character. To illustrate this, the
 electric light, after transmission through a deep-blue glass, was thrown
 on solutions in weak ammonia of two crystallized substances, aesculin
 and fraxin, obtained from the bark of the horse-chesnut, and of which
 the latter occurs also in the bark of the ash, in which, indeed, it was
 first discovered.        Both solutions exhibited a lively fluorescence ; but
 the colour was different, being blue in the case of aesculin, and bluish-
     •
         Fluorescent substances, like others, doubtless absorb the invisible heat-rays
 Wing beyond the extreme red, in a manner varying from one substance to another.
 Hrnre, it we include such rays in the incident spectrum, we have an example of
 absorption not accompanied by fluorescence.      Rut the invisible heat-rays differ from
 those of the visible spectrum     (as there is every reason to believe) only in the
 wav that the visible rays of one part of the spectrum differ from those of another,
 that is, by wave length, and consequently by refrangibility, which depends on wave
 length.    Hence it is not improbable that substances may be discovered which absorb
the visible rays in some parts of the spectrum less refrangible than that at which the
fluorescence    commences; and mixtures possessing this property may be made at
pleasure. Nevertheless, the speaker has cot yet met with n pure fluorescent substance
which exhibits this phenomenon.

green in the case of fraxin.       A purified solution obtained from the
bark exhibits   a fluorescence  of  an intermediate colour, which would
suffice to show  that aesculin would not alone account for the fluorescence
of the solution of the bark.
     When a substance possesses well-marked optical properties, it is in
general nearly as easy to follow it in a mixture as in a pure solution.
But if the problem which the observer proposes to himself be : — Given
a solution of unknown substances which presents well-marked characters
with reference to different parts of the spectrum, to determine what
portion of these characters belongs to one substance, and what portion
to another, it presents much greater difficulties.       It was with reference
to this subject that the second of the objects mentioned at the begin
ning of the discourse had been spoken of as that the attainment of which
was by far the more difficult.       The problem can, in general, be solved
only by combining processes of chemical separation, especially fractional
separation, with optical observation.         When a solution has thus been
sufficiently tested, those characters     which   are found always to accom
pany   one  another,   in, as nearly as can be judged, a constant proportion,
may,   with  the  highest probability,   be regarded as belonging to one and
the same substance.        But while a combination of chemistry and optics
is in general required, important information may sometimes be obtained
from optics alone.       This is especially the case when one at least of the
substances present is at the same time fluorescent and peculiar in its
mode of absorption.
     To illustrate this the case of chlorophyll was referred to. An
eminent French chemist, M. Fremy, proposed to himself to examine
whether the green colour were due to a single substance, or to a mix
ture of a yellow and a blue substance.           By the use of merely neutral
bodies, he succeeded in separating chlorophyll into a yellow substance,
and another which was green, but inclining a little to blue ; but he
could not in this way get further in the direction of blue. He con
ceived, however, that he had attained his object by dissolving chloro
phyll in a mechanical mixture of ether and hydrochloric acid, the acid
on separation showing n fine blue colour, while the ether was yellow.
Now solutions of chlorophyll in neutral solvents, such as alcohol, ether,
&c., show a lively fluorescence of a blood-red colour ; and when the
solution is examined in a pure spectrum, the red fluorescence, very
copious in parts of the red, comparatively feeble in most of the green,
is found to be very lively again in the blue and violet. Now a substance
of a pure yellow colour, and exercising its absorption therefore, as
such substances do, on the more refrangible rays, would not show a
pure red fluorescence.         Either it would be non-fluorescent, cr the
fluorescence     of its solution would contain (as experience shows) rays
of refrangibilities reaching, or nearly so, to the part of the spectrum at
which the fluorescence, and therefore the absorption, commences ; and
therefore the fluorescent light could not be pure red, as that of chloro
phyll is found to be even in the blue and violet.       The yellow substance
separated by M. Fremy, by the aid of neutral reagents,             is, in fact,

1864.]                     General Monthly Meeting.                          231
non-fluorescent.    Hence the powerful red fluorescence in the blue and
violet can only be attributed to the substance exercising the well-known
powerful absorption in the red, which substance must, therefore, power
fully absorb the blue and violet.        We can affirm, therefore, a priori,
that if this substance were isolated      it would not be blue, but only a
somewhat bluer green.       The blue solution obtained by M. Fremy owes,
in fact, its colour to a product of decomposition, which when dissolved
in neutral solvents is not blue at all, but of a nearly neutral tint, show
ing, however, in its spectrum extremely sharp bands           of absorption.

The speaker    had already shown the enormous differences                     which exist
among    gaseous bodies, both as regards their power of absorbing
and emitting radiant heat.        When a gas is condensed to a liquid, or a
liquid congealed to a solid, the molecules coalesce, and grapple with
each other by forces which were insensible as long as the gaseous state
was maintained. But, though the molecules are thus drawn together, the
luminiferous ether still surrounds them : hence, if the acts of radiation
and absorption depend on the individual molecules, they will assert their
power even after the state of aggregation has been changed.                        If, on
the contrary, their mutual entanglement by the force of cohesion be of
paramount influence in the interception and emission of radiant heat,
then we may expect that liquids will exhibit a deportment towards
radiant heat altogether different from that of the vapours from which
they are derived.
    The first part of the present inquiry is devoted to an exhaustive
examination of this question.         The speaker employed twelve different
liquids, and operated upon five different layers of each, which varied
in thickness from 002 of an inch to 027 of an inch.                          The liquids
were enclosul, not in glass vessels, which                    would have materially
modified the heat, but between plates of transparent rock-salt, which

  but slightly affected the radiation.         His source of heat throughout
 these comparative experiments consisted of a platinum wire, raised to
  incandescence    by an electric current of unvarying strength.           The
  quantities of radiant heat absorbed and transmitted by each of the
  liquids at the respective       thicknesses     were first determined.   The
 vapours of these liquids were subsequently examined, the quantities
 of vapour employed being proportional to the quantities of liquid
 traversed by the radiant heat.        The result of the comparison was that,
 for heat of the same quality, the order of absorption of liquids and of
 their vapours are identical.       There was no exception to this law ; so
 that,  to determine   the  position of a vapour as an absorber or radiator,
 it is only necessary to determine the position of its liquid.
      This result proves that the state of aggregation, as far at all events
 as the liquid stage is concerned, is of altogether subordinate moment —
 a conclusion which will probably prove to be of cardinal importance in
 molecular physics.       On one important and contested point it has a
 special bearing.     If the position of a liquid as an absorber and radiator
 determine that of its vapour, the position of water fixes that of aqueous
 vapour. Water had been compared with other liquids in a multitude
 of experiments, and it was found that, as a radiant and as an absorbent,
 it transcends them all. Thus, for example, a layer of bisulphide of
carbon 0-02 of an inch in thickness absorbs 6 per cent., and allows
 94 per cent, of the radiation from the red-hot platinum spiral to pass
 through it ; benzol absorbs 43 and transmits 57 per cent, of the same
radiation ; alcohol absorbs 67 and transmits 33 per cent., and alcohol
 stands at the head of all liquids except one in point of power as an
absorber. The exception is water.            A layer of this substance, of the
 thickness above given, absorbs 81 per cent., and permits only 19 per
cent, of the radiation to pass through it.           Had no single experiment
ever     been   made   upon   the   vapour    of   water, we might infer with
certainty    from  the  deportment     of the   liquid that, weight for weight,
this vapour transcends all others in its power of absorbing and emitting
radiant heat.
      The relation of absorption and radiation to the chemical constitu
tion of the radiant and absorbent substances was next briefly considered.
For the first six substances in the list of those examined, the radiant
and absorbent powers augment as the number of atoms in the com
pound molecule augments.           Thus, bisulphide of carbon has 3 atoms,
chloroform 5, iodide of ethyl 8, benzol 12, and amylene 15 atoms in
their respective molecules ; and the order of their power as radiants
and absorbents is that here indicated ; bisulphide of carbon being the
feeblest, and amylene the strongest of the six.              Alcohol, however,
excels benzol as an absorber, though it has but 9 atoms in its molecule ;
but, on the other hand, its molecule is rendered more complex by the
introduction of a new element.         Benzol contains carbon and hydrogen,
while alcohol contains carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.                 Thus, not
only does the idea of multitude come into play in absorption and radia
tion — that of complexity must also be taken into account.         The speaker

1864.]               Contributions   to  Molecular Physics.                 235
directed the particular attention of chemists to the molecule of water ;
the deportment of this substance towards radiant heat being perfectly
anomalous, if the chemical formula at present ascribed to it be correct.
     Sir William Herschel made the important discovery that, beyond
the limits of the red end of the solar spectrum, rays of high heating
power exist which are incompetent to excite vision. The speaker has
examined the deportment of those rays towards certain bodies which
are perfectly opaque to light.         Dissolving iodine in the bisulphide of
carbon, he obtained a solution which entirely intercepted the light of
the most brilliant flames, while to the extra-red rays of the spectrum
the same iodine was found to be perfectly diathermic.         The transparent
bisulphide, which is highly pervious to the heat here employed, exercised
the same absorption as the opaque solution.            A hollow prism filled
with the opaque liquid was placed in the path of the beam from an
electric lamp, the light-spectrum was completely intercepted, but the
 heat-spectrum was received upon a screen and could be there examined.
 Falling upon a thermo-electric pile, its presence was shown by the
prompt deflection of even a coarse galvanometer.
      What, then, is the physical meaning of opacity and transparency
as regards light and radiant heat ?         The luminous rays of the spec
 trum differ from the non-luminous ones simply in period.                  The
sensation     of light is excited by waves of ether shorter and more
 quickly recurrent than those which fall beyond the extreme red.            But
 why should iodine stop the former and allow the latter to pass? The
 answer to this question no doubt is that the intercepted waves are those
 whose periods of recurrence coincide with the periods of oscillation
 possible to the atoms of the dissolved iodine. The elastic forces which
 separated these atoms are such as to compel them to vibrate in definite
 periods, and, when these periods synchronize with those of the ethereal
 waves, the latter are absorbed.       Briefly denned, then, transparency in
 liquids as  well  as in gases is synonymous with discord, while opacity is
 synonymous     with  accord  between   the periods of the waves of ether and
 those of the molecules of the body on which they impinge.                  All
 ordinary transparent     and  colourless  substances owe   their transparency
 to the discord which exists between the oscillating periods of their
 molecules and those of the waves of the whole visible spectrum. The
 general discord of the vibrating periods of the molecules of compound
 bodies with the light-giving waves of the spectrum may be inferred
 from the prevalence of the property of transparency in compounds,
 while their greater harmony with the extra-red periods is to be in
 ferred from their opacity to the extra-red rays,       \\ater illustrates this
 transparency and opacity in the most striking manner.             It is highly
 transparent to the luminous rays, which demonstrates the incompetency
 of its molecules to oscillate in the periods which excite vision. It is
 as highly opaque to the extra-red undulations, which proves the
 synchronism of its periods with those of the longer waves.
      If, then, to the radiation from any source water shows itself to be
 eminently or perfectly opaque, it is a proof that the molecules whence

236                         Professor   Tyndall,                 [March IK,
the radiation emanates must oscillate in what may be called extra-red
periods.    Let us apply this test to the radiation from a flame of
hydrogen. This flame consists mainly of incandescent aqueous vapour,
the temperature of which, as calculated by Bunsen, is 3,259° C., so
that, if transmission augment with temperature, we may expect the
radiation from this flame to be copiously transmitted by the water.
While, however, a layer of the bisulphide of carbon O07 of an inch in
thickness transmits 72 per cent. of the incident radiation, and while
every other liquid examined transmits more or less of the heat, a layer
of water of the above thickness is entirely opaque to the radiation from
the flame.    Thus we establish accord between the periods of the mole
cules of cold water and those of aqueous vapour at a temperature of
3,259° C.     But the periods of water have already been proved to be
extra-red — hence those of the hydrogen flame must be extra-red also.
The absorption by dry air of the heat emitted by a platinum spiral
raised to incandescence by electricity was found to be insensible, while
that by the ordinary undried air was 6 per cent.       Substituting for the
platinum spiral a hydrogen flame, the absorption by dry air still
remained insensible, while that of the undried air rose to 20 per cent.
of the entire radiation.   The temperature of the hydrogen flame was,
as stated, 3,259° C. ; that of the aqueous vapour of the air was 20° C.
Suppose, then, the temperature of aqueous vapour to rise from 20D C.
to 3,259° C, we must conclude that the augmentation of temperature
is applied to an increase of amplitude, and not to the introduction of
periods of quicker recurrence into the radiation.
     The part played by aqueous vapour in the economy of nature is far
more wonderful than hitherto supposed.        To nourish the vegetation of
the earth the actinic and luminous rays of the sun must penetrate our
atmosphere ; and to such rays aqueous vapour is eminently transparent.
The violet and the extra-violet rays pass through it with freedom. To
protect vegetation from destructive chills the terrestrial rays must be
checked in their transit towards stellar space ; and this is accomplished
 by the aqueous vapour diffused through the air.      This substance is the
great moderator of the earth's temperature, bringing its extremes into
proximity, and obviating contrasts between day and night which would
render life insupportable.      But we can advance beyond this general
 statement, now that we know the radiation from aqueous vapour is
 intercepted, in a special degree, by water, and, reciprocally, the radia
 tion from water by aqueous vapour ; for it follows from this that the
 very act of nocturnal refrigeration which produces the condensation of
 aqueous vapour upon the surface of the earth
                                                    — giving, as it were, a
 varnish  of water to that surface —  imparts  to terrestrial radiation that
 particular character which disqualifies it from passing through the
 earth's atmosphere and losing itself in space.
      And here we come to a question in molecular physics which at the
 present moment occupies the attention of able and distinguished men.
 By allowing the violet and extra-violet rays of the spectrum to fall upon
 sulphate of quinine and other substances Professor Stokes has changed

1
   864.]            Contributions to Molecular    Physics.                237
the periods of those rays.       Attempts have been made to produce a
similar result at the other end of the spectrum — to convert the extra-
red periods into periods competent to excite vision — but hitherto
without success.      Such a change of period, the speaker agreed with
 Dr. Akin in believing, occurs when a platinum wire is heated to white
 ness by a hydrogen flame. In this common experiment there is an actual
 breaking up of long periods into short ones — a true rendering of
 universal periods visual.     The change of refrangibility here effected
 differs from that of Professor Stokes : firstly, by its being in the opposite
 direction — that is, from lower to higher ; and, secondly, in the circum-
 .stance that the platinum is heated by the collision of the molecules of
 aqueous vapour, and before their heat has assumed the radiant form.
 But it cannot be doubted that the same effect would be produced by
 radiant heat of the same periods, provided the motion of the ether
 could be rendered sufficiently intense.      The effect in principle is the
 same, whether we consider the platinum wire to be struck by a particle
 of aqueous vapour oscillating at a certain rate, or by a particle of ether
 oscillating at the same rate.
      By plunging a platinum wire into a hydrogen flame we cause it to
 glow, and thus introduce shorter periods into the radiation.        These, as
 already stated, are in discord with water ; hence we should infer that
 the transmission through water will be more copious when the wire is
 in the flame that when it is absent.    Experiment proves this conclusion
 to be true. Water from being opaque opens a passage to 6 per cent,
 of the radiation from the flame and spiral. A thin plate of colourless
 glass, moreover, transmitted 58 per cent, of the radiation from the
 hydrogen flame ; but when the flame and spiral were employed, 78
 per cent, of the heat was transmitted. For an alcohol flame Knoblauch
 and Melloni found glass to be less transparent than for the same flame
 with a platinum spiral immersed in it ; but Melloni afterwards showed
 that the result was not general — that black glass and black mica were
 decidedly more diathermic to the radiation from the pure alcohol
 flame.    The reason for this is now obvious. Black mica and black
 glass owe their blackness to the carbon diffused through them.           This
 carbon, as proved by Jlelloni, is in some measure transparent to
 the extra-red rays, and the speaker had succeeded in transmitting
  between 40 and 50 per cent, of the radiation from a hydrogen flame
  through a layer of carbon sufficient to intercept the light of the most
  brilliant flames. The products of combustion of the alcohol flame are
  carbonic acid and aqueous vapour, the heat of which is almost wholly
  extra-red.    For this radiation, then, the carbon is in a considerable
  degree transparent, while for the radiation from the platinum spiral, it
  is in a great measure opaque.       By the introduction of the platinum
 wire, therefore, the transparency of the pure glass and the opacity of
 its carbon were simultaneously augmented ; but the augmentation of
  opacity exceeded that of transparency, and a difference in favour
 of opacity remained.
     !No more striking or instructive illustration of the influence of coin

238                          Professor  Tyndall,               [March   18,
cidence could be adduced than that furnished by the radiation from a
carbonic oxide flame.       Here the product of combustion is carbonic
acid ; and on the radiation from this flame even the ordinary carbonic
 acid of the atmosphere exerts a powerful effect. A quantity of the gas,
 only one-thirtieth of an atmosphere in density, contained in a polished
 brass tube four feet long, intercepted fifty per cent, of the radiation
 from the carbonic oxide flame.      For the heat emitted by solid sources
 olefiant gas is an incomparably more powerful absorber than carbonic
 acid ; in fact, for such heat the latter substance, with one exception, is
 the most feeble absorber to be found among the compound gases. For
 the radiation from the hydrogen flame, moreover, olefiant gas possesses
 twice the absorbent power of carbonic acid, but for the radiation from
 the carbonic oxide flame, at a common tension of one inch of mercury,
 while carbonic acid absorbs fifty per cent., olefiant gas absorbs only
 twenty-four.     Thus we establish the coincidence of period between
 carbonic acid at a temperature of 20° C. and carbonic acid at a
 temperature over 3,000° C, the periods of oscillation of both the
 incandescent and the cold gas belonging to the extra-red portion of the
spectrum.
     It will be seen from the foregoing remarks and experiments how
impossible it is to examine the effect of temperature on the transmission
 of radiant heat if different sources of heat be employed. Throughout
 such an examination the same oscillating atoms ought to be retained.
 The heating of a platinum spiral by an electric current enables us to do
this, while varying the temperature between the widest possible limits.
Their comparative opacity to the extra-red rays shows the general
accord of the oscillating periods of our series of vapours with those of
the extra-red undulations.      Hence, by gradually heating a platinum
wire from darkness up to whiteness, we gradually augment the discord
between it and the vapours, and must therefore augment the trans
parency of the latter. Experiment entirely confirms this conclusion.
Formic ether, for example, absorbs 45 per cent, of the radiation from a
platinum spiral heated to barely visible redness ; 32 per cent, of the
radiation from the same spiral at a red heat ; 26 per cent, of the
radiation from a white-hot spiral, and only 21 per cent, when the spiral
is brought near its point of fusion.     Remarkable cases of inversion as
to transparency occurred in these experiments.          For barely visible
redness formic ether is more opaque than sulphuric ; for a bright red
heat both are equally transparent, while, for a white heat, and still more
for a nearly fusing temperature, sulphuric ether is more opaque than
formic.    This result gives us a clear view of the relationship of the
two   substances   to the luminiferous ether.   As we introduce waves of
shorter period the sulphuric augments most rapidly in opacity ; that is
to say, its accord with the shorter waves is greater than that of the
formic.     Hence we may infer that the molecules of formic ether
oscillate, on the whole, more slowly than those of sulphuric ether.
     When the source of heat was a Leslie's cube filled with boiling
water and coated with lampblack, the opacity of formic ether in com

parison with sulphuric was very decided. With this source also the
position of chloroform as regards iodide of methyl was inverted. For
a white-hot spiral, the absorption of chloroform vapour being 10 per
cent. .that of iodide of methyl is 16; with the blackened cube as source
the absorption by chloroform is 22 per cent., while that by the iodide
of methyl is only 19. This inversion is not the result of temperature
merely ; for when a platinum wire, heated to the temperature of
boiling water, was employed as a source, the iodide remained the most
powerful absorber. All the experiments hitherto made by the speaker
go to prove that from heated lampblack an emission takes place which
synchronizes in an especial manner with chloroform.           For the cube at
100° C, coated with lampblack, the absorption of chloroform is more
than three times that by bisulphide of carbon ; for the radiation from
the most luminous portion of a gas-flame the absorption by chloroform
is also considerably in excess of that by bisulphide of carbon ; while,
for the flame of a Bunsen's burner, from which the incandescent carbon
particles are removed by the free admixture of air, the absorption by
bisulphide of carbon is nearly twice that by chloroform.         The removal
of the incandescent carbon particles more than doubled in this instance
the relative transparency of the chloroform.          Testing, moreover, the
radiation from various parts        of  the same flame, it was found that for
the   blue  base of  the  flame the   bisulphide was the most opaque, while
for all the other portions of the flame the chloroform was most opaque.
 For the radiation from a very small gas flame, consisting of a blue
 base and a small white top, the bisulphide was also most opaque, and
 its opacity very decidedly exceeded that of the chloroform when the
flame of bisulphide of carbon was employed as a source.            Comparing
 the radiation from a Leslie's cube coated with isinglass with that from
 a similar cube coated with lampblack, at the common temperature of
  100° C., it was found that, out of eleven vapours, all but one absorbed
 the radiation from the isinglass most powerfully ; the single exception
 was chloroform.        It may be remarked that, whenever, through a
 change of source, the position of a vapour as an absorber of radiant
 heat was altered, the position of the liquid from which the vapour was
 derived was changed in the same manner.
      It is still a point of difference between eminent investigators
 whether radiant heat, up to a temperature of 100°C.,is monochromatic
  or not. Some affirm this ; some deny it. A long series of experiments
  has enabled     the speaker     to state that probably no two substances
  at a temperature of 100° C. emit heat of the same quality.         The heat
  emitted by isinglass, for example, is different from that emitted by
  lampblack, and the heat emitted by cloth, or paper, differs from both.
  It is also a subject of discussion whether rock-salt is equally diathermic
  to all kinds of calorific rays.    The differences affirmed to exist by one
  investigator being ascribed by others to differences of incidence from
  the various sources employed.          M M. de la Provostaye and Desains
  maintain the former view, Melloni and M. Knoblauch maintain the
  latter.   The question was examined by the author without changing

anything but the temperature of the source. Its size, distance, and
surroundings remained the same, and the experiments proved that rock-
salt shares, in some degree, the defect of all other substances ; it is not
perfectly diathermic, and it is more opaque to the radiation from a
barely visible spiral than to that from a white-hot one.
     In regard to the relation of radiation to conduction. Defining
radiation, internal as well as external, as the communication of motion
from the vibrating molecules to the ether, the speaker arrives, by
theoretic reasoning, at the conclusion that the best radiators ought to
prove the worst conductors.        A broad consideration of the subject
shows at once the general harmony of the conclusion with observed
facts.   Organic substances are all excellent radiators ; they are also
extremely bad conductors.       The moment we pass from the metals to
their compounds we pass from a series of good conductors to bad ones,
and from bad radiators to good ones.     Water, among liquids, is probably
the worst conductor; it is the best radiator.     Silver, among solids, is
the best conductor ; it is the worst radiator. In the excellent researches
of MM. de la Provostaye and Desains the author finds a striking illus
tration of what he regards as a natural law ; that those molecules which
transfer the greatest amount of motion to the ether, or in other words,
radiate most powerfully, are the least competent to communicate motion
to each other, or in other words, to conduct with facility.

                                On Oral Reading.
THE object of      the discourse was the advocacy              of occasional oral
readings by persons possessing leisure and a fair amount of the per
sonal qualifications requisite for such a function, both for parochial
purposes as a wholesome and instructive amusement to the poor ; and
for social purposes as an agreeable recreation for other classes of the
community whose more abundant resources do not always exempt them
from ennui and a craving for a little " indoor relief."
      With regard to the poorer classes, the speaker urged that but
comparatively few of them on leaving school to earn their livelihood
had learned to read with such facility as to read for pleasure ; but
that such persons would crowd eagerly to the warm, dry schoolroom,
bright with gas and gay with cheap decorations, to hear read to them
portions of books judiciously selected, and rendered coherent and intelli
gible by such explanations as might be requisite.               It would be quite
surprising to those not conversant with the more obscure sections of
human life to learn how much intelligence and apprehension there often
 is where there has been but very scanty instruction.                 True we are
without excuse if we withhold from the poor such education as may be
compassed ; but still nature           is very bountiful in repairing such
 injustices ; and   God   has    printed  many books of luminous pages not
 illegible even to the unlettered rustic ; whose intelligence is frequently
 kept in activity by means independent of what we usually understand by
education, so that an audience of peasants with such adaptation on the
 reader's part as common sense suggests, will often exhibit an appre
ciation of even literary excellence which would surprise persons not
 familiar with such experiments. The labour spent on such an enter
 prise would be amply compensated if only the auditors should go away

such an amusement would have at least a tendency to something higher,
at least a tendency to something better ; and might, in its degree,
contribute to higher ends than pastime.     The immaterial part of their
nature might become more consciously developed to themselves ;
observation might be stimulated — reflection awakened — imagination
quickened — possibly slumbering genius aroused — at all events, taste
refined — self-respect and respect for their fellow-men cherished — and
(would    it be too much to say ?) a consciousness       disclosed within
them    of filial relationship with the Creator of mind with all its
sympathies, and of matter with all its varieties and combinations.
     In recommending oral reading as a domestic recreation for the
more educated classes, the speaker dwelt chiefly upon the effect which
such a practice might in its degree contribute to produce upon the
 prevailing estimate of style or art in literary composition.          He
 maintained that nothing, as a general rule, would bear reading aloud
 which was not a work of art — and acceptable as such, independently of
the information conveyed to the mind of the hearer.        Nine-tenths of
 the reading of nine tenths of the readers of the present day is news
 paper reading, written for the most part without any profession of art,
 and for purposes of information only, and such as to read or hear read
 a second time would be intolerable.       The diffusion of this kind of
 reading contributed to the plausible, prevalent, but pernicious notion,
 that in composition matter is everything and manner unimportant.      He
 contended, on the contrary, that style or art is the measure of the skill
 — the intelligibleness— the attraction— the persuasiveness with which
 incidents, sentiments or opinions are expressed ; and suggested that the
 frequent reading aloud to cultivated auditories of compositions which
 bore the stamp of general consent as standard works of art, would
 have a tendency to counteract prevailing impressions disparaging to
 the cultivation of style, and to recall us to a more just and salutary
 estimate of its importance.
      The speaker asked permission to conclude with an experiment, and
 to read to the audience — not with any histrionic effort, but simply and
 plainly, as any gentleman of education might be expected to read it —
 a classic morsel — written a hundred years ago — containing no sensa
 tional incidents, containing, indeed, scarcely any incidents at all, and
 indebted for its reputation exclusively to the style or art with which it
 was composed.     If  he should be so fortunate in this experiment as to
  give his audience even a little pleasure, he considered that he should
  have established what he had ventured to propound.      He then read the
  story of Le Fevre, from Sterne.

         On the Chemical History and Application of Gun-cotton.
The history of Gun-cotton affords an interesting illustration of the
facility with which the full development of a discovery may be retarded,
if not altogether arrested for a time, by hasty attempts to apply it to
 practical purposes, before its nature has been sufficiently studied and
 determined.
      When Schonbein, in the autumn of 1846, announced that he had
 discovered a new explosive compound, which he believed would prove
 a substitute for gunpowder, the statement attracted general attention,
 and attempts were made with little delay in different countries to
 apply the material to purposes for which gunpowder hitherto had been
 alone used.    Schonbein, and Bottger (who appear to have discovered
 Gun-cotton independently, shortly after the former had produced                    it)
 lost little time in submitting their discovery to the German Confedera
 tion
    ;    anda   committee was appointed for its investigation, by whom
 Gun-cotton was eventually pronounced inapplicable as substitute fora
 gunpowder.
      In this country Gun-cotton was experimented with immediately
 after the method of its preparation was published by Schonbein.
 Researches were instituted into its nature, preparation, &c.,      Porrettby
and Teschemacher, John Taylor, Gladstone, and others.               A few
 experiments were made on its application as        propelling and mining
                                                        a
agent, and the manufacture of the material upon         considerable scale
                                                               a
was set on foot     byMessrs. Hall, the well-known gunpowder makers at
Faversham   ;   a patent having been previously taken out in this country
for the production of Gun-cotton according to Schonbein's process.
This factory had, however, not been long in operation before           very     a
disastrous explosion occurred at the works, by which         number of men
                                                                   a
lost their lives, and which was ascribed to the spontaneous ignition of
the Gun-cotton, by the jury, who endeavoured to investigate its cause.
From that time, the manufacture of Gun-cotton upon any considerable
scale was abandoned in England, and no important contributions to

246                            Profestor Abel                   [April 15,
our knowledge of this material were made, until, in 1854, Hadow
published the results of some valuable investigations, which served to
furnish a far more definite knowledge regarding the true constitution
and proper method        of producing Gun-cotton, than had hitherto
existed.
     In France, Gun-cotton was also made the subject of experiments
as early as the winter of 1846 ; and its manufacture was carried on at
the Government powder-works at Bouchet, near Paris. Some interes
ting   balistic  experiments were instituted, under the direction of
Piobert, Morin,    and other men of eminence, with Gun-cotton, in com
parison with different kinds of gunpowder, the results of which
indicated, that, for producing equal effects to those furnished by a
given weight of Gun-cotton, it was necessary to employ a double
quantity of sporting-powder, three times the quantity of musket-
powder, and four times the weight of cannon-powder.           It was also
found that the best results appeared to be obtained by arranging the
 Gun-cotton so that it should occupy the same space as the charge of
gunpowder required to produce an equal effect ; and other data were
arrived at, which show that the investigators were being led to
work in a direction similar to that afterwards so successfully pursued
by Baron von Lenk, in Austria.         Unfortunately, however, disastrous
 explosions occurred at the works at Bouchet ; one as early as March,
 1847, in a drying chamber; and two, following closely upon each
other, in 1848.     One of these took place in a magazine, near which it
 was believed that nobody had been for several days ; the other
occurred also in a magazine where Gun-cotton was being packed ;
 and on this occasion several lives were lost. These disasters appear
to have put an end, until quite recently, to experiments with Gun-
cotton in France.
     After the material had been pronounced upon unfavourably by the
 Committee of the German Confederation, one of its members, Baron
von Lenk, continued to devote himself to its study, and with such
success, it appears, that a committee was eventually appointed by the
 Austrian Government in 1852, to inquire fully into the merits of the
 material.    A sum of money was paid to Schonbein and Buttger, in
 recognition of the value of their discovery ; and an experimental
 manufactory of Gun-cotton was established at the Castle of Hirtenberg,
 near Vienna.     A particular form of gun was devised by Baron von
 Lenk, for employment with Gun-cotton, of which a 12-pounder
 battery was established.     The performances of these guns were con
 sidered sufficiently satisfactory to warrant the preparation of four more
batteries, which were sent to the army of observation in Galicia in
 1855, but did not go into active service.      It appears that, in conse
quence of a want of uniformity in the effects of the Gun-cotton, and of
an injurious effect upon the guns, added probably to the prejudice
entertained against it by the artillery corps, the material fell into
disfavour, and its application in cannon was for a time abandoned.
     It was received, however, with much greater favour by the

  1864.]           oh the Chemical History of Gun-cotton.               247
  engineers, and was applied with great success to mining and sub
 marine operations.      Meanwhile Baron von Lenk's labours to perfect
  Gun-cotton as a material for artillery purposes were unceasing, and,
 at the close of the Italian war, the subject of its application was again
 thoroughly reopened at the instigation of Count Degenfeld, then
  minister of war, who had, at an earlier period, taken an active interest
 in Baron von Lenk's investigations.      After upwards of one year's ex
 periments, a system of rifled field- and mountain- guns, to be employed
 with Gun-cotton, which had been elaborated by Von Lenk, was intro
 duced into the Austrian service ; thirty batteries of these guns were
 equipped, and it was considered as definitely settled that Gun-cotton
 would before long be introduced into the service in the place of
 gunpowder, for artillery purposes.
      In 1862, however,an explosion occurred in a magazine at Simmering,
 near Vienna, where both gunpowder and gun-cotton were stored ; and
 this disaster appears to have fortified to such an extent the arguments
 which were adduced against the employment of Gun-cotton, by its
opponents in the artillery service, that its use in this direction was
again put a stop to for a time.   Ultimately a committee of investigation
was appointed, which consisted in part of eminent scientific men, and
 which appears, after careful deliberation, to have reported highly in
favour of the stability and important properties, as an explosive, of the
material, a report which was supported by the favourable opinion
entertained of Gun-cotton by the Austrian engineers, in whose name
 Baron von Ebner prepared a very complete and interesting account
of the properties and effects of the agent, with particular reference to
 mining and other engineering operations.
      Gun-cotton appears, therefore, to have been again restored to
 favour in Austria, but no official accounts have reached England, up
to the present time, with regard to its employment in the recent war
operations in that country.
      In the spring of 1862, full details relating to the manufacture and
modes of applying Gun-cotton were communicated by the Austrian
 Government to that of Her Majesty, and the War Office Chemist, was at
once instructed to institute experiments upon the manufacture of Gun-
cotton, and upon its chemical constitution and stability.           In the
 autumn    of that  year, General Sabine    directed  the attention  of the
 British Association to the results obtained with Gun-cotton in Austria ;
 and a combined committee of engineers and chemists was appointed to
 inquire into the subject. At the meeting of the association in 1863,
 this committee presented a report, which was based upon information
received partly from General von Lenk, who had been permitted by
 the Austrian Government to visit this country for the purpose of com
municating     fully with the British Association on the subject, and
partly upon the results already arrived at in the experiments instituted
by the lecturer, under the direction of the Secretary of State for War.
Subsequently,      a committee of investigation was appointed by the
latter, under the presidency of General Sabine, composed of scientific

248                                     Professor Abel                                       [April   15,
men connected with the Royal Society and British Association, and of
military and naval officers of considerable experience ; and this
committee has been entrusted with the full investigation of the pro
perties of Gun-cotton, as improved by Baron von Lenk, with reference
to its application to military, naval, engineering, and industrial
purposes.
   The chemical constitution of Gun-cotton, concerning which the
opinions of chemists were divided until 1854, has been conclusively
established by the researches of Hadow.       In the formation of substi
tution-products, by  the  action of nitric acid upon cotton or cellulose,
three atoms of the latter appear to enter together into the chemical
change, and the number of atoms of hydrogen replaced by peroxide of
nitrogen in the treble atom of cellulose, C,8 HM O,, = 3 (C6 H,8 Os),
may be nine, eight, seven, or six, according to the degree of concen
tration of the nitric acid employed.
     The highest of these substitution-products is tri-nitro-cellulose,
pyroxilin,    or Gun-cotton         ;    C,8

by their solution the important material collodion, so invaluable in

 from the jars to a centrifugal machine, by the aid of which the excess
 of acid is removed as perfectly as is possible by mechanical means, the
 Gun-cotton being afterwards only slightly moist to the touch. The
 skeins are then immersed singly into water, and moved about briskly,
 so as to become completely saturated with it as quickly as possible.
 This result is best accomplished by plunging the skeins under a fall of
 water, so that they become at once thoroughly drenched.        If   they are
simply thrown into water and allowed to remain at rest, the heat pro
duced by the union of a portion of the free acids with a little water
would be so great as to establish at once a destructive action upon the
 Gun-cotton by the acid present.       The washing of the separate skeins
is continued until no acidity can be detected in them by the taste ;
 they are then arranged in frames or crates and immersed in a rapid
stream of water, where they remain undisturbed for two or three weeks.
 They are afterwards washed by hand, to free them from mechanical
 impurities derived from the stream, and are immersed for a short time
 in a dilute boiling solution of potashes.     After this treatment they are
 returned to the stream, where they again remain for several days.
 Upon their removal they are once more washed by hand, with soap if
 necessary ; the pure Gun-cotton then only requires drying, by sufficient
 exposure to air at a temperature of about 21° C., to render it ready for
 use.   A supplementary process     is,   however, adopted by General von
 Lenk, about the possible advantage or use of which his opinion       is  not
 shared by others, as already stated.        This treatment consists in im
 mersing the air-dried Gun-cotton in       a  moderately strong hot solution
 of soluble glass (silicate of potassa or soda), for sufficient period to
                                                     a
 allowit   to become completely impregnated    ;    removing the excess of
 liquid by means of the centrifugal machine     ;     thoroughly drying the
 Gun-cotton, thus " silicated," and finally washing      it   once more for
 some time, until all alkali is   abstracted.    Lenk considers that, by this
 treatment, some silica becomes deposited within the fibre of the Gun-
cotton, which, on the one hand, assists in moderating the rapidity with
 which the material burns, and, on the other hand, exercises (in some
 not very evident manner)   a   preservative effect upon the Gun-cotton,
rendering  it   less prone to undergo even slight changes by keeping.
The mineral matter contained in pure Gun-cotton which has not been
submitted to this particular treatment amounts to about one per cent.
The proportion found in specimens which have been " silicated
                                                                        " in
Austria and in this country, according to Lenk's directions, varies
between 1-5 and    2    per cent.    It difficult to understand how the
                                      is
addition of one per cent, to the mineral matter, in the form chiefly of
silicates of lime and magnesia (the bases being derived from the water
used in the final washing), which are deposited upon and between the
fibres in  a   pulverulent form, can influence, to any material extent,
either the rate of combustion or the keeping qualities of the product
obtained by Lenk's system of manufacture.
     Gun-cotton prepared according to the system just described            is

1n   its ordinary air-dry condition it contains, very uniformly, about
two per ceut. of moisture ; an amount which it absorbs again rapidly
from the air, when it has been dried.           The proportion of water
existing in the purified air-dried cotton, before conversion, is generally
about six per cent.       When pure Gun-cotton is exposed to a very
moist atmosphere, or kept in a damp locality, it will absorb as much
as from six to seven per cent. ; but, if it be then exposed to air of
average dryness, it very speedily parts with all but the two per cent.
of moisture which it contains in its normal condition. It may be
preserved in a damp or wet state apparently for an indefinite period
without injury ; for, if afterwards dried by exposure to air, it exhibits
no signs of change.
      In these respects it possesses important advantages over gunpowder.
The normal proportion of hygroscopic moisture in that substance
varies between three quarters and one per cent. ; but if exposed in
any way to the influence of a moist atmosphere, it continues to absorb
water until, however firm the grains may have originally been, it
becomes quite pasty.         It need scarcely be stated that, when once
gunpowder has become damp, it can no longer be restored to a
serviceable condition, except by being again submitted to the processes
of manufacture, starting almost from the commencement.
      Perhaps the most vital considerations, bearing upon the possibility
of applying Gun-cotton to important practical purposes, are those
which relate to the risk likely to be incurred in its manufacture, and
 preservation in large quantities. The manufacture of Gun-cotton is
unquestionably much safer than that of gunpowder ; in fact, there is
 no possibility of accident until the final drying process is reached ; as,
 in all the other stages, the material is always wet, and therefore
 harmless.     With the adoption of a proper system of warming and
 ventilation, in the drying-chamber, the last operation is certainly not
 a more dangerous one than that of drying gunpowder.          The question
 of the safe preservation of Gun-cotton cannot as yet be so easily and
 satisfactorily disposed of.    Specimens of Gun-cotton exist, which were
 prepared according to Schonbein's directions in 1846, and which have
 undergone no change whatever ; on the other hand, it is well known
 thatTJun-cotton, which was believed to have been perfectly purified,
 has become extremely acid and has even undergone so complete a
 decomposition, as to have become converted into oxalic acid and other
 organic products, when preserved in closed vessels, and especially
 when exposed continually, or occasionally, to light. This susceptibility
 to chemical change has been particularly observed in samples of Gun-
 cotton known to consist chiefly, or to contain some proportion, of the
 less explosive or lower substitution-products  (i. e. Gun-cotton specially
 prepared for the manufacture of collodion).      Hence, it    very possible
                                                              is
 that such instances, as are considered to have been well authenticated,

 252                           Professor Abel                    [April  15,
of the   spontaneous  ignition of Gun-cotton, when stored in considerable
 quantities,  or during exposure to very moderate heat, may have arisen
 not simply from an imperfect purification of the material, but also from
 the more or less imperfect conversion of cotton into the most explosive
 and apparently most stable product.
      There is no doubt that the improvements effected in the system of
 manufacture of Gun-cotton have been instrumental in rendering it far
 more stable in character than it was in the early days of its production
 upon a considerable scale.        At the same time, although General
 von Lenk and its warmest partisans consider that its unchangeability
 can no longer be disputed, a greater amount of experience, combined
 with more searching investigations than have hitherto been instituted,
 upon the possibility of its undergoing change when under the influence
 of moderate heat, alone or combined with that of moisture, and when
 preserved under a variety of other conditions, are unquestionably
 indispensable before its claims to perfect permanence can be con
 sidered as properly established.      It has already been ascertained by
 very recent experiments of the lecturer, that Gun-cotton prepared
 and purified with the most scrupulous care, speedily undergoes some
 amount of decomposition when exposed to temperatures              ranging
 from 32° to 66° C. ; it remains to be seen whether such decomposition,
 if once established by exposure of Gun-cotton to some temperature
 within the above limits, will cease permanently, when the material is
 removed from the influence of heat ; or whether precautions or
 efficient supplementary processes can be adopted in the manufacture, to
 counteract the tendency to change exhibited by Gun-cotton under the
 above circumstances.      These are only some of the points which need
 patient investigation  before it is positively known whether the requisite
 confidence can be placed in the material, as an agent susceptible of
 substitution for gunpowder.
      It has been ingeniously argued that a slight indication of sponta
 neous change in Gun-cotton         need give rise to no alarm, because
gunpowder is also liable to slight spontaneous change, reference being
 made to the fact that a very minute proportion of the sulphur in that
 material has been noticed to undergo oxidation.        It need hardly be
 stated that such a minute change cannot have the slightest effect upon
 the stability of the mechanical mixture, gunpowder, in which variations,
as regards purity and proportions of ingredients, occur, to an extent
which renders this change of absolute insignificance ; whereas in the
case of Gun-cotton as now manufactured, the development of acid,
however minute the proportion, may very possibly give rise to an
important disturbance of chemical equilibrium, in a compound, the
stability of which is based upon the perfect uniformity of its compo
sition ; and it may also be at once productive of further change, by
the tendency which the acid itself has to exert chemical action upon
certain elements of the Gun-cotton.
     The general properties of Gun-cotton as an explosive agent have long
been popularly known to be as follows : when inflamed or raised to a

 1664.]             on the Chemical    History of Gun-cotton.               253
temperature ranging between 137° and 150° C. it burns with a bright
flash    and large body of flame unaccompanied by smoke, and leaves no
appreciable residue.       It is far more readily inflamed by percussion than
gunpowder ; the compression of any particular portion of a mass of
loose Gun-cotton between rigid surfaces will prevent that part from
burning when heat is applied.           The products of combustion of Gun-
cotton, in air, redden litmus paper powerfully ; they contain a con
siderable proportion of nitric oxide, and act rapidly and corrosively upon
iron and gun-metal.        The explosion of Gun-cotton, when in the loose,
carded condition, the form in which it was always prepared in the early
days of its discovery, resembles that of the fulminates in its violence
and instantaneous character ; in the open            air it may be inflamed
 when in actual contact        with gunpowder, without igniting the latter ;
 in a confined space, as in a shell or the barrel of a gun, the almost
 instantaneous rapidity of its explosion, when in this form, produces
effects which are highly destructive as compared with those of Gun
 powder, while the projectile force exerted by it is comparatively small.
        Many attempts have been made, from time to time, to diminish the
 rapidity of explosion of Gun-cotton ; but the only one attended by any
 success, is that which, in General von Lenk's hand, has led to the develop
 ment of a system of mechanical arrangement of Gun-cotton, as ingenious
 and simple as it is effective.      By manufacturing the cotton into yarn,
 of different thicknesses and degrees of compactness or fineness of
 twist, before its conversion into Gun-cotton, this material is at once
 obtained in forms which not only burn with great regularity and much
  less rapidity, when used in the original condition, than the loose Gun-
  cotton wool, but which also, when employed in the form of reels, wound
  more or less compactly, or when converted into plaits or hollow ropes,
  may be made to burn gradually, in a manner similar to gunpowder, or
  to flash into flame instantaneously, exerting an explosive action very
  far exceeding that of the latter.       The modifications in the nature and
  degree of explosive force exerted        by Gun-cotton, which are essential
   for its application to military and industrial purposes as a substitute
   for powder, are, therefore, arrived at by means of very simple varia
  tions of the mechanical condition of the material.          Thus, to obtain
   the gradual action essential       for  the employment    of Gun-cotton in
   cannon, cartridges are made up of coarse yarn, which is wound firmly
   round a hollow cylinder of wood, of dimensions regulated by the size
   of the gun- chamber and the weight of the charge used, the best result
   being obtained by so arranging the latter that the cartridge entirely
   fills the space allotted to the charge in the gun.     Similarly, small-arm
   cartridges are made of cylindrical plaits of fine yarn or thread, which

 taneously and almost immediately upon the application of flame,
 consist of cylindrical, hollow, and moderately compact plaits (similar to
 lamp-wicks), made of Gun-cotton-thread, or very fine yarn. These
 plaits are produced in pieces of any length, and when employed as
 quick-matches are compactly enclosed in cases of waterproof canvas or
 other similar materials.     The charges to be used in mines, in which
 the most destructive effects are aimed at, consist of pieces of very
 firmly-twisted rope, with a hollow core along the centre, the number
 of strands of which it is composed varying with the size of the charge
 to be used.     For quarrying and blasting purposes, small lengths of
 the rope are employed singly ; for military operations (demolition of
 works, &c.), it is packed into moderately stout cases of sheet-metal.
 In these hollow ropes and plaits of Gun-cotton, the flame produced
 by the burning of that portion to which heat is applied, penetrates at
 once to the interior and into the interstices of the charge, and hence
 the entire mass of Gun-cotton is converted into gas and vapour, with
 almost instantaneous     rapidity.  A striking illustration of the very
 opposite effects which can be produced by very simple modifications in
 the mechanical arrangement of the Gun-cotton is afforded          by the
 following experiment : if two or three strands of Gun-cotton-yarn be
 very loosely twisted together and inserted into a tube of glass, or other
 material, in which they fit so loosely as to be readily drawn backwards
 and forwards, upon applying heat to a projecting portion at one end of
 the tube, the Gun-cotton thus arranged will explode with great violence,
 completely pulverising the tube, if it be of glass ; and the combustion
 will take place with such almost instantaneous rapidity that small
 portions of unburnt Gun-cotton will actually be scattered by the
 explosion.   But when two or more strands of the same Gun-cotton-
yarn are tightly twisted, singly in the first instance, then made up into
a firm cord, solid throughout, and enclosed in a glass tube or some
other description of case into which the cord fits very tightly, if a
 protruding end of the Gun-cotton be then inflamed, the cord will burn
 with moderate rapidity until the fire reaches the opening of the case,
when the combustion will pass over from the ordinary kind to a form
which can only be described as a smouldering ; the lighted extremity
of   the Gun-cotton simply glows within the case, while a steady jet of
flame (furnished by the combustible gases evolved from the Gun-cotton)
continues to burn at the open extremity of the case, until the contents
of the latter are consumed.      The Gun-cotton not only burns extremely
slowly under these conditions, but also with the greatest regularity, so
that the rate of combustion of a given length of the enclosed cord may
be accurately timed.        The rapidity of combustion of Gun-cotton
arranged in this given form may be regulated by the number of
strands in a cord, and the degree of their compactness, and it is by
this new modification of General von Lenk's system of arranging
Gun-cotton that the lecturer has succeeded in applying this material
to the production of slow-matches and time-fuzes ; uses for which it
had not previously been found suitable.

       Referente has just been made to inflammable gases evolved by
Gun-cotton while it undergoes a very slow combustion.             The com
position of Gun-cotton renders it self-evident that, under any circum
stances, the explosion of this substance must be accompanied          by the
production of a very considerable proportion of carbonic oxide. The
large body of flame, always observed when Gun-cotton is ignited under
ordinary circumstances, is principally due to the combustion of carbonic
oxide and, probably also, of small quantities of carbo-hydrogen com
pounds which, together with minute suspended particles of the mineral
 matter contained in the Gun-cotton, give to the flame its brightness.
 If   a tuft of Gun-cotton be ignited in a capacious and somewhat deep
vessel, the flame actually resulting from the burning of the tuft may be
 distinctly seen surrounded by a large body of flame, produced by the
 burning gases, which continue apparent for a very appreciable time
 after the disappearance of the flash of flame furnished by the explosion
 of the Gun-cotton.       If similar tufts be ignited in atmospheres of hy
 drogen, nitrogen, carbonic acid, coal gas, &c., the combustion of the
 Gun-cotton is only accompanied by a very small and pale flame, of
 instantaneous duration.      Similarly, if Gun-cotton be ignited in a vessel
 which has been previously exhausted, to at any rate one-half the ordi
 nary atmospheric pressure, the proportion of air, and therefore oxygen,
 present when the G un-cotton is ignited, does not suffice to effect the
 combustion of any large proportion of the inflammable gases generated,
 and hence the explosion of the Gun-cotton is attended only by a small
  pale flame.    If, however, the vessel be filled with oxygen and then
  exhausted to an equal or even a lower degree, it is filled with flame of
  dazzling brightness directly the ignition of the Gun-cotton is effected.
        The one modification, just referred to, of the phenomena which
  attend the ignition of Gun-cotton in a rarefied atmosphere is not the
  only result observed in experiments of this kind.         Various curious
  effects may be obtained ; their nature being determined by the degree
  of rarefaction of the atmosphere, the mechanical condition of the Gun-
  cotton, its position with reference to the source of heat employed, and
  other variable elements in the experiments. A brief account of some
  of the principal of these phenomena may not be without interest.
        In the experiments with a tuft of Gun-cotton in rarefied air, spoken
  of just now, a perceptible interval is observed between the first appli
  cation of heat (by passage of a voltaic current through a platinum
  wire enclosed in the tuft) and the first appearance of ignition of the
  Gun-cotton ; moreover, the pale flame observed when the latter does
  burn, is of very perceptibly longer duration than that of the bright
  flash which attends the explosion of Gun-cotton in air, under ordinary
  conditions.    If instead of using the Gun-cotton in the form of a tuft, a
  short piece of the Gun-cotton yarn be employed in the experiment,
  and laid on a support so that it rests upon the wire by which it is to
   be ignited, the pale flame of the burning Gun-cotton will travel along
   towards the two extremities of the piece of yarn with a degree of
   slowness corresponding to the extent of rarefaction of the atmosphere.

These results are in perfect accordance with the observation (first made
by Quartermaster Mitchell, afterwards fully examined into by Frank-
land, and recently amplified by Uufour), that the rate of burning of
time-fuzes is influenced by the altitude at which they are burned, or,
in other words, by the degree of pressure of the atmosphere, the com
bustion being proportionately slow with every decrement of pressure of
the air.    When the platinum-wire is first raised to a red heat, in the
centre of the tuft of Gun-cotton enclosed in a highly-rarefied atmo
sphere, the products resulting from the decomposition of that portion
of the material which is in close contact with the wire, immediately
distribute themselves through the rarefied space, conveying away, and
rendering latent by their great expansion, the heat furnished by the
platinum wire and that which results from the chemical change.          The
increase of pressure within the confined space, by the generation of the
gases and vapours, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the effect
of the heated gases, which escape, upon the particles of Gun-cotton
 through which they permeate, result, in the course of time, in the
 ignition of the mass ; but even then the Gun-cotton burns only slowly,
 because, in consequence of the rapidity with which the resulting gases
and vapours escape and expand, much of the heat essential for the
maintenance of the combustion is at once conveyed away.          The latter
 result is strikingly exemplified by an experiment in which Gun-cotton
yarn is substituted for the tuft of carded Gun-cotton ; indeed, if the
atmosphere be very highly rarefied (to 0'6 in inches of mercury) and
 a sufficient length of the Gun-cotton yarn (4 or 5 inches) be employed
 in the experiment, the burning of the material, induced by the heated
 wire, will proceed so slowly, that the heat resulting from the chemical
 change will be conveyed away from the burning surface, by the gases
 generated, much more rapidly than it is developed, so that the Gun-
 cotton will actually become extinguished when only a small portion of
 it has been burned.
      A very similar result is obtained if gunpowder, either in the form
 of grains or of one large mass, is exposed to the action of an incandes
 cent platinum wire imbedded in    it, the pressure of the atmosphere, in
 the apparatus     in which the experiment     is made, being reduced to
 between 0-6 and  2,    in inches of mercury.  The portion of Gunpowder
 contiguous to the heated wire will fuse   ;   vapours of sulphur will be
 evolved in the first instance, and, subsequently, the charcoal will be
 oxidised  by   the nitre, bubbles of gas escaping from the fused mass.
 The vapours and gases thus generated convey away rapidly the heat
 provided by the wire and developed by the chemical action      ; and at the
 same time the change which the gunpowder undergoes diminishes its
 explosive character, so that its partial ignition or explosion will only
 be effected after the lapse of several minutes, and, if   itbe in the form
 of grains, the explosion of the particles contiguous to the wire will
 have the effect of scattering the remainder without igniting it.
     The great reduction in the rapidity of combustion of Gun-cotton          is
 not the only result observed when small
                                              quantities of that substance

are exposed to heat under diminished atmospheric pressure.             In the
most highly-rarefied atmospheres (from 0'5 to 1 inch), the only indica
tion afforded of the burning of the Gun-cotton is the appearance of a
beautiful green glow, like a phosphorescence, immediately surrounding
that part which is undergoing decomposition.           When the pressure of
the atmosphere is slightly increased, a faint yellow lambent flame ap
pears, beyond the green glow, at a short distance from the point of
decomposition ; and, in proportion as the atmosphere is less rarefied,
this pale yellow flame increases in volume, while the green phospho
rescence becomes less and less apparent until it seems to be completely
obliterated.     Lastly, when the pressure of the atmosphere is compara
tively great (= 25 or 26, in inches of mercury), the Gun-cotton burns
 with the ordinary bright flame, though less rapidly, of course, than it
does under normal conditions of atmospheric pressure.            There is no
doubt that this bright flame is due to an almost instantaneous secondary
combustion (in the oxygen supplied by the air in the apparatus) of the
 inflammable gases evolved by the decomposition.           On the other hand
 the production of the small pale flame, observed when Gun-cotton is
 burned in more highly rarefied air, or in atmospheres of gases which
 cannot supply oxygen for combustion, is most probably due to the
 generation of a mixture of gases (by the change which Gun-cotton
 undergoes under these conditions) which contains not only combustible
 bodies such as carbonic oxide, but also a proportion of oxidizing gases
 (protoxide of nitrogen or even oxygen) ; such a mixture, having self-
 combustible properties, will receive sufficient heat from the burning
 Gun-cotton to become ignited, except when the atmosphere in which
 the change takes place is so highly rarefied that the heat is immediately
 dissipated and the gases evolved become highly attenuated, as already
 described.
      It will be readily conceived that the mechanical state of the Gun-
 cotton      e. the particular form in which
             (f.                                      employed), like other
                                                         it   is
 variable conditions which have been alluded to, will greatly influence
the nature of phenomena observed, when this substance               ignited in
                                                                        is
 air, or in various gases, either at ordinary or diminished pressures.

 if  the   yarn is enclosed in a tube or other vessel, through which those
 gases   are circulating, and from which one extremity of the Gun-cotton
 protrudes, when the latter is lighted it will burn in the ordinary man
  ner only until it reaches the opening of the tube, when the form of
 combustion will at once be changed to that just described. If, however,
 corresponding experiments are made in atmospheres of hydrogen or
  coal gas, the Gun-cotton yarn will burn in the slow manner described,
 but only for a very brief period ; indeed, it ceases to burn at all almost
 instantaneously, just as it does when ignited in a very highly-rarefied
 atmosphere.       This result is not due to the high diffusive powers of the
 gas in which the Gun-cotton is burned, as it may be obtained equally
  in open and in perfectly-closed vessels ; it can therefore only be as
 cribed to the high cooling powers, by convection, of the gases employed.
 Pure nitrogen, as stated just now, allows the Gun-cotton yarn to burn
 in the slow manner, but if mixed with one-fourth its volume of hydro
 gen, it arrests the combustion of the material, just like coal gas or pure
 hydrogen.
      A rapid current of air will also effect the transformation of the com
 bustion of Gun-cotton from the ordinary to the slow form, if the yarn
 be enclosed in a moderately wide glass tube, with one end protruding
 from the tube, so that it may be inflamed in the ordinary manner ; but
 unless the current be very rapid, an explosive mixture of air, and the
 inflammable gases generated from the Gun-cotton, may be produced in
 the tube, and become ignited, in which case the Gun-cotton will flash
 into flame instantaneously, and the tube will be shattered by the
 explosion.     If, however, a long piece of thin Gun-cotton yarn be
 passed through a small narrow glass tube, one or two inches long, into
 which it fits so loosely that it may be drawn through very easily, the
 change in the form of combustion is effected with certainty, and with
out the aid of a current of air. When the Gun-cotton, thus arranged
 and placed upon a flat surface, is inflamed at one extremity, it burns
as usual until it reaches the one opening of the tube ; the slow form of
 combustion then takes place within the tube, and the Gun-cotton will
 continue to burn in the slow manner, emitting only the small tongue
of flame, after the combustion has reached the portion of yarn on the
other side of the tube, which will be entirely burned in this peculiar
 manner.      In fact, to change the ordinary into the slow form of com
bustion of the Gun-cotton yarn in open air, it is only necessary to pass
a piece of the material through a perforation in a diaphragm of wood,
card-board, or paper, and to allow it to rest upon a flat surface on both
sides of the diaphragm.         The Gun-cotton will burn as usual upon
one side of the screen, until its combustion reaches the perforation,
when the large bright flame will vanish and the Gun-cotton upon the
other side of the screen will burn in the slow manner to the end.
      The two last experiments show, that if the combustible mixture of
gases, evolved by the action of heat upon Gun-cotton when it is
inflamed in open air, are prevented, even for the briefest space of time,
from completely enveloping the burning extremity of the yarn or

 1864.]            o/i the Chemical   History of Gun-cotton.                259
 twist   ;or, in other words, if they are forced for an instant to escape
only in     a direct line with the burning surface of Gun-cotton from
 which they are emitted, those particles of the latter which are in
 immediate proximity to the burning portion cannot be raised to the
 temperature necessary for their rapid and more complete combustion,
 and hence the gases themselves are in turn not supplied with sufficient
 heat for their ignition.       Now, as the gases which escape unburned
 convey away a very large portion of the heat developed by the
 metamorphosis of the Gun-cotton, it is impossible for the latter to
 continue to burn otherwise than in the slow and imperfect manner.
 If, however, a flame or highly-heated body be held in the path of the
 gases as they escape, they will at once be ignited and the yarn will
 burst into the ordinary form of combustion. The correctness of this
 explanation may readily be demonstrated by two or three simple
 experiments.      Thus, if a piece of loose or open Gun-cotton yarn is
 employed in place of the compact material which furnishes the
 results just described, it is very difficult, or even impossible, to cause
 the rapid combustion to pass over into the slow form, because the
 escaping gases cannot be diverted all into one direction, and cannot,
 therefore, be prevented from transmitting the heat necessary for
 perfect combustion from particle to particle of the material.          Again,
 if a piece of the compactly-twisted Gun-cotton yarn, placed upon a
 flat surface, is inflamed in the usual manner, and a jet of air is then
 directed in a line with the Gun-cotton so as to meet the flame, the
 latter will appear to be blown out, though the cotton still burns ;
 in fact, the burning gases are prevented for an instant from completely
 enveloping the extremity of the Gun-cotton, and hence the combus
 tion at once passes from the quick to the slow form. Conversely,            if,
 when the yarn has been made to burn in this slow manner, a very
 gentle current of air be directed against the burning portion, so as to
 force back upon the latter the gases which are escaping, thus impeding
 the rapid abstraction of heat, the Gun-cotton will very speedily burst
into the ordinary form of combustion, because, under these circum
 stances, the gases are almost immediately raised to the temperature
 necessary for their combustion.       In the same way,ifa   piece of the yarn
 placed upon   a    board   be  made  to burn  in  the slow  manner,   and one
 end of the board be gradually raised, so that the burning extremity of
 the Gun-cotton    is  the lowest, the latter will burst into flame as soon as
 the board has been raised to a position nearly vertical, so that the
 escaping gases flow back upon the burning surface.
      The slow or imperfect form of combustion may be at once induced
  in the compact Gun-cotton yarn, in open air, by applying to any part
 of the Gun-cotton      a source of heat not sufficiently great to inflame the
 gases generated.       A wire, or metal rod, heated to any temperature
  between 135° C. to just below visible redness, or the spark of a thin
  piece of smouldering string, will invariably produce the result described.
  Of course this effect, like most of the phenomena described,         is  to a
  considerable extent dependent upon the mechanical condition of the
                                                                  T2

Gun-cotton, upon the relation between the quantity as well as the degree
of heat applied   and the amount of surface of the G un-cotton, and upon
other conditions. While a small spark, or a thin platinum wire heated
to full redness, only induces slow combustion in the compact Gun-
cotton yarn, a thick rod of iron, heated only to dull redness, will
invariably inflame it in the ordinary manner.      A piece of open yarn
cannot be ignited so as to burn in the slow manner ; on the other
hand, the more compactly the Gun-cotton is twisted, the more
superficial is the slow form of combustion induced in it ; indeed, the
Gun-cotton may be rendered so compact that it will simply smoulder
in open air, if ignited as described, leaving a considerable carbonaceous
residue ; and the heat resulting from this most imperfect combustion
will sometimes be abstracted by the escaping gases more rapidly than
it is developed, so that the Gun-cotton will then actually cease to
burn, even in open air, after a short time.
    The remarkable facility with which the effect of heat upon Gun-
cotton may be modified, so as even to produce results totally opposite
in their characters, as exemplified by some of the experiments which
have been described, renders it easily conceivable that this material
may be made to produce the most varied mechanical effects, when
applied to practical purposes ; that it may indeed be so applied as, on
the one hand, to develope a force, very gradual in its action, which may
be directed and controlled at least as readily as that obtained by the
explosion of gunpowder, while, on the other hand, it may be made to
exert a violence of action and a destructive effect far surpassing those
of which gunpowder is susceptible. The results arrived at in Austria,
which show that Gun-cotton may be made to produce effects from three
to eight times greater than those of gunpowder, cease to be surprising
after a study of the chemical and physical characteristics of this
interesting explosive agent.
    The products obtained by the explosion of Gun-cotton, and its
decomposition under various conditions, have as yet been very
imperfectly studied, but there is little doubt that they vary in their
nature almost as greatly as the phenomena which attend the exposure
of the material to heat under different circumstances. It is well known
that, when Gun-cotton is inflamed in the open air, there is produced
(in addition to water, carbonic oxide, carbonic acid, and nitrogen) a
considerable proportion of binoxide of nitrogen, so that the gaseous
mixture assumes a red-brown tinge, and becomes very acid when it
mixes with air.      The products of the different forms of imperfect
combustion which Gun-cotton has been described as susceptible of
undergoing, are undoubtedly much more complex in their character
than those just referred to.      They include at times a proportion of
some substances, not yet examined, which make their appearance as a
white vapour or smoke ; cyanogen can readily be detected in all the
products of imperfect combustion ; the proportion of binoxide of
nitrogen is generally so large that the gaseous product becomes very
highly coloured when mixed with air ; peroxide of nitrogen has also

 1864.  J         on the Chemical    History of Gun-cotton.                 261
 been observed in some instances ; lastly, there is little doubt that the
products occasionally include a proportion of oxidizing gases.
      The products which have just been alluded to are the results of the
decomposition of Gun-cotton either at ordinary or diminished atmo
spheric pressures ; when the explosion of the material is effected in a
confined space, in such a manner that the main decomposition takes
place under pressure, the metamorphosis which the material undergoes
is of a more simple and complete character.
      It has been found by Karolyi that, when Gun-cotton is exploded
by   voltaic  agency in a shell which is burst by the explosion, and which
is enclosed within an exhausted chamber, so that the products of de
composition     are collected without danger, the results obtained under
these conditions are comparatively simple ; the analysis of the contents
of the chamber, after the explosion, showed that they consisted of car
 bonic acid 20-82 per cent., carbonic oxide 28'95, nitrogen 12-67,
                                 "              •

decomposition of Gun-cotton under these conditions (which are similar
to those of its explosion when employed as a destructive agent) appears,
therefore, not to be attended by the production of any oxide of nitrogen.
The lecturer found, in some preliminary experiments made under the
same conditions as those of Karolyi, that only a minute proportion of
binoxide of nitrogen was produced.           These results, when compared
with those obtained by the ignition of Gun-cotton in open air and
rarefied atmospheres, show that, just as the decomposition of this ma
 terial is of a more complicated and intermediate character, in proportion
 as its combustion is rendered imperfect by diminution of pressure            or
other circumstances, so, conversely, the change which it undergoes will
 be the more simple, and its conversion into gaseous products the more
 complete, the greater the pressure, beyond normal limits, under which
 it is exploded : that is to say, the greater the resistance offered to the
 generated gases upon the first ignition of a charge of Gun-cotton (and
 consequently the higher the temperature at which the decomposition of
 the confined Gun-cotton is
                              effected).   It is therefore readily intelligible
 that the notions hitherto generally entertained with regard to the very
 noxious character of the products of explosion of Gun-cotton and their
 powerfully corrosive action upon metals — based as these notions have
  been upon the effects observed on exploding Gun-cotton in open air —
 have been proved to be erroneous by the results of actual application
 of Gun-cotton to artillery and other purposes.          The foregoing con
  siderations contribute, moreover, to the ready explanation of the fact,
  established by the experiments in Austria, that the destructive effect
  of Gun-cotton is greatly increased, within certain limits, by increasing
 the resistance which the products of explosion have to overcome before
  they can escape into the air.
       The conditions (of temperature, pressure, &c.) which influence the
  nature of the decomposition of Gun-cotton, exert, unquestionably, a
  similar influence upon the nature of the explosion of gunpowder, and
  upon the mechanical effects which the products are capable of exerting.
                                                                                 r

 262             Prof. Abel  on the History of Gun-cotton.        [April  15,
 Observations made by the lecturer, in experiments upon the ignition of
 gunpowder in rarefied atmospheres, point to the existence of products
 of comparatively complicated character among those found by the
 gradual decomposition of that material under the conditions described.
 The earlier investigations (Gay-Lussac, Chevreul, &c.), of the products
 of explosion of gunpowder, represent these as being of a very simple
 character, and in harmony with the theory that gunpowder is converted
 essentially by its explosion into carbonic acid (or a mixture of that
 gas and carbonic oxide), nitrogen and sulphide of potassium.            But,
 more recent experimenters, Bunsen and Schischkoff, who have made a
 very elaborate examination of the products which they obtained by the
 explosion of gunpowder, represent the change to be one of a very
 complicated character ; fix the percentage of solid substances found at
 a much higher figure than that hitherto accepted, and show that the
 sulphide of potassium, which has been considered as the principal of
 these products, was only produced in very small proportion, in their
 experiments. The conditions under which these chemists exploded the
 gunpowder did not, however, correspond at all in their character to
 those under which gunpowder is exploded in actual practice, and
 would, therefore, be very likely to furnish results greatly at variance
 with those produced when a charge of powder is fired in a gun, a shell,
 or a mine.    That sulphide of potassium is abundantly produced, upon
 the discharge of a fire-arm, appears beyond doubt ; it may be readily
 detected in the solid matter which remains in the barrel near the
 breech ; it may be found deposited in considerable quantity near the
 muzzle of the arm, and there appears strong reason for believing that
 the flash of flame, observed     at the mouth of a fire-arm upon its
 discharge, is due in part to the ignition, as it comes into contact with
 the air, of sulphide of potassium, which has been vapourized by the
 heat of the explosion, and is thus mixed with the escaping gases.
     In comparing the effects of Gun-cotton, as an explosive agent, with
 those of gunpowder, and in basing theories, with regard to the difference
in the mechanical effects exerted by the two, upon the analytical results
 of the products of their explosion which have been obtained up to the
 present time, it is necessary to proceed with great caution ; for ex
 ceptional results cannot form any sound basis for correct theories or
tenable arguments. It can only lead to incorrect conclusions, which
may considerably retard the thorough investigation of a most important
subject, if the facts be ignored or lost sight of, that, firstly, the condi
tions which practically influence the nature of the products of the
explosion of Gun-cotton have a similar influence upon the change
which gunpowder may be made to undergo ; and that, secondly, the
effect of heat upon the water produced by decomposition of Gun-cot
ton, which forms so important an element in the action of this explosive,
has most probably its parallel, to no unimportant extent, in the vapour-
izing effect of heat upon the solids (especially upon sulphide of potas
sium) produced in the explosion of gunpowder.            These are matters
which demand their full share of consideration and investigation, before

1864.   J          Prof. Blackie    on the Spartan      Constitution.           263
it can be admitted       that a sufficient explanation of the remarkable dif
ferences      between the effects of gunpowder and Gun-cotton exists in
the assumption, that certain products of decomposition of the former
must be regarded entirely as waste matter in the material, simply
because they are solid at ordinary temperatures.              The fact, that Gun-
cotton is entirely converted into gases and vapour at the moment of
explosion, constitutes unquestionably one of the great advantages which
that substance possesses over gunpowder ; but it is premature, at pre
sent, to assume, in comparing the action of the two substances, that
only thirty-two (or even sixty) per cent, of gunpowder exist as gas or
vapour, at the moment of its explosion.
      It is to be expected that the investigations which are now being
actively pursued upon the true chemical effects produced in the ex
plosion both of Gun-cotton and Gunpowder, under conditions similar
to those which attend their employment in practice, will aid materially
in furnishing the correct data so essential for a thorough and impartial
comparison of the nature and merits of these two explosive agents.

 The peculiar institutions         and laws which go under the name of
 Lycurgus     — in  some respects a wonder and a problem to the ancients
  themselves — have in recent times received a very full and detailed
  discussion from some of the most distinguished scholars of Germany
  and England.        Foremost among these, of course, is to be mentioned
  Ottfried Muller, in his great work on the Dorians ; then, particularly,
  the   hiitorico-archseological   disquisitions of C.    F. Hermann and     Schoe-

historical work, propounded his views on the Spartan institutions
generally, with great originality and boldness, and specially on the
famous Agrarian laws. After such labours of such men, it seems not un
reasonable to think that we should have now arrived at some certain and
indisputable conclusions, on which those who read Aristotle, Isocrates,
and Xenophon some two hundred years ago, could only have very
misty apprehensions.      It is the intention of this discourse, accordingly,
shortly to review the results which, in this most interesting field of
archaeological   research, we seem to have arrived at ; and in doing so
the method which     I  shall adopt is to state shortly, in the first place,
the undisputed points in reference to the Spartan Constitution — that is,
such points as all well-instructed scholars, being men of sound judg
ment, and not hunters after novelty, are now agreed on ; and in the
second place, to discuss in detail one of the most characteristic of the
Spartan institutions, which is still lying under the severe ordeal of
Mr. Grote's sceptical reprobation, and which, therefore, cannot be
considered as undisputed among European scholars.
                                         I
     Among the undisputed points notice the following :
     1. The political constitution of Sparta was a broad aristocracy,
limited to some extent by regal rights and usages, but in no degree
modified by popular influence in the modern, or even in the Roman or
Athenian, sense of that term. By a broad aristocracy, I mean a large
corporation of privileged proprietors, varying from 10,000 to 2,000,
with a monopoly of political power, exercised indeed by different indi
viduals in different degrees, but altogether exclusive of the great mass
of the population, who were politically null, as much, or rather a great
deal more than the unenfranchised class in this country, because they
were in no sense recognized as members of the body politic, were
never appealed to even in the most distant way, and had no influence
of any kind in public affairs. This broad aristocracy was, in fact, the
whole Spartan people, who, as Dr. Arnold properly expressed                       it,
were "     anation of nobles," — brotherhood of privileged warriors,
                                   a
permanently encamped in        a   country whose native population they
treated as     nullity, as much as the laity
               a                                    ignored by the clergy of
                                                     is
the Romish Church.         The only limitation to which the great power
of this aristocracy was subject,    is found in the influence of the kings         ;
and this, connected as   it   was with the great element of religion, and
the important functions of war, must, when assisted by the weight of
personal character, have often been considerable.                Nevertheless,
monarchy in Lacedaemon, weakened as              was by the general strength
                                                it
and breadth of the aristocracy, and also by the early splitting of the
undivided Homeric kingship into two — itself the strongest proof of
the great strength of the old aristocracy — never could have been in               a
position to stamp  a    permanently distinctive character on the constitu
tion. Its proper type always was aristocracy            " close, unscrupulous,
                                                               a

                                                           :
and well-obeyed oligarchy         according   to  Mr.  Grote,      if
                                                                   any person
prefers that phraseology.
      2.The Spartan privileged class — that          is,
                                                   the whole Spartan people.

  1864.]                   on the Spartan Constitution,                   265
 so far as the rights   of citizenship were concerned — were wont to meet
  for the management     of public affairs in two bodies : the one general,
 called axxAi)<ria, of which the members, though select as respects the
  whole population, might be called a foj/wj or irXi/Soj, as respects the
 more select body chosen out of their members ; the other the yEjouiria,
 or senate of elders, an elective body chosen by the general mass from
 the members of their own body, of the greatest social weight and
 influence, being not less than sixty years of age. This •yK.wvla. may
just be regarded as a standing committee of the privileged classes,
constantly renovated from the general mass by a law of merit and
seniority, and entrusted with the exclusive right of discussing all
important public questions, and proposing all legislative measures in
the first place.     In this body, therefore, — as any person practically
acquainted    with  the working of political machinery will at once divine
 — lay the real power of the government in Lacedaemon : at least when
the constitution acted normally, and was not disturbed, as it was
liable to be, either by the arbitrary power of the ephors— of which
 anon — or by the preponderant personality of an energetic monarch.
 As for the larger assembly - the JxxA^o-i'a, though by the theory of the
 constitution possessing the supreme power in the last resort — exactly
after the Homeric type, so familiarly known from the amusing scene in
 Iliad II. — yet it played a very subordinate part in Spartan politics,
and makes little figure in Greek history, manifestly because its interests
and feelings were represented by its own best members, who regularly
 passed into the yepovo-t'a at the very age when their weight as public
counsellors had reached its acme.         An opposition between the two
divisions of the Spartan privileged class, such as exists in our country
between     the house of commons and the house of lords, never did
exist,  and  never could exist ; because the Spartan lower-house was in
fact a house of nobles, and the upper-house was only a select standing-
committee of the lower-house.         Anything, therefore, like popular or
democratic assemblies, in our sense of the word, anything like hostile
parties within the mass of the governing body, anything in the shape of
popular measures, popular eloquence, and champions of popular
rights, was altogether unknown in Sparta.          In this regard, Professor
Curtius does not overstate the matter when he says that, " though
the Spartan people had no laws or public measures of any kind thrust
upon them without their concurrence, yet, as a rule, they did not
govern ; they were governed."         For this reason, in the annals of their
public life we hear of no Olympian Pericles, no brilliant Alcibiades, no
impetuous Demades, no terrible Demosthenes, not even a correct and
polished, well-balanced, well-washed, well-anointed, well-combed, well-
brushed, and altogether well-bred Isocrates. They had no political
literature.
      The ephors, who, like the Roman tribunes, from small beginnings
rose to a power that often overshadowed the kings, and even over
rode the senate, have a very mysterious aspect to the student who
first begins to look into the details of the Spartan government

                            Professor Blackie                    [April 22,
machine.       But, on a little consideration, now that all the available
evidence has been carefully collected, it appears to me that there
cannot be the slightest doubt as to the true origin of the extraordinary
authority which, at certain periods, they exercised in public affairs.
The ephoralty arose from the necessity of providing a field for the
energies     of ambitious and adventurous young Spartans in the time
of peace. The law that no person should become a senator till the
ripe and safe age of sixty, was for purposes of aristocratic conserva
tion unquestionably a very wise one. But even in the most firmly-
compacted aristocracies there are combustible and explosive elements
which must be provided for ; and these elements exist nowhere so
strong as in the hearts of young men of talent and energy. Now, in
our country, the house of commons presents exactly the sort of
arena which is best adapted at once to gratify the ambition and test
the capacity of such active spirits.       But in Sparta, as we have seen,
the tKK\ifaia could perform no such functions ; therefore, instead of
public speaking and parliamentary tactics, a sort of overseership and
censorship — first in smaller, and then gradually extending to more im
portant matters — was laid open to the adventurous and ambitious among
the young Spartans, in which field of executive activity they might blow
off their dangerous steam in time of peace, and feel that they wielded
a power in certain matters which not even the king or the senate could
 treat with contempt. A free career being thus laid open to the young
 men and the less influential aristocracy, the iKK\^irla was in all
 respects qualified to play that acquiescent and innocent part which it
 played in Spartan history.      It became, in fact, politically null ; not
 because it had no rights, but because there was no need for exercising
 its rights.    In this way it came about that Sparta, for the space of
 four hundred years, exhibited to wondering Greece the most notable
 example of a stable conservative government, without any disturbing
 opposition, that ancient history knew. In fact, with such a perfectly
 satisfied broad aristocracy, if there was at any time any opposition to
 the government, it arose either in the shape of absolute mutiny and
 revolt among the helots, and unrecognized subject-classes,        or in the
 shape of conspiracy amongst some of the Spartans proper, who had
 lost their franchise by default, that is,  eitherby   not having conformed
 to the social regulations of Lycurgus, or by not possessing the necessary
 property qualification, and who were therefore no longer o1ioioi —
 peers among peers.        Of such a   conspiracy we have    a   well-known
 example in the case of Cinadon, which took place at the commence-
 mens of the reign of Agesilaus, R.C. 398.       The proceedings connected
 with the quashing of these mutinies and conspiracies reveal to us the
 weak point of the Spartan government.          A numerous subject-popula
 tion, absolutely without political rights, can be governed only by fear,
 andis    kept in check, partly by that unity of counsel and action which
 belongs to all well-organized governing bodies, partly by       a system of
 secret police, and secret execution, in that arbitrary form which   isalways
 the plague-spot of the government which employs       it,  and which, in the
                      \

1864.]           on the   Agrarian Laws of Lycurgus.                     267
case of Sparta, was distinguished by acts of bold unscrupulousness
and cold-blooded atrocity, surpassed by nothing that modern records
present in the annals of Rome, Naples, Paris, or Madrid.
     On the whole, therefore, we see, that notwithstanding the confes
sedly beneficial effect of the severe physical and moral training to
which the young Spartans were subjected, the results of their political
system were not such as to present a purely aristocratic government in
a particularly attractive light.    The Spartan system made good sol
diers, drilled and maintained in notable efficiency, a small people of
privileged proprietors supported by their swords ; but it altogether
failed to produce a great people. In external form only, to the super
ficial eye, the Spartan constitution exhibits that mixed form of govern
ment composed of the three necessary elements of king, lords, and
commons, which the wisest of the ancients looked on as the best pos
sible government ; but there was, in reality, no people, no liberty, no
movement, and no enterprise. What we find instead of a great, strong,
free, and happy people, is a very manly and vigorous, severely-trained ,
well-disciplined, and thoroughly effective aristocracy ; but an aristo
cracy altogether unfit to go beyond the narrow territorial limits within
which it grew up, and no more qualified to produce the highest type
of cultivated humanity, than the institutions of Plato's paper republic,
the red tape and pipe-clay ordinances of Berlin bureaucracy, or the
religious exercises of a Jesuits' College in Madrid or Rome.
     So much seems undisputed.       I shall now notice two points of con
siderable importance in the Spartan political and social organization,
which, considering the weighty names who have advocated opposite
views in regard to them, must be looked on as yet sub judice in the
world of learned research.     The first of these points relates to the true
nature and character of those Spartans who were called Sfioioi, Equals
or Peers.       With regard to these, the late Sir G. C. Lewis, in the
'
   Philological Review' (vol. ii. p. 64), has advanced a theory that they
were in all probability " an aristocratical class within the body of the
Spartans who were much employed in public offices, and had great in
fluence with the government, originally, perhaps, selected for their
merit ; and afterwards their rank became hereditary."           This theory
has been controverted by Professor Schoemann, in an able paper in his
  Opuscula Academica : and without going into the detail of the argu
ment, I shall only here state generally, that the passages in which
mention is made of these 0^0,0| in the Greek classics, are few and
incidental, and that, after a careful examination of them all,       I  have
come to the conclusion that there is no sufficient ground in the existing
authorities for the theory advanced by the learned English statesman :
and that, if we take the evidence as we have     it,without adding to    itin
the way of conjecture, we must just simply say that the peers were all
the Spartans who had not lost their property or other qualification.
Equality, indeed, and     asort of democracy within themselves, was an
essential characteristic of society in Sparta — itrot-o/i/a and ctipoKparla
         ^iat in the very words of Isocrates (Panath. 270 c.)    ;   and the

                                                                              <
268                           Professor  Blackie                   [April 22,
formation     of a class of superior hereditary privileged peers, in our
sense    of the word, is not to be assumed without the strongest
reasons, in the face of the plain presumptions to the contrary, arising
out of the whole constitution of oligarchy in Sparta.
     But the most important of the disputed points of the Spartan
social organization is that which relates to the AGRAKIAN LAWS.           On
this subject the great English historian of Greece, Mr. Grote, has
lately advanced a theory, which, as it runs counter not only to all the
ancient authorities, but to the weight of learned opinion in Germany,
well deserves the serious consideration of English scholars ; the more
so that, so far as I can see, the weight justly due to that learned
gentleman's authority has had a tendency to procure a ready admission
to certain brilliant sceptical novelties, enunciated by him, in quarters
where a decided opposition, on strong conservative principles, was rather
 to have been expected ; and thus the student of ancient history comes
 suddenly upon the somewhat singular phenomenon, that on one point
 at least of Hellenic research, while such Teutonic excavators as
 Ottfried Muller, C. T. Hermann, Schoemann, Curtius, and Diincker
 are marshalled on the side of ancient tradition and authority, in
 Oxford a learned professor of ancient history* can declare that Mr.
 Grote has proved, with " irresistible force," that all we have hitherto
 been taught of Agrarian laws in ancient Sparta is a hallucination
 and a dream.        The two nations thus appear to be changing sides ;
 the compatriots of Niebuhr have become historical conservatives,
 while the countrymen of Clinton seem eager to blow away early
 history into symbolism and myth. The mere suddenness and complete
 ness of this rebound might seem to indicate that the matter had not
been duly sifted, and that Mr. Grote's theory has been received more
from the weight due to his authority, than from an impartial consi
deration of the evidence.         So at least it appears to me ; and it shall
 be my object in what remains of this discourse to state in detail the
real significance of the ancient authorities on the subject, and how far
they are from giving any countenance           to the ingenious, but, in my
opinion, baseless theory of Mr. Grote.         Let it be noted, however, that
when     I speak of Agrarian laws as an integral part of the Lycurgean
organization,    I  do not mean to assert that the legislator introduced
these laws for the first time any more than he introduced the kingship
 or the senate.      It belongs to God to create ; the highest of mortal
 legislators  can  only use existing materials.         I
                                                   All say is, that, on a due
 consideration of all the ancient authorities, which are our only safe
guides in this matter, Agrarian laws must be acknowledged as, from
 the earliest times, part and parcel of that singular social organization
 which bore the name of Lycurgus.          In Lycurgus, as a man and a law-
  uuu; cr.nd not as a myth, a symbol, or an indefinite somebody or

maintain that all the characteristic Spartan laws and customs on which
his name was stamped, really proceeded originally from him ; much
less that we are bound to accept, as his actual scheme, every minute
detail of his legislation as presented to us in the highly-finished, or as
we might say, cunningly-cooked, accounts of late historians.
      Let us now examine Mr. Grote's position.           His denial of the
 Spartan Agrarian laws, as an historical fact, proceeds mainly on the
assertion, that while these laws are either ignored or contradicted by all
the earlier and more trustworthy witnesses, they are asserted only by
one or two recent and less creditable authorities.        This statement of
the case is certainly very plausible.      It is pretty much as if he had
said, all the eye-witnesses knew nothing about the matter in question,
only hearsay asserts it.       But the nature of the existing authorities
does not allow us to dispose of the question in this way.         There are
no eye-witnesses      in the case : the oldest cited, viz. Plato, lived at
least four hundred years after the great Spartan lawgiver ; and in such
circumstances mere priority in point of date is not of itself sufficient to
outweigh other and more material considerations.           Nay, even in a
common question of legal evidence, as every lawyer knows, the mere
nearness of a witness to the time in which a disputed fact took place,
will not of itself be able to secure to his testimony any peculiar pre
ference.     I shall, therefore, adopt what appears to me the more true
method of stating the evidence in an historical question of this kind.    I
shall first cite those authors who give a distinct and deliberate testi
mony to the Spartan Agrarian laws, and then inquire how far their
evidence is contradicted by any testimony to the contrary.           In the
first place, we have Polybius, a Greek, a native of the Peloponnesus,
and living in the times immediately following the Agrarian agitations
of the famous Spartan kings, Agis and Cleomenes. Of his weight and
judgment in political matters no one ever expressed a doubt ; and his
 testimony to the existence of equal allotments of land in Sparta, as
one of the most characteristic elements of the Lycurgean legislation, is
given in a passage (vi. 45.) where he expressly discusses political con
stitutions, and draws a direct contrast between the Cretan and Spartan
systems on this very point.        A more valuable witness, therefore, on
such a matter, could not be cited.        Then we have Plutarch, in his
 life of Lycurgus, — an author whom it is easy to call an " old
 wife," but who, in fact, was one of the best-read men of his day,
 and a man of remarkable good sense and sound judgment.                 No
 doubt he tells many stories which, like all historical anecdotes, may
 have been improved in the telling, or even invented to illustrate
 popular opinion : unquestionably also, his philosophy of history, exhi
 biting the whole Spartan constitution as jumping ready-made out of
 the brain of Lycurgus, is far from profound ; but it remains to be
 proved that he has ever given false representations of great historical
 characters,   or lightly stated any important historical fact.      On the
 contrary, I feel convinced, that before he sat down to write his life of
 Lycurgus, he had read Aristotle's famous work -ni, n-oXirtii) now

270                                     Professor Biackie                       [April 22,
lost ; and that the very distinct evidence given by him as to the
 Spartan Agrarian laws, must be regarded not as his testimony merely,
but as the result of the whole mass of historical evidence, including, of
course, Aristotle, which he had consulted on the subject.              And here we
 must observe, that in talking of the Spartan Agrarian laws, we are
 dealing with a matter, which, if it was not a mere figment, as
 Mr. Grote will have              must have been as well known in ancient
                                  it,
 Greece as      it in modern Europe, that the government of the Romish
                     is
 church    ismonarchical,     and that the principle of ecclesiastical democracy
is   represented by    the    Presbyterians in Scotland.        Facts of this kind
are far too deep-fixed in their roots, and far too wide-spread in their
branches, to be either invented or ignored.                  If
                                                            they are invented, they
 will not be believed     ;   ifthey are believed,          because they cannot be
                                                            it   is
ignored. To me, therefore, the testimony of two such writers as
 Polybius and Plutarch, expressly handling the subject, and summing
up as they do the whole historical tradition of antiquity, are quite
sufficient to establish the existence of Agrarian laws in ancient Sparta,
although they were not supported by any other evidence.                  But this
far from being the case. Isocrates, in his Panathenaic oration, where                   a is
contrast   isdistinctly drawn between Athenian and Lacedaemonian insti
tutions, talks expressly (270 c.) of the equality of lots in land, which
characterized the Dorians when they first settled in the Peloponnesus,
TTJS   xfyat ilf irpoarlKtt. taov t^tiv eKaarov         ;and Plato,    in the third
book of his laws (684 d.) manifestly alludes to the same state of
things.    I  conceive, therefore, that we have the concurrent testimony
of historians, orators, and philosophers, asserting or implying the
state of things in reference            to the distribution of land in Sparta,
which Mr. Grote, with such " irresistible force,"                     said to have
                                                                           is
disproved.      What, then, are the authorities by which we are called on
to consider that he has successfully rebutted the weight of the positive
evidence just adduced         ?His great authority, manifestly, more narrowly
looked at, in fact, his only authority,                 Aristotle — a name heavy
                                                       is

on the theory of politics, in which some points of the Spartan polity
are incidentally discussed.         These discussions occur principally in the
Second Book and      ;    it   ishere that Mr. Grote finds          notable passage
                                                                           a
(ii.  6)  asserting not the equality, but the extraordinary and abnormal
inequality, of property in the Spartan territory.               Now, in order to
understand this, we must consider carefully the whole plan and scope
of the book on Politics, and interpret the Second Book with reference
to that plan.     The work         purely
                                    is         theoretical investigation, with the

 an investigation, the philosopher has to prove in the first place that no
 best republic already exists either in theory or fact : that the intellec
 tual projections of Plato and the realized work of Lycurgus are equally
 at fault ; and therefore that the speculations of the philosopher are not
 foreclosed ; he may safely go on reasoning out the scheme of a best
  polity, without being liable to the charge of actum agere.      This cha
  racter of the Second Book sufficiently explains its somewhat ungracious
 attitude, that of systematic fault-finding.   He has merely to show that
 the various constitutions which he passes under review have, as a
 matter of fact, proved to be failures in certain points ; and his case is
 made out.       Accordingly, to use a vulgar phrase, he sets himself,
 what he does with manifest gusto as an Athenian, to pick holes in the
 coat of Lycurgus ; and has no difficulty in finding, that the Spartan
 women, so often celebrated for their patriotism and their domestic
 virtues, are in fact the most extravagant, the most blushless, and the
 most domineering ladies in Greece ; and that the lands, instead of being
 fairly divided, are accumulated in the hands of a very few proprietors
 (which accumulation all the ancient philosophers looked on as a great
social evil), and these proprietors principally women. And in account
 ing for this abnormal state of things, he goes on to accuse the legis
 lator of inconsistency, in having allowed the free disposal of landed
 property by testament, while he forbade it by sale inter vivos.       Now
 this whole way of stating the matter, not only does not seem to me to
deny, but rather plainly to imply, the existence of an equal division of
landed property in the early days of the Spartan ascendancy.            The
Stagyrite    speaks  in this whole book  of  what Sparta  had become  in his
day, not of what it was in the days of Lycurgus.         He did not require
to tell his readers what everybody knew, that since the days of Lysan-
der, Sparta was no more what it had been under Lycurgus, than
king Solomon of Palestine was like Joshua or Gideon.              Whatever
Lycurgus might have wished to make of Laced8emon,he had not achieved
it : the boasted Spartan constitution, which Plato and Xenophon had
lauded, was a manifest failure : and whoever felt inclined to set up
that as a model of the dpiVri; iro\irt/a was contradicted by the strong
staring fact, worth a whole waggon of arguments.
      The evidence of Aristotle being thus disposed of, Mr. Grote's case
on the authorities, according to my judgment, completely breaks down.
The other witnesses whom he cites, either say nothing at all on the
point, or say something quite different from what Mr. Grote supposes.
That there occurs occasional mention of rich men in Sparta, as well
as elsewhere, is nothing to the purpose.        The Spartan magnates, in
the days of Herodotus and Thucydides, might have acquired wealth
in various ways, altogether independently of the original equality of
the landed lots, on which the exercise        of the rights of citizenship
depended.      The mere silence of Herodotus in a passage (lib. i.),
where he is only mentioning Lycurgus in the most incidental way, can
have no weight ; and the defects in the slight treatise of Xenophon
are so manifest, that any mere omissions can prove nothing.             The

testimony of Isocrates in another passage of the oiation already quoted
(287-6),  has not the slightest bearing on the question ; for there the
orator is talking not of the original tenure of landed property under
the Lycurgean institutions, but of the freedom of Sparta, during a
long course of four hundred years, from violent Agrarian revolutions
and other social convulsions — a freedom to be attributed principally,
after the general conservative character of the government, to that
original equality in the division of property which rendered future
Agrarian agitation            unnecessary.
    If    theseobservations are correct, the result of our examination
manifestly         is,
                 that there      no historical evidence whatever against the

              it
render all external assertion superfluous.         It remains now that we look
at the matter shortly from this point of view.
     Agrarian laws have not been fashionable in modern times — least of
all in Great Britain. They are contrary to our British instinct of
individual liberty, and our national habit of leaving no more power
than     absolutely necessary in the hands of the central government.

                                             interpreting the past through the

ancient social life, than the supposition that           was in all respects like
                                                            it

                                               is is

as much as possible unlike.        It in the contrasts, not in the identities,
which ancient history presents, that great part both of its charm, and of
its instructive virtue, consists. The ancient Dalmatians, we are told by
Strabo (vii. 315), made         general re-division of their lands every eighth
                                  a
year.    Are   we  to disbelieve  this, merely because such an agrarian cus
tom appears to us altogether preposterous, unjust, and impolitic          ?   If
so, we must take up David Hume's position, and believe nothing, how
ever well attested, that       contrary to the results of that very undefined
                                  is
range of induction which we call our experience. We shall, therefore,
say that there      nothing improbable in the idea that an ancient legis
                         is
lator may have assigned his citizens equal lots of land, however much
such a measure may be contrary to English instincts and modern prac
tices.   And       we look at the real position of the Dorians as
                    if                                                  a   com
paratively small body of invaders encamped in a hostile country which
they held in subjugation, we shall see the strongest argument in favour
of the existence of an Agrarian law such as was popularly attributed
to Lycurgus.      An uncontradicted tradition asserts that after conquering
the Peloponnesus, the position of the Dorians was for a considerable
period extremely uncomfortable. They had the utmost difficulty in hold
ing their ground. Now, in such circumstances, nothing could be more
dangerous to the common cause than those feuds and jealousies among
themselves which are wont to arise from an unequal distribution of
property.     As a nation of warriors, who had acquired this new terri

tory by the sword, they had been exposed to common perils, and were
entitled to a common reward. But against this law of equal national
right to the conquered territory, the cupidity and violence of indi
 vidual chiefs would no doubt prevail ; and the discontent hereby caused
would breed exactly that state of public danger, in which the safety of all
 would be consulted by giving an unlimited power of arbitration to
some influential person on whom all could rely.                  Such a national
arbiter in matters between debtor and creditor, within the strictly his
torical period, was Solon, in Athens; such an arbiter, specially in
reference to landed property,           I   conceive Lycurgus      to have been
 when he is spoken of as the author of the Agrarian laws.              I do not by
any   means   think  myself   bound   to  inquire into  the  probable   correctness
of the details of these laws as given by Plutarch ; but the fact itself
 carries with it all the probability that the existing circumstances, the
 habits of thought of the ancient mind (Muller, Dor. ii. p. 212,
 English), and the analogy of certain well-known facts in modern
history can confer. The secularization of church Innds at the French
revolution, and the law of succession to landed property then established,
operated     practically as an Agrarian law, tending both to prevent
immense accumulations of property in the hands of individuals, and to
create among the newly-constituted proprietors, a broad, permanent
 interest in the new state of things.         An Agrarian law of a different
kind was that carried out by Baron Stein in Prussia, under the pressure
of the great national humiliation subsequent to the battle of Jena in
 1808.    On the whole,     I am so far from seeing any improbability in the
alleged   equality  of  lots, which,   according to the universal testimony of
the ancients, characterized      the Spartan public economy, that it appears
to me to be only a necessary part of their general system of equality
and    brotherhood, within certain well-known               and   narrowly-drawn
limits of aristocratic privilege.            Among a race of proprietors as
unequal as the present English nobility and gentry, a common mess, the
(rvaoiriov, so characteristic of Spartan life, would have been an im
possibility.
     With these convictions,       I need hardly say that      I see no need for
having recourse to that "new canon of historical criticism" which
Mr. Grote (vol. ii. p. 165, edit. 1862) brings upon the stage for the
sake of solving the difficulties connected with the alleged Agrarian
law of Lycurgus.        This canon, which traces the belief in this law to
the heated enthusiasm of certain interested dreamers in the days of
Agis IV. and Cleomenes (250 and 222 B.C.), appears to me merely a
special application of the thaumaturgic German fashion of creating his
tory out of conjectures, against which            I  think our British instinct
ought to lead us distinctly to protest.         The habit of dealing negatively
with old national tradition and supplanting it by plausible theories, is
always flattering to the ingenuity of scholars, but affords a very ques
tionable basis for anything that can be called history.             For myself    I
do not believe that a royal reformer such as Agis, wishing to move the
people to an acceptance of a great measure of Agrarian reform, conld

 do so by appealing to a mere figment, the child of yesterday's dream ;
 but his only hope of success must lie in his being able to clothe the
 startling aspect of his revolutionary measure with all the attractions
 that belong to the re-brightening of a faded memory deeply seated in
 the traditional consciousness of the people.       Generally speaking, while
 I  would willingly admit that the outer links and flourishes of national
 tradition are often invented,      I do most firmly believe the trunk and
 body of any deep-rooted, widely-spread popular belief to be a fact, a
 material fact in the outward fates of the nation ; as the soul of it is a
 moral fact, often the most important moral fact in the history of a great
 people.    Such facts were the battles of Bannockburn and Drumclog in
 Scotland ; the Norman conquest in England ; the legislation of Moses
 among the Hebrews, and of Lycurgus among the Spartans ; the mari
 time sway of Minos in the isles of the ^Egean, and the brilliant des
 potism of the Tarquins in early Rome.          Facts of this nature, and the
 personalities to which they are bound, possess a tenacious vitality in the
 continued consciousness of a nation, altogether independent of any
 scrolls of written record by means of which their reality may have been
 externally attested.

      It is now about twenty years since Gerhardt drew attention to the
 error of the molecular weights, or equivalent weights, as he called
 them, which represented       water as consisting of one atom of oxygen
 and one of hydrogen, and proposed to double the atomic weights of
 oxygen and of carbon.
      If Gerhardt had taken Berzelius's atomic weights and, while trans
 lating them into the hydrogen scale, had halved the atomic weights of
 the alkali metals and boron, he would have given us at once the system
 which we now adopt, saving the rectification of a few formulae, such as
                                                                   U 2

276         Prof. Williamson   on Classification   of the Elements   [April 29,
that of silver and oxide of uranium, &c; whereas by merely doubling
oxygen, sulphur, selenium, and carbon, in the then existing system
of atomic weights in the hydrogen scale, he really introduced a system
in which there are between 30 and 40 atomic weights to correct, in lieu
of one which needed only five or six such corrections. It would be
unreasonable to apply this fact in any degree to the disparagement
of Gerhardt's work. It only shows how tortuous is the road which
leads to truth.
    The discussion of the question involves chiefly the consideration of
the classification of the elements under the respective heads of chlorine
and  of oxygen.
     The first tribe containing those elements of which an atom com
bines with one atom of hydrogen or chlorine, or with three or with
five, &c., whilst the second tribe contains elements of which each
atom combines with two atoms of chlorine, or other monads, or with
four, or six, &c. The speaker did not, however, recommend that the
two great classes of elements be thus distinguished from one another,
for our chief evidence of atomic weights is derived from the study of
the molecular weights of compounds, and the molecule is the unit to
 which results must be referred.
     The first class is best described as furnishing only an even number
of atoms to each molecule, whereas the second class sometimes fur
nishes an even, sometimes an uneven number of atoms to one molecule.
 The process of classifying the elements has followed the very natural order
 of establishing a certain number of well-defined families, which were
subsequently connected together by erratic members, which occasionally
left their usual place to go over to some neighbouring family. Chlorine,
bromine, and iodine have long been acknowledged to constitute a
natural family ; and there are some, though hardly sufficient reasons
for placing fluorine at its head.      The three elements have the same
vapour volume as hydrogen in the free state, and we accordingly
represent their respective molecules as Cl', Br8, 18, corresponding to
H * = 2 vols. They form hydrides of similar composition, and
analogous properties, and of the same vapour volume.            Their com
pounds with most metals are analogous and have the same atomic heat
and general crystalline form.       Their corresponding oxygen acids also
exhibit considerable analogy.
     With organic radicals they form neutral ethers, like Cl C' Hs,
Cl C" H8 O, and no acid ethers. So that when a molecule of alcohol
or of acetic acid is replaced by chlorine, two atoms of chlorine take the
place of one atom of oxygen, and give rise to a molecule of chloride of
ethyle and a molecule of hydrochloric acid. They replace hydrogen
atom for atom, taking out one, two, or three atoms, &c., according to
circumstances. Their hydrogen compounds are all monobasic acids ;
for   if,
       in    given quantity of hydrochloric or hydrobromic or hydriodic
              a
acid, we replace part only of the hydrogen by potassium, we get at once
a  neutral salt mixed with the remaining acid, which        undecomposed,
                                                             is
and never an acid salt of the alkalies.           Fluorine in this respect

1864.]                 in relation to their Atomicities.              277
exhibits an anomaly which tends to remove it from this family to a
biatomic one.     For the acid fluoride of potassium is a well-defined
compound of considerable stability, of which the existence points to
the atomic weight 38 for fluorine, and the formula H' F for hydro
fluoric acid.    Hydrofluoric acid, moreover, combines with various
metallic fluorides — such as fluoride of silicon and fluoride of boron ;
and there are double fluorides of aluminium, &c., with alkaline fluorides,
both well known and easily formed.
     Similar double salts are, however, formed by chlorine ; for in
stance, terchloride of gold combines with a molecule of hydrochloric
acid, or of an alkaline chloride.      Tetrachloride of platinum combines
with two molecules of hydrochloric acid or of chloride of potassium, &c.
     It is not possible to reconcile the constitution of these and similar
bodies with one another and with the simpler compounds of chlorine,
by any theory representing it as polyatomic, and as holding together
the metallic atoms in these salts in virtue of its polyatomic character.
On the other hand, hydrochloric acid and metallic chlorides of opposite
properties cannot be assumed to be incapable of uniting with one an
other, while it is well known that oxides of basylous properties unite
with those of chlorous properties.          Hydrochloric acid unites with
ammonia, and we do admit that the two molecules are bound together
into one by a chemical force of combination, and not by any tetratomic
character of the hydrogen ; and HC1 or KC1 combines with SO8 by
a similar force.
      Again : oxygen, sulphur, selenium, and tellurium are admitted to
be truly analogous elements, for the parallelism of oxygen salts, and
sulphur salts, affords abundant proof of the analogy of oxygen and
sulphur, and the molecular volume of sulphur and selenium is found
 by Deville to agree at high temperatures with that of oxygen.
      The elements selenium and tellurium form acids analogous to
sulphurous and sulphuric acids respectively.          When combined with
 organic radicals they form compounds of the same molecular volume
 in the form of vapour ; and when any of them, such as oxygen, re
 places hydrogen in an organic body, it takes out two atoms of hydrogen
 at a time, replacing each couple by one atom of oxygen, as in the
 formation of acetic acid from alcohol.
      When we partially decompose water by potassium we get hydrate
 of potash formed, which is a molecule of water, from which half the
 hydrogen is expelled and replaced by potassium, and a second atom of
 potassium is required to displace the remaining hydrogen.
      If we compare any proto-chloride with a corresponding oxide, either
 of a metal or organic radical, we find that the molecule of the oxide
 contains twice as many atoms of the metal or radical as the chloride,
 and that one atom from the oxygen family is equivalent to two atoms
 from the chlorine family.
      When oxygen in alcohol is replaced by sulphur, no breaking up
 into sulphide of ethyle and sulphide of hydrogen takes place, as when
  the oxygen is replaced by chlorine or bromine.

 278    Prof. Williamson    on Classification of the Elements   [April 29,
     Among the best known compounds there are several of which one
 atom combines, like an atom of oxygen or of sulphur, with two atoms
 like hydrogen or chlorine. Thus carbonic oxide, sulphurous acid, and
 olefiant gas are capable of combining in the proportion of one atom of
 the radical with two atoms of chlorine, forming the compound C O Cl'
 phosgene, So' Cl" chloro- sulphuric acid, and CZH'C18 I3utch liquid;
 and these molecules have the same vapour volume as steam O H'. But
 in the free state the radicals have a vapour volume double as great as
 the equivalent quantity of oxygen, the atoms CO, SO", C'H' being
 as bulky as Os, so that whereas the molecule of oxygen and of sulphur
 consists of two atoms, that of carbonic oxide consists of one atom
 only, so also the molecule of sulphurous acid and of olefiant gas.
     Another family of very marked characteristics is that consisting of
 N, P, As, Sb, Bi, each member of which combines with three atoms of
 hydrogen or of ethyle (C* H,). forming basic compounds analogous to
 ammonia.      Their analogy in chemical reactions is also well known,
 as each of them forms an oxide corresponding to nitrous acid, and
 another corresponding to nitric acid.
     The sulphides of arsenic and antimony are notorious for their great
resemblance, and that of arsenious and antimonious acid is scarcely less
striking.    It even extends to isomorphism of their corresponding salts.
     The atomic heat of the four last terms of the series is also very
nearly the same, whilst that of nitrogen (examined of course as a gas)
is considerably less. Then the molecule of phosphorus and of arsenic
consists of four atoms, whilst that of nitrogen consists only of two,
showing a variety of constitution, which is by no means to be wondered
at, when we recollect that these elements are not uniformly triatomic,
but sometimes monatomic, pentatomic, &c., so that the molecule of
free nitrogen consists of two monatomic atoms, or two triatomic,
whilst the molecule of phosphorus and of arsenic is formed on the
ammonia type of one triatomic atom and three monatomic atoms.
     Another family may, perhaps, be made up of carbon and silicon,
both of which form volatile tetrachlorides, and are sometimes biatomic,
 sometimes tetratomic in their acids.
     Among metals, lithium, sodium, potassium, and probably also
the new metals, rubidium, caesium, and thallium, have many important
points of resemblance which show them to be monatomic.               They
replace hydrogen atom for atom, and form with many bibasic acids
both normal and acid salts. Their chlorides form with tetra-chloride of
platinum analogous double salts, and their sulphates form, with sulphate
of alumina, &c., those well-characterized salts called alums. They do
not form basic salts (unless when triatomic, like thallium).    They have
nearly the same atomic heat.
     Silver is remarkable for several of the properties which we have
noticed in the alkali metals.       It is eminently monatomic, and dis
inclined to form basic salts.   Its atomic heat also shows it to be mona
tomic. It appears to form an alum, and its sulphate has a great
resemblance of form with the anhydrous sulphate of soda.

1864.]                I'M relation  to their Atomicities.                 279
     Gold also must from its specific heat, and the constitution of its
two chlorides be classed among the metals which are monatomic or
triatomic.    Boron is evidently triatomic in its best known compounds,
as proved by the ter-chloride and ethylide.
     Among metals with strongly basylous properties, Ca, Sr, Ba, Pb,
are connected by very close analogies.         The general resemblance of
their sulphates and carbonates, and the isomorphism of most of them,
are too well known to need mention.
     But lead has been obtained in combination with Ethyle, and the
compound Pb (C* IP)' which corresponds to binoxide of lead, in
which the two atoms of oxygen are replaced by four atoms of ethyle,
and the compound Pb (C* H,) 8C1 proves beyond a doubt that the
metal is there tetrabasic.
     Again : lead is pre-eminent for its tendency to form basic salts even
with purely monatomic chlorous elements and radicals. Thus ordinary
nitrate of lead, when warmed in aqueous solution with ceruse, expels
carbonic acid from that compound, and forms the well-known and
crystallizable  basic nitrate — Pb
                                       |^Q      If this be represented   upon
the water type, it is formed from two molecules of water, H
                                                                     §o   two
                                                                     no
atoms   of hydrogen, one from each molecule being replaced by the
biatomic atom lead, whilst one of the remaining atoms of hydrogen is
                           NO1
replaced by    N OJ, thus Pbo
                           Ho
     But if the binary theory be adopted, it must be represented as
lead combined with the radical N Oa, and also with the radical H O,
and the biatomic lead holds thus two atoms together, just as much
as biatomic oxygen holds together ethyle and hydrogen in alcohol.
 If we mix our lead compound with sulphate of silver, and heat with
water, we replace the one atom of lead in it by two atoms of silver,
 getting a mixture of nitrate of silver and brown hydrated oxide of silver
just as the replacement of oxygen in alcohol by Cl* forms chloride of
 ethyle + hydrochloric acid.
      We are thus led to consider these metals as biatomic, and to repre
 sent their oxides by the old formulae Ca O, Ba O, Pb 0,'whilst carbon
 ates, sulphides, and sulphates have formulae like Ca C O8, Ca S O8, Ca
 S O', their chlorides, nitrates, and phosphates have formulae like Ca
 Cl', Ca (N O8) ", Ca 8 (P O,) '. Nitrate of potash has thus a similar
 formula (N 0" K) to arragonite C O8 Ca, and their isomorphism is no
 longer surprising.     The same remark applies to calc spar and nitrate of
 soda.
      Another analogous group of        metals is the triad, magnesium, zinc,
 and cadmium, all volatile       and forming salts which greatly resemble
 one another, and in many        cases isomorphous.      The constitution and

280   Prof. Williamson      on Classification   of   the Elements   [April   29,
 properties of Frankland's zinc ethyle leaves no doubt of the biatomic
character of zinc, for the compound Zn (Cl H,)' has the same mole
cular volume as ether O(C'HJ)'1, and if the atom of zinc were taken
out and replaced by one atom of oxygen, there would be no change of
volume. Then half the ethyle in zinc ethyle is replaceable by iodine,
just as half the ethyle in ether is replaceable by potassium.
     The biatomic character of this family being thus established, we
can extend the conclusion to the other metals which form magnesian
oxides, so called from the striking analogy of constitution of several of
their salts with the corresponding salt of magnesia.         In this manner
we are led to adopt for iron, manganese, nickel, cobalt, and copper
 atomic weights corresponding to biatomic cha acters.       The subsulphide
 of copper is thus represented by the formula Cu' S, which is sufficiently
 similar to that of sulphide of silver, Aga S, to remove our surprise at
 their isomorphism.    There    is,moreover, in the reactions of alumina,
sesqui-oxide of iron, sesqui-oxide of chromium, and sesqui-oxide of
manganese, much resemblance.          All these are weak bases, and their
 sulphates form with sulphate of potash those most characteristic salts
 called alums.    The three first are isomorphous in the uncombined
state, so that the conclusion established for iron and manganese may be
extended to aluminium and chromium.           But     it also arrived at by
                                                           is
other means, for chromium in combination with oxygen and chlorine
forms the well-characterized compound Cr O8 Cl' chloro-chromic acid,
which contains the same quantity of oxygen and of chlorine as chloro-
sulphuric acid in two volumes of vapour, having 52'5 of chromium in
the place of the 32 of sulphur of that compound.       Again, chromic and
sulphuric acids exhibit a   marked resemblance of properties, the former
being,if   anything, even more distinctly bibasic than the latter, and
their normal potash salts are isomorphous, so that chromium            abun
                                                                        is
dantly proved to be similar to sulphur in atomicity, and brings in
evidence of its own in favour of the biatomic character of aluminium,
iron, and manganese.      In like manner manganese in manganic acid           is
connected with sulphur in sulphuric acid, and requires        corresponding
                                                                a
biatomic weight.      The isomorphism and general analogy of per-man-
ganate of potash with per-chlorate of potash has often been alluded to
as pointing to the necessity of representing the former by          aformula
containing one large atom of manganese, Mn O, K but although this
                                                            :
formula, by assimilating the expressions for these two similar bodies,
removes one difficulty,  it  creates at the same time another difficulty,
by presenting   a   formula containing only one atom from the first
family of elements.     The speaker said he would not at present hazard
any opinion regarding the propriety of removing this difficulty by
doubling the above formulae, together with that of per-chlorate of
potash, although he might remark that the constitution of the basic
per-iodate of soda points to the formula Is O9 Na,      (Hs O).
                                                           3
     An exceedingly strong ground for admitting for many heavy
motals the atomic weight corresponding to        a biatomic character was
brought forward some time ago          by Wurtz, who pointed out that

1864.]                   in relation to their Atomicities.                       281
adopting for oxygen the atomic weight 16, we get a half-molecule of
       TTi f\
water — — in one molecule of various salts if we consider the heavy
metals monatomic.
    Other metals are susceptible of reduction by similar analogies to
the class of elements which are biatomic or tetratomic, &c.        Thus
mercury is proved by the ethylide and methylide to be biatomic by the
fact that the compound for one atom of mercury with two atoms of
ethyle or of methyle, occupies the same volume in the state of vapour
as the compound of one atom of oxygen with two of ethyle or of
methyle Hg (C H')'= 2 vols., and we can take out one atom of methyle
from the bi-methylide of mercury, and replace it by an atom of chlorine,
bromine, or iodine without disturbing the type,              J1'   Hg.    The   com
mon    bi-chloride of mercury has, moreover,         vapour volume corre
                                                     a
sponding to the biatomic character of the metal, and the same thing
holds good of the vapour of metallic mercury itself, which has the
same volume as the metal cadmium, and probably zinc, and the well-
known biatomic radicals        O,C   Os, Cs H', but double the volume of
                                      S
the elements oxygen and sulphur.            In the present state of our
knowledge the speaker was not aware of any sufficient grounds for
deciding which of these two constitutions of the free molecule of                    a
biatomic element or radical         to be considered as normal and which
                                     is
is abnormal.      On the one hand, mercury, cadmium, and all known
biatomic radicals have       amolecule containing one atom, while the
molecule of oxygen contains two atoms, and that of sulphur two at
high temperatures and six at lower temperatures.           Selenium      at     is
high temperatures      like sulphur.    It has  been amply   shown  by  Dr.
Odling and others that tin           biatomic and tetratomic in its two
                                     is
chlorides, and its compounds with the organic radicals and chlorine,
&c., leave no room for doubt on the point.
     By similar chains of evidence the remaining metals can be shown
to belong to the great biatomic class containing already so many.
     The vapour densities of the so-called sesqui-chlorides of iron,
aluminium, and chromium, as determined by Deville, show that the
molecule of each of these bodies contains two atoms of metal and six
atoms of chlorine, in fact the same quantity of metal as the molecule
of the sesqui-oxide this fact has been held to be an anomaly from the
                     :
point of view adopted regarding their atomic weights. The speaker
believed, however, that so far from being anomalous, these vapour
densities are the least which can be reconciled with the conclusion that
the metals permanently combine with even numbers of atoms from the
first family, for   if one atom of iron could on occasion combine with
three atoms of chlorine to form one molecule, the law respecting                     it
would assume the not very wise form, — that iron combines with an
even number of atoms from the first family, except when           combines
                                                                         it
with an uneven number        !
     The fact is,  that the sesqui-chlorides are not exceptions to the law,

as  at first sight they are suspected of being. Precisely the same
remarks apply to the so-called subchloride of sulphur of which the
molecule is S* Cls, as required by the law. So also cyanogen C* N*,
acetylene   C* H*, ethyle C' H10, &c. &c.     Amongst exceptions, the
speaker mentioned nitric oxide and calomel, both of which have vapour
densities corresponding to the molecular formulae N O and Hg CI.
    Many compounds are known to undergo decomposition on evapora
tion, and to be reproduced on condensation ; thus N IP O yields the two
molecules N H» and IP O, each with its own volume, as also S O3 Hs
yields S O2 and IP 0.      S O4 H9 and P CI5 are also known to yield on
evaporation vapour corresponding to a breaking-up into two molecules ;
and there are strong reasons from analogy, as well as experimental
evidence, to believe such decomposition.      As, however, a high au
thority seems inclined to doubt the decomposition, the matter may be
considered as still sub judice.
    The existence of basic salts of mercury or copper, when apparently
monatomic, is another class of apparent exceptions to the law. For      in     if,
the sub-nitrate of mercury, the atom of metal really replaced one atom
of hydrogen, just as potassium does in nitrate of potash, there ought not
to be basic sub-nitrate of mercury, any more than      basic potash salt
                                                              a                      ;
whereas  if the sub-nitrate of mercury contains, as the speaker asserted,
in one molecule two atoms of metal and two atoms of the salt radical
of the nitrates (N O»), then a basic salt   as natural and intelligible
                                                  is                                 a
compound as the basic nitrate of the red oxide.
    The action of ammonia on calomel confirms the molecular weight
Hg* CI* for the compound N IP Hg* CI, formed simultaneously with
         ;
sal ammonia, proves that twice (HgCl) takes place in the reaction.

          COLONEL PHILIP     JAMES YORKE, F.R.S. in      the Chair.
                         PROFESSOR   ROSCOE,   F.R.S.
 On   the  Metal Indium and Recent Discoveries      on Spectrum   Analysis.
Since    the spring of 1862, when the speaker delivered a course of three
lectures in this Institution on the Spectrum Discoveries, much has been
done to increase our knowledge of Spectrum Analysis, but the whole
subject is still in its infancy, and the further we advance the more we
find remains to be known.
     No less than four new elementary bodies have already been dis
covered by means of Spectrum Analysis : Caesium and Rubidium, by
 Bunsen ; Thallium, by Mr. Crookes ; and Indium, by Reich and Richter,
 of Freiberg ; whilst the foundations of Solar Chemistry, laid by Kirchhoff,
 have been rendered more secure by the observations            of Cooke, in
 America ; Donati, in Italy ; and Miller and Huggins, in England.
      Caesium and rubidium were at first only found in one or two
 mineral waters ; they have since been shown to be widely distributed
 in the vegetable as well as in the mineral kingdom ; they have been
 obtained in considerable quantities from the beet-root salt, and found in
 the ashes of tea and coffee, thus proving that they occur commonly in
 soil ; whilst, quite recently, M. Pisani has found that a mineral, called
 pollux, occurring in Elba, contains 34 per cent, of caesium, this metal
 having been mistaken for potash in the analyses which had previously
 been made of this substance.      Thallium and its compounds have been
 obtained in large quantities, and their properties fully investigated by
 Crookes and Lamy, whilst this metal has not only been found in iron
 pyrites, but also in large quantities by Schrotter, in the mica of Zinn-
 wald, and in lepidolite, from Moravia.       Thallium has been shown by
 Boettger to occur together with caesium and rubidium in the mineral
 water of Nauheim, near Frankfort ; Boettger has, moreover, shown that
 thallium is contained in the vegetable kingdom, he has found it in the
 yeast of the vinous fermentation ; so that thallium exists in wine ; also
 in treacle, tobacco, and chicory.     If 4 lbs. of any of these substances
 are employed, a sufficient quantity of thallium can be obtained as the
 double platinum-chloride to enable its presence to be easily detected.
 Professor Bunsen has informed the speaker that he has found a mother
 liquor from the Hartz, which contains so much thallium, that the

iodide can be obtained by direct precipitation in quantity at the rate
of 10*. per lb. The speaker exhibited the spectrum of the Nauheim
salt, which contains the three new elements ; the spectrum of each
metal is well seen by placing the mixed platino-chlorides                 in the
electric arc.
     Drs. Reich and Richter, of Freiberg, in Saxony, have lately dis
covered a fourth new metal in the Freiberg zinc blende.*              This metal
has been termed Indium, from the two splendid indigo-blue lines which
characterize its spectrum. Through the kindness of Professor Richter,
the speaker had been placed in possession of a few grains of this
new metal, the spectrum of which was exhibited by the electric
lamp. In its chemical relations it resembles zinc, with which it is asso
ciated in nature ; the metal can be reduced before the blowpipe to a
malleable bead, when it forms a soft, ductile bead, which imparts streaks
to paper on rubbing, and possesses a colour lighter than that of lead,
being about the same as that of tin. The metallic bead dissolves in hydro
chloric acid with the evolution of hydrogen.          The oxide of indium is
formed as a yellow fusible incrustation when the metal is heated before
the blowpipe on charcoal.       Indium differs from zinc in the insolubility
of the hydrated oxide in excess of both ammonia and caustic potash.
This new element may be separated from all the known metals by pre
cipitating its sulphide in alkaline solution, and by throwing down the
hydrated oxide first with ammonia and then with caustic potash ; and,
lastly, by precipitating the iron with dilute solution of bicarbonate of
sodium. The hydrated oxide of indium then remains in solution in
the pure state.       Indium may be readily detected when present in its
pure compounds by the deep purple tint which these impart to flame.
The characteristic lines are, however, best seen when a small bead of
indium salt is placed between two poles, from which an electric spark
passes ; the lines In a and In ft fall respectively upon divisions 107'5,
and 1 40 of the photographic scale of the spectroscope, when Na = 50,
and Sr   J=    100-5.    Up to the present time indium has been only found
in the very smallest quantity, and hence the atomic weight of the metal
and the composition of its salts have not yet been determined ; in
fact, the speaker was led to infer that Professor Richter sent him
 nearly all the compound of the metal remaining from the investigation
of its properties, for the purpose of illustrating this discourse.         It has
only as yet been detected in the zinc blende of Freiberg ; but it will,
doubtless, soon be discovered in larger quantities, and its compounds
more closely studied.
     As regards the spectra of the well-known metals, our knowledge has
been much increased by the publication of the second series of KirchhofFs
maps of the solar spectrum and the spectra of the chemical elements
 (Macmillan and Co.). In these Kirchhoff has marked the position of
the bright lines of no less than thirty metals, and indicated those which,
as they coincide with a dark solar line, reveal the presence of the par-

ticular metal in the sun's atmosphere.      KirchhofFs maps now embrace
the whole of the visible spectrum from the line a in the extreme red,
to the line a in the indigo ; beyond these limits the intensity of the
light passing through his three prisms became too slight to enable him
to draw the lines.   The observations thus made of coincidences of me
tallic with solar lines in the red and indigo portions of the spectrum,
confirm the conclusions drawn by Kirchhoff from his earlier obser
vations, with the exception of the presence of potassium.       This metal
is not seen in the solar atmosphere, the potassium red line is not coin
cident with the solar line a, as it was supposed to be, nor with any
other dark solar line.   No metal, in addition to those previously ob
served, was found to possess lines coincident with solar lines, and hence
the number of bodies known to be present in the sun has not been
increased.
     The experiments of Mr. Huggins on the spectra of the metallic
elements, made with an instrument of six prisms, although not yet
published in full, promise to add greatly to our knowledge on this
subject : one interesting observation may be cited ; viz. that the
spectrum of sodium has been found to contain three pairs of lines in
addition to those corresponding to the dark double line d, and that these
also coincide with dark solar lines, adding to the evidence previously
possessed of the existence of sodium in the sun.         The audience had
been already made acquainted with Dr. Miller's important researches
on the photographic spectra of the metals, and with the valuable
observations made by himself and Mr. Huggins on the spectra of the
fixed stars.   Connected with this part of the subject may be men
tioned Professor Stokes's interesting investigation on the long spec
trum of the electric spark, in which he shows that the vapour of certain
metals, such as iron and magnesium,          when heated by the passage
of an electric spark, emit rays of so high a degree of refrangibility,
that they are situated at a distance from the lines h, ten times as great
as that of the whole visible spectrum from a to h.           These highly
refrangible rays only become visible at the highest temperatures, and
they are not seen in the solar spectrum, although the less refrangible
iron and magnesium lines are present.        Hence it has been suggested
that the temperature of the sun must be lower than that of the electric
 spark in which these lines are developed.        This conclusion appears
legitimate only if we know that these rays of high refrangibility are
not absorbed in passing through our atmosphere ; and an investigation
of great interest here presents itself for those who ascend into the higher
regions of the atmosphere.
     The observations of Dr. Robinson upon metallic spectra have led this
astronomer to doubt the validity of some of the conclusions arrived at
 by Kirchhoff concerning the existence of a separate and non-coincident
set of lines in the spectrum of each metal.        It seems, however, that
 Dr. Robinson employed only one prism and a low magnifying power,
 so that we must conclude that the observations from which he deduces
 the coincidence of certain lines as proving their identity in several

metal*, cannot impugn the results obtained by help of a larger instru
ment of sufficient power to resolve these apparent coincidences.
     The original statement made by Bunsen and KirchhofF concerning
the spectra of the metals still remains unopposed by a single well-
established fact — the statement, namely, that when a metal is heated
up to a certain point, the spectrum of its incandescent vapour contains
a number of fine bright      lines which do not change their position
with increase of temperature, and are not coincident with the lines of
any other known substance.       There is, however, no doubt of the fact
that in the spectra of certain metals or metallic compounds new lines
are developed by increase       of temperature ; and also that certain
metals, as calcium, barium, and strontium, yield spectra of two kinds ;
one of these, seen at the lower temperature, and consisting of broad
bands,   being resolved at a higher temperature into bright lines.
These bright lines do not undergo any further change on elevation of
temperature, and characterize the true metallic spectrum, whilst the
band-spectrum    is probably produced by the incandescent vapour of a
metallic compound which is decomposed at a higher temperature.
     Our knowledge of the spectra of the non-metallic elements        as       is,
yet,
       in
       a  very incomplete state.    To the researches of Plucker, we are
especially indebted for information on this subject    he has shown that
                                                            ;
each     metalloid   possesses   a   peculiar   and   characteristic     spectrum    ;
hydrogen,    for instance, yielding only three bright lines, all of which are
coincident    with dark solar lines and nitrogen exhibiting
                                     ;                           complicated
                                                                     a
series   of bands. Plucker has lately come to the conclusion that many
non-metallic elementary bodies, and among them sulphur and nitrogen,
exhibit two distinctly different spectra when the temperature  altered,  is
in  this respect resembling the metals of the alkaline earths.    This
difference Plucker ascribes to the existence of these elements in two
allotropic conditions.
    A singular relation with regard to what have been termed the
carbon lines was observed by the speaker.         It has been stated that
all the various forms of carbon compounds when in the state of incan-
desceut gas, yield identical spectra.   This proves not to be the case               ;
the spectrum obtained from the flame of olefiant gas        different from
                                                                is
that obtained by the electric discharge through       vacuum of the same
                                                        a
gas; whilst the spark passing through       cyanogen vacuum produces
                                                a                                    a
spectrum identical with that of the olefiant gas-flame, and through the
carbonic oxide vacuum       a spectrum coincident with that of the spark
through olefiant gas vacuum.
     As an illustration of the application of abstract scientific prin
ciples to useful practical purposes,     the speaker stated that he had
lately applied spectrum analysis to the manufacture of steel            the   by
Bessemer    process.   One of the great drawbacks to the successful
practical working of Mr. Bessemer's beautiful process for converting
cast-iron directly into steel, has been the difficulty of determining the
exact point at which the blast of air passing through the molten metal
is to be stopped.    The conversion of five tons of cast-iron into cast

 288                           Professor  Roscoe                    [May   6,
steel usually occupies    from fifteen to twenty minutes, according to the
varying conditions of weather, quality of the iron, strength of the
blast, &c.    If  the blast be continued for ten seconds after the proper
point has been attained, or if it be discontinued ten seconds before that
point is reached, the charge becomes either so viscid that it cannot be
poured from the converting vessel into the moulds, or it contains so
much carbon as to crumble under the hammer. Up to the present
time, the manufacturer has judged of the condition of the metal by the
general appearance of the flame which issues from the mouth of the
converting vessel.       Long experience enables the workman thus to
detect, with more or less exactitude, the point at which the blast
must be cut off.       It appeared to the speaker that an examination of
the spectrum of this flame might render it possible to determine this
point with scientific accuracy, and that thus an insight might be gained
into the somewhat complicated chemical changes which occur in this
conversion of cast-iron into steel.       At the request of Messrs. John
Brown    and Co.,  of the Atlas  Works,  Sheffield, the speaker investigated
the subject, and succeeded in obtaining very satisfactory and interest
ing results.     The instrument employed was an ordinary Steinheil's
spectroscope,  furnished   with photographic scale and lamp, and provided
with a convenient arrangement for directing the tube carrying the slit
towards any wished-for part of the flame, and for clamping the whole
instrument in the required position.      By help of such an arrangement
the spectrum of the flame can be most readily observed, and the
changes which periodically occur can be most accurately noted.
     The light which is given off by the flame in this process is most
intense ; indeed, a more magnificent example of combustion in oxygen
cannot be imagined — and a cursory examination of the flame spectrum
in its various phases reveals complicated masses of dark absorption
bands and bright lines, showing that a variety of substances are present
in the flame in the state of incandescent gas. By a simultaneous
comparison of these lines in the flame-spectrum with the well-known
spectra of certain elementary bodies, the speaker has succeeded in
detecting the presence of the following substances in the Bessemer
flame: — Sodium, potassium, lithium, iron, carbon, phosphorus, hydro
gen, and nitrogen.
     A further investigation with an instrument of higher dispersive and
magnifying powers than that employed, will doubtless add to the above
list; 'and an accurate and prolonged study of this spectrum will pro
bably yield very important information respecting the nature of the
reactions occurring within the vessel.     Already the investigation is so
far advanced that the point in the condition of the metal at which it
has been found necessary to stop the blast can be ascertained with pre
cision ; and thus, by the application of the principles of Spectrum
Analysis, that which previously depended on the quickness of vision of
a skilled eye has become a matter of exact scientific observation.
     Another interesting practical application of our knowledge concern
ing the properties of the kind of light which certain bodies emit when

  heated, is the employment of the       light evolved by burning Magnesium
  wire for photographic purposes.         The spectrum of this light is exceed
 ingly rich in violet and ultra-violet rays, due partly to the incandescent
 vapour of magnesium, and partly to the intensely-heated magnesia
 formed by the combustion.         Professor Bunsen and the speaker in 1859
 determined the chemically active power possessed by this light, and
 compared it with that of the sun ; and they suggested the application
of this light for the purpose of photography.               They showed* that a
 burning surface of magnesium wire, which, seen from a point at the
sea's level, has an apparent magnitude equal to that of tiie sun, effects
on that point the same chemical action as the sun would do if shining
from a cloudless sky at a height of 9° 53' above the horizon.                 On
comparing the visible brightness of these two sources of light, it was
found that the brightness of the sun's disc, as measured by the eye, is
524-7 times as great as that of burning magnesium wire when the sun's
zenith distance is 67° 22' ; whilst at the same zenith distance the sun's
chemical brightness is only 36-6 times as great.              Hence the value of
this light as a source of the chemically active rays for photographic
purposes becomes at once apparent.
     Professor Bunsen and the speaker state in the memoir above referred
to, that, "the steady and equable light evolved by magnesium                wire,
burning in the air. and the immense chemical action thus produced ;
render this source of light valuable as a simple means of obtaining a
given amount of chemical illumination, and that the combustion of
this metal constitutes so definite and simple a source of light for the
purpose of photo-chemical measurement, that the wide distribution of
magnesium       becomes desirable.      The application of this metal as a
source of light may even become of technical importance.               A burning
magnesium wire of the thickness of 0'297 millimetre, evolves, accord
ing to the measurement we have made, as much light as 74 stearine
candles of which five go to the pound.           If this light lasted one minute,
0-987 metre of wire, weighing 0-120 grammes, would be burnt,                   hi
order to produce a light equal to 74 candles burning for ten hours,
whereby about 20 lbs. of stearine is consumed. 72-2 grammes (2$ ounces)
of magnesium would be required.            The magnesium wire can be easily
prepared by forcing out the metal from a heated steel press having a fine
opening at bottom ; this wire might be rolled up in coils on a spindle,
 which could be made to revolve by clockwork, and thus the end of
the wire, guided by passing through a groove or between rollers, could
be continually pushed forward into a gas or spirit lamp flame in which
it would burn."
     It afforded the speaker great pleasure to state that the foregoing
 suggestion had now been actually carried out.              Mr. Edward Sonstadt
has succeeded      in preparing magnesium         on the large scale, and great
 credit is due to this gentleman for the able manner in which he has

present very satisfactory position.
    Some fine specimens of crude and distilled magnesium weighing
3 lbs. were exhibited as manufactured by Mr. Sonstadt's process, by
Messrs. Mellor & Co. of Manchester.

foot ; * and half-an-inch of the wire evolves on burning light enough to
transfer a positive image to a dry collodion plate ; whilst by the com
bustion of 10 grains a perfect photographic portrait may be taken,
so that the speaker believed that for photographic purposes alone the
magnesium light will prove most important.             The photochemical
power of the light was illustrated by taking a portrait during the
discourse. In doing this the speaker was aided by Mr. Brothers,
photographer, of Manchester, who was the first to use the light for
portraiture.

     I. Is gun-cotton stronger than gunpowder ? The answer to this
is, Yes, sixfold stronger.
     By this we mean that             if
                                    we take      given weight of gun-cotton, say
                                                        a
four ounces, if we bore            hole 1$ inch in diameter and
                                      a                                   feet deep,    3
into hard rock or slate, in a quarry, and put                 ounces of gun-cotton
                                                                           4
into   it,  it will occupy about          foot of its length, and the aperture
                                           1
being    closed     in  the   usual   manner, and         match-line led from the
                                                                      a
charge   to   the  proper   distance   from which to fire           and     we next
                                                                               it
                                                                                ;        if
take 24 ounces of best gunpowder, bore                similar hole, and charge
                                                             a                                 it
similarly with gunpowder, and close               in the same way
                                                        it                 has been ;   it
found that, on these being exploded, the               ounces of gun-cotton have
                                                              4
produced greater effect, in separating the rock into pieces, than the
24 ounces of gunpowder.            The answer
                                                             is is,
                                                     therefore, that in disruptive
explosion the strength of gun-cotton                  sixfold that of good gun
powder.
     But the disruptive or bursting power of gunpowder                   not always is
the quality for which we value             most, nor the service we require of
                                               it
it. In mining rocks, in exploding shells, in blowing up fortresses,
this property        is what we value, and this work              what we require.
                                                                               is
But we do not want to burst our fowling-pieces, our rifles, our
cannon.      On the contrary, we want to use               force that shall project
                                                                       a
the projectile out of the gun without bursting the gun, without strain
ing the gun beyond           given moderate limit, which
                              a                                    shall be able to
                                                                               it
endure.      We    want   therefore     service from gun-cotton which shall be
                                           a
the contrary of destructive to, or disruptive of, the chamber in which
it does the work of giving motion to the projectile.
     This moderated and modified work, gun-cotton can also perform                             ;
and   it    the modern discovery of General Lenk, which has enabled us
           is
to moderate and modify gun-cotton, to this gentler service.                  He dis
covered how to organize, arrange, and dispose mechanically of gun-
cotton in such           way that
                         a                should be three times stronger than
                                           it
gunpowder.         Accordingly, one of his charges of gun-cotton, weighing
 16 ounces, projected            12-pound solid round shot with a speed of
                                  a
 1,426 feet      second, while
                 a                   charge of gunpowder of 49 ounces gave
                                      a
the same shot        aspeed of 1,400 feet       second. a   One-third of the weight
of gun-cotton exceeded, therefore, the threefold weight of gunpowder
in useful effect.
     II. Is gun-cotton more convenient than gunpowder? This                                   is
                                                                                              a
larger and more various question than the former, and divides itself
into various subdivisions.
     It well known to sportsmen, to soldiers, to artillery-men, that
           is
gunpowder fouls           gun.
                          a       A foul residue of soot, sulphur, and potash
soils the inside of the gun after every charge.              The gun must, some
how, be cleaned after a discharge if not            ;    fires worse, recoils more,
                                                                      it
and ceases to do its best.           If the gun be breech-loading gun its
                                                                       a

294                           Mr. Scott Russell                  [May  13,
mechanism is dirtied, and works less easily. Gun-cotton deposits no
residue, leaves the gun clean and clear, and the utmost it does is to
leave a gentle dew of clear water on the inside of the bore, this water
being the condensed steam which forms one of the products of its
decomposition.      Gun-cotton is, therefore, superior to gunpowder in
not fouling the gun, a result favourable both to quicker and more
accurate firing.
     It is further a matter of no slight convenience that gun-cotton
makes no smoke.       In mines the smoke of gunpowder makes the air
unbreathable,    and  for some time after explosion the miners cannot
return to their work.        In boring the great tunnel of Mont Cenis
through    the Alps, the  delay from smoke of powder alone will postpone
the opening of the line for many months.       After a properly-conducted
explosion of gun-cotton, the workmen may proceed in their work at
once without inconvenience.
      In casemates of fortresses, gunpowder fills the casemates with foul
 smoke, and the men speedily sink under the exertion of quick firing.
 By using gun-cotton it was ascertained that the men could continue
 their work unharmed for double the quantity of firing.     This is partly
 attributed to the greater heat, and partly to the foulness of the air
 produced by gunpowder.
      But it is under the decks of our men-of-war, that greatest benefit
 is likely to arise from gun-cotton.     Not only does the smoke of a
 broadside fill the between decks with hot and foul air, but the smoke
 of the windward gun blinds the sight, and hinders the aim of the lee
 ward.     When there is no smoke, as with gun-cotton, the aim of every
 gun may be precise and deliberate.         The diminished heat between
 decks will also tell powerfully      in favour of gun-cotton.      In our
 armour-plated ships also there is more value in breech-loading guns,
 than in any other use of artillery.       It is one of the necessities of
 breech-loading mechanism, that it be kept clean, and nothing tends
 more to derange its perfect action than the greater heat which gun
 powder imparts to the gun from which it is fired.
      That gun-cotton has the convenience of not heating the gun has
 been thus proved.       100 rounds were fired in 34 minutes with gun-
 cotton, and the temperature of the gun was raised 90°.         100 rounds
 were fired with gunpowder, and triple the time allowed to cool the
 gun, which nevertheless was heated so much as to evaporate water with
 a hissing sound, which indicated that its temperature was much above
 212°.     Under these circumstances the firing with gunpowder had to be
 stopped, while that with gun-cotton was comfortably continued to 180
 rounds.
      It is also a matter of practical convenience that gun-cotton, inso
  much as it is lighter, can be carried more easily and farther than gun
  powder ; and it may be wetted without danger, so that when dried
 again in the open air, it is as good for use as before.
      III.  We have now to ask — is it cheaper? The answer -to this
 question must be qualified— pound for pound it is dearer; we must

1
    864.]        on the Mechanical       Nature of Gun-cotton.             295
 therefore judge of its cheapness by its effect, not by weight merely.
 But where it does six times as much work, it can then be used at six
 times the price per pound and still be as cheap as gunpowder.           As far
 as we yet know, the prices of gun-cotton and gunpowder are nearly
 equal, and it is only therefore where the one has advantages and con
 veniences beyond the other, and is more especially suited for some
 specific purpose, that it will have the preference. Effective cheap
 ness will therefore depend mainly on which of the two does best the
 particular kind of duty required of it.
     To illustrate how curiously these two powers, gun-cotton and gun
 powder, differ in their nature, and how the action of gun-cotton may
 be changed by mechanical arrangements, we may take one kind of work
 that is required of both : —  If a general want to blow open the gates of
a city, he orders an enterprising party to steal up to the gate, with a
bag containing 100 lbs. of gunpowder, which he nails to the gate, and
by a proper match-line he fires the gunpowder and bursts open the
gate.       If
             he nailed a bag of gun-cotton of equal weight in the same
place and fired     it,the gun-cotton would fail, and the gate would be
uninjured, although the 100 lbs. of gun-cotton                is sixfold more
powerful than the gunpowder.            Here, then, gunpowder has the
advantage — both weight and effect considered.
     But the fault here lies not in the gun-cotton, but the way of using
it.    If instead of 100 lbs. of gun-cotton in        a bag, 25 lbs. had been
taken in a proper box made for this purpose, and simply laid down
near the gate, and not even nailed to         it,
                                                this 25 lbs. would shiver the
gate into splinters.     The bag which suits the powder happens not to
suit the gun-cotton.
     Gun-cotton   is  thereforea  power of       totally different nature from
                                                  a
gunpowder, and requires complete study to know its nature and
understand its use.      It appears that both gunpowder and gun-cotton
have special qualities, and may be peculiarly suited for peculiar uses.
 It   isthe duty of    awise people to make use of both to the ends they
each suit best, without prejudice arising from the accident of novelty
or antiquity.
     The nature of gun-cotton requires           double study, chemical and
                                                  a
mechanical.      Itis  not like steam, the same substance, whether in the
form of ice or water or steam.         It    isone substance when as gun-
cotton     enters the gun, and quite
            it                           different one when

and leaves the gun. Not only are the solids which enter converted
into gas, but they form totally new combinations and substances.             So
that the marvellous changes which the chemist effects by the magic
of his art take place in an instant of time, and during that almost
inconceivably minute period of time, in          laboratory intensely heated,

new unions are cemented, and at the end of this prolific instant totally
new combinations of matter, forming what we call new substances, issue
from the gun. It so happens that of these new substances, formed out

powder   there remain 68 per cent, of solid residue, and only 32 per
cent, are pure gases.
                MECHANICAL         APPLICATIONS     OF GUN-COTTON.
     The mechanical application of gun-cotton may be considered to be
due exclusively to Major-General Lenk, of the Austrian service.    Pure
gun-cotton becomes either a powerful explosive agent, or a docile per
former of mechanical duty, not according to any change in its compo
sition, or variation in its elements or their proportions, but according
to the mechanical structure which is given to it, or the mechanical
arrangements of which it is made a part.      It was General Lenk who
discovered that structure was quality, and mechanical arrangement
the measure of power, in gun-cotton ; and in his hands, a given quan
tity of the same cotton becomes a mild, harmless, ineffectual firework,
a  terrible, irresistible, explosive agent, or a pliable, powerful, obedient
workman.
     The first form which General Lenk bestowed on gun-cotton was
that of a continuous yarn or spun thread. Gunpowder is carefully
made into round grains of a specific size.             Gun-cotton is simply a
long thread of cotton fibre, systematically spun into a yarn of given
weight per yard, of given tension, of given specific weight.             A hank
of a given length is reeled, just like a hank of cotton yarn to be made
into cloth, and in this state gun-cotton yarn is bought and sold like
any other article of commerce.
     This cotton yarn converted into gun-cotton may be called, there
fore, the raw material of commerce.             In this form it is not at all
explosive in the common sense of the word. You may set fire to a
hank of   it,   and it   will burn rapidly with       large flame
                                                       a             but  ;   you   if
yourself keep out of reach of the flame, and keep other combusti
bles beyond reach, no harm will happen, and no explosion or concus
sion will result.        Ifyou lay      long thread of

cotton thread at intervals, and light one end of the thread,           will form
                                                                              it

                                                                     it                    it
as  it  blows with or against the line of the thread. This              the best

way to commence an acquaintance with this interesting agent.
     Care must be taken not to become too familiar with gun-cotton
even in this harmless and playful guise; cotton dresses will readily
catch fire from    it, and    it should not be treated with less care to keep
fire from it   than gunpowder.        In one respect        less liable to cause
                                                           it   is
danger than gunpowder.               Grains of powder are easily dropped
through  a   crevice, and may be sprinkled about in          scarcely noticeable

 1864.  1      on the Mechanical    Applications of Gun-cotton,          297
     The second form of gun-cotton is an arrangement compounded out
of  the elementary yarn.       It resembles the plaited cover of a riding-
whip ; it is plaited round a core or centre which is hollow.         In this
form it is match-line, and, although formed merely of the yarn plaited
into a ronnd hollow cord, this mechanical arrangement has at once
conferred on it the quality of speed.        Instead of travelling as before
only   6  inches a  second, it now  travels 6 feet a second.
     The third step in mechanical arrangement is to enclose this cord
in a close outer skin or coating, made generally of India-rubber cloth,
and in this shape it forms a kind of match-line, that will carry fire at a
speed of from 20 to 30 feet per second.
     It is not easy to gather from these changes what is the cause which
so completely changes the nature of the raw cotton by mechanical
arrangement alone.        Why a straight cotton thread should burn with
a slow creeping motion when laid out straight, and with a rapid one
when wound round in a cord, and again much faster when closed in
from the air, is far from obvious at first sight ; but the facts being so,
deserve mature consideration.
     The cartridge of a common rifle in gun-cotton is nothing more
than a piece of match-line in the second form enclosed in a stout paper-
tube, to prevent it being rammed down like powder.             The ramming
down, which is essential to the effective action of gunpowder, is fatal
to that of gun-cotton.       To get useful work out of a gun-cotton rifle,
the shot must on no account be rammed down, but simply transferred
to its place.      Air left in a gunpowder barrel is often supposed to
burst the gun ; in a gun-cotton barrel, it only mitigates the effect of
the charge.      The object of enclosing the gun-cotton charge in a hard
strong pasteboard cartridge, is to keep the cotton from compression
and give it room to do its work.
     It is a fourth discovery of General Lenk, that to enable gun-cotton
to perform its work in artillery practice, the one thing to be done is to
"give it room."         Don't press it together — don't cram it into small
bulk ! give it at least as much room as gunpowder in the gun, even
though there be only one-third or one-fourth of the quantity (measured
 by weight).      1 lb. of gun-cotton will carry a shot as far as 3 or 4 lbs.
of gunpowder; but that pound should have at least a space of 160
cubic inches in which to work.
     This law rules the practical application of gun-cotton to artillery.
A cartridge must not be compact, it must be spread out or expanded
to the full room it requires.      For this purpose, a hollow space is pre
served in the centre of the cartridge by some means or other.           The
best means is to use a hollow thin wooden tube to form a core ; this
tube should be as long as to leave a sufficient space behind the shot
for the gun-cotton. On this long core the simple cotton yarn is wound
round like thread on a bobbin, and sufficiently thick to fill the cham
ber of the gun ; indeed, a lady's bobbin of cotton thread is the innocent
type of the most destructive power of modern times — only the wood
in the bobbin must be small in quantity in proportion to the gun

296                                         Mr. Scott Resell                                            [May      13,
 cotton in the charge. There is no other precaution requisite except
 to enclose the whole in the usual flannel bag.
      The artillerist who uses gun-cotton has therefore a tolerably
 simple task to perform if he merely wants gun-cotton to do the duty
  of gunpowder. He has only to occupy the same space as the gun
 powder with one-fourth of the weight of gun-cotton made up in the
 bobbin as described, and he will fire the same shot at the same speed.
 This is speaking in a general way, for it may require in some guns as
 much as      of the weight of gunpowder and -J-J the bulk of charge to
                 -J-

                                 ;    a
 greater experience may enable the gun-cotton to exceed the per
 formance of the gunpowder          every way.   in
      The Jifth principle in the use of gun-cotton          that involved in its is
 application to bursting uses. The miner wants the stratum of coal
 torn from its bed, or the fragment of ore riven from its lair the civil                           ;
 engineer wishes to remove          mountain of stone out of the way of
                                                 a                                                                 a
 locomotive engine and the military engineer to drive his way into
                                 ;
 the fortress of an enemy, or to destroy the obstacles purposely laid in
 his way. This         new phase of duty for gun-cotton —
                            is
                            a                                          the work               it   is
 of direct destruction. In artillery you do not want to destroy directly,
 but indirectly.    You don't want to burst your gun, nor even to injure
      and, we have seen, in order to secure this, you have only to give
it it

    room.
      The fifth principle, therefore,       to make    is,
                                                         destructive— to cause
                                                                            it

 you have only to deprive        of room. Give
                                           it         room, and    it obedient               it   is              ;
 imprison      and it,  rebels.   Shut up without room, there
                                 it                                     nothing                    is
tough enough or strong enough to stand against it.
      To carry this into effect, the densest kind of gun-cotton must be
 used.    It must no longer consist of fine threads or hollow textures
wound on roomy cores.         All you have to do to make dense, solid,
                                                                        it is

        a
work, but shook the ground under the feet of the engineers in               way                          a
never done by the heaviest charges of powder.
     To make gun-cotton formidable and destructive, squeeze                  and                         it
close     upit to make
                  ;         gentle,  slow,
                                      it   and  manageable,    ease    and  give                  it
it  room. To make gunpowder slow and gentle, you do just the con
trary    you cake, condense, and harden
            :                                       to make    itslow, safe for         it
guns, and effective.
     To carry out this principle successfully, you have to carry    even                                it
to the   extreme.    Ask gun-cotton to separate       rock already half-        a
separated,     will refuse to comply with your request.
                   it                                          Give    a                                     it
light burden of earth and open rock to lift,     will fail. If you wantit
it to do the work, you must invent      ruse, — you must make believe
                                                          a

that the work      is hard, and it will be done.       Invent a difficulty and
put it   between the cotton and its too easy work, and it will do it. The
device is amazingly successful.          If the cotton have work to do that
is light and easy, you provide it with a strong box, which is hard to
burst, a box of iron for example ; close a small charge, that would be
harmless, in a little iron box, and then place that box in the hole
where formerly the charge exploded harmless, and in the effort it
makes to burst that box, the whole of the light work will disappear
 before it.
      The first trial of English-made gun-cotton was made at Stowmarket
 in the spring of 1864.        A charge of 25 lbs. not only destroyed a tree-
 stockade, but shattered it into matchwood.
      It is, therefore, the nature of gun-cotton to rise to the occasion and
 to exert force exactly in proportion to the obstacle it encounters.        For
 destructive shells this quality is of the highest value. You can make
 your shell so strong that nothing can resist its entrance, and when
 arrived at its destination no shell can prevent its gun-cotton charge
 from shivering it to fragments.
      These are the main principles in the mechanical manipulation of
 gun-cotton which will probably render it for the future so formidable
 an instrument of war.           Resistances too great for gunpowder only
 suffice to elicit the powers of gun-cotton.         On the other hand, in its
 elementary state as the open cotton yarn, it is playful, slow, gentle,
 and obedient ; there is scarcely any mechanical drudgery you can
 require of it that it is not as ready and fit to do as steam, or gas, or
 water, or other elementary power.
       In conclusion,   I  may be asked to say as a mechanic what       I think
 can be the nature and source of this amazing power of gun-cotton.           In
 reply let me ask, Who shall say what takes place in that pregnant in
 stant of time when a spark of fire enters the charge, and one-hundredth
  part of a second of time suffices to set millions of material atoms loose
  from fast ties of former affinity, and leaves them free every one to
  elect his mate, and uniting in a new bond of affinity, to come out of
  that chamber a series of new-born substances ? Who shall tell me all
  that happens then?        I will not dare to describe the phenomena of that
  pregnant instant. But       I will say this, that it is an instant of intense
  heat — one of its new-born children is a large volume of steam and
  water. When that intense heat and that red-hot steam were united in
  the chamber of that gun and that mine, two powers were met whose
  union no matter yet contrived has been strong enough to compress and
  confine. When       I  say that a gun-cotton gun is a steam- gun, and when
  I  say that  at that  instant  of intense heat, the atoms of water and the
  atoms of fire are in contact atom to atom, it is hard to believe that it
  should not give rise to an explosion infinitely stronger than any case
  of the generation of steam by filtering the heat leisurely through the
  metal skins of any high-pressure boiler.

             On the Physical Aspects      of the Moon's Surface.
As  the Moon's hemisphere, which is ever turned          towards us, has its
features illuminated   in opposite  directions  during  her  monthly passage
in her orbit around the earth, every part of it is exposed in turn to
the rays of the sun, which fall on the details of its features in constantly
varying inclinations ; and it is from this circumstance that we have
such favourable opportunities afforded to us of obtaining a very correct
knowledge of the configuration of the details in question, as well as of
their height or depression above or below the mean level of the Moon's
general surface.    Thus it is that we are enabled most carefully to
scrutinize her remarkable surface ; and should we have drawn any
hasty inferences from one set of observations, the opportunity is usually
presented to us in the course of a fortnight, or at farthest a month, to
correct them if erroneous, or to verify them if accurate, and to pursue
further investigations that may be suggested by reflection on what we
had last observed.
    In these respects telescopic visits to the surface of the Moon yield
more correct and reliable results than would many a visit to portions
of our world where the scenery to be surveyed is not, perhaps, con
veniently accessible : and even when it is reached, the traveller may
be surrounded by circumstances which very seriously interfere with
his personal comfort, or disturb that tranquillity which is so requisite
a condition for close and accurate observation, and thus lead him to
hasty conclusions, which he has no future opportunity to rectify.         In
strong contrast with such circumstances is the position of the astronomer,
comfortably placed beside his telescope, in the silence and tranquillity
of a fine clear night, with all distracting objects excluded from his view.
The whole of his attention is thus brought to focus, as it were, on the
point under investigation there and then presented to his scrutiny, and
ready to yield perfectly truthful replies to his questions ; nothing being
requisite for a correct interpretation of facts, other than a quick eye
backed by a sound and unbiassed judgment.
    It is from circumstances such as these that we have acquired, Tiy a      %

long course of assiduous observation and reflection, an amount of inti
mate acquaintance with the physical structure of the Moon's exterior,
in many important respects far more accurate than is our knowledge
of that portion of the earth.
    In order rightly to interpret the details of the Moon's surface, as
revealed to us by the aid of the telescope, we ought, in the first place,
to bear in mind the true nature of volcanic action, namely, that while
it has reference to the existence of intense temperature and molten
matter, it does not derive its origin from combustion, considered as
such in a strictly chemical sense, but proceeds from an incandescent
condition, induced in matter by the action of that great cosinical law
which caused an intense heat to result from the gravitation of particles
of matter towards a common centre. These particles, originally exist
ing in a diffused condition, were, by the action of gravitation, made
to coalesce, and so to form a planet. Volcanic action, then, has in
all probability for its source the heat consequent upon the collapse of
such diffused matter, resulting in that molten condition through which
there is strong reason to believe all planetary bodies to have passed in
their primitive state, and of which condition the geological history of
our earth furnishes abundant evidence.      Thus the molten lava which
we see issuing from an active volcano on the earth, is really and truly
a residual portion of that molten matter of which the entire globe once
consisted.
    In reference to the nature and origin of that eruptive force which
had again and again, in the early periods of the Moon's history,
caused the remaining molten matter of her interior to be ejected from
beneath her solidified crust, and so to assume nearly every variety of
volcanic formation in its most characteristic aspect, the key to these may
be found in the action of that law which pervades almost all matter in
a molten condition, namely, that " molten matter occupies less bulk,
weight for weight, than the same material when it has ceased from
                   "
the molten state ;   or, in other words, " that matter in a molten state
is specifically more dense than the same material in a solidified con
dition." Thus it is that in passing from the molten to the solid state
the normal law is resumed, and expansion of bulk either just immedi
ately precedes or accompanies solidification.      It is, therefore, in this
expansion in the bulk of the solidifying      matter,  beneath the Moon's
crust, that we are to  look for the true cause of that  eruptive or ejective
action which has resulted in the displacement, surfriceward, of the fluid
portion of the Moon's internal substance    ;  a displacement which has
manifested itself in nearly every variety of volcanic formation, such as
circular craters with their central cones or mountains of exudation,
cracked districts, &c. all these variations of well-recognized volcanic
                       ;
phenomena being intermingled and overlaid one upon the other in the
most striking and wonderful manner.
    It may, however, be very reasonably and naturally asked, " What
evidence have  I    that the featuresI    refer to have any relation to
volcanic action at all?" In reply to such       a question  I  would direct

302                              Mr. Nasmyth                             [May 20,
the inquirer's attention to one single feature which,                I   conceive,
demonstrates    more completely than any other the fact of volcanic
action having (at however remote a period) existed in full activity in
the Moon.      The special feature to which       I  would refer is the central
cone that may be observed within those " Ring-formed mountains," as
they have been termed.          " The central cone " is a well-known and
distinctive feature in terrestrial volcanoes.       It is the residue of the last
expiring efforts of a once energetic eruptive volcanic action, which
had thrown the ejected matter to such a considerable distance round
about the volcanic vent, that in its descent it had accumulated around
in the form of a ring-shaped mountain or crater ; whilst on the subsidence
of this volcanic energy, the ejected matter was deposited in the
immediate vicinity of the vent or volcanic orifice, and thus arose the
" central  cone."
     Anyone who     is familiar with terrestrial volcanic craters must, at
the first glance at those which are scattered in such infinite numbers
over the Moon's surface, detect this well-known analogous feature,
the central cone, and at once reasonably infer that these similar forms
arose from a common cause, that cause being no other than volcanic
action, accompanied by all its most marked characteristics.

     In examining the Moon's surface, we cannot but be impressed with
the vast dimensions of many of the volcanic craters with which her
surface is studded.      Craters of thirty miles and upwards in diameter
are by no means uncommon, and the first impression on the mind in
reference to such magnitudes is one of astonishment, that so small a
planet as the Moon (whose magnitude is only about ,'..ih that of the
earth) should exhibit evidence of volcanic violence so far greater than
any that we have on the earth.        This apparent paradox will, however,
disappear   when    we come  to  consider    that in consequence of the Moon
being so much less than the earth, the force of gravity on its ex
terior is not above ,',ih of that on the earth, and that the weight of
the lunar materials on its surface is reduced in the latter proportion,
while, on the other hand, by reason of the small magnitude of the
-M CM.11 and its proportionately much larger surface in ratio to its magni
tude, the rate at which it parted with its original cosmical heat must
have been vastly more rapid than in the case of the earth.        Now, as the
disruptive and eruptive action and energy are in proportion to the

  304                           Mr. Nasmyth                       [May   20,
 greater rate of cooling, those forces must have been much greater in the
 first instance ; and, operating as they did on matter so much reduced in
 weight as it must be on the surface of the Moon, we thus find in com
 bination two conditions most favourable to the display of volcanic force
 in the highest degree of violence. Moreover, as the ejected material
 in its passage from the centre of discharge had not to encounter any
 atmospheric resistance, it was left to continue the primary impulse of
 the ejection in the most free and uninterrupted manner, and thus to
 deposit itself at distances from the volcanic vent so much greater
 than those of which we have any example in the earth, as to result in
 the formation of the craters of vast magnitude so frequently encoun
 tered in a survey of the Moon's surface.       In like manner we find the
 ejected matter piled up to heights such as create the utmost astonish
 ment.      Lunar Mountains of 10,000 feet high are of frequent
 occurrence, while there are several of much greater altitude, some
 reaching the vast height of 2i>,000 feet, and that almost at one bound,
 as they start up directly from the plane over which they are seen to
 cast their long black, steeple-like shadows for many a mile ; whilst at
other times they intercept the rays of the sun upon their highest
peaks many hours before their bases emerge from the profound dark
 ness of the long lunar night.
      Among the many terribly sublime scenes with which the Moon's
surface must abound, none can be grander than that which would
present itself to the spectator, were he placed inside of one of these
 vast volcanic craters (Tycho, for instance), surrounded on every
side by the most terrific evidences of volcanic force in its wildest
 features.
      In such a position he would have before him, starting up from the
vast plane below, a mighty obelisk -shaped mountain of some 9,000
feet in height, casting its intense black shadow over the plateau ; and
partly up its slope he would see an amphitheatrical range of moun
tains beyond, which, in spite of their being about forty miles distant,
would appear almost in his immediate proximity            (owing to the
absence of that
                     " aerial perspective," which in terrestrial
                                                                   scenery
imparts a softened aspect to the distant object), so near, indeed, as to
reveal every cleft and chasm to the naked eye ! This strange com
mingling of near and distant objects, the inevitable visual consequence
of the absence of atmosphere or water, must impart to lunar scenery
a terrible aspect ; a stern wildness, which may aptly be termed un
earthly.     And when we seek to picture to ourselves, in addition to the
lineaments and conditions of the lunar landscape, the awful effect of
an absolutely black firmament, in which every star, visible above the
horizon, would shine with a steady brilliancy (all causes of scintil
lation or twinkling being absent, as these effects are due to the presence
of variously heated strata, or currents in our atmosphere), or of the
vivid and glaring sunlight, with which we have nothing to compare in
our subdued solar illumination, made more striking by the contrast of
an intensely black sky ; if, we say, we would picture to ourselves the

1864.]       on the  Physical Aspects of    the Moon's Surface.         305
wild and unearthly scene that would thus be presented to our       gaze, we
must search for it in the recollection of some fearful dream.
     That such a state of things does exist in the Moon we         have  no
reason whatever to    doubt, if we may be permitted to judge from in
ferences reasonably   and legitimately deduced from the phenomena on
its surface revealed   by the telescope ; neither can there be a question
as to the presence     there of the same brilliant tints and hues which
accompany     volcanic phenomena       in terrestrial craters, and which
 must lend additional effect to the aspect of lunar scenery.           Nor
must we omit, whilst touching upon the scene that would meet the
eye of one placed on the Moon's surface, the wonderful appearance
that would be presented by our globe, viewed from the side of the
 Moon which faces earthward.         Possessing sixteen times the super
ficial area, or four times the diameter, which the Moon exhibits to us,
situated high up in the lunar heavens, passing through all the phases
of a mighty moon, its external aspect ever changing rapidly as it re
volves upon its axis in the brief space of four-and-twenty hours, what
a glorious orb it would appear !      Whilst its atmospheric phenomena,
due to its alternating seasons, and the varying states of the weather,
would afford a constant source of interest.        But, alas! there can be
none to witness all these glories, for if ever man was justified in
forming a conclusion which possesses the elements of certainty, it is that
there can be no organized form of life, animal or vegetable, of which
we have any cognizance, that would be able to exist upon the Moon.
     Every condition essential to vitality, with which we are con
versant, appears to be wanting.       No air, no water, but a glaring sun,
which pours its fierce burning rays without any modifying influence
for fourteen days unceasingly upon the surface, until the resulting
temperature may be estimated to have reached fully -12" ; and no
sooner has that set on any portion of the lunar periphery than a wither
ing cold supervenes; the "cold of space'' itself, which must cause the
temperature to sink, in all probability, to 2,jll° below zero.        What
plant, what animal could possibly survive such alternations of heat
and cold recurring every fourteen days, or the accompanying climatic
conditions ?
     But let us not suppose, because the Moon is thus unfitted for
animal or vegetable existence as known to us, that it is necessarily a
useless waste of extinct volcanoes.      Apart from its value as ''a lamp
to the earth," it has a noble task to perform in preventing the stagna
tion that would otherwise take place in our ocean, which would,
without its influence, be one vast stagnant pool, but is now maintained
in constant, healthy activity, through the agency of the tides that
sweep our shores every four-and-twenty hours, bearing away with
them to sea, all that decaying refuse which would otherwise accumu
late at the mouths of rivers, there to corrupt, and spread death and
pestilence around.      This evil, then, the Moon arrests effectively, and
with the tides for a mighty broom, it daily sweeps and purifies our
roasts of all that might be dangerous or offensive.

                On Greek Coins      as   illustrating Greek Art.
   1.  Introduction. — It has been long known that Greek coins are
important monuments of Greek art. K. O. Miiller constantly cites
them in his great work on the Archaeology of Art (Archaologie der
Kunst), and had he been able thoroughly to study a large collection,
he would have rendered the present attempt needless.               Yet, notwith
standing    the  general   agreement     and   this illustrious example,  Greek
coins have not yet been the subject of an essay defining their place as
documents in the history of art.
   2. Definitions. — Under the term art, sculpture and painting are here
intended, with the intermediate province of bas-relief, to which coins, as
reliefs in miniature, belong. Sculpture represents character ; painting,
expression. Character is the general and permanent aspect of the
face and body as denoting the dominant quality.               We can trace in the
features and form the effect of study, or of idleness, of pride, or of
humility.      Expression is the transient but intense effect of some sudden
feeling, such as love or hatred, daring or terror. It is -illustrative of
this distinction that we feel that whereas we look at a sculptured face
of the best style, a face in a fine picture seems to look at us. Bas-
relief partakes sometimes of the characteristics of sculpture, sometimes
of those of painting. — (Coinp. Muller, Arch, der Kunst, § 27.)
   3. Our Knowledge of Greek Art. — Our present knowledge of Greek

1864.]          on Greek Coins as   illustrating Greek Art.            307
art, apart from that derived from coins, is extremely scanty.           Of
sculpture, under which bas-relief may here be included, we have
incomplete and uncertain information.       Literature gives us the names
of the chief artists and some idea of their styles. In the works that
remain we recognize the characteristics pointed out by literature.    But
of all the famous names of ancient sculpture, only works of Phidias,
and of Scopas and his fellow-artists at Halicarnassus, are known to us.
The noble architectural sculptures from the Parthenon and the Mauso
leum, happily united at our national museum, acquaint us thoroughly
with the styles of these masters; but when we look for a work of
Praxiteles or Lysippus, we look in vain. In the museums of Europe
there are a few statues of such surpassing excellence that they must be
works of the greatest sculptors, but it has been impossible to guess their
authors. The majority of famous statues forms but a Greco-Roman
gallery of inferior and even corrupted copies, made to suit the
taste of Roman collectors by artists who could not invent, and wanted
the honesty or the skill to copy accurately.
   Our knowledge of Greek painting scarcely deserves the name. The
information of literature, necessarily more vague than in the case of
the sister art, is wholly unsupported by any remains.      It would be an
insult to Greek painting to cite the feeble frescoes of Pompeii.      The
only glimmer of evidence is derived from bas-reliefs and vase-paintings.
The former are sometimes pictorial, but as they have lost what
colouring, at least of background, they had, they only show us design
and arrangement, not the essential characteristic of painting, the repre
sentation   of light. The latter are monuments of the skill of the
Greeks in drawing, though they fail in exactly the same manner, for
they are of the most rudimentary kind of designs, and from their neces
sarily hasty execution, could never have attained any higher character.
     4. Value of Coins. — Greek coins are of every age of Greek art,
and of every city of the Greek world — of every age from the period
of its long infancy before the Persian War, until its destruction under
the Roman rule — of every city from Thasos to Cyrene, from Marseilles
to Tarsus.     Every Greek city was constantly sending forth coins
bearing types varied in accordance with the rich power of invention
of the Greek mind.        From such a mass of evidence,        it must be
possible to obtain some valuable generalizations.          For a correct
induction, we require not only a large number of instances, but the
means of classing them.         Greek sculpture fulfils only the first
condition ; Greek coins fulfil both.      Without induction, the bases of
not a single science have been laid down ; and what has been done
since Bacon's discovery, first in natural science and then in learning,
still remains to be effected in the archaeology of art.
     5. Local Character of Greek Art. — The speaker claimed to have
discovered that Greek coins fall into elasses representing great local
schools.    This might have been expected, as all art shows the same
characteristic. This was illustrated by the cases of the modern schools
of painting, and of Gothic as well as Arab architecture. That the
                                                                 r 2

 308                Mr. R. S. Poole    on Greek Coins.                 [May   27,
 same    law    obtained in Greek      art,   K. 0. Muller     has   incidentally
 suggested    :  the coins prove it.
      The date of the best examples of art in the coins is from B.C. 450
 to B.C. 350, from not long after the repulse of the Persians to the
 overthrow of the liberties of Greece by Philip, the age of the highest
 political, literary, scientific, and artistic excellence of the nation.
      6. The Schools. — The chief and leading school — the term school
 being used in its geographical sense as distinguished from style, which
 is the effect produced upon art by a leading artist — was that of Greece
 itself, including Macedon and Thrace.               Its works are eminently
 sculpture-like (Greece produced           the great sculptors); they may be
 enlarged   ;   the  forms are compact   ;  they represent character instead of
 expression, and are marked by repose and truthfulness.           The favourite
 material is silver.
      The west coast of Asia-Minor produced the Ionian school, the
pictorial style of which reminds us that the three greatest names in the
list of Greek painters, Zeuxis, Parrhasius, and Apelles, were of
natives of this country.       The works of this school may be enlarged ;
its forms are free and flowing, dishevelled hair and streaming drapery ;
 it delights in representing expression instead of character, the transient
instead of the constant.        The favourite materials were the warmer
metal gold, and what is but pale gold, electrum.
      In Sicily and Italy a school flourished which combined the highest
execution with a lower kind of design.             Unaided by the influence of
sculpture or painting, neither of which owes a single name of celebrity
to the western colonies, it lived upon repeating itself, and so fell into a
mannered and eclectic style.          Its works cannot be enlarged without
injury, on account of the exaggeration of form. The style is usually
compact, but occasionally indulges in a timid freedom.             It represents
neither character nor expression, unless we are to admit, for instance,
but one character for all female heads.              In place of either it puts
manner.       It displays a certain hardness and cramped drawing that
indicate a limitation to one kind of material and to minute work.
     Intermediate between the schools of Greece and Ionia is the
school of Crete, which, copying nature rather than following sculpture
or painting, goes half-way from the gravity of the Greek ideal to the
expressiveness of the Ionian.        It is picturesque without being pictorial,
if a distinction drawn from usage may be allowed. It oscillates
between character never strong, and expression             never intense.     Its
want of strength is relieved by its love of nature. It excels in the
portrayal of animal and vegetable subjects, and delights in perspective
and foreshortening.
     Far in the East, where Greek civilization struggled in vain against
the destructive influence of Oriental formalism,             art could never
emancipate       itself from a dependence on architecture.         The Asiatic
school is architectural ; the forms are hard and straight ; they are
never developed.
     We may distinguish these schools by assigning to each its most

 1864.]     Prof. Frankland     on Recent Chemical            Researches.       309
marked characteristic.      The school of Greece is sculpture-like; the
school of Ionia picture-like ; the school of Sicily and Italy gem-like ;
the school of Crete picturesque ; and the school of Asia architectural.
     The distinctive characteristics of the schools were then illustrated
by a comparison and separate criticism of some of their best works,
represented     by enlarged copies.        It is unfortunately impossible to
repeat these observations in the present abstract, as without drawings
corresponding to the diagrams, they would not only be difficult to
understand,     but might even convey ideas essentially different from
those intended.
     It was observed that the discovery of schools to which were due the
differences in the coins, would tend to render more definite our know
ledge of Greek art in general.        Not only did sculpture and painting
flourish most where the coins most showed their influence, but in the
case of sculpture it was remarked that classification would be aided by
a knowledge of the various treatments             of bas-relief, and that thus it
would be shown that the schools extended throughout the range of the
kindred arts.     Thus a new basis might be laid down for the archaeology
of art.
     The speaker concluded with some general remarks on the national
value   of the study of art, on the prospects of art in England, and on
the assistance that the critical knowledge of Greek works would give to
those wishing to promote the growth of art in this country.

  Amongst     the branches of inquiry that have engaged the attention of
  chemists during the past fifteen years, there can scarcely be two
  opinions as to the paramount importance of those investigations, which
  have had for their object the discovery of the internal structure of
  chemical compounds, and especially of organic compounds ; for it is
  by thus studying the architecture of these bodies, that we become
  acquainted with the plans according to which nature herself constructs
  them under the influence of what we term vitality, and that we are

310                            Professor   Frankland                  [June   3,
enabled    to imitate her operations.      The vast number of organic com
pounds that can now be produced, without the aid of life in any form,
some of them even constituting a part of the food of man, affords ample
testimony to the importance of this field and the success with which it
has been cultivated.
     The ultimate analytical composition of a chemical compound affords
us little or no information available for the production of that com
pound, artificially ; but the moment the internal arrangement of the
atoms becomes known, the constructive process at once suggests itself.
Such a problem may be attacked in two distinct ways, either by taking
the compound to pieces, or by building it up from its proximate con
stituents. More than twelve years ago, the speaker had applied the
latter or synthetical process to the investigation of organic compounds
containing metals, some of the results of which he had communicated
to the members on a previous occasion.               A like scrutiny must be
applied   to  other  families   of  organic  substances   if we are to become
equally acquainted      with    their  molecular   construction.    It was the
application of the synthetical process to an important family of organic
substances, that had formed the basis of the investigations recently
carried on in the chemical laboratory of the Institution.         In the execu
tion of this work the speaker had been enthusiastically joined by his
friend, Mr. Duppa, who had in an eminent degree contributed to
whatever success had attended their labours.
     The family of organic acids thus attacked, and which is represented
by lactic acid, had for some years past excited the interest and atten
tion of chemists, but although much laborious investigation had been
expended upon       it,
                     especially    byKolbeand Wurtz,yet the constitution of
these acids was still far from being established.      Like any effort to over
come  a  difficulty, such an investigation required the selection of plan a
of attack, and the preparation of the agents, or weapons, by which the
assault was to be made.        The speaker had already proved in paper   a
communicated to the Royal Society, that oxalic acid was the basis or
model of the family of acids to be investigated.         This fact showed the
path by which the subject was to be approached, and he then went on
to describe the principles according to which the weapons were con
structed.
     In Mechanics, the engineer proportions the force which he employs
to the effect required to be produced, and       it was considered one of the
greatest achievements      in such control of mechanical force, when Mr.
Nasmyth's steam-hammer could be made, at one moment to deliver a
blow gentle enough to break the shell of         a   nut without crushing the
kernel, and at the next to descend with         a  force sufficient to smash  a
block of granite and shake the ground beneath it. As in mechanics,
where we deal with masses, so in chemistry, where we have to do with
atoms,    it    also necessary to apply
               is                           a  properly graduated amount of
force, and to apply       itin the right direction.     Chemistry was yet far
behind mechanics in this faculty of graduating force, but           by  availing
ourselves of certain chemical reactions, we had the power, as             were,
                                                                         it

 1864.]                    on Recent Chemical Researches.                               311
 of gradually storing up force in the atoms of bodies, and of delivering
 the blow when the force had become strong enough to effect the change
 required.      In this way the comparatively inert radicles or molecules,
 methyl, ethyl, amyl, &c., could be invested with chemical energy suffi
 cient to force their entrance into oxalic acid.                   The process of thus
 endowing these radicles with force was likened to the gradual winding
 up of a weight to the height necessary for the production of a given
 effect by its subsequent fall.           For this purpose a force external to the
atoms to be elevated was obviously required.                    The first supply of this
force was taken from sodium ; but sodium, although competent to raise
the molecules         of ethyl or methyl to a great elevation, was yet too
rough in the use of its power, for if we attempted, by its sole agency,
to elevate these molecules, they were actually torn to pieces by the
violence of the effort.            The action of the sodium must, therefore, be
moderated by combining it with mercury ; much of its power was thus
lost, but sufficient still remained for the purpose, if rightly employed.
    This sodium amalgam on being brought into contact with the
iodides of methyl, ethyl, or amyl refused to exert any action, but on the
addition of a few drops of acetic ether, which acted in this case like a
ferment, the sodium separated the iodine from the ethyl, whilst the
latter united itself with the mercury.

     By this association with mercury,                the   energy    of the ethyl      was
greatly increased, but it still lacked sufficient power for its attack upon
oxalic acid ; having once commenced its ascent, however, the further ele
vation of the ethyl became comparatively easy.                    It was only necessary
to digest the mercuric ethide, procured as above described, with metallic
zinc, at a temperature of 100° C. for several hours, in order to replace
the mercury with zinc, by which means zinc ethyl was obtained.

     The zinc ethyl thus obtained possessed far greater energy than the
mercuric ethide from which it was derived,* and, in fact, in this com
pound, the ethyl became fully armed for the contemplated expedition.
The speaker, however, showed that its power could be still further in-

 forming a fiery jet of blue and white flame.

     The speaker then described the action of several of these bodies
upon oxalic acid, or rather oxalic ether.    This action consisted in the
removal of one atom of oxygen from oxalic acid, and its substitution
by two atoms of ethyl, methyl, &c.      Thus, by the action of zincethyl,
oxalic acid was transformed into leucic acid — a body that had previously

1864.]                   on Recent Chemical    Researches.                313
been obtained       from animal tissues, especially from the spleen and
lungs.   By acting upon oxalic ether with the zinc compounds of other
organic radicles, a large number of acids belonging to the lactic series,
and hitherto unknown, could be produced.          Many of these acids were
isomeric with each other, that is, possessed the same percentage com
position, but differed in their interior architecture.        Thus leucic acid
was susceptible of no less than nine isomeric modifications, three of
which had already been obtained by the method now described.              The
following table shows the internal structure of these isomeric leucic

      These reactions proved that lactic acid, the representative of this
family of acids, was also cast in the mould of oxalic acid. Thus,
the latter deadly organic body was converted by the removal of
one atom of oxygen and its substitution by one of hydrogen and
one of methyl into the harmless acid of sour milk, a constituent of
the juices of the human body, and an agent, no doubt, of importance in
the transformations attending animal life.      A similar marvellous trans
mutation of character is met with in the highly poisonous arsenic acid,
which, by the exchange of one atom of oxygen for two of methyl, is
converted into the innocuous, though perfectly soluble, cacodylic acid.
      The speaker concluded as follows : — Here, then, we have a most pro
 lific reaction, capable of furnishing an immense number of new organic
 bodies, and at the same time indicating to us the very simple manner
 in which nature evolves some of her, apparently, most complex results.
 By a species of progressive development, this simply organized oxalic
acid becomes gradually elevated, cultivated, and transformed into
 bodies, which, when viewed by one ignorant of their true origin, appear
 to possess a hopeless complexity.     Not only do we now gain a clear
 insight into the architecture of these acids, but we can take the very

elements    of which they are composed, and build them up unaided by
any   vital processes.     We need not even go for oxalic acid, our very
type or model, either to the wood-sorrel, or the lichen, which, by means
of this acid, corrodes the rock upon which it grows ; for we have the
power both to lay the foundation and to build the superstructure of these
organic bodies, without the least assistance from either animal or vege
table life.    And is it too much to hope, that, by analogous inductive
scrutiny, even the most obscure and complex physiological phenomena
of life itself will one day yield to scientific research, and become to us
as clear and simple as they are now dark and unintelligible?            But to
accomplish this, the human intellect must prepare itself for efforts far
more difficult than any it has yet made.          Hitherto the more palpable
and simple phenomena of nature have been the first to attract the
attention of philosophers, whilst the more recondite and hidden, consti
tuting increasingly difficult subjects of research, have been left for
future explorers.        Thus, although we are still scarcely advanced
beyond the condition of children gathering pebbles on the shore of the
boundless ocean of knowledge, yet those pebbles, never easy to find,
are now no longer left dry on the beach. They must be dragged from the
grip of the waves by patient and cunning toil.          Difficulties innumer
able and appalling confront us, but let the human intellect be only left
free and untrammelled, and it will surely accomplish the task set
before it.

                         On a Magnetic Experiment.
There    are two words which           are very often          employed in scientific
writings — matter and force.     The definition of each involves the
conception of the other.    We know nothing of force save through its
operations upon matter, and we know nothing of matter save through
the manifestations of its force.  The characteristics of any force must
 be sought in the material changes which it is competent           to produce.
 Some years ago     Ifelt a great interest in the subject of magnetism, and
in those years      Idevised an apparatus to enable me to investigate
certain mechanical effects which accompany the act of magnetization.
I   wished to apply this apparatus to diamagnetic bodies as well as
 paramagnetic ones — to bodies such as bismuth, as well as to bodies
such as iron.       I
                    intend this evening to show you the action of this
 instrument, and to give, if    Ican, some explanation of the experiments
of others which have been confirmed by my own.
     Let us pass quickly in review the excitation of this wonderful
 power of magnetism.       Here is a strong horseshoe magnet set upright,
 and here is a bent bar of steel, whose arms are the same distance apart
as those of the horseshoe magnet.            I
                                            draw the bent steel bar over the
 ends, or the poles, as they are called, of the magnet.           It suddenly
obtains the power of attracting this iron keeper and holding it fast.
I  reverse the stroke of the steel bar : its virtue has now disappeared ;
it is no longer competent to attract the keeper.                  I
                                                         continue the stroke
of the steel bar in the last direction, and now it is again competent to
attract the iron : thus    I can at will magnetize and demagnetize this
bent piece of steel.
     Here is a fine permanent         magnet constructed by Logeman of
Haarlem, and competent to carry a great weight.           Here, for example,
is a dish of iron nails which it is able to empty.      At the other side of
the table you observe another mass of metal, bent like the Logeman
magnet, but not, like     it, naked.    This mass, moreover,         not steel,
                                                                            is
but iron, and  it    surrounded

to illustrate the excitement of magnetism                    by
                                                        electricity.    At the

  present    moment this huge bent bar is so inert as to be incapable of
  carrying a single grain of iron.                       I
                                               now send an electric current
  through the coils that surround           and its power far transcends that

  It holds 561b. weight attached to each of its poles, and empties
             a                                                                                  it

       Now the magnetized iron cannot be in all respects the same as the
  unmagnetized iron.        Some change must take place among the mole
  cules of the iron bar at the moment of magnetization. And one
  curious action which accompanies the act of magnetization                will now        I
  try to make sensible to you. Other men laboured, and we are here
  entering into their labours       the effect

   the acts of magnetization and demagnetization         so stir the atoms of the
   magnetized body that they, in their turn, can stir the air and send
  sonorous impulses to our auditory nerves.
       I have said that the sounds occur at the moment of magnetization,
  and at the moment when magnetization ceases hence,                     can devise

  belongs to a RuhmkorfPs induction coil.            Here         monochord, andis   a

  bar   is placed in   aglass tube, which      surroundedis       copper wire.       by                     I
 place the contact breaker in          distant room, so that you cannot hear
                                             a

assembly hears something between a dry crackle and                  musical sound     a
issuing from the bar in consequence of its successive magnetization and
demagnetization.
      Hitherto we have occupied ourselves with the iron which has been
acted upon by the current.          Let us now devote       moment's time to the

     Thus we have magnetic action exhibited by a body which does not
contain a particle of the so-called magnetic metals.        The copper wire
is made magnetic by the electric current.           Indeed, by means of a
copper wire through which a current flows we may obtain all the
effects of magnetism.         I
                             have here a long coil, so suspended as to be
capable of free motion in a horizontal direction : it can move all round
in a circle like an ordinary magnetic needle.           At its ends I   have
placed two spirals of platinum wire which the current will raise to
brilliant incandescence.     They are glowing now, and the suspended
coil behaves in all respects like a magnetic needle.      Its two ends show
opposite polarities : it can be attracted and repelled by a i.,.im1rt, or
by a current flowing through another coil ; and it is so sensitive that
the action of the earth itself is capable of setting it north and south.
     There is an irresistible tendency to unify in the human mind ; and,
in accordance with our mental constitution, we desire to reduce pheno
mena which are so much alike to a common cause.           Hence the concep
tion of the celebrated Ampere that a magnet is simply an assemblage
of electric currents. Round the atoms of a magnet Ampere supposed
minute currents to circulate incessantly in parallel planes ; round the
atoms of common iron he also supposed them to circulate, but in all
directions — thus neutralizing each other. The act of magnetization he
supposed to consist in the rendering of the molecular currents parallel
to a common plane, as they are supposed to be in a permanent magnet.
     This is the celebrated theory of molecular currents propounded by
Ampere.      You observe it consists in the application of conceptions
obtained from sensible masses of matter to insensible or atomic masses.
Let us follow out this conception to what would appear its legitimate
consequences.       Ihave said that we obtain both attractions and repul
sions from electric currents : all these effects are deduced from one
law, which    is, that electric currents flowing in the same direction
attract each other, while, when they flow in opposite directions, they
repel each other.      Let me illustrate this law rapidly. Here are two
flat coils suspended facing each other, and about eight inches apart.   I
send a    current through both, causing        to flow through them in the
                                              it
same direction ;   the coils instantly clash and cling together in virtue of
their mutual attraction.       I now reverse the current through one of
them, and they fly      yard asunder, in virtue of their mutual repulsion.
                        a
And now one of them twists its suspending wire so as to turn its oppo
site face to the other coil     the currents are now again in the same
                                  ;
direction, and the coils clash and cling as in the first instance. Imagine,
then, our molecular currents flowing round the atoms of this iron bar
in planes perpendicular to the length of the bar. From the law just
enunciated we should infer the mutual attraction of those currents           ;
and from this attraction we should be disposed to infer the shortening
of the bar at the moment of magnetization. Here, for example,           is a
coil of copper wire suspended vertically       the end of the coil dips into
                                                 ;
this little basin of mercury.       From     small voltaic battery behind

send a   current through the coil     ;and, because      passes in the same

 direction through all its convolutions, they attract each other. The
 coil is thereby shortened ; its end quits the mercury with a spark ; the
 current ceases ; the wire falls by its own gravity ; the current again
 passes, and the wire shortens as before.               Thus you have this quick
 succession of brilliant* sparks produced by the shortening of the wire
 and the interruption of the current as it quits the mercury.
       Is it a fact, then, that an iron bar is shortened by the act of mag
 netization ? It is not.          And here, as before, we enter into the labours
 of other men.
       Mr. Joule was the first to prove that the bar is lengthened.                  Mr.
 Joule rendered this lengthening visible by means of a system of levers
 and a microscope, through which a single observer saw the action. The
 experiment has never,         I  believe, been made before a public audience ;
 but the instrument referred tof at the commencement of this lecture
 will,    I think, enable me to render this effect of magnetization visible
 to everybody present.
       Before you is an upright iron bar, two feet long, firmly screwed into
 a solid block of wood.           Sliding on two upright brass pillars is a por
 tion of the instrument which you see above the iron bar.                The essential
 parts of this section of the apparatus are, first, a vertical rod of brass,
 which moves freely and accurately in a long brass collar. The lower end
 of the brass rod rests upon the upper flat surface of the iron bar. To
 the top of the brass rod is attached a point of steel ; and this point
 now presses against a plate of agate, near a pivot which forms the
 fulcrum of a lever. The distant end of the lever is connected, by a
 very fine wire, with an axis on which is fixed a small circular mirror.
 If  the steel point be pushed up against the agate plate, the end of the
 lever is raised ; the axis is thereby caused to turn, and the mirror
 rotates.      I  now cast a beam from an electric lamp upon this mirror;
 it is reflected in a luminous sheaf, fifteen or sixteen feet long, and
 it strikes our screen, there forming a circular patch of brilliant light.
 This beam is to be our index ; it will move as the mirror moves, only
 with twice its angular velocity ; and the motion of the patch of light
 will inform us of the lengthening and shortening of the iron bar.
       I   employ one battery simply to ignite the lamp.               I   have here a
second battery to magnetize the iron bar.                 At present no current is
 passing.      I  make the circuit, and the bright image on the screen is
suddenly displaced. It sinks a foot. I break the circuit : the bar
instantly shrinks to its normal length, and the image returns to its first
position.       I  make the experiment several times in succession : the
result is always the same.               Always when       I magnetize, the image
instantly descends, which declares the lengthening of the bar ; always
when      I interrupt the current, the image immediately rises.                 A little
warm water projected against the bar causes the image to descend

                   brilliant by the introduction of  a coil of wire and  a  core  of soft
iron into the circuit.

gradually.       This, I believe, is the first time that this action of mag
netism has been seen by a public audience.
      I have employed the same apparatus in the examination of bismuth
bars ; and, though considerable power has been applied,                       I  have
hitherto failed to produce any sensible effect.            It was at least conceiv
able that complementary effects might be here exhibited, and a new
antithesis thus established between magnetism and diamagnetism.
      No explanation of this action has, to my knowledge, been offered ;
and    I  would now beg to propose one which seems to be sufficient.                 I
place     this large   flat  magnet upon     the   table ;   over it  I  put a  paper
screen ; and on the screen I shake iron filings.                     You know the
beautiful lines in which those filings arrange themselves — lines which
have become classical from the use made of them in this Institu
tion ; for they have been guiding- threads for Faraday's intelli
gence while exploring the most profound and intricate phenomena
of magnetism.          These lines indicate the direction in which a small
magnetic needle sets itself when placed on any of them.                   The needle
will always be a tangent to the magnetic curve.                      A little rod of
iron, freely suspended, behaves exactly like the needle, and sets its
longest dimension in the direction of the magnetic curve. In fact, the
particles of iron filings themselves are virtually so many little rods of
iron, which, when they are released from the friction of the screen by
tapping, set their longest dimensions along the lines of force. Now,
in this bar magnet the lines of force run along the magnet itself, and,
were its particles capable of free motion, they also would set their
longest dimensions parallel to the lines of force — that is to say,
parallel to the length of the magnet.             This, then, is the explanation
which I would offer of the lengthening of the bar.                  The bar is com
posed of irregular crystalline granules ; and, when magnetized, these
granules tend to set their longest dimensions parallel to the axis of the
bar.       They succeed, partially, and produce a microscopic lengthening
of the bar, which, suitably magnified, has been rendered visible to
you.*
      Perhaps you do not see the magnetic curves from your present
position, but I will enable you to see them.               I  have here an electric
lamp turned on its back, and from it a vertical cylinder of light now
issues.      Over the aperture of the lamp       I  place two small bar magnets,
enclosed between two plates of glass.             The vertical beam is received
upon a looking-glass which reflects it on to the screen.               In the path of
this reflected beam I place a lens, and thus obtain upon the screen a
 magnified image of the two small bar magnets.                  And now I sprinkle
 this fine iron sand on the plate of glass, and you see how it arranges
 itself under the operation of the magnets.              A most beautiful display
     *
        My assistant, Mr. Barrett, has just drawn my attention to a paper by M. De
 la Rive in which this explanation is given.    To him, therefore, belongs the entire
 credit of it.— J. T., June 16.

322               Professor Tyndall on a Magnetic   Experiment.   [June         10,
of  the magnetic curves is now before you.       And you observe, when           I
tap the glass, how the particles attach themselves by their ends,
and how the curves close in upon each other.           They try to attach
themselves thus and close thus up in the solid iron bar: the consequence
is that the longitudinal expansion is exactly counterbalanced by the
transverse contraction, so that the volume of the bar remains unchanged.
     But can we not bring a body with movable particles within an
electro-magnetic coil? We can ; and I will now, in conclusion, show
you an experiment devised by Mr. Grove, which bears directly upon
this question, but the sight of which, I believe, has hitherto been
confined to Mr. Grove himself. At all events,            I
                                                       am not aware of its
ever having been made before a large audience.              I have here a
cylinder with glass ends, and it contains a muddy liquid.                This
muddiness is produced by the magnetic oxide of iron which is
suspended mechanically in water.         Round the glass cylinder I have
coiled five or six layers of covered copper wire; and here is a battery
from which a current can be sent through the coil.      First of all, I place
the glass cylinder in the path of the beam from our electric lamp,
and, by means of a lens, cast a magnified image of the end of the
cylinder on the screen.      That image at present possesses but feeble
illumination.     The light is almost extinguished by the suspended
 particles of magnetic oxide. But, if what 1 have stated regarding the
lines of force through the bar of magnetized iron be correct, the
particles of the oxide will suddenly set their longest dimensions
parallel to the axis of the cylinder, and also in part set themselves end
to end when the current is sent round them.        More light will be thus
enabled to pass ; and now you observe the effect.           The moment            I
establish the circuit the disc upon the screen becomes luminous :                I
interrupt the current, and gloom supervenes ;        I
                                                    re-establish      it,

have     luminous disc once more.

     The apparatus, as      Ihave stated, was really invented to examine
whether any mechanical effect of this kind could be detected in dia-
magnetic bodies      but hitherto without result. And this leads me to

remark on the large ratio which the failures of an original inquirer
bear to his successes.      The public see the success— the failure              is
known to the inquirer alone.      The encouragement of his fellow-men,
it    true, often cheers the investigator and strengthens his heart
     is                                                                   but

                         On Combustion by Invisible Rays.
We    are so accustomed to associate the word ray with the idea of light,
that the term dark, or invisible, or obscure rays, stimulates the imagina
tion by its strangeness ; and such is more particularly the case when
we are told that the major portion of the radiation of the sun itself is

 of this invisible character. This great discovery      was announced sixty-
 five years ago by Sir William Herschel.          Permitting a sun-beam to
 pass through     a glass prism,  he  formed  the  coloured spectrum of the
 solar light ; and, carrying a small thermometer through its various
 colours, he determined their heating power.         He found this power to
 augment gradually from the violet to the red ; but he also found
 that the calorific action did not terminate where the visible spectrum
 ended.     Placing his thermometer in the dark space beyond the red,
 he proved the heating power there to be greater than in any part of
 the visible spectrum.
      Sir William Herschel concluded from his experiments, that besides
 those rays which, acting separately upon the retina, produce the sensa
 tion of colour, and the sum of which constitutes our ordinary sunshine,
 a vast outflow of perfectly invisible rays proceeds from the sun, and
 that, measured by their heating power, the strength or energy of these
 in visible rays is greater than that of all the visible rays taken together.
      This result was questioned by some and confirmed by others ; but,
 like every natural truth that can be brought to the test of experiment,
 the verity of Sir William Herschel's announcement was soon completely
 established. Forty years after the discovery of those invisible rays
 by his father, Sir John Herschel made them the subject of experiment.
 He made an arrangement which enabled him to estimate the heating
 power of the spectrum by its drying power.            Wetting by a wash of
 alcohol, paper blackened on one side, he cast his spectrum on this
 paper, and observed the chasing away of the moisture by the heat of
 the rays.    His drying paper presented to him a thermograph of the
spectrum and showed the heating power to extend far beyond the
red.
      By the introduction of the thermo-electric pile, Melloni created a
new epoch in researches on radiant heat.         This instrument enables us
to examine, with a precision unattainable with ordinary thermometers,
the distribution of heat in the solar spectrum. Melloni himself de
voted some time to this subject.          He had made the discovery that
various substances, in the highest degree transparent to light, were
eminently opaque to those invisible heat-rays.          Pure water, for ex
ample, is a body of this kind.        Only one substance did Melloni find
to be equally pervious to the visible and the invisible rays — namely,
transparent rock-salt.       And though the researches of MM. De la
Provostaye and Desains, together with some extremely suggestive
experiments executed by Mr. Balfour Stewart, show conclusively that
Melloni erred in supposing rock-salt to be perfectly transparent, it
must be admitted that, in this respect, the substance approaches very
near perfection.
     Abandoning prisms of glass, which had been always employed
previously, Melloni made use of a prism of rock-salt in his experi
ments on the solar spectrum.         He was thus enabled to prove that the
ultra-red rays discovered by Sir William Herschel formed an invisible
spectrum, at least as long as the visible one. He also found the posi

  tion of maximum radiant power to lie as far on one side the red as the
green light    of the spectrum on the other.
       Dr. Franz, of Berlin, subsequently examined the distribution of
  heat in the solar spectrum, employing for this purpose a flint-glass prism.
  He showed that the inaction of the ultra-red rays upon the retina did
 not altogether arise from the absorption of those rays in the humours
 of the eye ; at all events, he proved that a sensible portion of the invi
 sible rays was transmitted across the eye-ball of an ox, and reached the
  back of the eye.     Professor Muller, of Freiberg, afterwards examined
 very fully the heat of the solar spectrum ; and representing, as Sir
 William Herschel also had approximately done, by lines of various
 lengths the thermal intensity at various points, he drew a curve which
 expressed the calorific action of the entire spectrum.
       At various intervals during the last ten years the speaker had
 occupied himself with the invisible radiation of the electric light ;
 and to the distribution of heat in its spectrum he now directed
 attention. The instruments made use of were the electric lamp of
 Duboscq and the linear thermo-electric pile of Melloni. The spectrum
 was formed by means of lenses and prisms of pure rock-salt.            It was
 equal in width to the length of the row of elements forming the pile,
and the latter being caused to pass through its various colours in suc
cession, and also to search the space right and left of the visible spec
 trum, the heat falling upon   it,  at every point of its march, was deter
mined by the deflection of an extremely sensitive galvanometer.
      As in the case of the solar spectrum, the heat was found to augment
from the violet to the red, while in the dark space beyond the red           it
rose to a maximum.         The position of the maximum was about as dis
tant from the extreme red in the one direction, as the green of the
spectrum in the opposite one.
      The augmentation of temperature beyond the red in the spectrum
of the electric light  is  sudden and enormous.     Representing the thermal
intensities   by lines of proportional lengths, and erecting these lines as
perpendiculars at the places to which they correspond, when we pass
beyond the red these perpendiculars suddenly and greatly increase in
length, reach  a    maximum, and then fall somewhat more suddenly on
the opposite side of the maximum.         When the ends of the perpendicu
lars are united, the curve beyond the red, representing the obscure
radiation, rises ina    steep and massive peak, which quite dwarfs      by  its
magnitude the radiation of the luminous portion of the spectrum.
      Interposing suitable substances in the path of the beam, this peak
may be in part cut away.         Water, in certain thicknesses, does this very
effectually.    The vapour    of water would do the same and this fact en

ables us to account for the difference between the distribution of heat
in the solar and in the electric spectrum. The comparative height and
steepness of the ultra-red peak, in the case of the electric light, are
much greater than in the case of the sun, as shown         by  the diagram of
Professor Muller.       No doubt the reason is, that the eminence corre
sponding to the position of maximum heat in the solar spectrum has

332                         Professor          Tyndall                         [Jan. 20,
been cut down by the aqueous vapour of our atmosphere.                 Could a
solar spectrum be produced beyond the limits of the atmosphere, it
would probably show as steep a mountain of invisible rays as that ex
hibited by the electric light, which is practically uninfluenced by atmo
spheric absorption.
     Having thus demonstrated that a powerful flux of dark rays accom
panies the bright ones of the electric light, the question arises,
                                                                          " Can
we not detach the former and experiment on them alone?
                                                                   "
     One way of doing this would be to cut off the luminous portion of
the decomposed beam by an opaque screen, allowing the non-luminous
portion to pass by its edge.       We might then operate at pleasure upon the
latter : — reflectit,         it,
                        refract     concentrate it. This, in fact, was done by
Sir  William    Herschel,    but
                              a    quantity of heat could not thus be obtained
sufficient to produce the results intended to be exhibited before the
conclusion of the discourse.          Another plan consists in permitting the
total radiation to pass through some substance transparent to the heat
rays, but opaque to the light rays.         Mellon! discovered that lampblack,
and also a    kind of black glass, while perfectly opaque to light, trans
mitted a considerable quantity of radiant heat.              In the " Lectures
on Heat," given at the Royal Institution in 1862, and since made
public, experiments with these bodies are described.               It was while
conversing with his friend Mr. Warren De la Rue, in the autumn of
 1861, on the possibility of sifting, by absorbents, the light of          beam  a
from its heat, that the speaker first learned that carbon was the
substance which rendered Melloni's glass opaque.                This fact was
of peculiar interest to him, for          and others seemed to extend to solid
                                         it
bodies a law which he had detected two years previously in his experi
ments on gases and vapours, and which showed that elementary gases
were highly transparent, while compound gases were all more or less
opaque — many of them, indeed, almost perfectly opaque — to invisible
radiant heat.
     In the speaker's first experiments on the invisible radiation of
the electric light, black glass was the substance made use of.              The
specimens, however, which he was able to obtain destroyed, along with
 the visible,a    considerable portion of the invisible radiation. • But the
discovery of the deportment of elementary gases directed his attention
 to other simple substances.         He examined sulphur dissolved in bisul
 phide of carbon, and found         it almost perfectly transparent to the invi
sible rays.      He also examined the element bromine, and found that
notwithstanding its dark colour,             was eminently transparent to the
                                              it
 ultra-red rays.       Layers   of this substance, for example, which entirely
 cut off  all   the  light  of a brilliant  gas flame, transmitted its invisible
radiant heat with freedom.            Finally, he tried solution of iodine in
                                                              a
 bisulphide of carbon, and arrived at the extraordinary result, that a
 quantity of dissolved iodine sufficiently opaque to cut off the light of

the mid-day sun was, within the limits of experiment, absolutely trans
parent to invisible radiant heat.
      This theifis the substance by which the invisible rays of the elec
tric light may be almost perfectly detached from the visible ones.
Concentrating       by a small glass mirror, silvered in front, the rays
emitted by the carbon points of the electric lamp, we obtain a conver
gent cone of light. Interposing in the path of this concentrated beam
a cell containing the opaque solution of iodine, the light of the cone is
utterly destroyed, while its invisible rays are scarcely, if at all, meddled
with. These converge to a focus, at which, though nothing can be
seen even in the darkest room, the following series of effects may be
produced : —
       When a piece of black paper is placed in the focus, it is pierced by
 the invisible rays, as if a white-hot spear had been suddenly driven
 through it. The paper instantly blazes, without apparent contact with
anything hot.
       A piece of brown paper placed at the focus soon shows a red-hot,
 burning surface, extending over a considerable space of the paper,
 which finally bursts into flame.
       The wood of a hat-box similarly placed, is rapidly burnt through.
  A pile of wood and shavings, on which the focus falls, is quickly
 ignited, and thus a fire may be set burning by the invisible rays.
       A cigar or a pipe is immediately lighted when placed at the focus of
  invisible  rays.
       Disks of charred paper placed at the focus are raised to brilliant
  incandescence ; charcoal is also ignited there.
       A piece of charcoal, suspended in a glass receiver full of oxygen,
 is set on fire at the focus, burning with the splendour exhibited by this
 substance in an atmosphere of oxygen. The invisible rays, though they
 have passed through the receiver, still retain sufficient power to render
 the charcoal within it red-hot.
       A mixture of oxygen and hydrogen is exploded in the dark focus,
  through the ignition of its envelope.
       A strip of blackened zinc-foil placed at the focus is pierced and in
  flamed by the invisible rays.      By gradually drawing the strip through
  the focus, it may be kept blazing with its characteristic purple light for
  a considerable time.      This experiment is particularly beautiful.
       Magnesium wire, presented suitably to the focus, burns with almost
  intolerable brilliancy.
       The effects thus far described are, in part, due to chemical action.
  The substances placed at the dark focus are oxidizable ones, which,
  when heated sufficiently, are attacked by the atmospheric oxygen, ordi
  nary combustion being the result. But the experiments may be freed
  from this impurity.        A thin plate of charcoal, placed in vacuo, is
  raised to incandescence at the focus of invisible rays. Chemical action
   is here entirely excluded.     A thin plate of silver or copper, with its
  surface slightly   tarnished   by the sulphide of the metal, so as to dimi
   nish its reflective power,  is raised to incandescence  either in vacuo or

in air.   With sufficient battery-power and proper concentration, a plate
of platinized platinum is rendered white-hot at the focus of invisible
rays ; and when the incandescent platinum is looked at through a prism,
its light yields a complete and brilliant spectrum. In all these cases
we have, in the first place, a perfectly invisible image of the coal points
formed by the mirror ; and no experiment hitherto made illustrates the
identity of light and heat more forcibly than this one.          When the
plate of metal or of charcoal is placed at the focus, the invisible image
raises it to incandescence, and thus prints itself visibly upon the plate.
On drawing the coal points apart, or on causing them to approach each
other, the thermograph of the points follows their motion. By cutting
the plate of carbon along the boundary of the thermograph, we might
obtain a second pair of coal points, of the same shape as the original
ones, but turned upside down ; and thus by the rays of the one pair of
coal points, which are incompetent to excite vision, we may cause a
second pair to emit all the rays of the spectrum.
     The ultra-red radiation of the electric light is known to consist of
ethereal undulations of greater length, and slower periods of recur
rence, than those which excite vision.        When, therefore, those long
waves impinge upon a plate of platinum, and raise it to incandescence,
their period of vibration is changed.      The waves emitted by the pla
tinum are shorter and of more rapid recurrence, than those falling upon
it ; the refrangibility being thereby raised, and the invisible rays ren
dered visible. Thirteen years ago, Professor Stokes proved that by the
agency of sulphate of quinine, and various other substances, the ultra
violet rays of the spectrum could be rendered visible. These invisible
rays of high refrangibility, impinging upon a proper medium, cause
the molecules of that medium to oscillate in slower periods than
those of the incident waves.     In this case, therefore, the invisible rays
are rendered visible by the lowering of their refrangibility ; while in
the experiments of the speaker, the ultra-red rays are rendered visible
by the raising of their refrangibility.    To the phenomena brought to
light by Professor Stokes, the term fluorescence has been applied by
their discoverer, and to the phenomena brought forward this evening
at the Royal Institution, it was proposed to apply the term calorescence.
     It was the discovery, more than three years ago, of a substance
opaque to light, and almost perfectly transparent to radiant heat — a
substance which cut the visible spectrum of the electric light sharply
off at the extremity of the red, and left the ultra-red radiation almost
untouched, that led the speaker to the foregoing results. They lay
directly in the path of his investigation ; and it was only the diver
sion of his attention to subjects of more immediate interest that pre
vented him from reaching, much earlier, the point which he has now
attained. On this, however, he can found no claim ; and the idea
of rendering ultra-red rays visible, though arrived at independently,
does not by right belong to him.        The right to a scientific idea or
discovery is secured by the act of publication ; and, in virtue of
such an act, priority of conception as regards the conversion of

heat-rays into light-rays belongs indisputably to Dr. Akin.               At the
meeting of the British Association, assembled at Newcastle in 1863,
he proposed three experiments by which he intended to solve this
question,     lie afterwards became associated with an accomplished man
of science, Mr. Griffith of Oxford, and jointly with him pursued the
inquiry.     Two out of the three experiments proposed at Newcastle by
Dr. Akin are impracticable.           In the third, Dr. Akin proposed to
converge the rays of the sun by a concave mirror, to cut off the
           '
light by proper absorbents,' and to bring platinum foil into the focus
of invisible rays. It is quite possible, that, had he possessed the instru
mental means at the speaker's disposal, or had he been sustained as the
speaker had been both by the Royal Society and the Koyal Institution,
Dr. Akin might have been the first to effect the conversion of the dark
heat-rays into luminous ones.          For many years the idea of forming
an intense focus of invisible        rays had been perfectly clear before
the speaker's mind ;       and in 1862 he published experiments upon
the subject.       The effects observed by him in 1862 at the focus
of invisible      rays were such as no previous experimenter had
witnessed, and no experimenter could have observed them without
being driven to the results which formed the subject of the evening's
discourse.     Still publication is the sole test of scientific priority ; and it
cannot be denied that Dr. Akin was the first to propose definitely to
 change the refrangibility of the ultra-red rays of the spectrum, by
causing them to raise platinum foil to incandescence.

       On the results  of Cuneiform Discovery up       to the present time.
 Sir Henry      commenced by observing that the time had gone by when
 it was necessary to defend the system of Cuneiform              Decipherment
 from the attacks of the incredulous.         The school of sceptics, led on
 by the late Sir G. Lewis and his friends, had passed away.               France
 and Germany, which were at first slow to believe, had now fairly given
 in their adhesion, and admitted Assyrian studies into the
                                                                      recognized
 category of linguistic science.       The Institute of France, indeed, had
 last year conferred its biennial         prize of 20,000 francs on M.
 Oppert, for his labours on the Assyrian Inscriptions, thereby testifying,
  in the face of Europe, to the genuineness      and value of his researches.

336                        Sir Henry Rawlinson                   [Jan. 27,
In  England, the Cuneiform decipherers were no longer looked upon
as visionaries or impostors.   The tone of the public press had become,
at any rate, respectful, and anxiety was beginning to be shown
for authentic information on the subject.
     Assuming, then, that there was no occasion to recapitulate the
arguments, which he had advanced in a former discourse in that room,
in support of the general principles of his method of Decipherment.
Sir Henry went on to say, that great caution was still required to
be exercised in discriminating between guess-work and demonstration,
and in accepting the results put forward by different enquirers.        M,
Oppert,   for  instance, had  contributed an article  on the  " Tower   of
Babel," to Dr. Smith's " Dictionary of the Bible," asserting that the
name of Borsippa, which attached to the site where the tower was
traditionally believed to have stood, was etymologically connected
with " the confusion of tongues," and that there wns also a distinct
allusion to the same event in the inscription on the cylinders found in
the ruins of the Borsippa Temple ; and this remarkable notice,
transferred to the pages of a recent number of the " Quarterly
Review," had naturally attracted much attention amongst Biblical
students, authenticating, as it seemed to do, one of the earliest and
most important portions of the Scripture narrative.        There was in
reality, however, no foundation whatever for M. Oppfirt's state
ment.    He had misinterpreted certain expressions, and at once jumped
to the conclusion that he had really found a trace of Noachidan
history.   As far as Sir Henry's own researches extended, not a single
allusion had been discovered in the inscriptions, either of Assyria or
Babylonia, to the leading events of the Mosaic record. It seemed
probable, indeed, that the earliest native Babylonian notices did not
reach as high as the period of Chedorlaoiner and his confederate
kings ; for at that time Elam was evidently in the ascendant, and the
provinces to the westward were mere tributaries, whereas when Cunei
form history first dawns on us, we find the Turanian tribes of the
Accad and their allies, represented in the Bible by the goim, or
" nations," of whom Tidal (properly, Tur-gal, " the great
                                                              chief") was
king, exercising independent sway in Southern Chaldea.
     Sir Henry then, referring to diagrams suspended on the wall,
proceeded to explain his own views with regard to the early com
parative chronology of Assyria and Babylonia, as revealed to us from
the Cuneiform Inscriptions.     He showed, in the first place, that there
was an authentic date reaching as high as the 19th century B.C.
Whether the Ismi-dagon, who built a temple in Assyria at this
period, was really the king of the same name, whose bricks had been
found in the ruins of Urof the Chaldees, did not much signify.      It was
sufficient to know that the Assyrians really had materials for history,
ascending to a period of such remote antiquity.      He believed himself,
that the Assyrian " Empire," succeeding the rule of the high-priests,
commenced     in the 18th century B.C. synchronously, perhaps, with
the establishment of a Turanian dynasty in Babylon.        To the latter,

 on the authority of Berosus, he assigned a duration of 450 yours, sup-
 Iiosing that in about B.C. 1300, Tilgamus of Assyria had driven out
 these Turanians, and established a junior branch of the Royal family
 of Nineveh on the throne of Babylon, which family had remained in
 power until shortly before the era of Nabonassar in B.C. 747. The
 great line of Assyrian royalty had, probably, remained unbroken from
 the first establishment of the Empire in the 18th century B.C. to the
 death of Shalmaneser IV. at the siege of Samaria, in B.C. 721, and
 the remaining kings, from Sargon downwards, who, if belonging to
 the royal family, did not, at any rate, succeed in the direct line of
 hereditary descent, formed what was generally called the Lower
 dynasty.
       A most important aid for determining the dates of the later Assy
 rian history, and for rectifying, by means of these dates, the general
 scheme of Scripture chronology, had been recently obtained, through
 the discovery, among the Nineveh tablets in the British Museum, of a
 table of Archons, or Eponymes, extending over a period of 270 years.
  It had been the custom at Nineveh, as at Athens, to name the year
 after a particular officer, and a series of these names, therefore, formed
 an official chronological table.          Fragments of four such tables had
 been found, the reigns of the kings, moreover, being marked by a line
 drawn across the column of names, and students were thus able within
 the limits of the series, or from about B.C. 910 to 640, to determine
 the relative date of all the leading events in the history of Western
 Asia. The effect of this was to lower the date of Jehu and his con
 temporaries by about forty years.                                           •
      Sir Henry then went on to show from a diagram, explaining the
canon, the various synchronisms of Assyrian and Jewish history, down
 to the time of the great Sardanapalus, who was, he stated, the son of
 the Biblical Esar-Haddon.           The reign of Sardanapalus afforded the
only point of contact between the history of Nineveh and the history of
 Greece, the Assyrian empire expiring just as the Grecian power arose.
The dodecarchy of Egypt, described by Herodotus, was shown to have
 been instituted by Sardanapalus, and the same king received an offer
ing of Cimmerian slaves from Gyges, the king of Lydia, who played
so prominent a part both in Grecian history and fable.
      In a later part of his discourse, Sir Henry commented on the
contents of many of the tablets which he had been recently examining,*
 and of which the following was a list : —
      1. Syllabaries, or lists, explaining the phonetic powers and meanings
of all the Assyrian simple and compound characters and monograms.
     * These " terra-cotta " tablets, which form the most valuable portion of the
Assyrian collection in the British Museum, were exhumed from the ruins of the
palace of Sardanapalus at Nineveh, being in fact the debris of the Royal Library.
There are probably as many as 100,000 fragments of such tablets now ranged on
the shelves of our national museum, but a very small portion are legible, and a
still smaller portion sufficiently perfect to give the sense of the document to which
they belong.

These lists were invaluable, he said, to the Assyrian student, and
comprised above one thousand characters.
    2. Grammatical documents, explanatory of the old Babylonian
language, which was itself of the Turanian type, and yet was largely,
though irregularly, amalgamated with the Semitic Assyrian.
    3. Classified lists of animals and birds, of woods, metals, stones,
trees, fruits, and all natural productions, the lists being arranged in the
two languages of Assyria and Babylon.
     4. Mythological    treatises, giving the names, parentage, functions,
and attributes of the gods ; the places where they were worshipped ;
specific names of the temples ; the prayers and sacrifices to be ad
dressed to them ; their festivals, &c., &c.       There were only thirteen
principal divinities worshipped in Assyria, but the minor members of
the Pantheon were " Legion."
     5. Explanatory lists of proper names, showing the principles on
which the system of Assyrian nomenclature was based.            Every name
in Assyrian had thus a distinct meaning : Sennacherib meant " The
moon glorifies my brothers ;
                                   "
                                       Merodach-Baladan,    " Merodach has
                 "                      "
given   a  son ;   Nebuchadnezzar,        Nebo  is  the  protector of land
marks;" Sargon, "The established king;" Esar-Haddon, "Asshur
has given a brother," &c., &c.
     6. Legal documents,      consisting of deeds of sale of lands, houses,
gardens, orchards, vineyards, slaves, cattle, grain, &c. ; leases of property
or grants for a term of years, on special conditions of farming and tax
ation ; contracts for the supply of grain ; purchases of grain, or farm
stock, or other property ; loans of money (calculated by weight in
silver) at interest, and often on security of land, or cattle, or grain ;
deeds of barter ; dedication of slaves to the service of the temples, &c.,
&c. Sir Henry said he had copied some hundreds of these legal
tablets, and had thus acquired a very tolerable insight into the private
life of the Assyrians.      These legal documents, like the others, had
been inscribed, in the first instance, on tablets of soft clay, which were
afterwards baked and converted into " terra cotta." Before the tablet,
however, was put into the furnace, the executing party— that            is,
                                                                          the
person conveying his property to another set his seal to       it,
                                                                 to authenti
cate the transfer;  and, in default of   a   seal, he made three or more
impressions with his thumb nail, the said impressions enabling one at
the present day to recognize the exact fashion in which the Assyrians
cut their nails. On the margin of all such tablets there was a memo
 randum, charging an extra fee to the law officer for using the thumb
nail instead of the seal, apparently as a punishment for carelessness         in
not wearing the regular signet seal.         These legal documents were
usually executed somewhat after the following form — First, the name
                                                       :

the seals of such parties authenticating the conveyance    ;  then the state
ment of property, lands, houses, slaves, or other chattels to be sold         ;
then the name and quality of party or parties buying       ; price in weight
of silver; money to be paid in full property to be taken possession

fulfil    contract, liable   to severe penalty ; fine to be paid to the gods ;
purchase-money         to be  returned tenfold to the buyer, and contract to
be declared cancelled. Then follow the names of witnesses, who some
times also set their seals to the document — and at the end the date of
the sale, that is, day, month, and year of Eponyme or Archon ; and,
finally, name of law officer, or Aba, who drew up the contract. Among
the legal documents were some which resembled our marriage-settle
ments, an Assyrian young lady, as it appeared, not being entitled to
hold property in her own name after marriage, but a trustee being
appointed by the father to hold the lands for her separate use.
       No. 7, was a class of tablets, which Sir Henry could only compare
to our visiting cards, or rather to the practice of writing one's name in
the visitor's       book at Buckingham palace or Marlborough             house.
They contained simply the name of the visitor, calling himself " the
 king's slave," and an invocation to the gods to protect the monarch,
 and they seemed to have been left at the king's palace as a mere mark
 of respectful loyalty. Their only value now was as an evidence of an
 ancient curious custom, and as a means of accumulating Assyrian
 names.
       8. Despatches and letters from officers on service reporting victories
 over the king's enemies, and giving elaborate lists of killed and
 wounded, captives, amount of spoil, &c.         From these documents were
 subsequently compiled the official annals of the monarch.
       9. Inventories of the royal property, deposited in the different
 palaces of the kingdom.         The objects were often difficult of identifica
 tion, but the lists were still very curious.
        10. Records of hunting expeditions ; in fact, a sort of royal game-
  book, kept by the " grand veneur," the game, however, being chiefly
  lions and leopards, and the larger wild animals.
        1 1. Agricultural treatises, explaining all the various details of hus
  bandry in relation to the best time and method of cultivating corn and
  garden land. These contained many very curious details about sowing,
  watering, manuring, succession of crops, &c.
       No. 12 comprised astronomical and astrological documents. Sir
   Henry stated that he was at present busily engaged in investigating the
  tablets of this class ; and he trusted that when he had finished his
   researches,    he should be able to trace the progress of astronomy
   from the first glimmerings of the pursuit amongst the Chaldeans, with
   whom it was well known to have originated, to the more perfect state
   in which the science was handed over by the Chaldeans to the Greeks,
   to be by them transmitted to the Arabs, and, through their means,
    re-introduced into Europe during the dark ages. It was a very dif
    ficult study, and his investigations were as yet incomplete ; but still he
    had already obtained results which filled him with extreme surprise,
    for not only were the Assyrians acquainted with the general movement
    of the heavenly bodies, and with the laws and tables necessary to
    enable them to calculate lunar eclipses, but they also seemed to have

340                         Sir ffenry Rawlinson                   [Jan. 27,
observed the four satellites of Jupiter, which, in those regions, could
be often seen with the naked eye, and to have been even acquainted
with the seven satellites of Saturn, which never could have been seen
without the aid of lenses.       He had also found a notice of comets, and
many    allusions to eclipses.    What he was now especially searching for
was a register of lunar eclipses, dated from the year of the Eponyme or
Archon, similar to that register, in fact, which must have been con
sulted by Ptolemy in compiling the Almagest ; for it must be remem
bered that if the exact date of a single Eponyme or Archon could once
be fixed by an astronomical calculation, then the whole of the 270
years of the canon would at once become positive chronology ; since
 the name of one single Archon would regulate the entire series.         He
 had also found a large number of observatory reports on the full
moon and the equinoxes, and tables for the position of the planets
 throughout the year.      The great majority of the tablets, however, of
 which he was now treating, referred to astrology, and recorded the pre
tended influence of the heavenly bodies— as they were in conjunction
or opposition — upon all sublunary actions ; everything being included,
                               "
 as in " Zadkiel's Almanac       and similar trash of the present day, from
the fate of empires to washing one's hands or paring one's nails. There
 were also horoscopes and nativities and hemerologies, giving the lucky
and unlucky days throughout the year.         The whole system, indeed, of
judicial astrology and magic had originally come, as was well known,
from Chaldea ; and he was now examining the very documents which
had so well bewildered and fascinated the Greek philosophers. Among
the fragments of real science, which he hoped to extract from the mass
of rubbish now under investigation, were an explanation of the original
solar zodiac, a list of the fixed stars known to those primitive astro
nomers, and, possibly, some evidence as to their invention of the lunar
zodiac, or " mansions of the moon," which had been also known in
extreme antiquity both to the Chinese and Indians.
     Sir Henry said that, before concluding, he would quote a few
instances in which the accuracy of his system of cuneiform decipher
ment had been tested ; and he would leave his audience to judge from
the results, if they were not fully warranted in accepting his trans
lations.
     1. Sir Gardner Wilkinson, many years ago, had found a porphyry
vase in the treasury of St. Mark's at Venice, inscribed with a legend
both in hieroglyphics and in cuneiform.            He sent a copy of the
cuneiform legend to Sir Henry, who at once read it as " Artaxerxes,
the great king," the very same reading having been already obtained
by Sir Gardner from the hieroglyphs.
     2. A similar test was afforded by the legend found on the vase
excavated by Mr. Newton a few years back from the famous tomb of
Mausolus at Halicarnassus.         Mr. Birch, the great Egyptologist, read
the hieroglyphic legend as " Xerxes, the great king," and Sir Henry
independently furnished the same reading for the cuneiform.
     3. A more elaborate test was subsequently undertaken.        Copies of

 186u.]          on the Results  of Cuneiform Discovery.                341
 the great cylinder inscription of Tiglath-Pileser I., extending to nearly
  1000 lines of cuneiform writing, were submitted to four Assyrian
 scholars — to Sir Henry in London, to Dr. Ilincks in Ireland, to M.
 Oppert in Paris, and to Mr. Fox Talbot of Laycock Abbey, and they
 were invited to send in independent translations under seal, on a
 certain day, to be examined by a committee composed of the first
 scholars in England, namely, Dean Milman, Mr. Grote, the historian,
 Professor Wilson, Dr. Cureton, and Sir Gardner Wilkinson. The
 translations were thus sent in to the committee, and on being compared
 were found to coincide, not indeed word for word, but in all essentials
 of distribution of subject, reading of names, and general signification,
 the verdict recorded by the committee being decisive as to the com
 petency of the gentlemen engaged to read and translate the language.
      4. A further means of verification had been afforded by a series of
 bi-lingual readings — cuneiform and Phoenician — recently discovered
 on some of the Nineveh legal tablets.     These tablets, which contained
 for the most part deeds of sale in cuneiform, were docketed in
 Phoenician, and the names of the parties expressed in the two lan
guages corresponded throughout, as had been shown in a paper recently
published by Sir Henry on the subject.
      5. The last proof he should give was still more curious.      He had
met with a passage in one of the Nineveh inscriptions, which stated
that the king Asshur-izir-pal (the famous builder of the North- West
Palace at Nimriid, excavated by Mr. Layard), having reached the
sources of the Tigris in one of his mountain expeditions, had there
found the memorial tablet of Tiglath-Pileser I., sculptured with his
image and titles ; and had accordingly, in imitation of his great pre
decessor, sculptured his own figure and titles on the rock as a
" pendant " to the other tablet. Sir Henry, being much struck with
this curious passage, had requested Mr. John Taylor, H.M. Consul at
Diyarbekir, who was then travelling in the vicinity, to take an oppor
tunity of visiting the source of the Tigris, and thus verifying the
Nineveh notice.      Mr. Taylor did visit the spot in the course of his
travels, and there, on the walls of a cave from which the main stream
of the Tigris flows, he found the two tablets precisely as described in
the annals of the Nineveh king.       He had sent home casts in paper,
both of the sculpture and inscriptions, which had been published in the
second volume of Professor llawlinson's (a brother of the speaker)
" Ancient    Monarchies."    The sculpture of Tiglath-Pileser I., dated
from the     twelfth century B.C-, and was the earliest specimen of
Assyrian    Art yet discovered. Sir Henry thought that, after such
repeated instances of verification, no reasonable doubt could be enter
tained of the correctness of the cuneiform readings.
      Sir Henry said, in conclusion, that he wished to draw the attention
of the public to the curious treasure-house of old- word knowledge into
which he was seeking to penetrate.     It was not to be expected that, how
ever successful future researches might be, anything of real importance
could be added from the Nineveh tablets to the scientific knowledge of

the nineteenth century ; but still it could hardly be devoid of interest
to ascertain the social and intellectual condition of the Assyrians at
such an early period of history, intimately connected as those people
were, on the one side, with the Jews in laws, language, and religion,
and standing as they did, on the other side, in the position of pro
genitors of European civilization ; for it could not now be doubted
that the Asiatic Greeks derived their first germs of art, of philosophy,
and of Science from the Chaldeans and Assyrians.
      He could not hold out the prospect of any great results from the
materials now in hand, for the tablets were, for the most part, crumb
ling and mutilated ; and he doubted, moreover, if the original Nineveh
collection had ever contained documents of the highest class of interest,
— such as codes of laws, or systems of philosophy, or even those astro
 nomical registers, involving abstruse mathematical calculations, which
had excited the admiration of Aristotle when forwarded by Calisthenes
 from Babylon; but still he did not despair of more successful discoveries
 hereafter.      At present, they had merely access to a single collection of
 literary   documents    belonging to a single king ; but, no doubt, every
 city  in the  old  empires of Babylonia and Assyria had its library, and
 every monarch had his record office ; and there was nothing therefore
 unreasonable in hoping that Arbela, or Nebi-Junus, or Kilch Shirgnt
 in Assyria, or some of the still more ancient sites in Southern Chaldea,
 which had been as yet but most imperfectly explored, would some day
 yield up more perfect and more valuable treasures.
      Sir Henry added, that our excavating labours were limited at pre
 sent to one experimental search, which was being made by Colonel
 Kemball, our consul-general in Turkish Arabia, among the little-
 visited Chaldean ruins, in connection with his duty of superintending
 the construction of the overland telegraph between Bagdad and Bus-
 sorah.     As Colonel Kemball had no more than 5001. at his disposal for
 excavating purposes, he could do little beyond tapping the soil in the
 various sites selected for examination ; but still every new brick and
  every new fragment of a tablet added something to our previous stock
 of knowledge ; and there was reason, at any rate, to be thankful that
 some movement had been thus renewed ; that we were not, in fact,
 reduced to that total cessation from all progress — that " rest and be
  thankful " condition — which had recently found favour in high quar
  ters ; but which, in his humble opinion, was as fatal to science as it
  was to liberty.

                   Bismuth             Bi            210
     It is observable that the atomic proportions of the metals range
from 7 parts of lithium, through 108 parts of silver up to 210 parts
of bismuth. Now it is found that all these different proportions have
substantially the same specific heat, so that 7 parts of lithium, 108
parts of silver, and 210 parts of bismuth, for instance, absorb or evolve
the same amount of heat in undergoing equal increments or decre
ments of temperature.     Hence, taking silver as a convenient standard
of comparison, the atomic proportion of any other metal may be
defined to be, that quantity of the metal which has the same specific
heat as 108 parts of silver.
     Many of the metals unite with the halogen radicles chlorine and
bromine, as also with the organic radicles ethyl and methyl, to
form volatile compounds, which may be conveniently compared with
the chloride and ethide of hydrogen.          Now, it is found that the
several proportions of metal or hydrogen contained in equal volumes
of these gaseous chlorides or ethides, are their respective atomic pro
portions ; so that equal volumes of chloride or ethide of hydrogen,
zinc, arsenic, tin, mercury, lead, and bismuth, for instance, contain
1, 65, 75, 118, 200, 207, and 210 parts of hydrogen or metal respec
tively.    Hence, the molecule of chloride of hydrogen, HC1, being
conventionally regarded as constituting two volumes, the atomic pro
portion of a metal may be defined to be that quantity of the metal
                                                             2r2

which is contained in two volumes of its gaseous chloride, or bromide,
 or ethide, or methide, &c.
     These two definitions having reference respectively to the specific
 heats of the metals, and the molecular volumes of their gaseous com
 pounds, lead in all cases to the same conclusion.                Thus, 200 parts of
 mercury    is  the    quantity of mercury      which has  the  same   specific heat as
 108 parts of silver, and is also the quantity of mercury contained in
 two volumes of mercuric chloride, mercuric ethide, &c.
     The atomic proportions of the different metals unite with 1, 2, 3,
 4, &c. atoms of chlorine and ethyl, to form the two-volume molecules
 of their respective chlorides and ethides, as shown below : —

     Or, two volumes of the gaseous chlorides of hydrogen, mercury,
bismuth, and tin, for instance, are found to contain respectively
35-5 parts, twice 3.5'5 parts, three times 35-5 parts, and four times
35'5 parts of chlorine.
     Aluminium, which is one of the three most abundant constituents
of the earth's crust, and the most abundant of all its metallic consti
tuents, enters into the composition of a large number of native
minerals of great value in the fine and useful arts, and also forms
extremely well-defined artificial compounds, possessing a high degree
of chemical interest.           Nevertheless chemists are not at all agreed as
to the atomic weight which should be accorded                  to the metal, or as
to the molecular formulae of its principal compounds.
     The quantity of aluminium which has the same specific heat as
108 parts of silver, is found to be 27'5 parts ; and analysis shows that
this quantity of aluminium combines with three times 35'5 parts of
chlorine to form chloride of aluminium.                   Accordingly the atomic
proportion of aluminium should be fixed at 27'5 parts ; its chloride be
formulated as a trichloride thus, A1CI8 ; and its other compounds be
represented       by corresponding expressions, as shown in the left-hand

     But the quantity of aluminium contained in two volumes of its
gaseous chloride was found by Deville to be 55 parts, instead of
27-5 parts, while the quantity of chlorine was found to be six times
35'5 parts, instead of three times 35'5 parts.       Hence, relying ex
clusively upon    molecular   volume,  the atomic  weight of aluminium
would bu 55, and the formula of chloride of aluminium A11C1,.       This
conclusion, however, is inadmissible for several reasons, and chiefly
because it would make the atomic proportion of aluminium possess a
specific heat twice as great as that belonging to the atomic proportion
of  any other metal.
     To evade this difficulty some chemists have proposed to accord to
the molecule of aluminic chloride the formula Al,Cl,, whereby an indi
visible proportion of metal would be habitually represented by a divi
sible symbol ; for it is agreed on all hands that the proportion of
aluminium contained in the molecule of aluminic chloride is the
smallest proportion of aluminium found in any aluminic compound
whatsoever ; that it is incapable of experimental division by any pro
cess whatsoever ; and consequently that, so far as our present know
ledge goes, it is an indivisible or atomic proportion.
     Now there are undoubtedly certain bodies, elementary and com
pound, of which the ascertained vapour densities, and consequent
volumes, no matter how accounted for, are, as a mere matter of
experiment, discordant with the chemical analogies of the respective
bodies ; but in most instances these anomalous results are rendered
unimportant by other determinations of vapour density, either of 'the
same bodies raised to higher temperatures,      or of associated bodies
having a more decided volatility.     Hence arises the question whether
the ascertained volume of aluminic chloride, which is discordant with
the specific heat of aluminium, may not be anomalous in a similar
manner, and whether the anomaly may not be corrected by an examin
ation of other more volatile aluminic compounds.
    The methide and ethide of aluminium recently obtained by
Mr. Buckton and the speaker are, so to speak, varieties of aluminic
chloride in which the chlorine has been replaced by methyl and ethyl,
and are at the same time far more volatile and manageable than
the typical chloride.   Now, it has been found that two gaseous volumes
of the methide and ethide of aluminium contain only 27 '5 parts of
aluminium, united with three atomic proportions of methyl and ethyl ;
and accordingly their molecules have to be expressed by the formulae
AlMe, and AlEts respectively. In other words, the normal results
obtained with the methide and ethide correct the anomalous result
obtained with the chloride, and confirm the atomic weight and
molecular formulae deducible from the specific heat of aluminium.
     That the ascertained vapour density of aluminic chloride is really
anomalous receives a further corroboration in the behaviour of
aluminic methide itself. At 220°, and all superior temperatures, the
vapour density of this compound shows that two volumes of its
vapour contain 27'5 parts 'of aluminium and three times 15 parts of

 346                    General   Monthly   Meeting.              [Feb. 6,
  methyl ; but at 130°, its vapour density, corrected for alteration of
  temperature, becomes very nearly doubled, or, in other words, two
  volumes of its vapour contain very nearly 55 parts of aluminium and
  six times 15 parts of methyl. According, however, to the well-known
 rule, based on the separate researches of Cahours and Deville, the mole
 cular formula of a body must be calculated from its permanent or
 ultimate, and not from its variable or initial vapour density, whence
 the high vapour density of aluminium methide at 130° does not at all
 interfere with our attributing to its molecule the formula AlMe,,
 deducible from its vapour density at 220° and upwards, and har
 monizing with the specific heat of metallic aluminium.
      Aluminium ethide and methide occur as colourless liquids.      The
 ethide boils at 194°, and does not freeze at — 18°. The methide
 boils at 130°, and solidifies at a little above 0° into a beautiful
 crystalline mass.    Both liquids take fire on exposure to air, and
 explode violently by contact with water. They are produced from
 mercuric ethide and methide respectively, by heating these compounds
 for some hours in a water-bath, with excess of aluminium clippings.
This process was obviously suggested by Frankland and Duppa's
new reaction for making zinc ethide, methide, amylide, &c.

                        On Central     and Eastern Arabia.
 By commerce, by arms, or by knowledge and scientific inquiry, the
 world seems the destined inheritance of England : and of that inhe
ritance Arabia is not the least extensive or the least interesting portion.
 In that view      I  communicate with pleasure a brief summary of the
 information gained during a journey in the central and eastern regions
 of the great peninsula — a journey undertaken under the auspices, and
 forwarded by the liberality, of that constant patron of scientific enter
 prise, the Emperor of the French.
      When the moment came for attempting the exploration of Central
 Arabia, a task for which seven years' residence in Syria and Egypt
 had prepared me by a knowledge of the Arabic language, literature, and
 manners,    I  assumed the disguise of a native travelling physician, took
 with me a trusty companion, a Damascene by birth, and in company
 with a few Bedouins crossed the desert that lies between Gaza and
 Ma'an. The object of my disguise was not so much personal security
 as the attainment of greater familiarity            in my intercourse with the
 natives, and consequent facility in observing unobserved.               Of course,
 this same disguise deprived me of many aids common to European
 travellers — sketch-books, mathematical instruments, and the like ; but
 it procured me, on the other hand, great freedom of action and special
 means of information.
      Having arrived at Ma'an, on the great pilgrim road, at the begin
 ning of June, we made acquaintance with a small band of Bedouins,

1865.]              en    Central and Eastern Arabia.                    349
who offered to conduct us across the waste that lies between that
place and the Djowf, the first inhabited land of Central Arabia,
which is an isolated oasis lying at the southern extremity of Wadi
Serhan, and at an equal distance south-east and south-west from
Bagdad and Damascus.          It belongs at the present day to the govern
ment of Ulal, prince of Shomer.           Here we reposed about three
weeks, amid a people celebrated for their hospitable and manly character,
under the shade of palm groves renowned for their copious fruit, and
gardens of vines, apricots, and other fruit trees, rivalling those of
Damascus. I ought to notice that the square form given to this oasis
in several maps is erroneous, its length from east to west equalling
at least ten times its breadth from north to south.             By whatever
road one desires to reach the midlands of Arabia, one must on
some point cross the desert, since it forms a ring round the whole
peninsula, behind the mountains which border the sea coast.           To the
north, where we passed      it,this ring
                                       is about 180 English miles broad;
to the south much more so         ; on the east and west       it   generally
                                                                    is
narrower, but  it  exists everywhere.
     To trace briefly the line of my journey,       lay — First, from Ma'an
                                                     it
to Djowf; next from Djowf across       a  second arm of desert, luckily    a
narrower one, to Djebel Shomer, the first mountain range of mid-
Arabia, and  a   kind of advanced bulwark to the central plateau.      Once,
amid the mountains of Shomer, our way led us by villages and planta
tions scattered through the deep rocky gorges to the city of Hayel, the
capital of the new kingdom of Shomer whose first limits we had
                                                ;
already entered on arriving at Wadi Sushan, when half way from
Ma'an to Djowf.      Here we remained   a   month and     half, as doctors to
                                                          a
the reigning monarch, Telal Ebn-Rasheed, to the " royal family, and
to the town at large."        We then crossed the remainder of Djebel
Shomer or Aja, for the town of Hayel     is in the very heart of the moun
tain;   next passed the broad valley that separates        from the parallel
                                                          it
range of Djebel Solma, where Hatim Tai, the most generous, and
Antar, the bravest of the Arabs, lie buried, (the Arabs pretended to
show us their tombs,) and then traversed the high pasture lands
of Upper Kaseem, stopping every evening in some village by the
way.
     At last, below Kowarah, the last southerly town belonging to the
Shomer government, we came to that enormous land-dip where the
whole level suddenly sinks down into the vast plain of Southern
Kaseem,  a   region of dates and corn, of traffic and commerce, the most
fertile and populous district of Central Arabia.           Here begins the
Wahhabee empire.
     We passed the town of Rass, and        acurious stone circle, like that
of Stonehenge or Carnac, and after a few villages came to Bereydah,
which, by the way,   is  to the north of Oneyzah, not the south, as most
maps erroneously make it.         The town       large, and contains about
                                                is
23,000 inhabitants here we stopped for some weeks.

war in the province for the Wahhabee armies were besieging Oneyzah,

the   capital of Kaseem, and we had the pleasure of seeing several
reviews and camps, besides one skirmish.
     From Bereydah we turned north-east, crossed the rest of Kaseem,
and a narrow but difficult sand-pass or nefood that separates between
the three provinces of Woshem, Sedeyr, and Kaseem.                  At last we
came to Zulphah, a commercial town on the high road ; indeed the
only one from Nejed to Barra.           It stands in a valley at the foot of
Djebel Toweyk.
     This mountain here forms a high limestone wall, running from
north to south ; ultimately it bends like a crescent from east to west,
 and hence its name Toweyk, or Twist.            It is a succession of plateaux,
 generally  in  three   stages — lower, middle,    and higher — the last is the
 most easterly.     Its upper limb forms the province of Sedeyr. Here
 begins, in Arab parlance, Nejed
                                         — i.e. the uplands — a term only
 applied by the natives in Arabia itself to the rive provinces situated
 within the mountains of Toweyk, namely, Sedeyr, Aared, Yemamah,
 Aflaj, and Woshem.
      We now entered the province of Sedeyr. Our first halt was at
 Ghat ; our second at Mejmaa, a large fortified town high up in the
 mountain.     It was, till lately, the capital of the province. We then
 passed Djelajil and Roudah, and came to Toweym, the actual capital.
 It is on the second ledge, and consequently higher up than Mejmaa.
 Then we came to Haft, then to Thoneeyr, and next to a high pass,
 called Theniyyat Atalah, opposite Djebel Atalah on the east.             This is
 the loftiest point of Djebel Toweyk.           It is a little more than three
 thousand feet above the sea-level.       Thence we came to Sadik, next to
 Horeymelah, a good-sized town well fortified, where Mohammed Ebn
 Abd-el Wahhab, the founder of the Wahhabee sect, was born. Next we
 came to Sedous, where ends Sedeyr and begins the province of Aared.
 At last we entered Wadi Haneefah, the central valley of Arabia, in
 the midst of Djebel Toweyk ; here we passed the ruins of Eyanah and
 Dereyyuah, the old Wahhabee capital destroyed by Ibraheem Pasha,
 now deserted, and came to Riad, the modern capital.
      Here lives the sultan of Nejed, Feysul, with his eldest son Abd-
 Allah, and others of the royal family. The town contains at least
 25,000 inhabitants. It stands amid beautiful plantations and gardens,
 whence its name.       South of it lie the mountains of Yemamah, famous
 in Arab poetry, around the heights of Toweyk.                 Here we passed
 nearly two months.        Then we visited Manfoohah and Selemyah in the
 Yemamah, a very warm district, where cotton grows in plenty; and
 thence entered Wadi Soley, the same          I   suppose with what maps call
 Wadi Aftan, a name unknown in Arabia itself, to the best of my know
 ledge.    We had now to cross again the high ledge of Toweyk, from
 whose white steppes we saw far away in the south, on the verge of the
 Great Desert, the granite hills of Hareek, or " Burning," a very hot
 province, whose inhabitants are almost as dark as Abyssinians.
      Then we descended the eastern side of Toweyk about one thousand
 feet, and came to the desert, which we now re-crossed to get out of Cen
                                                                                  '

  tral Arabia   ; there are here full eighty miles to pass without water. Next
  we descended      Wadi Farook, a deep valley that separates the Desert of
  Dahna (i.e. red, from the colour of its scorching sands) from the coast
  range of Hasa mountains, which are basalt and granite ; then we
  descended full a thousand feet more and came on the plain of Hasa
  between the hills and the Persian Gulf.
       In Hofhoof, a town as large as Kind and the capital of Hasa, we
  remained some weeks — very pleasant ones, for the people are civilized
  and fond of strangers, and the country is full of running streams,
  hot-springs, pretty villages, old castles, and fruitful gardens.        We then
 journeyed to Katif, on the shore of the Persian gulf. Here was the resi
  dence of the old Carmathian rulers : their palace and castle, built more
  in a Persian than an Arab style, are still remaining.           From Katif we
  crossed in an Arab ship to Bahreyn, and stopped about a month in the
  active seaport town of Menamah, and in the neighbouring island of
  Moharrek, where resides the governor Ebn-Khalifah.
      From Bahreyn      I  crossed over to Katar.      This is the first land pro
  vince belonging to the sultan of Oman, most improperly called the
  Imam of Mascat ; for Mascat is not a capital, nor is he an Imam, nor
  even a Mahometan, but a Biadi, i.e. a Carmathian, or in plain English,
  a freethinker, like most of his subjects.      The capital of Katar is Bedaa,
  and here    I   stopped some time with the old governor Ebn-Thani.
  Here are the best pearl fisheries ; the monopoly belongs to Oman, but
  is farmed at a low price.       The land is rocky and barren ; behind its
 low hills lies the Great Desert.
      I  then crossed, against my will, as a storm took the ship out of
 her way, to the Arabo- Persian coast, off Barr Faris.             Here   I visited
 some towns, such as Chiro and Charak ; and then, journeying east by
 Ras Bustanah, entered the strip of coast which belongs to the sultan of
 Oman, whose rule extends hence as far as Djask.              After a short stay
 at the thriving port of Linja,        I  crossed over to Sharja, a good-sized
 town on the Oman coast, and thence journeyed up by the Djowasmrah
 Coast to Res Mesandum ; visited the once flourishing island of Ormuz,
 and then came down the coast of the three provinces Ro'os el Djebel,
 Kalhat, and Batinah to Sohar, one of the three capitals of Oman. The
 two others are Neywah and Bahhola, in the interior.              From Sohar      I
 took ship for Mascat, but the ship went down off the Sowadah islands,
 and, with a few others,      I saved my life by swimming, and regained the
 coast between Barka and Seeb.             Not far hence the sultan of Oman
 has a country palace, where         I   paid a visit to his majesty, and then
 came across country to Mascat.           There I remained for some weeks to
see the town and the neighbourhood, and then returned by sea up the
 Persian gulf, and by the Tigris to Bagdad.
      Such was the route of my Arab journey.            Of course, it was accom
panied    by occasional    danger  from    Bedouins  in the desert, and from the
jealousy of the Wahhabees, who readily suspect a stranger to be also a
spy in the towns, besides other casualties, such as the shipwreck above
 mentioned. I will only say that, whoever knows enough Arabic to pass

for a native of Damascus or Cairo, and enough medicine or traffic to
become doctor or merchant for a year or two, can, with ordinary
prudence and patience, visit the whole of Arabia at his leisure, and
come off safe, under the protection of Providence.
      A few words on the three great kingdoms into which Central and
Eastern Arabia is divided. 1 . The northernmost is of recent foundation ;
it embraces the upper part of the peninsula from the desert and the
pachalics of Damascus and Bagdad to the north, to the frontiers of
Lower Kaseem on the south ; Zeima Khaibar and the Djowf belong to                  it,
but its strength and origin lie in the mountains now called Djebel
Shomer.       It was founded as an offshoot of the Wahhabee empire and
under its protection about forty years ago, but has since become entirely
independent.       The present king, Telal Ebn-Rasheed,       is
                                                              a   man of about
forty, of extraordinary talents, and real statesmanship.         His great aim
has been to encourage commerce and agricullure throughont his exten
sive states, and the great market-place of Hayel          his work.
                                                         is             Religion
is  free throughout his states, and the king has used all his efforts to
implant colonies of Shiyhees, Jews, and Christians in the capital itself,
and partly succeeded.        Wiihin his palace he encourages literary men
and poets, who still, as formerly, are the foremost honoured in Arabia.
In war he has hitherto been uniformly successful.           There      no stand
                                                                       is
ing army, but muster-rolls of the militia are kept in the capital, and
at   a few days' notice    have seen a force of some thousands, well armed
                           I
and disciplined after Arab fashion, brought together.          The provinces
are administered          by
                         governors, named      bythe king himself; but each
has  a   counter-check in local Mejlis, or assembly composed principally
                               a
of the local nobility.
      The climate in this part of Arabia        is very temperate, the nights
cool, and the air dry.       The men of Shomer are the finest specimens of
the Arab race        indeed,
                      ;        I have seldom so;'n anywhere        a handsomer
people, being courteous, intelligent, and generous, so that stranger soon
                                                               a
finds himself at home among them. In religion, some are Mahometans;
a  greater number keep up the old Arab practices of prayers to the sun,
sacrifices to the dead, sacred groves, &c.       However, these are in their
way    Monotheists,   only without  the bigotry  of Islamitic nations.    There
is  a small Wahhabee party in the capital, but fortunately         it     highly
                                                                            is
unpopular.        Morals are better here than elsewhere in Arabia, but
gallantry    is by no means unknown among the young folks.
      The breed of camels       good and abundant.
                                   is                   The horses of Shomer
are excellent     ;some are shipped off for India       by
                                                        Koweyt ;   others go to
Bagdad, Damascus, and Egypt, where they pass for Nejdean horses, to
which, however, they are inferior        for the real Nejdean breed, peculiar
                                         ;
to the highlands of Toweyk, is,          Ihave all reason to believe, never
exported from its native land — never sold or bartered. When at the
Wahhabee capital         was admitted, in quality of veterinary surgeon, into
                          I

Nejdees  I
         ;     never saw, before or after, such perfect beauties.    One which
I  mounted, without saddle or bridle, Arab fashion, was so manageable

 and pliant, with all his fire, that  I could have fancied myself a centaur,
 and that the horse was part of myself.           There are not above four
 thousand head of this breed in existence.
     The total population of the Shomer states amounts to about half a
million, or a little more, including townsmen and Bedouins ; the military
 force to about thirty-five thousand.      Bedouins are more numerous here
 than in the rest of Arabia ; but they are looked on as far inferior in
 every respect to the fixed population, and are entirely subject like all
 others to the Government.           On entering the Shomer territories,
 one gets a passport (price about           \\  thaler) from the first local
governor, and then one may travel as secure as in Germany or
England.
     2. The Wahhabee empire, which has recovered its strength since
 its overthrow by Ibraheem Pasha, and is still governed by the old
family of Ebn-Sa'ood, begins to the south of Shomer. It includes
the whole of Central Arabia, from the shores of the Persian Gulf to
the frontiers of Mecca ; to the south it is bounded by the Great Desert
and the Yemen.
     It is the most absolute and the most centralized monarchy that          I
have ever seen, fully as much so as the Roman empire, to which it
 bears no small resemblance.         Its peculiarity lies in the bigotry and
fanaticism which form its mainspring of action. The Wahhabees are
Koranists to the letter, and whoever is not so, is for them a heretic,
polytheist, or infidel.    Swearing by any name but that of God, invo
cation of any creature, Mahomet not excepted, nay even putting the
copulative conjunction waw between the name of a creature and that of
 God, and also smoking tobacco, are all crimes which may be punished
by death, and not seldom are.            Wearing silk or gold ornaments,
omitting to pray at the mosque five times a-day, talking or having a
light in one's house after night-fall, playing on any musical instru
ment, and many similar acts are punished with blows at discretion.
Adultery, theft, and the like are less severely treated.            In conse
quence, throughout the Wahhabee states, there is much religion, more
 hypocrisy, and little morality.
     The upland country (which is strictly Wahhabee) lies in general
from 1500 to 3000 feet above the level of the sea. Here is little
desert or sand ; the soil is marly,          part pasture, part cultivated,
especially   in the  valleys which     everywhere   intersect the plateau of
Toweyk like a labyrinth.      The southern slope of the mountain, which
forms the provinces of Aaredand Yemamah, is the most fertile portion
of Nejed ; to the east and north it is more barren. The climate is
healthy — cool in winter, and not over-hot in summer ; but no snow
ever falls on Toweyk : rain is however not uncommon, and the winter
torrents sometimes sweep away houses and plantations.             I  only met
with one perennial stream ; it waters Djeladjil ; nor did     I  hear of any
other.
     The distinctive character of the people is patience, perseverance,
and great concentration of thought and purpose ; they are brave and

354                         Mr. W. G. Palgrave                      [Feb.  10,
generous, but prone to hatred and bloodshed, often to treachery.           Of
all Arabs, the Nejdean is the only one who in war postpones plunder
to killing ; they seldom give or ask quarter.            In stature they are
generally inferior to the inhabitants of Djebel Shomer, nor equally
handsome ; but they are strong and enduring of fatigue.
      The Nejdean government is a centralized despotism. In all pro
vinces conquered or annexed the native chiefs and nobility are sooner
or later put to death, banished, or set aside, and replaced by go
vernors from the capital, often negroes of the palace service. Hence
throughout the empire, exists a large party of disaffected, especially
in the provinces of Kaseem and Hasa.           The Bedouins throughout the
empire    have   been utterly crushed,  and  the  whole monopoly of oppres
sion and robbery is reserved to the Government.
      Fanaticism is kept up by countless " Metawwaa's," literally " those
who enforce obedience to God," and by the " Meday'yeeyah," or
" Zelators"
               (enthusiasts), a singular institution dating from the Arabian
cholera of 1855, and consisting of twenty-two men invested with powers
like those of the Roman censors, and whose business is to put down
irreligion and immorality, to act as spies, and to bear a large part
in government measures.         These, with two ministers, one for internal
the other for foreign affairs, the chief treasurer (a negro by-the-way),
 and the Kadi, Abd-el-Latif, a very clever and very dangerous man,
 great grandson of the first Wahhabee, form the cabinet council of the
 sultan Feysul, and meet with him officially twice a-week, besides extra
 ordinary consultations. Other public audiences of the sultan are very
 rare, and private ones yet rarer.
      The royal palace in Riad is equal in size to about two-thirds of the
 Tuileries and strongly fortified with walls, towers, and trench, but of
 no architectural beauty, and gloomy. The palace of the heir apparent,
 Abd-Allah, is somewhat smaller, but much handsomer and more
 regular in its construction.       The buildings throughout Nejed and
 Shomer are with very few exceptions of unbaked brick, which here
 hardens into a mass almost as strong as stone ; the use of the arch is
 unknown, and hence all large rooms have to be supported on pillars.
 The great mosque or Djamia at Riad is capable of containing about
 four thousand persons, but it is perfectly unadorned.
      The total population of the Wahhabee empire equals about
  1 ,700,000 souls ; its military force is  about 60,000. Of its subjects,
 about half are Wahhabees by principle and politics ; the other half,
 because they cannot help themselves, of course ; the army is mainly
 drawn from the former class,
      Agriculture, pasture, and war are the main occupations of Nejed.
 Commerce was so once, but it has much gone down under the
 Wahhabee system ; nor is there hardly any manufacture, unless what
 is done by shoemakers and blacksmiths.
      The coast-province of Hasa is the very reverse of Nejed. A warm,
 damp climate, hardly any pasture land, running streams and plantations
 everywhere : the dates of Hasa are the best in Arabia, and conse

1865.]                 071   Central and Eastern Arabia.                          355
quently in the world : a population fond of commerce, which they
carry on as much as their Wahhabee rulers will let them, with Bah-
reyn, Persia, and India ; good manufacturers of the finest cloth and
embroidery known in Arabia, and skilful workmen in gold and silver.
In religion, most are of the Carmathian or Free-thinking school, though
outward conformity to Islam is exacted by the Wahhabee govern
ment.     The whole of the province, its basalt rocks, its hot springs, its
not unfrequent earthquakes, bear witness to volcanic agency.
     I have forgotten to say, that in language, the Arabic now spoken
among all classes, high or low, in the towns and villages of Shomer,
Kaseem, and Upper Nejed, that            as far as Eiad,
                                          is,            is the Arabic of the
Koran, without change or corruption, with all the grammatical rules,
inflexions, vowel terminations, and observed in common talk no less
minutely than in books or mosque sermons.             But in Southern Nejed
and Hasa the dialect changes somewhat, and           less exact.
                                                    is             The poetry
is  the same as that of old times in metre, arrangement of rhymes,
 and choice of subjects     only in Hasa and Oman this
                             ;                                isexchanged for
 what the people call Nabtee or Nabathajan, where the rhymes are
alternate, and the metre         regulated, not by quantity but
                                 is                                     by
                                                                       accent.
I   met with plenty of manuscripts in the different houses, some treating
of religion, others of history, geography, medicine, poetry, grammar,
 &c., but none of ancient date       nor do any lapidary inscriptions exist
                                      ;
throughout Central Arabia, great deficiency. Medical science
                                  a                                       very

 low, mathematics unknown.
     3. Time will not permit me to say anything about Bahreyn and the
coasts and islands of the Persian Gulf or about Oman, that most ancient
and yet powerful kingdom, whose population, exclusive of its African
possessions, amounts to about 2,300,000, its military force to 90,000, and
 the annual income of its government to above        1,000,0002. sterling (the
revenues of Nejed are about one-tenth of that sum).           Suffice   to say
                                                                        it
that in land and climate — from the lofty heights of Djebel Akhdar, more
 than six thousand feet above the sea-level, where grow the vine, whose
juice the Biadee inhabitants have the good sense to enjoy, the oak, the
 plane, and other trees and plants of European vegetation, down to the
 warm plains of Batinah, where the cocoanut, the betel-palm, the mango,
 papay, sugar-cane, and the like, might make one suppose oneself         India
                                                                         in
 — Oman offers the greatest variety and fertility of any part of Arabia.          I
 should have wished, too, to say something of its government, based on
 local and municipal institutions, and the nearest approach that         Ihave
 seen in the East to   aconstitutional form of rules — of its industrious and
 clever population — of its women, whose unveiled beauty           isrenowned
 throughout Arabia — of its religion,      singular mixture of old Sabaeism,
                                                a
 later Persianism, and Carmathian free-thinking — of the hospitable and
 social customs of land where the stranger sooner than anywhere else
                   a
 finds himself not only      guest but
                             a               member of the family — of the
                                                a
 variety  which  distinguishes   its dialect,  and recalls the oldest known
 forms of the Arab language -of its nobles, the Yuaribah, whose ances
 tral parent, say they, dates from near four thousand years — of its sultan.

                       Friday, February    24, 1865.
 SIR HENRY HOLLAND, Bart. M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. Vice-President,             in
                                the Chair.
                   JOHN    EVANS,  F.R.S. F.S.A. &c.
                     On   the Forgery of Antiquities.
 MR. EVANS commenced his discourse by observing that there was no
maxim of political economy more generally accepted, than that wilh
articles of which the production was unlimited, the supply would
always be equal to the demand ; while where the supply is limited, an
increased demand would always be met by adulterations or imitations
of the genuine article, or by something that might be substituted for
it. The forgery of antiquities was therefore to be regarded as the
inevitable consequence of the high prices paid for them, as it was far
easier and more profitable to produce and sell counterfeit antiques
than to set to work and dig up or procure in a legitimate manner the
genuine articles.
     He begged it to be understood that he did not appear in the
character of one who was beyond the reach of all imposition, for
having more than once been a victim to the forger, he had a fellow
feeling for his companions in misfortune.
     He explained that though the words counterfeits and forgeries are
usually regarded as synonymous, there was, strictly speaking, a slight
difference  between them : counterfeits, contra-facta, being made to
imitate genuine originals ; forgeries, fabricata, though professing to

be genuine, not being of necessity imitations, but frequently embodying
new conceptions.
      Counterfeits     and forgeries abound in every department of
Archaeology — manuscripts, inscriptions, gems, pottery, enamels, glass,
ivories, coins, weapons, ornaments, and implements in all metals, and
even in stone, have all been fraudulently imitated.
      Literary forgeries did not strictly come within the limits of the
discourse, though the names of Chatterton and Ireland were familiar to
all, and possibly some might have heard of emendations of Shakspeare,
and Greek manuscripts, as having been subjects of discussion within the
last few years.      The forgery of inscriptions dates back to a very early
period, having commenced soon after the revival of letters at the close
of the fifteenth century. Among others might be cited that " found "
 at Viterbo, inscribed by Tarquinius to his dearest wife Lucretia, and
 that said to have been found on the banks of the Rubicon, embodying
 the decree of the Roman senate against Caesar's crossing that river.
 Of late years, owing to the greater means of comparison at command,
 and the better knowledge of palaeography, such forgeries have rarely
 been attempted, though without reckoning the Book of Mormon, a
 few cases have occurred in America.          Fictitious inscriptions are oc
 casionally scratched upon ancient pottery, and at the present time
 genuine Roman tiles are exposed for sale in London, with imitations
 of the impressions of stamps upon them.
       Nearly allied to the forgery of inscriptions is that of antique gems,
 which is carried on to a great extent in Italy.       An instance recorded
  by Mr. King was cited, in which an ancient female bust upon an agate
  had been converted into a Madonna by the addition of a nimbus, and
  an entirely modern head of the Saviour had been added upon the other
  side of the stone.     Another instance had been mentioned by Mr. Syer
  Cuming, of the making of six large soarabsei of amethyst, together with
  the necklace of the Egyptian king Menes, by an artificer near Drury
  Lane in 1837.       The sepulchral figures of glazed ware, so common in
   Egyptian interments, are said to be made in this country in large
  quantities, and exported to Egypt, to be there dug up in the presence
   of unwary travellers.
       Of the frauds in connection with Greek and Etruscan vases, the
   most venial is that of mere restoration and repainting ; but there are
   other processes by which plain vases of black or red ware are, by
   scraping or painting, ornamented with figures and inscriptions ; but the
   style of drawing and the unevenness of the surface ought to be sufficient
   to place purchasers upon their guard. In addition to these metamorphic
   processes, there have been regular manufactories of fictitious vases
   both at Vienna and Corfu.       These forgeries are usually heavier than
   the genuine   specimens.
        Forgeries   of Roman lamps and terra-cottas       are   very common,
   and   not easy of detection in the simpler forms.         Many successful
    counterfeits were produced a few years ago, by an      Italian residing in
    London.

     In Mexico, forgery of this kind has been carried on to a great
 extent, for the Indians still make their unglazed pottery in the same
 manner as they did before the conquest by Spain ; so that when they
imitate the real antiques, it is impossible to detect the fraud, though
 they frequently betray themselves     by the details showing traces of
 European influence.
     Imitations of Majolica and Raffaelle ware have been manufactured
 in abundance, and even the iridescent lustre of the Gubbio ware is
 counterfeited ; nor is this surprising when vases have sold for 200/.,
 and 120/. has been given for a single Faenza plate.
     Dresden and Sevres china are counterfeited in the most barefaced
 manner, and probably more than half of that now exposed for sale in
London is fictitious.   The false Dresden china has generally a whiter
ground than the true, which has usually a tint of blue, and the
 forged mark is generally painted over the glaze instead of under it.
 The frauds with regard to Sevres are often more complicated. In
 many instances, the whole of the pattern and glaze has been removed
 from the more common ware, and a fresh ground of turquoise or some
 of the Royal colours substituted together with fresh medallions or
 devices.   This fraud is difficult of detection, but there is often a
 mottled look about the surface, and occasionally the forms present
anachronisms.      Mr. Marryatt records an instance of a dejeuner
 service offered to Louis XVIII. as having belonged to his grand
father Louis XV., the principal plateau of which was of a form
 not introduced until 1788, or fifteen years after the death of the re
puted owner of the service.
     The forgery of Palissy ware has also been conducted on a large
scale, and whole collections are frequently palmed off on country
collectors as having been formed by some deceased maiden lady,
whose representatives are not connoisseurs in china.
     Enamels also have been frequently counterfeited, and Mr. Franks
has observed     that the Manchester Exhibition of 1861 contained
specimens imitating nearly all the different varieties of enamel work.
In France, the forgery of some Limoges enamels, bought by the
Rothschild family, was traced home, and the fabricator punished by a
fine of 1000 francs and imprisonment for fifteen months.
     Even glass has not escaped, and the beautiful vessels found in the
tombs of Thebes have been successfully imitated ; and Roman and
Greek glass has been counterfeited even to the beautiful iridescence
caused by the decomposition of the ancient glass, which is imitated by
sticking upon the surface of the modern vessel, scales detached from
fragments of really ancient glass.
     In ivories, Mr. Franks recognizes two distinct schools of fabrica
tion, one in the S.E. of France, which adopts the Gothic style, the
other in the neighbourhood of the Rhine, which prefers to imitate
Roman or Romanesque carvings. There has been an instance where
several hundred pounds have been paid for one of these productions.
    The practice of forging ancient coins was very early adopted, and in

   1865.]                on tlit Forgery of Antiquities.                    359
   the sixteenth century, we find Agostini devoting one of his Dialogues
   on Medals to this subject, since which time many numismatic writers
   have treated of it at greater or less length.
       Counterfeit coins may generally be classed under the following
   heads: —
                   1. Ancient forgeries.
                   2. Counterfeits .struck from modern dies.
                   3. Cast coins.
                   4. Altered coins.
       With the first class Mr. Evans was not concerned, for though the
  coins, as money, were counterfeits, yet, as antiquities, they were genuine.
  As to the others he entered into some detail, as they illustrated the
  frauds practised with regard to other objects in metal.
      The counterfeits struck from modern dies are of two kinds — those
  which are forgeries pure and simple, and of which no ancient originals
  ever existed ; and those which are counterfeits in imitation of genuine
  coins.   Of the former were cited as instances, the coins of Priam, with
  a view of Troy on the reverse ; of Dido, with the view of Carthage ;
  of Hannibal, with the Latin title of Dux Poenorum ; of Julius Caesar,
  with VENI, VIDI, vici ; and of Augustus, with FESTINA LENTE.            Such
  pieces carry with them their own condemnation.       Other imaginary coins
  were fairly in accordance with what the genuine coins would probably
  have been had such ever existed.     Specimens were exhibited purporting
 to be coins of Francis and Mary Queen of Scots, of Henry and Mary,
 of Lady Jane Grey as Queen, and of Richard Cosur de Lion, of whom
 no genuine English coins are known.        Of the two coins of Richard I.,
 one had been struck probably at the close of the last century, the
 other from dies engraved by Mr. Evans himself, some twenty years
 ago. Neither could for a moment impose on an experienced eye, nor
 could they be compared with the works of the renowned Paduan
 forgers, Victor Gainbello, Giovanni del Cavino (known as the Paduan),
 Alessandro Bassiano, and others who flourished in the sixteenth century,
and whose forgeries, even as such, are held in some estimation. Even
 Benvenuto Cellini produced imitations of ancient coins.        In later times
the most celebrated counterfeiter was the German, Becker,who engraved
dies for upwards of 300 varieties of coins, principally Greek and
 Roman.     Fortunately there are lists published of all his dies, and im
pressions from them in lead are preserved in most of the principal
museums, so that his works can always be identified.          False coins can
often be detected by the forms of the letters and other minutiae, as well
as by the appearance of the metal and of the edge.        The weight is also
sometimes a guide.      They are occasionally struck upon genuine coins
of little value, in which case there are sometimes traces left of the
original impression. An instance was given of a false crown piece
of Elizabeth, on which, owing to different degrees of oxydization between
the parts that had been more or less compressed, the names and titles
of William    III.  had appeared in a brown tint on the surface.
                                                                2c2

     On silver it is difficult to obtain the peculiar bloom of antiquity,
and   various chemical means have been resorted to, such as treating
with acids, browning with sulphur, or burying the coins in certain com
pounds.     Becker used to place his coins in a box full of iron-filings,
attached to the springs of his carriage, and, as he expressed               " took        it,
his old gentlemen         drive," until their surface became dulled
                                a                                               the             by
constant shaking among the filings.
     In copper or brass         easier to give an appearance of antiquity by
                                    it   is
chemical means, and varnish of different colours has been used to
imitate the brilliant coating of brown, chocolate, or various shades of
green, communicated to coins by              long sojourn in certain soils, and
                                                      a
which    isknown   as the patina.
     False coins, cast in moulds, are extremely abundant in silver and
copper, but occur also in gold. One of this class                   engraved     as
                                                                                 is
genuine   in  the   Monumenta
                       '
                                  Historica    Britannica.'    It purports   to  be
an ancient British coin, and the obverse having been moulded from
one variety and the reverse from another,                 totally new type has
                                                                        a
resulted from their union. The surface of cast coins usually presents a
rather granulated appearance, and there               want of sharpness in the
                                                               is   a
details, which are in consequence            sometimes    touched   up with the
graver. The joint of the mould            also often to be traced.
                                                     is
     In altered coins, new types are sometimes produced by the erasure
of certain letters, or parts of the device, or even                         by
                                                              the substitution by
skilful engraving of the head and titles of one emperor for another.
In other cases the obverse of one coin joined to the reverse or obverse
                                                          is
of another, so as to produce new and apparently unique varieties. As
the joint     carefully concealed

face of the coin      usually
                           is  left  intact,  this   one of the most successful

forms of fraud.
     Another form of deception, with regard both to coins and antiques,
is the assigning of fictitious places of finding to them. Wherever earth
works are going on in London, and these objects are inquired after,
there they are sure to be produced found not on the spot, as asserted,
                                                      ;
but among the refuse of some curiosity shop in the neighbourhood.
Genuine and false coins, Greek and Roman, foreign and English, of
all dates, are frequently produced as the result of digging the founda
tion for  a  City warehouse              !
     This system of fictitious finding— one in which the words invention
and finding are strictly synonymous — has been of late most successfully
practised.      It has been exposed by Mr. Franks, Mr. Syer Cuming,
Mr. Gunston, Mr. Charles Reed, and others; and moreover, once led
to an action for libel, brought by            dealer in antiquities
                                                      a                gainst the     a

imposed upon, and had purchased            large number of remarkable objects
                                                     a
in lead or pewter, that were said to have been found in the formation
of new dock at Shadwell.
     a                              Many of these were supposed to be Pil
grims' signs, and all were supposed to be connected with some religious
proceedings.      There were monarchs, knights, archbishops, bishops, and

I860.]               on the   Forgery of Antiquities.                   361
priests ; incense-cups, reliquaries, vessels of all forms, and numerous
plaques and large medallions, with loops for suspension.          Their very
number and variety afforded some argument against their being re
garded as forgeries, as it was urged that no single forger could have
such fertility of invention as was exhibited by this series of articles,
and that therefore, though exceptional, they were genuine. Unfortu
nately for such an hypothesis, Mr. Reed had procured some of the
plaster moulds in which they were cast, one of which was exhibited.
There was also a figure upon a bull, which the forgers had been
entrapped into copying from a drawing which was exhibited by its
side. The figure of a bishop was also shown, which had been made in
the course of twelve hours, in consequence          of Mr. Gunston making
 inquiry after a certain figure, of which he left a sketch in the hands of
a workman.         The sketch was that of a statue of a bishop, at Roches
 ter, and the name of FABRICATVS was placed on its pedestal
 in the drawing, and duly re-appeared on the ancient-looking leaden
 figure.
        The manufacture of these objects is still carried on, and numbers
 are sold both in London and in the country.         They usually bear some
  unintelligible inscription upon     them,  and  frequently a date ranging
  from 1000 to 1200, and given in Arabic numerals!            A considerable
  number of these forgeries was exhibited, and also some in cock metal,
  a mixture of copper and lead, which had lately been introduced to imi
  tate bronze, as objects in lead were now held in suspicion.          There
  were daggers, spearheads, celts, tazzas, keys, rings, and medallions, all
  very carefully cast.    Some which are moulded from genuine originals
  are difficult of detection so long as they retain the coating of river
   mud with which they have been daubed;            but when washed, their
   modern character is revealed, even to the tooth-marks of the vice in
   which they have been held to be filed up.
        Allusion was next made to the manufacture of forged antiquities in
   Suffolk, where several ancient British coins, and even the silver seal of
   the British Prince Cunobeline, had been produced.         A silver brooch,
   bearing the names of four Anglo-Saxon bishops, and a silver chain of
   the time of the Georges, but bearing the name Cardinal Wolsey upon
  it,   were among the productions of the same artists.
         Of other forgeries in metal, armour of all kinds, rings and seals
    were considered to be the mediaeval antiquities most frequently coun
    terfeited
          ;    of Roman and Greek, statuettes, bronze vessels of various
    forms, and various personal ornaments have been favourite subjects.
         Mr. Evans next came to modern fabrications in stone, among
    which also seals claim
                         a    place.   Specimens were exhibited of counter
    feit jet seals and rings.     The former are usually founded upon a
    genuine seal of Osbert de Hilton, preserved   in   the Whitby Museum,
    but occasionally claim to be the seals of Roman emperors or Kiijlish
     tings. Two of those exhibited, belonging to Mr. Sharp, had been
    carved in cannel coal,    by   a notorious forger of flint weapons, one
     Edward Simpson, or " Flint Jack," and the tool with which they had

                                  Mr.  J. Evant                    [Feb. 24,
  been   executed,    an  old knife ground to a point, was placed beside
  them.
       The objects in stone, however, that are most frequently counter
  feited, are the relics of the so-called Stone Period — of these, numerous
  specimens were exhibited ; among them, two large perforated axes,
  purchased in Suffolk — one made of soft sandstone, and much better
 adapted for being cut than for cutting — the other also of sandstone,
  but disguised with a coating of coloured varnish, to make it resemble
  some kind of greenstone.       Some celts and perforated axes of granite
 and greenstone were also shown, but neither the forms, nor the charac
  ter of the surface of the stones, were in accordance with their pretended
 antiquity.     It was mentioned that genuine stone celts with their edges
  broken are occasionally re-ground, in order to make them more valu
 able, as being perfect specimens.
      It is in flint that forgery has been most rife. Eight or ten years
 ago there was a manufactory of stone hammer-heads, ancient British
 urns, and flint weapons of all descriptions on the eastern coast of
 Yorkshire, principally carried on by one William Smith, alias Skin
 and Grief or Snake Willy.           Not only arrowheads and celts of all
 sizes, but rings, knives, saws, and even fish-hooks of flint were pro
 duced, some of which have been engraved as genuine in local Archaeo
 logical publications.      Since then, the manufacture has spread south
 wards, and many of the forgerie s exhibited came out of Suffolk. They
 have also been produced in Kent, and recently, the most accomplished
 of the forgers, the Edward Simpson or Flint Jack before mentioned,
 has made more than one public exhibition of his skill in flint-working
 in London.       The fabrication of stone antiquities is carried on, but on
 a smaller scale, in the North of Ireland.       There is usually a greater
 difference in the convexity of the two faces of the forged flint arrow
 heads than in the genuine examples ; and in nearly all the forgeries, a
 dullness of surface characteristic of recent fracture.
      On the Continent, forgery has been practised in connection with
 the Lake-dwellings of Switzerland, both with regard to objects in stone
 and in bone. Even the antiquities found in the cave deposits of France
 have not entirely escaped.         Ancient stone implements have been
 socketed into ancient bones so as to give them handles, and the result
 has been modern forgeries composed of genuine antiques.            Designs,
 and even inscriptions, have also been carved on genuine ancient bones,
in such a manner as would almost defy detection, but for the character
of the drawings and supposed letters.       In such cases the best advice to
collectors is that given to the public by the Bank of England with
regard to their notes — Look not only at the note itself, but also at
those from whom you receive it.
      Even amongst the most ancient relics of human workmanship with
which we are acquainted — the flint implements found in the old gravel
deposits of river valleys both in England and France, the forger has
been at work ; and Icklingham in Suffolk, and Amiens and Abbeville
in France, have each produced their own schools of counterfeiters.

Public attention had been called to these forgeries a year and a half
ago, by a cause c&ibre, when the fossil human jaw of Moulin-Quignon
was placed on trial before a mixed jury of its own countrymen and of
Englishmen, and a verdict returned in which Mr. Evans had been un
able to concur.     He was not, however, going to re-open that question,
and would only observe that while formerly, when the gravel pit of
Moulin-Quignon was worked, fossil bones were of excessively rare
occurrence in it ; now that little or no gravel is dug, human bones have
cropped out like mushrooms on its banks, and even a whole human
skull has made its appearance.
     The forged flint implements from Amiens are usually of the long
spear-head   type ; those from Abbeville are generally flatter, with a
cutting edge all round, and ovato-lanceolate in form ; those from Ick-
lingham are usually sharply pointed, flat on one face and convex on the
other. Of course there are varieties of form, but at all these places
they are usually produced for sale enveloped in some clayey matrix,
so as to conceal the character of their surface, unless some portion of
an ancient surface of flint has been left in chipping them out, in which
case the old surface is sometimes wiped clean and the new left covered
with mud. It is only after a thorough washing that they appear in
their true colours.
     The characteristics of age and of novelty were next discussed, but
it was observed that though flint implements, which present one or
more of the characteristics of antiquity, cannot be of modern manufac
ture, yet it is by no means so certain that some which retain the
characteristics of novelty may not be really ancient.      It is known that
a fractured flint may preserve its surface unaltered for ages if em
bedded in chalk, while, if exposed on the surface or embedded in
certain soils, a few centuries may serve to change the colour and tex
ture of its surface.    In some of the French caves explored by Messrs.
Lartet and Christy, certain flint implements come out as fresh-looking
as if made yesterday ; while others, possibly of a different quality of
flint, have their surfaces much altered. Both the character of the flint
and the circumstances under which it had lain were to be taken into
account in judging of the antiquity of a flint implement ; but though
certain characteristics may prove that it is not of recent manufacture,
it is in the highest degree unsafe to estimate its antiquity merely by
the condition of its surface.
     There is generally something in the form of the recent forgeries
which strikes the practised eye ; the method of chipping is different,
the angles between the different facets sharper, and the edge also
sharper, than is usual with genuine specimens.        The surface is com
monly   dull and   lustreless,  and if a portion be chipped  off, there is no
perceptible difference between the recent fracture and the rest of the
surface. These remarks were intended to apply more particularly to
the common forgeries practised by ordinary workmen.
     The principal characteristics of antiquity, more especially of the

 364                             Mr.  J.  Beant                       [Feb. 24,
flint implements from the river gravel deposits, may be summed up
under the following heads : —
      1. Calcareous incrustations on the surface, caused by the passage
of water charged with carbonate of lime over the flints.
     2. Dendritic markings, or the small moss-like marks on the sur
face caused by the peculiar crystallization of a combination of
manganese.
     3. Marks of wear, caused by the implements having been trans
ported with the other stones forming the gravel along the bed of the
ancient river.     None of these three characteristics have been imitated
by any ordinary forger, though portions of old surfaces with these
marks upon them occur on forged implements.
     4. Glossiness of surface, sometimes caused by friction, and some
times probably arising from a partial dissolution of the surface of the
flint.   There have been attempts made to give this gloss by friction
to recent counterfeits;       but the lustre is generally such as can be
removed by washing.
     5. Discoloration of surface.        This is one of the best tests of
antiquity,   as  the  character  of  the  surface of the flint is completely
altered, sometimes to a considerable depth, and instead of retaining
its original colour, becomes white, grey, brown, or ochreous, according
to different circumstances, often acquiring at the same time consi
derable lustre.      It is only at Abbeville that attempts have been
made to colour the surface of counterfeit implements, which was done
by smearing them with ochreous clay, or with the beautiful dark
                               "
pigment of the renowned black band," according to the position in
which they were destined to be found.           After washing, however, the
Moulin-Quignon       specimens show a recently fractured surface, and on
some are particles of iron, derived from the hammer with which they
had been chipped out, and in a still unoxydized condition, notwithstand
ing the ages during which they were supposed to have been inhumed.
     " But," continued Mr. Evans, " enough has been said of these
miserable attempts at fraud.        We have taken a glance at nearly every
department     of  antiquity,  and  in each and all we find that wherever
there has been a demand for any particular class of objects, it has
more or less been met by a supply of forgeries.          I am afraid that what
I  have said will hardly be regarded as encouraging to collectors, and
that it may be thought calculated to throw distrust on all arguments
based solely on archaeological evidence.
     " The case, however, is not so bad as it appears. Great as may
be the forger's skill, I do not believe there is one forgery in a thousand
that eventually escapes detection.          With those long versed in any
particular branch of archaeology, there is a sort of intuitive perception
which enables them almost at a glance to distinguish between the true
and the false.     And even with those less versed, a little exercise of
common sense and careful observation and comparison will suffice to
prevent any grievous error.       It is surprising, also, how the once having

been taken in tends to sharpen the observation ; and in this respect it
is possible that the existence of forgeries may not be altogether an un
mixed evil.    Habits of caution and of careful investigation are cheaply
purchased, if acquired for a small sum of money invested in worthless
forgeries.
    " There       is,
                  indeed, no reason for the collector or antiquary to
despair  ; far less reason   there to doubt the value of well-sifted
                                       is
archaeological evidence.
     " We do not doubt the existence of genuine coins of Julius Caesar
or of Alexander the Great, because there are numerous counterfeits of
them;    much less do we doubt of the former existence of these mo
narch*.      And yet     believe there are some who, because the flint
                          I
implements from the ancient fluviatile beds have been counterfeited,
persuade themselves into believing them all to be forgeries          in the
                                                                         ;
same manner as some others persuade themselves that because there
are natural forms of flint which in     measure resemble the implements
                                                 a
from the drift, therefore they all are natural, and not artificial.
     " The existence of these forgeries, however, affords
                                                                 moderately
                                                                     a
complete answer to the latter class of doubters, for the counterfeits of
the genuine implements which have imposed upon so many are all
artificially chipped out, and have been of necessity thus made in order
to resemble the originals, which must therefore be regarded as arti
ficial also.
     " The other class of doubters will do well to bear in mind that the
existence of     counterfeit generally implies the existence of
                  a                                                 genuine

original, and that the frauds which have been attempted would never
have been discovered, had not those who detected them had sufficient
experience of genuine specimens on which to found their judgment.
They must also remember, that the exposers of these frauds are pre
cisely those who, having most fully investigated the circumstances,
are most fully convinced of the value of those discoveries of relics
of primaeval man in beds of immense antiquity, of which such interest
ing accounts have, on former occasions, been given in this room                    by
Mr. Prestwich           and   Mr. Lubbock.

                             JAMES   FERGUSSON,      Esq.     F.R.S.
                On the Holy Sepulchre and the Temple              of Jerusalem.
The object of this discourse was to show that the building in the sacre '
                                                                         "
enclosure at Jerusalem called by Europeans the " mosque of Omar
                             " Dome of the Rock "), and supposed by
(but by Mussulmans the
some to have been built by Omar over the site of the altar of the
Jewish temple, is really the " church of the Anastasis, or Resurrec
tion," built by Constantine over the rock which he believed to contain
the sepulchre of Christ.
     The speaker commenced by briefly recapitulating the arguments in
his former discourse, on February 21, 1862, on the same subject. On
that occasion he had argued the Christian and Constantinian origin of
the " Dome of the Rock," mainly from the architecture of that building.
No refutation of his arguments having been put forward, and his own
recent visit to the spot having destroyed the force of the taunt fre
quently levelled at him, that he had not been to Jerusalem, while it
had confirmed him in his former views, he took this opportunity of re-
enforcing them.     This he did by the reverse process of argument to
that formerly employed —viz. by describing the dimensions of the suc
cessive temples of the Jews.    " If," said the speaker, " can convince  I
you that the rock which is situated in the centre of the building popu
                                        '

outside the temple area, you will be forced to admit that         was not      it
built     the Moslems — the only reason ever advanced for assigning the
           by
building of to them being, that on that rock stood the Holy of Holies,
                    it
or the altar of the Jews.            If
                                   was not built by the Moslems,
                                          it                           was          it
by the Christians    and ;      if
                            by them,      can be no other than the church
                                               it
which Constantine erected over what he believed to be the cave in
which the body of our Lord was laid. The architecture          of his age,is
and neither he nor any other Christian ever built church in Jerusalem,
                                                                  a
the whole floor of which was occupied by        great rock with
                                                          a        cave in      a
it,  but that which Eusebius describes as the one erected by that
emperor."
     The heads of the argument in the former discourse were recounted
as follows —    :
      1.The situation of the present so-called church of the Holy
Sepulchre      the middle of the town,
                 in                         locality so much at variance
                                                  a

1865.]         on the   Holy Sepulchre and     the Temple           of Jerusalem.      367
with the recorded incidents of the passion, that many pious and learned
men had denied that it could possibly contain the tomb of the Saviour,
notwithstanding the traditions clinging to                    it,
                                                 and though unable to
suggest any alternative.
    2. The fact that the mosque of Omar, so called, was not a mosque,
because   had no kibleh
          it              but, on the contrary, its principal entrance
                             ;
was towards Mecca, where the kibleh ought to be       and that though;
 architecturally    atomb in all essential elements, there was no tradition
 of anyone having been buried in         it
                                          ;  and     was so splendid
                                                          it            monu       a
 ment, and of so recent     adate, that  it was difficult to believe that the
 tradition had been so completely lost.
     3. The solution of the mystery           by
                                              the discovery that its architec
 ture was of the age of Constantine, which, combined with the form of
the building, the rock and the cave, and all the circumstances of the
case, led irresistibly to the conclusion that      could be nothing else than
                                                         it
the church which Constantine erected over what he believed to be the
Holy Sepulchre.
     4. The architectural evidence — less appreciable though not less
certain than    ifthe building had been Gothic instead of Byzantine of
the fourth century.
     5. The certainty that the " golden gateway " was a festal portal of
the same age as the Dome of the Rock, exactly answering to the gate
way leading to the Altar of Constantine's Basilica, as described by
Eusebius, while the Mosque El-Aksah was             Saracenic building of the
                                                          a
end of the seventh century, more modern in style, that they must
be several centuries earlier.
     6. The confirmation afforded by the historical argument to the
conclusions arrived at from the architectural evidence.
     7.  The accordance of the locality (if the Dome of the Rock were
the Holy Sepulchre) with the Scripture narrative, instead of being
irreconcilable therewith as the localities pointed to in Jerusalem
were.
     The speaker then spoke briefly of his personal experience at
Jerusalem.      He had noticed no material points of which he had not
been previously aware from the plans and drawings of Catherwood,
Arundale, the numerous photographs, and the fine engravings of De
Vogue.     The extreme beauty of the interior of the building had, how
ever, much surprised him.        He was familiar with the Taj Mahal and
the other great imperial tombs of Agra and Delhi, and most of the
tombs and tomb-like buildings in other countries.          But they were all
                                                                              •
surpassed       the Dome of the Rock, which perfectly realized the instruc-
               by
tions of its imperial builder      the elegance of its proportions and the
                                     ;
appropriateness of its detail, which does not exist to the same extent in
any other building, combined with the mystery of the Great Rock,
which occupies the whole floor of the sanctuary, make up whole, un            a
rivalled in the world.     "    If
                                 the Mohammedans ever did anything as
beautiful in any age or any country, the memory of          has passed away.
                                                                    it
If  ever they built anything resembling         the record of
                                                   it,             gone."it   is

368                        Mr. James Fergusson                   [March   3,
     He could not trace in the architecture of the Dome of the Rock a
vestige of the style of Justinian's age or of anything that followed it.
It  seemed worthily to represent the last dying effort of the gorgeous
but formal style of Pagan Rome — the first living effort of that freedom
and grace which afterwards culminated in the Christian cathedrals of
the West.
     The speaker    then alluded to the cross shown by De Vogue on the
abacus   of one of  the capitals of the pillars of the building, and to the
block or dossert which the Christian architects, between the ages of
Constantine and Justinian, used, instead of the architrave of the
Romans, in their efforts to get rid of the inconvenient entablature, and
which they universally adorned with the Christian monogram of the
labarum.     The crosses, except in the one case, he had failed to find —
all had been either chiselled off or plastered over : while the dossrrts
were all cased in marble, and therefore the labarum (if there) was
 hidden.
     As to the Cufic inscription round the interior of the Dome, which
 states the date of the building as 72 Hejra, or a.d. 691, and the name
 of the builder as El Mamoun (a.d. 813-833), it is obvious that
 either the name or date has been altered and falsified, and consequently
 no argument can be based upon it. But it is remarkable that the rest
 of the inscription refers to " Jesus the son of Maria," and to Him
 only, and that His name is mentioned four times over in it.        Not one
 word about David, or Solomon, or Mahomet, the site of the temple,
 or the altar of the Jews.      If it was not known that Christ was buried
 there, why take such pains to proclaim His mission on the walls ?
      In proceeding to the immediate object of the present discourse—
 the description of the dimensions of the temple — Mr. Fergusson com
 menced with the tabernacle, which was the model for Solomon's
 temple. He showed that the apparent anomalies in the dimensions
 given in Exodus, which had hitherto so sorely encumbered restorers of
 the tabernacle, vanished directly it was assumed that the tabernacle
 had a " ridge."      " It was a tent ; and like every tent from before the
 time of Moses to the present day, it had a ridge.        When once this is
 suggested, the whole becomes clear.          Thus, every dimension of the
 tabernacle is a multiple of 5, except the curtains, which are 14,
 because they were measured along the slope.          There were only four
 pillars in the interior, but five in the porch, as there must be if there
 was a ridge.     In fact, the moment you assume the ridge, which was in
 dispensable   as a protection against the weather, all the difficulties dis
 appear,  and   every part of the Bible description becomes intelligible.
      " When the tabernacle came to be superseded by a more perma
 nent structure, it was copied literally in plan and arrangement, with
 this marked distinction, that in the edifice of the temple every dimen
 sion of the tabernacle was exactly doubled.            Thus, the Holy of
 Holies in the tabernacle was a cube of 10 cubits, in the temple of 20.
 The Holy place in the tabernacle was a double cube of 10, in the
 temple of 20 cubits. The porch of the tabernacle was 5 cubits by 10,

1865.]      on the  Holy Sepulchre and     the Temple  of Jerusalem.   369
of   the temple 10 by 20.        The verandah of the tabernacle was 5
cubits wide, the chambers that surrounded the temple measured 10.
But perhaps the most remarkable coincidence is that the angle of the
roof made the tabernacle 15 cubits in height, and consequently the
temple was raised by a false roof, or upper chamber, till its height
was 30 cubits."
     The dimensions of the court of Solomon's temple are not given
either in the Bible or Josephus ; but it may safely be inferred that, like
the edifice, they were double those of the tabernacle, and that the
court, therefore, measured 100 cubits by 200, or 150 ft. by 300 ft.
This is the more probable because the courts of Ezekiel's temple
were of that size.      In the edifice itself the only difference between
Ezekiel's  dimensions  and  those of Solomon arises from the introduction
of a range of chambers between the temple court and the north court.
The large dimensions of the external boundary of the sanctuary
in Ezekiel's account, which have so often puzzled restorers, were dis
missed as having no topographical existence ; but referring to the
division of the land alone, irrespective of the temple, and as represent
             "
ing merely one of those simple arithmetical ratios to which the Jews
were always partial in architectural matters."
     The temple of Zerubbabel followed the measurements of Solomon
and of Ezekiel, as appears by comparing the notices of Esdras, Josephus,
and Hecataeus of Abdera.
     So far the pre-Christian temples.      The temple of Herod is much
more important, because its foundations can still be traced out, and it
thus becomes the turning-point of all topographical inquiries at Jeru
salem.    The authorities for restoring it are Josephus and the book
Middoth in the Talmud.        The house itself was only repaired. It was
still standing, as rebuilt by Zerubbabel, when Herod took it in hand,
and its dimensions were not altered ; the only difference between it
and Solomon's being that it retained the passage between the external
chambers of Ezekiel, making the width 60 instead of 40 cubits. Two
wings were also added to the facade, each 20 cubits square, so that
the whole building measured 100 cubits long and 100 cubits wide. It is
evident that a building 100 cubits wide could not stand in a court
yard of the same dimensions, and allow a passage round it. We con
sequently find the breadth of the court increased to 135 cubits, or 202
feet 6 inches, and the length between the porticoes 187 cubits, or 280
feet, leaving 20 feet for the cloisters and the thickness of the walls.
The court was strongly fortified, having three gates on the north and
three on the south side, and one, the most magnificent of all, towards
the east.    What had been the outer court, or court of the Gentiles,
was cut in two, and appropriated to the women ; its breadth was also
135 cubits.    Its extent, east and west, can be fixed with very tolerable
accuracy by the protraction of the outer court.      It must have been, as
nearly as possible, 40 cubits, or 60 feet. The important and character
istic addition which Herod made was the great court of the Gentiles,
with its " royal porch," 600 feet long and 100 feet wide, supported

 370                        Mr. James Fergusson                          [March   3,
  by 162 Corinthian columns, which divided it into three aisles, of which
  the centre one was 100 feet high.             The court of the Gentiles sur
  rounded the whole of the other courts, and formed a square, as Josephus
  expressly states, of which the external measurement was one stadium,
  or 600 feet, on each side.
       Having obtained these general dimensions, the speaker next pro
  ceeded to apply them to the existing remains.           Here some remarkable
  coincidences disclosed themselves.
       All agree that the south-western angle of the Haram enclosure is
  one of the angles of the temple area.           For 600 feet eastwards from
  this angle along the south wall all is practically solid.         But at that
  point  a  range  of vaults is reached,   unequally spaced, badly  constructed,
  and not only of much more modern age, but too weak to have sup
  ported the temple. So far, therefore, did the temple extend ; and
 in this direction the history and the topography are agreed.
      Returning to the south-west angle, and measuring 600 feet north,
  we come to a second bridge or causeway.            Up to that point the great
 " bevilled "
                 masonry of Herod extends ; but there it ceases.         On this
 side, again, the history and topography are at one, and thus two sides
 of the quadrangle are obtained.               The other two, lying within
 the sacred enclosure,       have not yet been investigated.          The posi
 tion of the great rock-cut reservoir in front of the Aksah, the water
 courses, as far as they have been examined, all accord with the indica
 tions of Josephus and the Talmud.           Everything tends to show that the
temple     of  Herod   was, as  Josephus    tells us, 600 feet square, and was
 situated in the south-western angle of the present Haram area.
       The rock, therefore, which now stands under the Dome of the
Rock, was certainly outside the area of the temple, at a distance of
 150 feet from its northern wall.
      Before leaving this part of the subject, a few words were devoted
to showing that the supposition that the altar in the temple was placed
upon a rock, is unsupported by any evidence or implication of the
Bible, Josephus, or the Talmud ; and           is,    in fact,
                                                            a    mere Moham
medan tradition.
      The remainder of the discourse was devoted to an examination of
the post-Christian evidence.        By citations from the Bourdeaux Pilgrim
(a.d. 333), Gregory Nazianzen, Antoninus Martyr (560), and Euty-
chius (870), Mr. Fergusson urged that the position of the Temple
was well known, and the "beautiful gate" standing as late as the
end of the sixth century, and that the site of the Temple had been
intentionally left waste     by  the Christians, and turned into     a dunghill.
In this state of desolation and defilement    it     was found  by the Moham
medans when they conquered Jerusalem, in 636.               The Mohammedan
accounts are contained      in  the treatises of Jelal-ed-Deen and Mejr-ed-
Deen. They state that Omar obtained from the patriarch of Jeru
salem  a   gift of the site of the temple, on condition that Omar should
erect on   it          of
               one house    prayer, and no other, in the whole of Jerusalem,
Th.it the one mosque thus erected was the Aksah (built by Abd-el

1865.]        on the Holy Sepulchre and the Temple         of Jerusalem.     371
Malik in 691),     was shown by the testimony of Arculfus (a.d. 700),
who mentions the "square house of prayer recently built by the
Saracens, and capable of holding 3,000 persons." Arculf 's silence as
to any Mohammedan building answering to the Dome of the Rock is
also difficult to explain on any other supposition than that the Dome
of the Rock was a Christian building, and still used as such — in fact,
the building which he minutely describes as the Anastasis, or church
of the Resurrection.       Attention was drawn to the fact that, excluding
the building in question, all the early Mohammedan mosques are
clustered round the Aksah, and within the limits of the 600 feet
already given as the limit of the temple.           The speaker further said
that Sir Henry Rawlinson had allowed him access to his large
and valuable Arabic library, and that he had various works therein
contained, examined by a competent Arabic scholar, who had extracted
and translated all passages bearing on Jerusalem.             The result was,
that down to the time of Abd-el-Malik, and later, the limits of the
temple were well known to the Mohammedans, and that they neither
built, nor pretended to have built, the structure now called the
" Mosque of Omar."
     "If, then," concluded Mr. Fergusson, " the Dome of the Rock was not
built by the Saracens, it must have been built by the Christians ; there
is no third party to have done it.                         I
                                          In that case would ask, ' What
church did Constantine or any other Christian priest or monarch build
in Jerusalem over a great rock, with one cave in            but the church of
                                                           it,

                        '
                        ?   Till this question answered — and no attempt
                                                is

                                      or to supply its place with any reason
able suggestion — the arguments of my opponents halt.
     "As began, let me conclude. first took up the question on archi

difficulties, or the road without its ruts and roughnesses         ; but    I  do
assert that, so far as  I   can judge, an immense preponderance of evi
dence, from whatever point      it   isviewed,  is in favour of the conclusion
that the building at Jerusalem, known as the Dome of the Rock,              isthe
identical church which Constantine built over what he believed             to  be
the Sepulchre of Christ."

                 WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                          Friday, March    10, 1865.
      SIR RODERICK     I. Murchison, K.C.B. F.RS.         in the Chair.
                    PROFESSOR     A. C. Ramsay, F.R S.
         On the Eozoon and the Laurentian Rocks         of Canada.
MR. RAMSAY commenced by giving a brief account of the physical
structure of part of the interior of North America, which consists of
great plains and table-lands lying between the ranges of the Laurentian
mountains (which run from Labrador far westward along the north
shores of the St. Laurence and Ottawa), the mountains of Gaspe and
the Appalachian chain, and the gradual slopes of the Rocky moan-
tains in the far west.      The Geological Survey of Canada embraces
great tracts of the Laurentian mountains and of the mountains of
Gaspe, and all the flat country that lies south of the St. Lawrence,
the Ottawa, and Lake Huron, and in these territories a vast region
has been surveyed in a manner that may fairly be said not to have
been surpassed on any part of the North American continent.             This
survey was begun in the year 1842, and before its commencement
the Silurian    strata of the United States         having been generally
correlated to those of Europe, the precise relations of the strata of
Canada to both soon began to be established. Before that period very
little was known by geologists about the Laurentian rocks, except that
 they consisted of gneiss, granite, syenite, and so-called igneous masses,
 and the geological age of the series was undetermined.         Indeed, the
 gneiss of the mountains   north  of  the St. Lawrence,  and of the Appala
 chian chain, of Gaspt;, Newfoundland, and other districts were all more
 or less confounded together, and supposed, as gneiss, to be probably
 of the same or nearly of the same age.
     But in 1845 it was first proved by Sir William Logan that the
 Laurentian gneiss lies unconformibly under the Potsdam sandstone, a
 rock well known to be the equivalent of the Lingula flags of Britain,
                            "
 or the " Primordial zone     of Barrande, then and for long after supposed
 to contain in its lingulae and trilobites the earliest created forms of
 organic life.   This taken in connection with the discoveries of other
 American geologists, clearly proved the Laurentian gneiss to be of
 much earlier date than the greater part of the gneiss of the Green
 Mountains (a part of the Appalachian chain), and of Gaspe, &c.,
 for they were shown to be the metamorphosed              representatives of
 various members of the Silurian series, most of them younger than the
 Potsdam sandstone.

1865.]       on the Eozoon and the    Laurentian Rocks of Canada.         375
      This was followed by the discovery of the Huronian rocks, which
were proved also to be older than the Potsdam sandstone, but younger
than the Laurentian gneiss ; and not only so, but it was also shown that
the Huronian rocks, themselves metamorphic, were deposited after the
metamorphism of the Laurentian strata ; for they contain pebbles and
boulders of the latter in such a condition, that it is plain the metamor-
phisin of the masses from which they were derived took place long
before the commencement of the Huronian epoch.
      In 1863 a stratigraphical discovery, still more remarkable, was
made ; for it was proved that the Laurentian rocks themselves consist
of two series of altered strata, the uppermost of which lies in the
highest degree unconformably on the lower series ; and it was again
found that the Potsdam sandstone, quite unaltered, lies thoroughly
unconformably on the upper Laurentian gneiss.
      Besides total unconformity, there is a marked and constant dis
tinction in the nature of the gneiss of the two series, the lower being
Orthoclase-gneiss, containing potash-felspar, while the upper has been
called Anorthosite-gneiss, containing lime and soda-felspars, much of
which is true Labradorite ; and these differences being constant, there
is no difficulty in distinguishing the two series.
      Both series are exceedingly contorted, and have undergone an
amount of metamorphism that may almost be called extreme, unless
we adopt the view that granite and its allies are the result of an
amount of metamorphic action so excessive that the rocks have passed
beyond the stage in which foliation still remains.
      The Lower Laurentian being at present the oldest known stra
tified series, its base is unknown ; although as it contains in some
cases water-worn stratified pebbles, it is clear that its original unmeta-
morphosed        materials were derived from the waste of consolidated
stratified formations of far older date.       Neither are its topmost strata
known, for all the other strata with which it is in contact lie uncon-
                                    .....

great, as the following measured section of a portion of the strata will

     It  was in 1858 that fossils were found in the band of limestone
No.    2 ; and at first they were    considered by Sir Wm. Logan to
belong, probably, to the genus of corals known as Stromatopora,
but renewed examinations, first by Dr. Dawson, Principal of McGill
college, Montreal, and afterwards by Dr. Carpenter, establish that in
reality the fossils are Foraminifera, not detached like those of more
modern type, but that they lived and grew in a peculiar mode over wide
areas in the sea bottom, in a manner somewhat analogous to the mode
of growth of a bank of corals. The chambers (as shown in the
diagrams used) are unsymmetiical, and while growing spread irregularly,
and they are enclosed above and below by a layer having a finely
tubular structure similar to that of the shell of the nummulite and
other allied forms.      Between these layers the sarcode-body was
enclosed, and between the irregular chambers         there frequently lies
an inter-skeleton, penetrated by numerous branching tubes, and by an
occasional larger tube, called by Dr. Carpenter the Stolon.            The
chambers that contained the sarcode-body and the tubes now consist
of serpentine, and the inter-skeleton of carbonate of lime ; and on an
acid being applied the silicious casts of the tubes are found so arranged
that Dr. Dawson and Dr. Carpenter had no doubt as to the organic
nature of the specimens, which were examined by them with the
microscope most carefully.     Better authority it is impossible to have.
     Having visited the district with Sir Wm. Logan,       I  think  I may
safely say that the chief part of all the bands of limestone is so crystal
line (from metamorphic action) that it is hopeless to expect to find
fossils in them ; but that part of the band No. 2, in which they have
heretofore been observed, attains a thickness of about 200 feet, and
doubtless Eozoon or other traces of organic remains may yet be found
elsewhere. It is by a lucky accident, so to speak, in metamorphic
action, that they have been preserved where we now find them, and,
said the speaker, "   I for one firmly believe not only that all these
Laurentian deposits were of marine origin, but also that the original
matter of limestones of such vast thickness, and that once spread so
widely over that old sea bottom, must have been chiefly formed by the
growth and decay of organic bodies."
     Mr. Ramsay then showed the importance of these discoveries in
relation to geological time.
     First, he spoke of metamorphism having, according to the best
hypothesis, been produced by heated alkaline waters in rocks deeply
 buried beneath vast accumulations of strata, since removed               by
denudation.
      Before the commencement of the Silurian epoch such metamorphic
 actions had already taken place three times : first, in the lower
 Laurentian rocks ; secondly, in the upper Laurentian rocks ; and
thirdly, in the Huronian series, and each set of strata had evidently
 been subjected    to prodigious waste      and denudation, before the
 commencement of the formation that now succeeds it in the American
series.

  1865.]    on the Eozoon    and the Laurentian Rocks      of Canada.       377
      But secondly, geological time       is not to be measured merely by
  the  formations now existing, for the unconformities indicate gaps, or
  periods of time, stratigraphically unrepresented, which were probably
 far longer in duration than the time occupied in the deposition of the
  formations that remain.*
      Again, an instructive moral may be drawn from a consideration of
  the subject with regard to the style of reasoning that has often been
 too prevalent with respect to the discovery of the oldest zones of life
 of various kinds. For example, for many years no one doubted that
 the Lower Tertiary or Eocene beds contained the oldest relics of
 mammalian life, and a great outcry of disbelief was raised when they
 were discovered in the secondary rocks in the Stonesfield slate of the
 lower Oolite. Since then the Microlestes has been found in the New Red
 series, and there for the time it rests.     The same kind of astonishment
 prevailed, as reptile bones were successively discovered down through
 the Lias into the Trias, and from these into the Palaeozoic forma
 tions of Permian, Carboniferous, and Old Red Sandstone age.              And
 when we consider the history of the mollusca, as recorded by distin
guished geologists, the same hankering after finality has constantly
cropped out.       The " primary formations " it was said contained no
fossils, for they were formed before the creation of life began : till
late in last century Hutton dispelled the illusion by proving the
presence of fossil shells in so-called
                                           "                         For some
                                             primary clay-slates."
time the Llandeilo flags of Sir Roderick Murchison were regarded as
the oldest fossiliferous rocks, till on the discovery of the still older
lingula flags and their equivalents in Bohemia, they were fondly
named the primordial zone.          " Here at last is a
                                                           resting place : we
can hope for nothing older than the lingulae and trilobites of this great
                              '
original ' primordial zone ; but soon Mr. Salter found annelids, and as
 bethinks trilobites on a horizon lower still, and the beginning was again
 thrown farther back into time ; and no one dared to dream of traces
 of life yet older, being found in gneiss, for if they even ever existed
there, which is improbable, they must have been all obliterated by
metamorphic action. Suddenly Sir W. Logan makes a great leap,
thousands of fathoms deeper than any formation previously known to
contain the relics of life, and from the limestones there extracts the
Eozoon, from rocks so immeasurably older than the oldest Silurian
and Cambrian strata, that no power of imagination can feebly realize,
even in a geological sense, the great gaps that lie between them : and
though we may feebly attempt to estimate the latest lapses of geological
time, we can no more hope to fathom these Laurentian depths than we
can hope to measure the distance of the most unresolvable of the
unresolved nebulae, merely because we are able to estimate our distance
from the sun."

                  WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                           Friday, March   17, 1865.
Major-General, Edward Sabixe, R.A. Pres. R.S. Vice-President,
                                 in the Chair.
                      Balfour Stewart,      Esq.  F.R.S.
         On the latest Discoveries concerning the Sun's Surface.
It  is well known     that a distant body does not impress       the eye with
the idea of relief.
     Thus distant mountains do not stand out like      the nearer parts of a
landscape,  and   the  sun and  moon  appear only as flat discs.
     But although neither to direct nor telescopic vision do these
heavenly bodies appear spherical, yet it is possible to produce stereo
scopic impressions by combining together two pictures of these bodies
taken at different times.
     This has been done by Mr. Warren De la Rue with great success,
and this gentleman has produced numerous stereoscopic representations
of our satellite, in which the general sphericity as well as the unexunr*
of surface come well out. He has also produced a more limited
number of stereoscopic impressions of the sun ; but our knowledge of
the solar surface is only to a certain extent derived from these
impressions, while it is to a greater extent derived from the careful
study of ordinary sun pictures.
     The bounding luminous surface of the sun is termed his photosphere,
and our subject may be divided with reference to the surface into three
 parts : the first comprising the region above the photosphere ; the
second, the photosphere itself; and the third, the region beneath the
 photosphere.
     To commence with the region above the photosphere, it may be
 easily shown that this region contains a very dense atmosphere.
     In the first place, according to a well-known law the dark line* ia
 the solar spectrum denote the presence of certain substances in a state
 of vapour, and yet in a comparatively cold state, above the photosphere
 of the sun. These substances comprise among others sodium, mag-
 nesium, iron, and nickel.
     Again, the rim of the sun when viewed by the eye, but more
 conspicuously in photographs, appears less luminous than the central
 portions ; and this would also appear to indicate the presence of an
 absorbing atmosphere of lower temperature than the photosphere. m>
 that a ray of light from the border having to pass through a cm

1865.]      on the latest Discoveries concerning the Sun's Surface.          379
siderable thickness of this atmosphere would become diminished in
brightness.       (This was illustrated by a beautiful photograph taken by
Mr. De la Rue.)
      In   the third place, the red flames and part of the corona which
surround the sun during a total        eclipse, reveal to us the presence of an
extensive solar atmosphere.
      It appeared to the Astronomer Royal and some others as probable
that    these bodies belong to the sun ; but their connection with our
luminary was put beyond doubt by Mr. De la Rue, who by means of
the Kew heliograph was enabled to take photographic pictures of the
sun at the total eclipse which happened in Spain in July, 1860.
      (The photographs were exhibited ; and it was seen that as the moon
proceeded over the sun's disc, the red flames and part of the corona
discovered themselves at that side which she had left, and were covered
up by her disc at that side towards which she was approaching, thus
showing that they belong to the sun.)
      Another proof in favour of the idea that the red flames belong to
the sun is derived from the nature of the light which they emit.            This
 has great photographic power compared to its luminosity, so much so
 that one prominence was photographed by Mr. De la Rue, which was
 invisible to the naked eye.         Now such rays can, as far we know,
 belong only to intensely heated gas, and such gas can only belong to
 the sun.
       Next, with regard to the photosphere, or luminous envelope of the
 sun, this surface when viewed through powerful telescopes appears
 granulated or mottled. (Reference was here made to a diagram lent
 by the Rev. J. Howlett, and to a photograph by Mr. De la Rue.)              But
 besides this, there is reason to believe that great defining as well as
 magnifying power discloses the fact that the whole photosphere of the
 sun is made up of detached            bodies, interlacing one another and
  preserving    a  great  amount    of  regularity, both in form and size.
  Mr. Jas. Nasmyth was the first to proclaim this curious fact — he called
  these bodies willow leaves ; Mr. Stone has called them rice-grains ;
  Padre Secclii, coups de jnnceau.         (Some photographs from drawings
  lent by Mr. Nasmyth were then exhibited.)
       The faculae belong to this part of the subject : they are detached
  portions of the photosphere which are much brighter than the region
  around them ; but this difference in brightness is chiefly apparent near
  the sun's limb.     The reason of this is believed to be, that they are
   portions of the sun's photosphere thrown up into the higher regions of
   the atmosphere, by which means they are enabled to escape a great
   part of the absorbing effect of this atmosphere which is particularly
   strong near the border ; while near the centre the absorption is not
   great, so that they do not gain much by escaping it.
       The idea that faculae are elevated has been confirmed by a stereo
   scopic impression of a sun-spot and some faculae taken by Mr. De la
   Rue, in which the spot appears to be a hollow while the faculae
   m elevated ridges.
                                                                      lae appear
                                                                                 ^^"

 380           Mr. Balfour Stewart    on the  Sun's Surface.     [March   17,
     It should also be remarked, that faculae retain the same appearance
 often for a considerable time, sometimes even for days together, so that
 they are clearly not composed of heavy matter, but are rather of the
 nature of a cloud.
     The phenomena of the third region, or that beneath the photosphere,
 may be embraced in one word, "sun-spots."      These consist of an umbra,
 or central darkness, surrounded by a less dark penumbra. Mr. Dawes
 has discovered in some spots even a deeper darkness in the centre of
 the umbra.
     Now if that theory of spots   be correct which supposes that they are
 cavities of which the umbra      forms the bottom, while the penumbra
 constitutes the sloping sides,    then the umbra ought apparently to
 encroach on that side of the      penumbra which is nearest the visual
 centre of the disc.
    Prof. Alex. Wilson, of the University of Glasgow, was the first to
 remark that spots really behaved in this manner, and his observations
 have been abundantly confirmed by the Kew photographs.             (One of
these was exhibited.)
     It therefore follows, that the umbra of a spot is at a lower level
than the penumbra ; and since luminous ridges, and sometimes detached
portions of luminous matter, cross over spots, it must be concluded
that the whole phenomenon is below the surface.
     In the next place, spots are the means of exhibiting to us the
rotation of our luminary.      If  we turn to the south and view the sun
spots always cross the disc from east to west, that is to say from left
to right.    (The apparent path of a spot at different seasons was here
traced on a diagram, constructed and lent by Rev. F. Howlett ; and it
was remarked that when allowance is made for the inclination of the
earth's axis, the path is really the same at different seasons.)
     Besides the apparent motion due to rotation of the sun, spots have
also a proper motion of their own, which was discovered by Mr.
Carrington. This motion is also from left to right ; those near the solar
equator moving fastest.      Mr. Carrington also remarked that spots
confine themselves to the equatorial regions of the sun.
     Hofrath Schwabe, of Dessau, has remarked that spots have a
period of maximum and minimum nearly every ten years, and General
Sabine has found that the year of maximum sun-spots is at the same
time that of greatest disturbance of the earth's magnetism.
     Finally, the behaviour of sun-spots appears to some extent to be
influenced by the planet Venus, in such a manner that when a spot
comes round by rotation to the ecliptical neighbourhood of this planet,
it has a tendency to dissolve ; and on the other hand, as the sun's surface
recedes from this planet, it has a tendency to break out into spots.

       On  Art- Education, and    how   Works  of Art should   be viewed.
The    speaker felt that it would be expected of him to discourse on Art,
and    especially on that Art to which he had given many years' atten
tion. As, however, it would be impossible to condense, within the
short time allowed, any sufficient history of Sculpture, or a clear expo
sition of the various characteristics of the Art during the long period
of its ancient and modern practice, or to enter thoroughly upon merely
technical matter, as if he were addressing Art-students, he proposed to
take a view of the subject which should interest a general and unpro
fessional   audience ; namely, in what way works of Art should be
considered by the public, so as to afford the largest amount of gratifi
cation and profit.
     The interest now taken in Art is a fair ground for offering some
remarks on the best way of directing the public intelligence in this
important field. Museums, collections, exhibitions, abound all over
the country, and the large numbers of visitors to these show beyond
dispute how willing people are to find amusement in such displays.
The statistics on this subject would be very curious ; but, beyond
this, they would suggest serious reflection whether this class of enter
tainment might not be made a means of greatly benefiting the moral
and intellectual condition of the people.        It is well known that many
thousands visit, in the course of every week in the year, the two great
public museums of Art in London ; while during the ten or twelve
weeks only to which the exhibition of the Royal Academy is, of neces
sity, confined, and when I >. is paid for admission, such large numbers
 attend that, last season, considerably above £12,000 was taken at
the doors.
      Now, a question arises, whether, and how far, this general interest
 felt in Art has had any beneficial influence on the public Taste.        The
 answer scarcely can be considered satisfactory. As a nation, we cannot
 be said to exhibit this quality in any eminent degree ; and the inquiry
 naturally suggests itself, why, with this large supply of Art and this
 disposition to look at Art-productions, should this inferiority exist ?
      Chiefly, then, if not entirely, it may be attributed to the absence of
 any education in the principles of Art.        It is not recognized, even in

 among the superior classes, the most crude notions prevail upon the
 theory and principles of design ; while all the higher aims and objects
 of Art are utterly ignored.
     The value of any production, whether of High Art or Literature,
 and the measure of enjoyment to be derived from                must be in the
                                                                          it,

 power to be acquired                    ?
     That there      no indisposition, generally, in the public to be better

 where they fancy       may be obtained.
                                  it           In public galleries an eager
 interest     shown to listen to any chance explanations that may be
               is
 going on.    On visiting exhibitions of pictures, people seek direction in
 the same way, or they are found procuring marked catalogues from
some one or other whose judgment they may think superior to their
 own  ;   proof, at least, of willingness to be assisted, though the advan
          a
 tage gained may sometimes be questioned.         They may be told what to
 look at but they are not taught how to see it. They are without any

 really consists    and what are its claims to consideration as a means of
                         ;
 expressing and developing the Beautiful.        They simply find particular
 works pointed out for examination        but no reasons are asked or given

case, biassed by favouritism or prejudice.
     It precisely here that the want of sound education the theory

and the principles of Art, as distinct from the merely technical,                                 is
seen.    The public      thrown upon individual, and perhaps extremely
                                    is
one-sided, opinion, from which       takes its impressions, instead of having
                                                   it
the power of forming for itself         judgment based upon

     Amongst the errors to which an uneducated public                  prone in        is
estimating works of Art         the fancy that mere imitation constitutes
                                              is
excellence.      It has its own very great merit. As a mechanical
accomplishment         no doubt, ranks, and should rank very high
                              it,                                           and             ;
an artist cannot be too diligent in mastering this most important
element of practice, as his language of expression.       But    never should it
be forgotten that imitation          only    means isto  an end
                                                             a     and not the    ;

the language by which ideas are to be conveyed.                This erroneous
opinion, as to the extreme merit of mere imitation, per se, has led to
much degradation of Art. Instead of making Art the medium of
expressing the great and the good in forms of beauty — as all the great
artists of the great periods of Art have done— modern Art            frequently        is
found illustrating the most ordinary and commonplace subjects,
selected, as     would seem, simply with the view of enabling the artist
                    it
to show his skill in the minute and elaborate imitation of what very often
are but mean and undignified details.        Art should aspire to raise men's

monplace, and even to what is low and repulsive.             Plato made the
Good and the Beautiful identical.
     Colour, light and shade, perspective, and the ease with which
familiar objects may be exhibited in the sister art, offer great temptation
to the painter, and much attraction to the general mass of the public ;
and where the taste is not refined the low quality of a subject will not
be felt as any drawback.       It is not so in sculpture. Any attempt, here,
to indulge in the ordinary and commonplace meets its sure Nemesis.
Its fate is certain. While the productions of the great Greek schools,
in spite of discoloration, dirt, and mutilation, still justly claim the
admiration of all real judges of excellence in this art, there is not a
single instance of a work in sculpture of a low or vulgar school that is
suffered to have a place in any collection.       Yet how are those who are
desirous to understand Art to be taught this if no means are afforded
for their learning it? Again, then, the want of education in what is
true and good in Art is apparent, for here, especially, the better influ
ence of a cultivated taste in the public might have good effect.
     It would be a great mistake to suppose that this knowledge may not
be imparted.     It is not intuitive, but is to be acquired. In Greece the
national habits educated the people to a sense of the beautiful.          In
Italy, in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries especially, the influence
of the higher classes interested the populations in works of Art, and
thus their education was practically advanced ; and without denying the
existence of a more keen sensibility to the beautiful, and more acute
observation, in some persons, and even nations, compared with others, it
may fairly be assumed that all may in different degrees be improved in
their power of appreciating the good wherever it is to be found.       Pro
bably all present are acquainted with that charming work on Italy,
'
  Corinne," and may remember the chapters in which the works of Art in
Rome are described.        The value of the knowledge referred to is fully
exhibited here.     And yet this was the result of education, of its kind.
Madame de Stael had been intimate with Schlegel, and she improved
her own natural faculties by acquiring from him the power to view Art
through an elevated, and, it may be said, a true and proper medium.
     In judging a work of Art the first thing to be considered is the
intention or purpose of the design, and whether the meaning is clearly
expressed.    Secondly, it must be tested by the degree of refinement it
exhibits ; in the choice and character of its subject, and by the mode
of presentation adopted by the artist ; and here the quality of his taste
and mind will be at once seen.        Thirdly, the forms should command
attention, not only in the human and other figures, but in drapery and
all the accessories.    Normal beauty should be recognized as essential
to all fine Art, and even in the less ambitious subjects there should be
a careful avoidance of ugly or repulsive forms.           So the Greeks felt,
and in this, though we may no longer sympathize with their subjects,

3S4              Prof. Westmacott     on  Art-Education, $c.      [March 24,
their productions still are and ever will be a standard. It was this
radical principle that enabled them, or rather obliged them, to make
beauty an element in all their productions.          It was seen not only in
their nobler works, but it spread over and down to the com
monest objects : their furniture,        vases, tazze, earrings, necklaces,
&c. So it was also in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, when the
works of the great Italian masters influenced the taste in small things,
as is seen in the beautiful performances of Benvenuto Cellini and other
artists of the time ; and more modern examples might easily be found.
This is one of the material consequences of a cultivated taste in Art,
 — and by no means an unimportant one.
     The commonplace, and, it must be admitted, pleasing theory of
the necessarily refining influence of the Arts, needs scarcely to be
noticed here.    No doubt the proper office of Art, and of all exercises of
human intelligence, should be to refine and elevate ; but Art does not
effect this, of necessity.   Experience has shown that, though it may be
employed for the noblest objects, it may also be used as an easy means
of corruption, and that the existence of a very refined taste in Art is
no security for a high moral condition of society. It is in its use or
its abuse that its worth is tried.      The social state of Italy in the
reigns  of   Alexander    VI., of Julius   II., of Leo X., and other Popes
were, according to their own native historians, characterized by the
prevalence of the most shocking demoralization and profligacy, at the
very time that Leonardo, M. Angelo, Francesco Francia, and Raffaelle
were producing their master-pieces        in painting and sculpture ; and
France in the reigns of Louis XIV. and Louis XV. was as remark
able for the general corruption of morals pervading all classes, as for
the glory derived from her triumphs in literature and art.
     Here, then, is another reason for endeavouring to show the public
how so fascinating an appendage or accessory of civilization may be
turned to good instead of to evil.     How it may be made an instrument
of moral refinement and instruction, as well as a source of pleasure.
     In conclusion, the value of Art-education would be felt in the great
increase of enjoyment people would have in Art.          It would teach them
how to observe, and it would quicken their intelligence in seizing and
appreciating Nature in her true and proper aspect. Its effects would be
seen also on the public Taste.     The want of it has, there can be no
doubt, a lowering influence both on Art and artists ; for where the know
ledge and feeling of the public is wanting in tone, the artists are not
likely to rise above the standard of those from whom they look for
employment. An intelligent public would raise the standard.
     Another very important benefit might be expected from thus
qualifying the public to judge correctly of Art. It would go far to
put a stop to the pretentious dictation that prevails in matters of Art,
where self-elected and incompetent critics make themselves the dis
pensers of not only fame but employment.              Competition, sound in
principle, has lost all its value, from the feeling that exists among
the comparatively better class of artists that it is a delusion.      Few or

none   of  any position will now submit to be judged by such judges as,
ordinarily,   compose these competition committees, where, in addition
to the possible danger of inadequate qualification in its members, a
well-organized party may have arranged beforehand whose design
shall have the preference, quite irrespectively of its comparative
merit. Nothing would be so calculated to remedy some of the evils
here complained of as the improvement of the public intelligence in
the requirements and principles of true Art ; and in all competitions
it might be an advantage to have the advice and assistance of pro
fessional, but disinterested men, upon technical questions.         The con
sequences of the absence of such securities for a better class and
treatment of public works are sufficiently obvious, without the necessity
of more particular reference.

                  On Scientific   Experiments    in Balloons.
Mr. Glaisher,      at the beginning, referred to the discourse given by him
two years since, when he had made eight ascents, for the purpose of
scientific researches, in the higher regions of the atmosphere, and said
since that time he had made seventeen additional.          He described the
process of filling a large balloon, and briefly described a balloon ascent,
speaking of the novel sensation at first experienced, of the extreme
coldness and dryness of the air at great elevations ; of the painless
death awaiting the aerial traveller who should ascend to an elevation
too great for his power of endurance, and compared it to that of the
mountain traveller, who, benumbed and insensible to suffering, yields
to the lethargy of approaching sleep, and reposes to wake no more.
Moral energy in both cases, he stated, was the only means of safety.
    He then exhibited the several instruments used, pointing out their
extreme sensitiveness       and delicacy, and then spoke of the primary
objects  of balloon    research.
                Subjects   of Research  by means   of Balloons.
     1st. To determine the rate of decrease of temperature, with increase
of elevation ; and to ascertain whether the results obtained by obser

every increase of elevation of 300 feet — be true or not.
    2nd. To determine the distribution of the water, in the invisible
shape of vapour, in the air below the clouds, in the clouds, and above
them, at different elevations.
    3rd. To compare the results, as found by different instruments,
together : —

            Dry and Wet Thermometers — (Free).
           Dry and Wet Thermometers— (Aspirated, or air made to pass rapidly).

           Regnault's Dew Point — (Air made to pass rapidly).
       2. To compare the readings of —
           Mercurial and Aneroid Barometers, &c.
    4th. Solar radiation, by taking readings of the blackened bulb
thermometer fully exposed to the sun, with simultaneous observations
of the dry bulb thermometer, and also of observations of Herschel's
Actinometer.
    5th. To determine whether the Solar spectrum, when viewed from
the earth, and far above           it,
                               exhibited any difference whether there

when near sun-setting.                                           ^,
    6th. To determine whether the horizontal intensity of the earth's
magnetism was less or greater with elevation.
           Propagation of sound.
           Amount of ozone, &c.
     In every ascent    second or third thermometer, differently gra
                              a
duated, has been used to check the accuracy of the readings of the dry
thermometer, and the truthfulness of the temperature shown by it. In
some of the ascents    delicate blackened bulb thermometer was placed
                          a
near to the place of the dry-bulb thermometer, fully exposed to the
sun in cloudless skies, or to the sky at all times — the readings of this
instrument were nearly identical with those of the dry-bulb thermometer
in clouded states of the sky, and thus acted as an additional check.
    At all times, one or the other, or both, Regnault's and Daniell's
hygrometers, have been used sufficiently often at all heights, to show
whether the wet-bulb thermometer was in proper action, and to check
the results given by the use of the dry- and wet-bulb thermometer on
the reduction of the observations.
    The author said he would not give detailed account of the expe

confine himself to some of the results.
    He said     was soon found that the state of the sky exercised a
                  it
great influence, and the experiments had to be repeated with two
groups, one with cloudy skies, and the other with clear skies.

     Up to the height of 22,000 feet, the number of experiments vary
from 7 to 17 ; and there can be but little doubt that the number
showing the decrease of temperature are very nearly true, and approxi
mate closely to the general law.                    Above 24,000 feet the number of
experiments are too few to speak confidently upon them, but they are
in accordance with the series deduced from the experiments at less
elevations.
    A decline of temperature under a clear sky of 1° takes place within
100 feet of the earth, and at heights exceeding 25,000 feet it is neces
sary to pass through 1,000 feet of vertical height, as appears in the
last column of the preceding table, for a decline of 1° of temperature.
    By adding together successively the decline of temperature for
each 1,000 feet the whole decrease of temperature from the earth to
the different elevations is found ; the results, with a cloudy sky, are
as follows : —

    These results, showing the whole decrease of temperature of the
air from the earth up            to 23,000 feet, differ very considerably from
those with a clear sky, to be spoken of presently. The number in the
last column show the average increment of height for a decline of 1",
as found by using the temperature of the extremities of the column
alone.      To 1,000 feet high the average is 1" in 223 feet, increasing
gradually to 1° in 445 feet at 23,000 feet.

     These results, showing the whole decrease of temperature from the
 ground to 30,000 feet, differ greatly, as just mentioned, from those
 with a cloudy sky.
     The numbers in the last column, showing the average increase of
 height for a decline of 1° of temperature from the ground, to that
elevation, are all smaller than those with a cloudy sky at the same
elevation.        Each result is based upon at least seven experiments, taken
at different times of the year, and up to this height considerable con
fidence may be placed in the results ; they show that a change takes
place in the first 1,000 feet of 1° on an average in 162 feet, increasing
to about 300 at 10,000 feet.           In the year 1862, this space of 300 feet
 was at 14,000 feet high, and in 1863 at 12,000 feet.               Therefore, the
change of temperature has been less in 1863 than those in 1862, and

less in 1864 than in 1863, but the experiments have all been taken at
different times of the year.
     Without exception the fall of 1° has always taken place in the
smallest space when near the earth.

      The law of moisture here shown is a slight increase from the earth
 to the height of 3,000 feet, and then a slight decrease to 6,000 feet,
 the degree of humidity being at this elevation nearly of the same value
 as on the ground — from 6,000 to 7,000 feet, there is a large decrease,
 and then an almost uniform decrease to 11,000 feet ; it increases from
 12,000 to 16,000 feet, and then decreases; the number of experiments
 up to 11,000 feet, vary from 10 to 33 ; and           I   think good confidence
may be placed in the result to this elevation, but at heights of 12,000
 feet, the number of experiments are evidently too small to speak with
any confidence in respect to the results.
      By treating the results with a clear or a nearly clear sky in the
same way, the following results were obtained : —

      Showing that large changes take place near the earth, amounting
 to 24° in the first mile, becoming less and less the farther removed,
 till the change from 100 miles to 200 miles is less than 3°.
      The speaker then said, as these results were deduced chiefly from
 experiments in the summer and during the hours of the day, it became
 desirable to take experiments at other times in the year to ascertain
 whether this law would hold good at all times of the year, and at all
 times of the day.
      For this purpose it was necessary to take experiments in the
 winter, spring, and autumn.     He then described the experiments made
 at these seasons, and pointed out that experiments made on September
 29, January 12, and April 6, during the day, differed very much from
 the general laws, and those on June 13, 20, and 27, made a little
before, at the time of sunset, and a little afterwards, differed materi
ally from those made when the sun was at a good altitude ; for in
stance, on June 13, at the time of sunset, no difference in temperature
was experienced for 2,000 feet from the earth.
      The speaker then said, it is very clear from the particulars of each
ascent, that they cannot all be combined, or all used in deducing
general laws. Those ascents which have been made during the past
year under similar circumstances to those from which the laws of
decrease of temperature were found, when combined do not change the
values previously found to any great amount ; but those which have
been made under other circumstances, such as in the winter, and at
times of the setting sun, differ very greatly indeed.
      The deviation from this law, however, in winter is certainly of the
highest importance to us, the meeting of a strong current of air from
the S.W. of so great a depth as nearly one mile, over our country on
                                                        I
January 12, in the season of winter, which current know continued
many days, must have exercised great influence.        This was the first
instance of meeting with a stream of air of higher temperature than on
the earth ; above this the air was dry, and higher still it was very dry :
fine granular snow was falling thickly above this warm stream of air.
      The S.W. current being thus observed is of the highest import
ance as bearing upon the very high mean temperature we experience
during winter, so much higher than is due to our position on the
earth's surface, and it is highly probable that to its fluctuations the
variations of our winters are due.
      Our high winter temperature has hitherto been referred for the
most part to the influence of the heated water of the Gulf Stream, but
if this were the case the same agency being at work around the coast
of France, should exercise the same influence, yet we know that the
winters of France are more severe than our own, though situated so
much south of us.
     Dr. Stark, of Edinburgh, some years since referred the mildness
of the winters in Britain for the most part to prevalence of the S.W.
or anti-trade wind, which is the prevailing aerial current in this lati
tude during winter.

   1865.]             on Scientific Experiments in Balloons.           393
       He  observes, so long as these winds blow, we have no frosts or
  intense colds ; but the moment the wind changes during winter to an
  easterly, north-easterly, or northerly direction, we have both frost and
  snow, and more or less intense cold.
       The S.W. winds in their course meet with no obstruction in
  coming to us, but they blow directly to us and to Norway over the
  Atlantic ; and hence we enjoy a much milder climate during winter
  than any other lands not similarly situated with regard to such winds.
       The south-west winds cannot roach France till they have crossed
  the whole of Spain and the high mountain range of the Pyrenees ;
  and by the time they have crossed that mountainous country they are
  so much cooled that France can derive comparatively little benefit
  from them, and hence apparently her more severe winters.
       Another fact may be inferred from this winter trip ; it has always
  been a matter of great difficulty to me to account for the simultaneous
 appearance of dense fog over the whole country and extending far out
 to sea , but the fact of a warm current of air, situated under a mass of
 snow falling, would fully account for the production of any amount
 of  fog.
      Another inference   may be drawn from the facts noticed ; one only
 I will mention,    and it is this : If during the prevalence of a warm
  current of air passing over these islands there can be currents of air
                               I
 of so low a temperature as experienced, it is evident that as it is but
 a struggle between two or more forces, either of which may prepon
 derate at any moment, it is not safe, therefore, in the winter months,
 how mild soever the weather may be, to go thinly clothed at any time,
 for at any moment this warm current may be deflected, and its place
 occupied by the cold current, and thus some of our sudden and
 apparently unaccountable changes may be due.
      The fact of no change of temperature being met with at the time
 of sunset on June 13, for 2,000 feet from the earth, that a much
 smaller change took place than usual on June 20, a little before sun
 set; and that on June 27, after sunset, as well as could be determined,
the change to 3,000 feet was small, it would seem that the laws
which hold good by day do not hold good by night; indeed, it seems
probable that at night, for some little distance, the temperature may
increase with elevation instead of decreasing.     This can only be deter
mined by experiments at night.
      Comparing the results of one experiment with another with respect
to the moisture in the air, at the same elevation, it is found to be very
different at different times ; and that on the same day the moisture is
very differently distributed, there having been on some of the days of
experiments several successive wet and dry strata placed one above the
other.
      The variation in this climate, its frequent disturbed atmosphere,
the smallness of the country, causing great anxiety after passing
through clouds and out of sight of the earth, for fear of descending
over the sea, when the balloon has no longer power to keep up,

394                             Mr. James Glaisher                  [March 31,
rendering each experiment limited in its duration, that perhaps this
country is not the best for determining the laws which govern
atmospheric changes.
     I  am glad to learn that similar observations are contemplated
being made in France, and            I   hope that similar observations will be
made in other countries, for it is probable that above the large plains
of the continent, where the weather is more uniform, and where an
observer can be for hours out of sight of land without anxiety — that
the experiments can be more easily made, and probably, too, the
general laws made more easily apparent.
     Many ascents will, however, be necessary ; clouds as large, and
clouds far colder than any             I  have met with, were experienced by
Messrs. Bixio and Barral, in their ascents in June and July, 1850,
from Paris. These gentlemen made two ascents for scientific pur
poses, and although from accidents the ascents were of short duration,
the results were of high interest.           Among them, they noticed that they
passed through a cloud of icicles, which sustained themselves in the
air, as it appeared to them, contrary to the laws of gravity ; but upon
their horizontal surfaces they saw beneath them, however, an exact
image of the sun, formed by the reflection of the luminous rays on the
 crystals of ice, floating about in a foggy atmosphere ; and they noticed
 the temperature of the cloud to be as low as minus 40°, a far greater
 degree of cold than     I  ever experienced.
      With such variations as these, as many ascents will be necessary
 to be made in France as in England, to determine general laws ; but
 each ascent may be made far richer in results than any one in
 England.     In France, the duration of a journey will be limited only
 by the wishes of the observer, and not as here by the sea, or by one
 solitary hour's observations— that being the time frequently in which
 we approach the sea.
      It is certain that there are in the higher regions of the earth's
 atmosphere spaces subjected to great cold, and others to considerable
 heat ; that there exist some clouds of very low temperature ; and
 some, as those passed through on January 12, for a mile in thickness,
 of comparatively high temperature.
      The presence of such, either cold or hot currents, passing over the
 country, must play an important part in all our meteorological pheno
 mena, and must exert a great influence upon our climate.
      When    I  first undertook to make these experiments,          I  expected
 that a few ascents would have given the information sought ; the
 number of experiments          I  have now made is twenty-five, and so far
 from exhausting the subject, they have only indicated a much wider
 field for future operations.
      The law of decrease of temperature under ordinary circumstances,
 both with a clear and a cloudy sky, when the sun is above the horizon, in
 the months   of summer,     I  thinh is pretty well determined ; but from the
 series of  observations   made    in winter, we cannot say such laws hold good
 throughout  the  year :   neither   can we say that the laws which hold good by

day trill be true by night ; and the general result of these differences must
be that the theoretical       law of refraction now used, must be abandoned,
and that every observatory will have to determine its own laws, inde
pendently.
       Solar Radiation      : Blackened Bulb Thermometer,      and HcrscheTs
                               Actinometer Observations.
       On August 31, at the heights of 7,000 and 8,000 feet, the black
 ened    bulb thermometer, exposed to the full influence of the sun, read 3°
 only higher than the shaded thermometer.
       On September 29, at the height of 14,000 feet, the excess of reading
 of the blackened bulb thermometer was 2J° only under a bright sun,
 the increase of readings of the actinometer was from 3 to 5 divisions
 only ; at 13,000 feet the excess of the blackened bulb readings in
 creased to 4° and 5", and the increase in one minute of the actinometer
 reading were 7 to 8 divisions.           At the height of 3,000 feet and 4,000
 feet, the influence of the sun increased, raising the blackened bulb to
 7°
      and 8° in excess of the readings of the shaded thermometer, the
 scale readings of the actinometer increased to 20 and 25 divisions in
 one minute, and on reaching the ground the increase in the same time
  was from 45 to 50 divisions.
       On January 12, the readings of the exposed and shaded thermo
 meters were nearly alike.
       On April 6,      I was unable to use tho actinometer, and never suc
  ceeded in placing it properly.         The excess of reading of the blackened
  bulb thermometer was but small during the cloudy state of the sky,
  and increased       to 5° and 6° at 10,000 feet, this excess increased on de
  scending     into  the  lower atmosphere, until cloud was entered.
        On June 13, the excess was at all times small.
        On June 20, at many inspections the readings of the two thermo
  meters were identical.
        On Juno 27, the exposed thermometers nearly always read lower
  than the shaded thermometer ; on examination of these instruments
  afterwards, they were both found to read correctly.
        On August 29, the blackened bulb thermometer read lower than
   tho shaded thermometer till 6,000 feet were passed ; it then read
   higher, increasing to 7° at 14,000 feet high.
        From all these experiments it seems that tho heat rays in their
   passage from the sun pass the small bulb of a thermometer, communi
   cating very little or no heat to it.        Similar results being shown by
   the use of Herschel's        actinometer on every occasion that     I  have had
   an opportunity of using it.         From these experiments we may infer that
   the heat rays
                    from the sun pass through space trithout loss, and become
    effective in proportion to the density of the atmosphere or the amount of
    water present through which they pass, and
                                                      if so, the proportion of heat
    received at Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Saturn, may be the same as

the effective solar heat at Jupiter and Saturn may be greater than at

greater distances from the Sun.
                      Different Velocities of     Air. — The Wind.
     On September 29, the balloon left Wolverhampton at 7h. 43m. a.m.
and fell near Sleaford, a place ninety-five miles from the place
of ascent, at lOh. 30m. a.m. During this time the horizontal move
ment of air was thirty-three                 miles, as registered at Wrottesley
Observatory.
     On October 9, the balloon left the Crystal Palace at 4h. 49m. p.m.,
and descended at Pirton Grange, a place thirty-five miles from the
place of ascent, at 6h. 30m. p.m. ; Robinson's anemometer during
this time registered eight miles at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich,
as the horizontal movement of the air.
     On January 12, the balloon left the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, at
2h. 8m. p.m., and descended at Lakenheath, a place seventyi mles
from the place of ascent, at 4h. 10m. p.m. ; at the Royal Observatory,
by Robinson's anemometer during this time the motion of the air was
six miles only.
     On April 6, the balloon left the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, at
4h. 8m. p.m., its correct path is not known, as it entered several
different currents of air, the earth being invisible owing to the mist ;
it descended at Sevenoaks, in Kent, at 5h. 37m. p.m., a point fifteen
miles from the place of ascent ; five miles was registered during this
time by Robinson's anemometer, at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich.
     From all the experiments, the velocity of the air at the earth's surface
appears to be very much less than at a high elevation.

very closely approximate indeed to the results obtained by either of
these instruments, as will be seen by the following comparison of
results.

398    Mr. Glalsher      on Scientific Experiments in BaUoons.      [March          31,
      The number of experiments made up to the height of 7,000 feet
 varying from 21 to 60 in each 1,000 feet as taken in the last three
 years, are sufficient to enable us to speak with confidence ; the results
 are, that the temperatures of the dew point as found by the use of the
 dry- and wet-bulb thermometers, and my hygrometrical tables, are
 worthy of full confidence up to this point. At heights exceeding 7,000
 feet, the three years' experiences   do not yield a sufficient number of
 experiments to give satisfactory results.       Before we can speak with
 certainty at these elevations more experiments must be made.
      Let us take the balloon as we find      it,and apply    itto the uses of
 vertical ascent   let us make
                     ;             subservient to the purposes of war, an
                                  it

                                       ;            itto ascend to the verge
 of our lower atmosphere and as
                             ;          is, the balloon will claim its place
                                       it
among the most important of human inventions, even            if    remain an
                                                                   it
isolated power, and should never become engrafted as the ruling prin
ciple of the mechanism we have yet to seek.
      Whether we regard the atmosphere as the great ^boratory of
changes which contain the germ of future discoveries, as they unfold
to the chemist, the meteorologist, the physician         ; its physical rela
tion to animal life at different heights      ;  the form of death, which
at certain elevations      iscertain to take place; the effect of dimi
nished pressure upon individuals similarly placed         ;   the comparison
of mountain ascents with the experiences of aeronauts              ;these are
some of the inquiries which suggest themselves, and faintly indicate
researches which naturally ally themselves         to the course of balloon
experiments.
     Sufficiently varied and important they will be seen to rank the
balloon as valuable aid to the uses of philosophy, and rescue
            a                                                            from

the impending degradation as           toy, fit only to be exhibited or
                                       a
to administer to the pleasures of the curious.
     Already     has done for us that which no other power has accom
                it
plished;   it has gratified the desire natural to man, to view the earth
in new aspect, and to sustain himself in
  a                                            a  new element, hitherto the
exclusive privilege of birds and insects. We have been enabled by its
aid to ascend among the phenomena of the heavens, and to exchange
conjecture for instrumental facts, recorded at twice the elevation the
highest mountain permits us to observe.

 hundred guineas (not awarded in 1 858) were ordered to be reserved to
 the next award of the Actonian prize, none of the other Essays
 being, in the judgment of the Committee of Managers, of sufficient
 merit to entitle the author thereof to such prize.

                 On   the  Combining   Power of Atoms.
YOTJR  ROYAL HIGHNESS, LADIES    AND  GENTLEMBN,
           You observe on the lecture-table a great number of bottles,
containing an almost perplexing variety of chemical substances ; the
walls of the theatre are covered with diagrams exhibiting an endless
number of formulae, which some of my audience,      I have no doubt, are
contemplating with mixed feelings of uneasiness and resignation. Nor
                                    I
will it diminish your discomfort if tell you that each of the substances
on the table represents at least a thousand bodies actually known, and
again that each of the known bodies represents a million or more bodies
which are not known, but which exist well defined in the mind of the
chemist who calls them into life whenever he requires them for pur
poses theoretical or practical.                          I
                                   At the first glance, admit this is
rather a formidable array ; but our anxiety is materially lessened, if
we learn that this host of substances is formed according to simple
laws which it is in our power to discover, and which by the united
efforts of chemists are gradually unfolding themselves.
    May   I be permitted this evening to call your attention to some of
the laws, or at all events law-like regularities, recently observed, and
which are at present engrossing the interest of the leading chemists of
all countries.
    I  would commence with one of the simplest of experiments : — Here
are two gases, hydrogen and chlorine,' the one a colourless inodorous
gas, which burns quietly with a pale flame, the other a greenish yellow
gas, possessing a suffocating odour, and not inflammable.    When equal
volumes of these two gases are mixed together, and a light applied to
   Vol. IV.     (No. 42.)                                     2o

402                        Dr. A. W. Hofmann                     [April 7,
the mixture, an explosion takes place, a compound gas being produced,
which fumes in the air, and which, when dissolved in water, constitutes
the spirit of salt, or muriatic acid of the earlier chemists, now called
hydrochloric acid.
     By certain processes, which we must not inquire into at the present
time, the compound of hydrogen and chlorine, called hydrochloric acid,
may be made to unite with another gas, oxygen ; the combination
giving rise to the formation of an acid called hypochlorous acid, and
by which most of the bleaching operations carried out in commerce
are effected.    On plunging an appropriately-prepared piece of Turkey-
red calico into a warm solution of chloride of lime, which is closely
related to hypochlorous acid, you observe that a white pattern is
produced on the cloth.
     Again, an additional quantity of oxygen may be united to hypo
chlorous acid, when the compound called chlorous acid is formed. A
well-known salt of commerce, chlorate of potassium, is generally used
for its preparation. This salt is readily decomposed by acids. The
explosive violence with which sulphuric acid acts upon it, the deto
nation attended by flashes of light, are phenomena early and frequently
observed by the laboratory student.         By substituting nitric for sul
phuric acid, an explosive gas is formed, which, when dissolved in
water, constitutes the chlorous acid in question.
     A third compound, chloric acid, may be formed by the addition of
a  further  dose of oxygen to chlorous acid.     The most familiar salt of
 this acid is the chlorate of potassium just mentioned. This, as well as
other derivatives of chloric acid, is largely used for pyrotechnic pur
poses.    Here we must be satisfied with calling attention to a species
of white gunpowder which has been lately devised, and which consists
of a mixture of the potassium salt with tannic or gallic acid.
     Lastly, by still further increasing the supply of oxygen, a fourth
compound, perchloric acid, is produced. This substance again exhibits
the explosive habitudes of the group of bodies in question. When
made to combine with aniline, for instance, perchloric acid gives rise
to a compound which goes off when heated in a test-tube, burning, as
you observe, with an intense white light.
     A glance at the diagram shows us the regularity with which the
amount of oxygen increases in this series of oxygenetted derivatives of
 hydrochloric acid. There is nothing arbitrary in this accession ;
 each increment ensues step by step.

     Looking at the simplest body at the head of the list, we find it to
be a compound of one atom of hydrogen with one atom of chlorine.
By uniting this compound with one atom of oxygen, we obtain
hypochlorous acid ; by adding another, we produce chlorous acid ;
the accession of a third atom gives rise to chloric acid ; and a fourth
atom of oxygen, lastly, produces perchloric acid.
     The same gradual rise in the successive additions of oxygen may
be traced in numerous other groups of bodies.           For the present we
will confine our attention to two more series.
    Under the name of olefiant gas, a transparent colourless gas,
burning, as you observe, with a brilliantly luminous flame, is known,
which consists of carbon and hydrogen.            By a circuitous process,
which must not detain us, this gas may be converted into a peculiar,
very volatile liquid of a pungent odour, which chemists have called
aldehyde. This substance, which is more readily procured by sub
mitting alcohol to the action of oxidizing agents, may be looked
upon as a compound of olefiant gas with oxygen. Aldehyde is marked
by its powerful attraction for oxygen ; so greedily, indeed, does it absorb
this gas, that it is almost impossible to preserve aldehyde except
in hermetically-closed vessels.       Nor does aldehyde unite only with
oxygen when it meets with it in the free state ; combined oxygen is
equally attracted by it.      When gently heated with oxide of silver, dis
solved in a suitable liquid, aldehyde very rapidly removes the oxygen
from the oxide, metallic silver in a lustrous condition being deposited
on the surface of the vessel in which the operation is performed.      This
reaction, first observed by Baron Liebig many years ago, has recently
been modified so as to admit of industrial application on a large scale
for the manufacture of looking-glasses and reflectors for astronomical
instruments. When aldehyde is thus oxidized, it is converted into a
compound called acetic acid, well known to everyone as the principal
constituent of common vinegar.
    Again, acetic acid may be made to unite with an additional quantity
of oxygen to produce a compound called glycolic acid, an acid which
has been discovered during the last few years, but which has not at
present received any useful applications.
     On referring to the following diagram we          perceive the simple
relation existing between these four bodies : —

           Glycolie acid      .   . .  C, H, +   3 0 = C. H, O.
    We   observe    here   exactly as in the   previous series the gradual

404                        Dr. A. W. Hofmann                     [April 7,
assimilation of oxygen. Olefiant gas by absorbing one atom of oxygen
produces aldehyde ; by absorbing a second atom it gives rise to the
formation of acetic acid ; by a third annexation of a similar quantity
of oxygen, lastly, glycolic acid is formed.
     May   I  be permitted to quote an additional instance.     In the oil
obtained from the seeds of the croton tiglium chemists have discovered
a peculiar acid, crotonic acid, which has been lately observed also
among the derivatives of mustard.
     This substance, consisting of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, is
convertible by oxidation into another acid, succinic acid, a beautiful
crystalline body, which is more frequently obtained by submitting the
familiar resin amber to the action of oxidizing agents.
    Succinic acid, when combined with an additional atom of oxygen,
gives rise to the formation of malic acid, a crystalline acid largely
present in the juice of apples and rhubarb, the substance indeed to
which the acid reaction of these juices is chiefly due.    On cutting an
apple or a piece of rhubarb, and pressing the cut surface against a piece
of blue litmus paper, it is immediately reddened.
     But malic acid also may be still further oxidized, the product
being one of the most familiar vegetal acids, tartaric acid.     This acid
is one of the compounds existing largely in the juice of grapes.    When
a grape is squeezed on a piece of blue litmus paper, the latter is red
dened wherever it comes in contact with the grape juice.
    The molecules of all these acids contain the same number of carbon
atoms and also the same number of hydrogen atoms, the difference in
their composition consisting entirely in the number of oxygen atoms
which are present, as obvious by reference to the diagram.

    In this diagram an unknown acid C, He Oa figures between crotonic
and succinic acids.    This substance has not yet been obtained, but the
experience of the gradual assimilation of oxygen in other series permits
us to forecast the existence of this compound. Though not yet actually
prepared,    I  have not hesitated to introduce it into the list of bodies
derived from crotonic acid by simple oxidation.
    The three examples which we have studied unmistakably show
us that oxygen is capable of combining with other groups of elements

 I865.J             on the Combiuing Power      of Atoms.               405
 so as to give rise to new compounds : that this combination takes place
stepwise, atom by atom : that the fundamental properties of the original
compound remain more or less unaltered in the new compound of
greater complexity, and that the amount of oxygen thus, so to say,
assimilated, is in no way dependent on the greater or less complexity
 of composition of the original compound. In the first case we had
 the simplest of all possible compounds, hydrochloric acid consisting
of one atom of hydrogen and one of chlorine ; in the second case we
started with a compound containing two atoms of carbon and four of
 hydrogen, altogether six atoms, while in the case of crotonic acid not
less than four atoms     of carbon, six of hydrogen, and two of oxygen,
altogether twelve atoms, were involved.
     An endless variety of similar examples might be quoted for the
purpose of illustrating the generality of the inferences we have drawn,
but   I will, with your permission, assume that      I have established my
point.
     We have in the next place to examine whether substances are
capable of combining with nitrogen, exactly as we have just seen them
 unite with oxygen. Remembering as we do that nitrogen is rather
marked by the absence of salient combining powers, we are not
surprised to learn that all attempts hitherto made with the view of
adding nitrogen directly to other bodies have entirely failed.          But
even indirectly by availing ourselves of roundabout ways, by calling to
our aid the multitude of reactions which modern chemistry has brought
to light, nitrogen cannot be added to other substances without intro
ducing at the same time other elements into the composition of the
compound. Let us endeavour to illustrate this point by examples :
we could not perhaps quote a better case than that of benzol, the
substance which is the starting point of the manufacture of aniline, the
source of the beautiful colours so much in request at the present time.
Benzol consists of carbon and hydrogen. No one has, as yet, succeeded
in uniting this substance with nitrogen alone. Nothing on the other
hand is easier than to combine benzol simultaneously with nitrogen
and hydrogen.      The very transition of benzol into aniline involves the
assimilation by the benzol molecule of one atom of nitrogen and one
atom of hydrogen.      Again, aniline is capable of fixing a second atom of
nitrogen, but not without assimilating also a second atom of hydrogen.
The compound thus produced is a beautiful crystalline body called
phenglene-diamine, which is likely to receive some interesting appli
cations in the manufacture of brown dyes.        To this compound again
additional atoms of nitrogen and hydrogen may be joined, a fourth
substance, as yet without application, picryl-triamine, being formed.
The following diagram, in which again the simplest compound (benzol)
is placed at the top of the list, shows how these several substances are
related to each other.

      Let me give you another and even simpler series in illustration of
  the same point.    Hydride of ethyl, like benzol, refuses to combine with
  nitrogen, but it also receives into its molecule one atom of nitrogen
  and one atom of hydrogen, the well-known substance ethylamine,
 which has the greatest analogy with ammonia, being formed. This, by
 a repetition of the same transaction, is converted into ethylene-diamine,
 an oily base of great causticity ; while a third repetition of the process
 produces a compound, vinyl-triamine, the existence of which is not
  yet fully established.     The analogy between the first and the second
 series is obvious by a comparison of the formulae.

             Vinyltriamine     .     .   C, H. +    3 H N    = C, H, N,
      We entirely refrain from examining into the particular processes,
 varying to a very considerable extent, by which these transformations
 are accomplished, the only point, which we have an interest in establish
 ing here, being that nitrogen, when it joins a compound, joins not alone,
 but in company with hydrogen.               In this respect then nitrogen essen
 tially differs from  oxygen,      which   we saw combining with bodies, atom
 by atom,    without involving      the  introduction  of other materials.
      Can we explain this strange difference in the behaviour of oxygen
 and nitrogen ?     Before endeavouring to answer this question, let us
 examine in what manner carbon atoms are received into the molecules
 of bodies, whether like oxygen atoms they are capable of joining
 directly, or like nitrogen atoms they are accepted only when presenting
themselves in company with other atoms.               Investigation of a special
case appears best fitted to supply the desired information.
      Among the endless number of carbon compounds, we could not
possibly select a simpler one than marsh-gas.                   This transparent
colourless inflammable gas, as everyone               knows, escapes from the
fissures of the great coal measures and accumulates                  in the gal

1865.]             on the Combining         Power of Atoms.                  407
leries of ill-ventilated      coal mines, frequently giving rise to the
explosions so much dreaded and deplored.                 It is also often deve
loped  from  stagnant pools     and   swamps,    in general from marshy lands,
whence its name.        Marsh-gas      consists  of  carbon and hydrogen.      Is
this substance convertible into a compound which contains a larger
amount of carbon ? By a series of processes far too numerous and
complicated to admit of being discussed this evening, marsh-gas may
be converted into hydride of ethyl, a substance                 of very similar
properties, and which the members of the Royal Institution have
frequently seen prepared by a simpler method discovered by Dr.
Frankland, viz. : the action of zinc-ethyl upon water.              Hydride of
ethyl contains one atom of carbon more than marsh-gas, but with this
carbon atom, two hydrogen atoms have been simultaneously conferred
 upon the marsh-gas molecule.           On submitting hydride of ethyl to a
similar series of transformations we convert it by the addition of
another carbon atom into hydride of propyl, but not without fixing
 again two atoms of hydrogen.
     The same processes may be repeated again and again, hydride of
propyl being converted in its turn into hydride of butyl, and hydride
 of butyl into hydride ofamyl. We arrive in this manner at a series
 of bodies very similar in their properties, each of them differing from
 the previous one by the accession of one carbon atom invariably linked
 with two atoms of hydrogen.          Many members of this series are found
 amongst the products of the distillation of coal ; others, especially those
 richer in carbon, existing in the American oils, which are now being so
 much used for lighting and other purposes.
     The composition of these several bodies may be exhibited in the
 following diagram : —
                              Increment      of Carbon.

      But  we may    illustrate the law which regulates the increment of
  carbon by starting from another foundation.             Instead of building on
  marsh-gas, we   make    use  of the    oxide  of  marsh-gas, methylic alcohol.
  This compound by the successive addition of one atom of carbon and

408                          Dr. A. W. Hofmann                    [April 7,
two of hydrogen, produces a series of alcohols which may be regarded
as the oxides of the corresponding marsh-gas-analogous.           The first
compound thus obtained is ethylic alcohol, ordinary spirits of wine ;
the second, propylic alcohol, generated in the fermentation of the
grape-skin residue of the manufacture of wine; the third, butylic
alcohol, formed by the fermentation of the molasses of beetroot sugar ;
the fourth, amylic alcohol, or potato oil, obtained as a residue in the
manufacture of spirit from the starch of potatoes. Caproic, oenanthylic,
and caprylic, alcohols are further terms of the series, which rises, not
without considerable gaps, to terms containing as many as eighteen,
twenty-seven, and even thirty atoms of carbon, which are found
respectively in palmitic, cerotic, and melissic alcohols: the first, 'a
product of the decomposition of spermaceti ; the last two, derived
from ordinary bee's wax and Chinese wax.

    Again, we may take another compound as point of departure.
Formic acid is a body long since discovered to be secreted by the ant.
By adding an atom of carbon and two of hydrogen to this acid we
arrive at acetic acid, which we have already met with this evening as
one of the products of the oxidation of olefiant gas.    By the successive
accumulation, within the molecule of this acid, of similar quantities of
carbon and hydrogen, a long series of acids is formed, including some
of the most interesting compounds with which the chemist has to deal :
butyric acid, contained in butter ; valeric, the active constituent of the
valerian root ; caproic and caprylic, obtained from goat's fat ; cenan-
thylic, from castor oil ; pelargonic,        the odoriferous principle of
pelargonium roseum ; rutic, the product of oxidation of oil of rue ;
palmitic, contained in palm oil and in spermaceti ; tnargaric and

     The action of the acids just examined upon the groups of alcohols
previously studied gives rise, as is well known, to the class of bodies
called compound ethers.          On arranging some of the numerous bodies
belonging to this group into a series in which the carbon rises, atom by
atom, we find, in exact accordance with our former observations, that
the accession of one atom of carbon involves the simultaneous introduc

     All these substances present more or less general interest. The
powerful, and in some cases almost repulsive odours which the com
pound ethers possess may be tamed down by dilution, so as to render
these substances useful, and indeed extensively applied, substitutes for
natural essences.      Formate of methyl, the simplest of all compound
ethers,   like the next  term, formate of ethyl, has received some applica
tions in the flavouring of inferior varieties of rum. Acetate of ethyl,
                                                                    "
familiar to everyone as acetic ether, is used for " improving          certain
wines ; the butyrate of methyl and ethyl, substances which undiluted
 possess an almost overwhelming, and by no means attractive, odour,
exhale, when dissolved in an appropriate amount of spirits of wine, the
finest perfume of the pine apple ; acetate ofamyl, lastly, the final term
of our series, exhibits the peculiar aroma of the jargonelle pear in so
high a degree that it is now extensively manufactured to flavour the
well-known pear drops of our confectioners.
     I  must not, however, dilate too much on the odoriferous qualities
 of the compound ethers ; here, indeed, we are concerned with these
substances only in so far as they afford additional evidence in favour
of our speculations respecting the growth of carbon in a series of
carbon compounds.
      One more illustration and we shall have done with this part of our
 inquiry.     In a lecture delivered some time ago in this theatre, I had
 the honour of submitting to the members of the Royal Institution a
 brief account of Mauve and Magenta, the remarkable coal-derived
 colouring matters which have sprung from the happy union of
 industry and science in our times.      May   I  be permitted once more to
 call your attention for a moment to the group of tinctorial ammonias?
 Aniline red, or rosaniline, as it is called by chemists, is convertible by
 certain processes into beautiful violet, and even blue colouring matters.
 This conversion invariably involves addition of carbon to the molecule
 of rosaniline. By its conversion into certain varieties of violet, the
 red fixes six atoms of carbon ; by its transition into certain bluish
 shades, not less than fifteen atoms of carbon are assimilated.       In what
 manner does this increment of carbon affect the amount of hydrogen ?
  Inspection of the diagram teaches us that aniline violet contains
  12 = 2 x 6 atoms of hydrogen more than aniline red, and that the
 transition of red into blue is attended by an accession of as many as
  30 = 2 X 15 atoms of hydrogen.

1865.]            on the Combining Power      of Atoms.              411
     In the preceding remarks     I have submitted to you an extensive
series  of examples    taken from different pages in the vast volume of
chemistry, which appear to indicate that oxygen combines atom by
atom, that nitrogen enters the compound freighted with one atom of
hydrogen, and lastly, that carbon cannot join the concern except with a
capital, so to speak, of two atoms of hydrogen.          Supposing for a
moment that this rule could be established without a single exception
throughout the whole range of chemistry, are we enabled to assign
a probable reason for this peculiar behaviour of the oxygen, nitrogen,
and carbon atoms ?
     To answer this question we must commence by considering for a
few moments some of the simplest compounds of the elements con
 cerned.
     Here we have four glass tubes surmounted by large globes. The
first of these contains hydrochloric acid, the compound of hydrogen
with chlorine ; the second did contain the vapour of water, the com
pound of hydrogen with oxygen, but which is now condensed to small
drops of fluid water deposited on the sides of the globe ; in the third
vessel we have the compound of hydrogen with nitrogen, ammonia ;
while the last is filled with one of the compounds of carbon with
hydrogen, viz. marsh-gas.
     These four compounds, all transparent and colourless, we distin
guish by the simplest experiments.         On opening the sealed tubes
of the vessels under mercury no change takes place in the case of
hydrochloric acid, ammonia, and marsh-gas, while the mercury imme
diately rises and fills the globe containing the condensed water vapour.
When the remaining three vessels are now raised, so as to allow the
broken points of the tubes to dip in a layer of water floating on the
mercury, the liquid rushes into the globes containing hydrochloric acid
and ammonia ; of the two solutions thus produced by the absorption of
the gases, the one containing the hydrochloric acid reddens blue litmus ;
the other, formed by the absorption of the ammonia, changes red lit
mus to blue. The marsh-gas differs from all the others by its insolu
bility and by its inflammability.    Indeed, if the globe be broken and
a light applied, the gas burns with a feebly luminous flame.
     Nor are the differences observed in the structure of these four
hydrogen compounds less characteristic, although they cannot be so
easily demonstrated by experiment, at all events within the limited
time at my disposal. Indeed, to give you an idea of their structure
which is necessary for our purposes,     I must be permitted to borrow a

     We now require to know the quantities of the other elements pre
sent in the four compounds under examination, and again we extract
from the original two volumes of hydrochloric acid one volume of
chlorine ; from the two volumes of water-vapour, one of oxygen ; from
the two of ammonia, one of nitrogen ; and lastly, from the two volumes
of marsh-gas, an amount of carbon which provisionally      I may be per
mitted to represent by one volume, since, owing to the non-volatility of
the carbon, the volume of the carbon vapour has not yet been ascertained.

     In  the second column of the diagram are given the compounds of
 these  four  elements with chlorine, and exactly as we have seen them
 combining respectively with 1,2, 3, and 4 volumes of hydrogen, we
 now find them associated with 1, 2, 3, and 4 volumes of chlorine.
 Again, in the third column we have the series of sodium compounds of
 these elements, and although in this case we must be careful not to
 speak of volumes of sodium-vapour, since chemists have not as yet
 obtained sodium-gas in the pure state, we perceive at all events from
 the diagram that one volume of oxygen fixes exactly twice, one volume
 of nitrogen exactly three times the quantity of sodium which is com
 bined with one volume of chlorine.
     The study of elementary gases has led chemists to the unanimous
 opinion that equal volumes of these different gases contain an equal
number of the smallest particles or atoms.         Numerous theoretical con
siderations and numerous experimental inquiries inevitably lead to this
result, which is now a generally received truth.         If equal volumes of
different gases be submitted to the same pressure they contract to an
equal extent, and if they are equally heated they expand equally.
     We have here an apparatus so disposed as to permit us to establish
this point experimentally.       It consists of a kind of double U tube, with
one long and simple limb, and one short limb bifurcated into two
branches, each of which is provided with a stopcock.              These short
limbs are moreover surrounded by a glass cylinder.          Near the bottom
of the apparatus another stopcock is placed, enabling us to empty the
apparatus. The three limbs of the instrument being filled with mer
cury, we introduce into the stopcocked limbs the gases to be examined,
into the one hydrogen and into the other oxygen, care being taken to
have as nearly as possible equal volumes of the two.           These volumes
being marked by caoutchouc rings we pour mercury into the long
open limb, and we find that the mercury column thus obtained com
presses the two gases to an exactly equal extent.        Again, on letting out
mercury through the bottom stopcock, so as to lower the column and
diminish the pressure, we observe that both hydrogen and oxygen
undergo equal dilatation.        And so again we are enabled to prove the
expansion    and   contraction  of  the two gases to be equal, if the glass
cylinder   surrounding     the bifurcated   limb of the apparatus be filled
alternately by hot steam or cold air.
     Now,   if  equal volumes of the elementary gases contain an equal
number    of atoms, it  is obvious that
         The chlorine    atom combines with     1 atom  of hydrogen,
          „    oxygen       „         „         2 atoms       „
          „    nitrogen    „          „         3    „        „
and since   there are reasons for believing that the quantity of carbon
existing in two volumes of marsh-gas (but which, as           I have pointed
out, has never been obtained in the gaseous state) represents the carbon
atom, we may add that
          The   carbon atom combines with 4 atoms       of hydrogen.

1865.]             on the Combining    Power of Atoms.               415
And in   a similar manner we may say that the atoms of the four elements
in question, when uniting with chlorine, are found to be capable of
fixing 1, 2, 3, or 4 atoms of chlorine.
                                  FIG.  5.
     These observations which, if time permitted, might be considerably
 expanded, lead us to a very important distinction of elementary atoms,
 which is based upon their atom-fixing capabilities, more shortly ex
 pressed, upon their combining powers.
     If the atom-fixing power of the chlorine atom be taken as standard
 of comparison, we are compelled to assign to the oxygen atom the two
 fold, to the nitrogen atom the threefold, and to the carbon atom the

 416                         Dr. A. W. Hofmann                      [April 7,
fourfold atom-fixing power : or, looking at this question from a different
point of view, we find that one atom of oxygen is performing the work
of two atoms of chlorine ; one atom of nitrogen, that of three ; one atom
of carbon, lastly, that of four atoms of chlorine. Hence we distinguish
the chlorine atom as univalent, the atom of oxygen as bivalent, that of
nitrogen as trivalent, and, lastly, the carbon atom as quadrivalent.
      With the recognition of these different combining powers in elemen
tary atoms we have made a very considerable step towards the solution
of the question which presented itself in the earlier part of this discourse,
viz. : How is it that the oxygen atom is fixed directly, the nitrogen
atom together with one, the carbon atom, lastly, together with two
atoms of hydrogen ?      This peculiar mode of combination is the neces
sary consequence of the special atom-fixing capabilities of the oxygen,
nitrogen, and carbon atoms ; and this        I believe I can show you by a
very simple contrivance.       I am again tempted to rely entirely on me
chanical means of elucidating the subject, and       I will on this occasion,
with your permission, select my illustration from that most delightful
of  games, croquet.
      Let the croquet balls represent our atoms, and let us distinguish the
atoms of different elements by different colours.       The white balls are
hydrogen, the green ones chlorine atoms ; the atoms of fiery oxygen are
red, those of nitrogen, blue ; the carbon atoms, lastly, are naturally repre
sented by black balls.      But we have, in addition, to exhibit the different
combining powers      of  these  atoms.    This we accomplish by screwing
into the balls a number of metallic arms (tubes and pins), which corre
spond respectively to the combining powers of the atoms represented,
and which, while constituting an additional feature of distinction,
enable us at the same time to join the balls and to rear in this manner
a kind of mechanical structures in imitation of the atomic edifices to be
illustrated.    Thus the hydrogen and chlorine atoms, which are uni
t-nit ni atoms, have each one arm, representing one combining or attraction
unit ; the atom of oxygen, a bivalent atom, has two, representing two
attraction units ; while the nitrogen and carbon atoms, respectively tri
valent and quadrivalent, are provided with three and four arms, indi
cating the three and    four combining units respectively distinguishing
these atoms.

     Of  the newly-formed building     materials let us make a preliminary
trial in constructing the four hydrogen compounds just examined.
     We start with four appropriately disposed stands as a foundation,
on each of which we place a hydrogen sphere as the first building stone.
     On one of these hydrogen atoms we fix a chlorine atom by inserting

the solid arm of the former into the tubular arm of the latter, we have
thus constructed a molecule of hydrochloric acid.                 The attraction
units of the two elements are saturated ; we can add no more ; the
building is finished.

    The next hydrogen atom we combine in a similar manner with
an atom of oxygen, but no closed molecule is thus produced.               One of
the attraction units of the oxygen is not yet saturated, as indicated by
the one arm remaining uncovered.             Only by fixing upon this arm a
second hydrogen atom we saturate this second attraction unit also.
The closed water molecule is a finished building.

    Again, an atom of nitrogen is inserted into          the hydrogen atom on
our third stand ; the two nitrogen arms which             are left exposed suffi-
cientlv indicate that two attraction units remain         unsaturated, and have
accordingly to be provided with two atoms of             an univalent element.

 If  this univalent element    be hydrogen,        the finished structure is the
 molecule of ammonia.

     In a similar manner, lastly, we perceive that when a four-armed
 carbon atom is fixed upon the hydrogen atom, the three combining
 units remain unsaturated, and that the construction of a closed molecule
 of marsh-gas can be accomplished only by the accession of three atoms
 of hydrogen.

                              Formation  of MARSH-GAS.
     At this stage we may appropriately resume the question suggested
by  the  earlier considerations of this evening. The facility with which
our newly-acquired building material may be handled, enables us to
construct even some of the more complicated substances involved in
these considerations.
     And first, the building up of the oxygen compounds of hydrochloric

1865.]              on the Combining      Power of Atoms.                 419
acid may be attempted. On opening the molecule of hydrochloric acid,
two attraction units (one belonging to the hydrogen atom, and the other
to the chlorine atom,) are liberated ; they are exactly equal to the two
attractions of the bivalent atom of oxygen.        With the insertion of an
oxygen atom we perceive that the molecule is closed again, no uncovered
arm projects, no attraction remains unbalanced. This new molecule —
we call it hypochlorous acid — we open again : again two attraction
units are liberated and saturated by a second atom of bivalent oxygen.
The molecule of hypochlorous acid is thus converted into the molecule
of chlorous acid. The insertion of one or two more oxygen atoms
under exactly similar circumstances would give rise to the formation
of the molecules respectively of chloric and of perchloric acids.
      We are thus enabled, by availing ourselves exclusively of oxygen
as building material, to convert the two-storied molecule of hydro
chloric acid successively into a three-, four-, five-storied molecule, and
ultimately even into the six-storied molecule of perchloric acid ; and
there is no reason why a happy experimentalist, by using additional
and more complicated scaffolding, should not succeed in raising still
loftier structures.

      The reason why, when uniting with a compound, oxygen joins this
compound, atom by atom, is now obvious. I5y opening a finished
molecule, two attraction units are set free ; these may be balanced by
                                                              2n2

  one atom    of oxygen, but also by a chain of two, three, four, in fact,
  of any number of oxygen       atoms.    Of the two, four, six, eight, &c.
  attraction units possessed by one, two, three, and four atoms of oxygen,
 two, four, and six units are consumed in linking these atoms into a
  chain, so that only two units, one at each end of the chain, remain at
 our disposal, and may be used in closing up again the broken
 molecule.
      Not less satisfactory is the information supplied by the considera
 tion of a series of nitrogenetted compounds. In hydride of ethyl we
 possess a molecule containing two atoms of carbon and six atoms of
hydrogen. With the view of introducing an atom of nitrogen we
 break this molecule. A glance at our model shows us at once, that
 by inserting between the fragments a nitrogen atom only, we are
 unable to reproduce a finished building, for of the three attraction
 units with which the nitrogen atom enters, two only are saturated ; one
 remains unsaturated, indeed one nitrogen arm projects uncovered.
 It is only by addition of another atom of hydrogen that the closed

      HYDRIDE OF ETHYL.
molecule of ethylamine is formed. This molecule again we open,
again we introduce an atom of nitrogen, and again we observe that
one attraction unit of the newly-added atom remains unsatisfied,
and that an additional atom of hydrogen is required for the trans
formation of ethylamine into ethylene-diamine, and so again when
ethylene-diamine is to be converted into ringltriamine.

reception of a  new atom, the number of combining units liberated               is
always two. This, as we have seen,        the number which
                                             is                saturated

                                         a                     but when
                                                                ;
these two attraction units are saturated by       nitrogen
                                                       a   atom,  one of
the attraction units of the nitrogen remains free         when they are
                                                           ;
saturated by a  chain of nitrogen atoms, the number of attraction units
remaining free must be equal to the number of atoms composing the
nitrogen chain.
     The experience acquired in the study of the oxygen and nitrogen
compounds has prepared us for the examination of the increment of
carbon. In fact,    it   is only necessary to apply the method hitherto
followed to one of the series of carbon compounds already reviewed,
to enable us to understand why the carbon atom             assimilated,
                                                           is            not
atom   by  atom, like the oxygen atom, not associated with one atom of
hydrogen like the nitrogen atom, but associated with two atoms of
hydrogen.
     We have only to remember that the carbon atom saturates four
combining units, while the nitrogen atom saturates only three.         Now,
we have seen that the rupture of       molecule involves the liberation of
                                         a
two attraction units.        The saturation of these two units by the
trivalent nitrogen atom left — 2=1 attraction unit disengaged

similar manner, if the saturation be effected by the quadrivalent carbon
atom, 4—2=2 attraction units must remain unsaturated.
     The reason why the carbon atom, when fixed by compounds,
associates with two atoms of hydrogen, — why so large           anumber of
carbon compounds differ by CHa, or a multiple thereof, — in fact, the
relation in the composition of numerous series of carbon compounds
which is   designated by the term homology,     now intelligible
                                                  is
     In attempting to illustrate this behaviour of the carbon atom by
our mechanical models, we conveniently select the molecule of marsh-
gas, the simplest compound of carbon and hydrogen, as the foundation
of our edifice.    This molecule we open for the insertion of        second
                                                                     a
carbon atom.       The two attraction units liberated by the rupture of
the molecule are saturated by two of the attraction units of the quadri
valent carbon atom, two attraction units of which remain un
saturated.     Indeed two carbon arms remain uncovered, on which we
forthwith fasten two atoms of hydrogen. The transformation of marsh-
gas into hydride  of   ethyl   thus accomplished.

     It is scarcely necessary to expand these illustrations, and if ven
ture to raise up a few more of these mechanico-chemical edifices, it is
because    I  want to show you that our building stones are available
for many other purposes.
     Hitherto we have been satisfied with examining under what con
ditions the atoms of oxygen, of nitrogen, and carbon are received into
molecular structures.       The question now presents itself, on what
terms the chlorine atom is allowed to join ?
     The model of the marsh-gas molecule is still before us. Let us
open this molecule for the reception of a chlorine atom.        Two attrac
tion units are thus liberated ; but the chlorine atom is univalent.
Accordingly two atoms of chlorine are required, one of which
combines with the hydrogen atom which we remove from the marsh-
gas, converting it into hydrochloric acid which separates, while the
other chlorine atom joins the rest of the molecule of marsh-gas.         The
new molecule, monochlorinelled marsh-gas, may be looked upon as
marsh-gas in which one atom of chlorine holds the position originally
occupied by the hydrogen atom. We are thus led up to the recognition
of new conditions of combination, conditions which have not as yet
attracted our attention this evening, but which unfold to us one of the

  most important principles of modern chemistry, the principle of substi
  tution. The monochlorinetted marsh-gas, which is a liquifiable gas,
  when again submitted to the action of chlorine loses a second, a third,
  and lastly, a fourth atom of hydrogen in the form of hydrochloric
  acid, giving rise to the formation of dichlorinetted, trichlorinetted
  marsh-gas, better known as chloroform, and, lastly, of tetrachlorinetted
  marsh-gas or tetrachloride of carbon, i. e. marsh-gas in which the four
  atoms of hydrogen are displaced by an equal number of chlorine atoms.

       Our information regarding the combining powers of atoms is thus
  materially expanded. Having already learnt that when entering into
  a molecular structure the carbon atom associates with two atoms of
  hydrogen, the atom of nitrogen with one atom of hydrogen, that the
  oxygen atom combines directly, we now find that the chlorine atom
  combines only by substitution, i. e. when a space has become vacant
  in the molecule by the expulsion of hydrogen.
        The rest of the marsh-gas molecule remaining after the introduc
  tion of one atom of chlorine, and consisting of one atom of carbon,
  combined with three atoms of hydrogen, is frequently designated by
  the name of methyl.      The aggregate of atoms CII„ the radical methyl,
  may    be traced in all the compounds obtainable from marsh-gas by the
   insertion of other atoms.    Thus by the assimilation of an oxygen atom,
   marsh-gas becomes methylic alcohol, i. e. water in which one atom
   of hydrogen is displaced by methyl, by the absorption of nitrogen
   with its tributary hydrogen, it becomes methylamine, i. e. ammonia in
    which one atom of hydrogen is displaced by methyl ; by the incor
   poration of an atom of carbon, lastly, with its pair of hydrogen atoms,
    the marsh-gas molecule is converted into methyl-marsh-gas,     e. marsh-

     facility with which the chlorine atom in chloride of methyl may be
     exchanged for other atoms, leaving the aggregate of carbon and

     atoms in methylic ammonia, the possibility of replacing even the
     oxygen and the nitrogen in these compounds, without affecting the
     methyl, the stability, lastly, of methylic marsh-gas, containing as it
     does the whole of its carbon and the whole of its hydrogen in the form
     of methyl, all these circumstances appeared to indicate the probability
     of the separate existence of methyl. Why all attempts to separate the
     atom group CH3 have remained unsuccessful ; why methyl could not
     be caught ; why, ultimately when Dr. Frankland's masterly experiments
     appeared to have precluded all chance of escape, despairing methyl
     combined with itself, surrendering as methylic marsh-gas or methyl-
     methyl ; why, in fact, it would appear to be an essential character of
     methyl not to have a separate existence : all these questions are readily
     answered by our croquet balls, which exhibit us methyl as an unfinished
     molecule, capable of conversion into the finished molecules, hydride,
     chloride, hydrate, amide and methide of methyl, but not capable of
     existing as a molecular fragment with imperfectly balanced attractions.
          Taking a farewell glance at the results we have elicited this
     evening, we may fairly ask whether the experience collected on a

 comparatively limited area is fully and unequivocally corroborated by
 the examination of a more expanded range of observations?        To this
 question we cannot unhesitatingly give an affirmative answer.   It would
 not be difficult to quote a number of substances, the construction of
 which appears to have been governed by rules of combination different
 from those which we have endeavoured to lay down. Indeed, we need
 not even go beyond the circumscribed field on which we have hitherto
moved to meet with prominent cases of exception.
     Among the several compounds of carbon and hydrogen which have
 passed through our hands this evening, we remember the two simplest,
 marsh-gas and olefiant gas.      In the marsh-gas molecule C1I,, we
 have the carbon atom completely saturated with hydrogen ; by the
entrance of a second carbon atom, with its two accessory hydrogen
atoms, we saw the molecule of marsh-gas, or hydride of methyl,
converted into the molecule of hydride of ethyl CSH..
     The formula of olefiant gas, Ci,H,, places its molecule midway
between the molecules of marsh-gas and hydride of ethyl. Comparing
olefiant gas with marsh-gas, we find that it contains one of carbon
 more than the latter, the number of hydrogen atoms being equal in
 both substances.   Contrary, then, to the rule on which we hitherto
relied, we find that the carbon atom transforming the marsh-gas
molecule into the molecule of olefiant gas, enters without carrying
along the two atoms of hydrogen, which we had accustomed ourselves
to consider as the inseparable companions of the carbon atom on such
occasions.    While frankly admitting that in olefiant gas we meet with
the first exception to a rule hitherto unbroken, we are entitled to
inquire whether there are no means of explaining this anomalous
construction of the olefiant gas molecule. Let us again apply to the
models which, in a measure, have assisted us in constructing the rule ;
perhaps they may help us also in elucidating the exception.
     In building up the molecule of olefiant gas by the insertion into the
marsh-gas molecule of one atom of carbon only, we obtain what hitherto
we would have called an unfinished molecule, i.e. a molecule in which
two of the attraction units of the second carbon atom are unsatisfied.
Indeed, a glance at our model shows us that two carbon arms project
uncovered. We are thus led to inquire whether unfinished molecules,
i.e. molecules in which a certain number of attraction units remain
unbalanced, are capable of a separate existence.        This question is
accessible   to experiment.    Olefiant gas, indeed, possesses all the
characters which, granting for argument's sake the possibility of its
existence, we are inclined to attribute to an unfinished molecule.      In
the cases hitherto considered, we saw the chlorine atom, when admitted
into a molecular structure, always entering with substitution, hydrogen
separating from the chlorinetted molecule in the form of hydrochloric
acid. In this manner we succeeded in transforming the marsh-gas
molecule successively into monochlorinettcd, di-, tri-, and, lastly, te-
trachlorinetted marsh-gas or tetrachloride of carbon. Submitting, on

 the contrary, olefiant gas to the action of chlorine, we find that the
 chlorine is fixed directly, without substitution, the chlorine atoms meet,

so to speak, with vacant spaces existing in the olefiant gas molecule ;
in order to get in, they need not expel a corresponding number of
hydrogen atoms to make room for them.             The compound generated
is the so-called Dutch liquid, an oily substance first produced by an
association of Dutch chemists at the close of the last century.            It
was the production of this oily liquid that gave rise to the name of
olefiant gas.      The number of chlorine atoms thus received directly
without substitution is two, corresponding exactly with the number
of attraction units that remained unsaturated.      Any further number of
chlorine atoms are found to enter by substitution, and by substitution
only.    Similar phenomena are observed when olefiant gas is brought
into the presence of bromine. We have here a large glass vessel con
taining some bromine and water ; the vessel, by means of a flexible
tube, is connected with a gasholder filled with olefiant gas.   On agitation,
we see the olefiant gas rushing into the vessel as into a vacuum.        The
olefiant gas fixes two atoms of bromine, being converted into a trans
parent colourless liquid, the substance called dibromide of olefiant gas.
Here again the combination takes place without substitution.
    The behaviour of olefiant gas, under the influence of chlorine and
bromine, elucidates the nature of its molecule.          The facility with
which this gas is capable of fixing two atoms of chlorine to become
Dutch liquid, two atoms of bromine to become bromide of olefiant
gas, and by roundabout processes two atoms of hydrogen to become
hydride of ethyl — all three finished molecules — characterizes olefiant
gas as a molecule interrupted in its growth, and in which the power
of resuming this growth, and the limit of its final development, may

 be traced by the simplest experiments.        The apparently anomalous
construction of the olefiant gas molecule is thus most satisfactorily
accounted for.     Indeed, far from disturbing the harmony of the rules
of combination elicited by our inquiries, a closer examination into the
nature of this compound, whilst explaining whatever appeared excep
tional in its construction, leads us, on the contrary, to a loftier inter
pretation of these rules, to the conception of compounds, the very
structure of which foreshadows the more prominent features of their
 chemical character.
     I have selected olefiant gas as an example of a class.    We remem
ber that this substance is the first term of a long list of homologous
bodies, in all of which we find similar structure combined with similar
chemical properties.      All these substances, and, let me add, a great
variety of others, we have to regard as molecules arrested under special
 circumstances at a certain stage of their development, but capable,
under favourable conditions, of growing again, until by the perfect
balance of the atomic attractions within, they have ultimately arrived
at maturity.
     We have thus been led, step by step, to a distinction of a novel
kind, that of finished and unfinished molecules ; or, to use the more
frequently employed expression, that of saturated and non-saturated
compounds.      I need not tell you that this distinction carries us to the
threshold of a new field of research, hitherto crossed only by a small
band of fearless pioneers, who are encountering difficulties on all sides.
Admitting, as we are compelled to do, the existence of what we have
called unfinished molecules, we inquire under what special conditions,
at what special stages the growth of a molecule may be arrested ? How
is it that as yet the marsh-gas molecule is known only in the finished
state, CH4) that none of the fragmentary marsh-gases, CHa, CHS, and
CH„ which might exist, have ever been obtained? Again, how is it
that the molecule of hydride of ethyl exists, so to speak, finished and
unfinished ; and, lastly, that of the several fragmentary states in which
this molecule might be met with, two only, namely the two states,
C« H4 (olefiant gas), and C, H» (acetylene), have ever been observed ?
We are thus brought face to face with some of the most deeply inter
esting problems of chemical mechanics, in the solution of which the
exertions of chemists are engaged at the present moment.       I must not,
however, dwell upon the interest attached to this new line of inquiry,
upon the numerous experiments which the idea of saturated and non-
saturated compounds has already suggested, and on the influence it is
likely to exercise on the direction of chemical investigation for some
time to come.
     Nor am     I permitted to follow these speculations into another
direction.   I have to forego, more especially, the pleasure of submitting
to you some of the ingenious explanations which Professor Kekule, to
whom we are greatly indebted for the development of this branch of
chemistry, has advanced for the elucidation even of saturated com

 elaboration  of this subject may appear, it would lead me inevitably
beyond the   legitimate limits of a Friday evening lecture at the Royal
Institution.
     Indeed  my time, and,   I  fear, your patience, are exhausted, and   I
must add but few concluding words.               Your attention so kindly
bestowed on my remarks will not,        I trust, have been entirely thrown
away, if   I have succeeded in convincing you that modern chemistry is
not, as it has so long appeared, an ever-growing accumulation of
isolated facts, as impossible for a single intellect to co-ordinate as for
a single memory to grasp.
     The intricate formulae that hang upon these walls, and the bound
less variety of phenomena they illustrate, are beginning to be for us as
a labyrinth once impassable, but to which we have at length discovered
the clue.    A  sense of mastery and power succeeds in our minds to the
sort of weary despair with which we at first contemplated their for
midable array.     For now, by the aid of a few general principles, we
find ourselves able to unravel the complexities of these formulae, to
marshal the compounds which they represent in orderly series ; nay,
even to multiply their numbers at our will, and in a great measure
to forecast their nature ere we have called them into existence.      It is
the great movement of modern chemistry that we have thus, for an
hour, seen passing before us. It is a movement as of light spreading
itself over a waste of obscurity, as of law diffusing order throughout a
wilderness of confusion, and there is surely in its contemplation some
thing of the pleasure which attends the spectacle of a beautiful day
break, something of the grandeur belonging to the conception of a
world created out of chaos.

account for the dynamical actions within or without the body. The

food co-operated in this work was brought under review. The third

     The speaker then examined the food of soldiers during peace as giv
ing a fair average of food required by adult men, of soldiers engaged
in work like the Royal Engineers, and of those exposed to the fatigues
of war, as giving diets necessary for labourers. The following averages
were given in ounces     : —

Edinburgh.

  432               Dr. Lyon Playfair        on the  Food of Man           [April  28,
       Active labour     was defined to consist of work which would enable a
  man   to walk twenty miles every day throughout the year, except on
  Sundays.      The labour during war is much the same, for soldiers
 marching     fourteen    miles daily, with 60 lbs. weight of accoutrements,
 exercise labour amounting to 776,160 foot pounds, while the pedestrian
 walking twenty miles exerts a force of 792,000 foot pounds.
      In the second division of the discourse, the speaker showed that the
 common experience of mankind is in favour of the nitrogenous ingre
 dients of food being the source of dynamical work. Horses and men,
 when labouring, are provided with food rich in such substances, and
 their labour was shown by numerical data to be proportional to the
 amount of the former. Thus the work of a horse, divided by the work
 of an ox, gives the ratio 1 : 1'43, while the plastic food of these ani
 mals, treated in the same way, yields 1 : l'44. In the same way, the
 work of a horse is eight times greater than that of a man, and the
 plastic food used for the external dynamical labour of each is nearly in
 the same proportion.         The equation of decomposition used by the
 author is the following one : —
                                    Urea or                      «l,L
                 Albumen.                               Carbonic         W.ter.
                                            ^*w*rbonlc
     C,.  Hs8  N.   0,.  + 100 O =    3 (CO, (NH,)a) +     21 CO. +    13 (H, O,)
      In this equation,   the small quantity of sulphur in albumen is viewed
as oxygen.       The simplicity of the equation is remarkable ; for of the
two forms of carbonic acid produced, the one, amido-carbonic acid,
 passes away per vesicant, and gaseous carbonic acid perhalitem.                Seven
times    as much carbon should appear in the latter as in the former
secretion, and this is exactly what has been found in the case of dogs
 fed with flesh free from fat.          Using Andrew's units of heat and the
above equation, one ounce of transformed tissue (28-35 grammes) would
 raise 126'5 kilogrammes of water, 1°          C,  or converted into its mechani
cal equivalent by Joule's number 425, would raise 53,762 kilogrammes
one metre high.*         These numbers are easily applied.           Soldiers during
 peace are well exercised by a march of seven miles daily. Their useful
external work is therefore 38,333 metre kilogrammes; while the poten
tial energy in the 3-94 oz. of flesh-formers (remaining after deducting
the amount in the alvine evacuations) is 211,822 metre kilogrammes.
But the internal dynamical work of the heart, respiratory and other
movements, require 107,524 metre kilogrammes, so that the residue of
 104,298 metre kilogrammes represents              nearly three times as much
potential energy       as  useful  work.     The   same method of calculation
being    applied    to a  labourer,   shows   that  the 3-5 oz. of flesh-formers,
applied    to external     dynamical     work,   would,    after deduction, yield
   • In this estimation the carbon in urea is supposed to be oxidized into carbonic
oxide; but it would be still more in favour of the view if urea were taken as the
residue, and six atoms more of hydrogen were oxidized.

  172,125 metre kilogrammes, the useful work of the labourer being
 109,496 metre kilogrammes.
      The speaker then showed that the fat contained in the muscles was
 quite insufficient to account for the useful work done.           While the
 wasted muscles of a non-labouring man would yield 506 kilogramme
 units of heat, the fat resident in them would give only 87 kilogramme
 units.
     The third division of the discourse treated of the secretions as
measures of work.      A man living on a subsistence diet should excrete
267 grs. of urea daily, and we find that 264 grs. have been actually
found under such circumstances. Soldiers on the diet of peace should
 have from 560 to 580 grains of urea in their excretions, and the mean
 of Haughton of 575 grs. represents this quantity. An active labourer
ought to have 735 grs. of urea in the urine, and forgemen in engineer
 ing works were found to have 740 grains, while active pedestrians were
found to have as much as 800 to 850 grs.          The same people on days
 of rest, as on Sundays, had only 500 grs.
     The amount of nitrogen secreted per anum was viewed as the
measure of digestive or assimilative work.          One-twelfth of the flesh-
formers consumed in food pass away in a state of health in the alvine
evacuations as exhausted digestive ferments.          These, the speaker con
tended, were merely slightly oxidized flesh-formers, ready for assimila
tion and secreted to prepare the food for absorption into the blood.
A small portion of them were exhausted in the act, and were then
excreted per anum, but much the largest portion was reabsorbed into
the blood, and was used for the formation of tissues.
     In bad digestion, or with excess of food more than one-twelfth of
the flesh-formers is necessarily found in the alvine evacuations.

                On Magenta and its Derivative Colours.
Three    years ago, in this theatre, Dr. Hofmann delivered his celebrated
discourse on Mauve and Magenta, and it might seem temerity in me
to trespass upon the premises of so great and distinguished a master,
were it not remembered that during that interval rapid strides had been
made in organic chemistry, and especially, perhaps, in the direction of
the aniline colours.
     Although   I  will endeavour to confine myself as much as possible
to the immediate subject of the discourse, it will be necessary to glance
for a few moments at the history of Aniline, the progenitor of nearly
all the beautiful compounds you see around the table.
     Aniline was discovered in the year 1826, by Unverdorben, who
obtained it from the destructive distillation of indigo.             A short time
afterwards, Runge and Fritsche observed that by the action of strong
hydrate of potash upon the dye, aniline was eliminated in far greater
quantity.    Indigo in small fragments is heated in a retort with a strong
solution of caustic potash, and in the distillate, which consists of many
products, there is found a thin and nearly colourless fluid, having a
specific gravity of 1,028, a peculiar but not disagreeable odour, and a
pungent biting taste.       When kept for some time, even in the dark and
in stoppered bottles, it assumes a darker tint, and becomes ultimately
a very dark brown.          Unverdorben called it " crystalline," Runge
" kyonal," and Fritsche " aniline."
     This substance is a nitrogenized base, and is capable, when com
bined with acids, of forming those beautiful crystallized salts, nearly
all of which have been carefully examined by Dr. Hofmann and other
chemists.
     There are many other         sources   besides    indigo, from which aniline
may    be obtained.      For commercial purposes it            is always prepared
from nitro-benzol,     a substance      derived from the action of nitric acid
upon benzol.

aniline.

Benzol was originally discovered by Mr. Faraday in 1825, in his investi
gations upon the gaseous products from oils subsequently obtained by the
decomposition of benzoic acid by means of caustic lime. Mr. Mans
field, however, succeeded in producing it in much larger quantities
from coal-tar naphtha.     When the lighter portions of this compound are
distilled fractionally until a constant boiling point of 180° F. is arrived
at, the product consists of pure benzol, identical with the carbo-hydro-
gen obtained by Mr. Faraday.
     From the earliest discovery of aniline it was noticed that certain
oxidizing agents when mixed with a solution of its salts produced a fine
violet tint. Even in minute quantities, a few drops of hypochlorite of
lime render it purple.       There is another test for aniline, which      I
                                        I
will show you, and which, as far as am aware, has not been observed
previously.     If the red gases obtained by the decomposition of nitric
acid by starch or sugar, be passed into an aqueous solution of aniline,
the liquid speedily assumes a yellow colour, owing to the formation of
a new base — azophenylamine,       which is gradually precipitated as a
bright yellow powder. It was not, however, until the year 1856 that
aniline was applied to any great practical purpose, although from the
beauty of its compounds, and from its comparative accessibility, it had
from the time of its discovery become a great favourite with chemists.
     Mr. Perkin was the first who produced colour on an extensive scale
from this base.    He added a solution of bichromate of potash to a salt
of aniline, and from the precipitate thereby produced, he isolated a
magnificent purple dye, he termed " mauve," which at once became
popular, and indeed at the time almost universal.          It may truly be
said that this discovery has identified Mr. Perkin with the aniline
colours, and that he will be always associated with one of the most
striking and brilliant passages in the history of chemistry as applied to
the industrial arts.
     It cannot be supposed that such a discovery would be allowed to
rest.    A mine had been opened which chemists began to explore, and
in such numbers, and with such avidity and zeal, as almost to lead us
to anticipate that its riches will soon be exhausted.         The action of
numerous bodies upon aniline and its homologues were found to be
productive of colour.     Nitrate of silver, nitrate of mercury, chloride
of mercury, chloride of tin, arsenic acid, iodine, and many others, when
heated with the base, gave a rich crimson colour, in more or less
abundance ; and, although it would be impossible for me to enter into
a disquisition on the comparative merits of these various methods for
the production of colour,  I trust to be able to produce magenta, although
in somewhat crude form, at this lecture table, and also to dye this
tassel of silk from a solution of its salt.    The reagent  I will employ is
iodine.    A few crystals of this element are placed in a tube with about

twice their weight of aniline. Heat is at once evolved, and with the
assistance of a higher temperature from the spirit lamp, you will ob
serve, that in a few moments intense colour is developed. If a few
drops are now poured into spirit, and this solution added to water, a
fine rose-coloured tint will appear.
        It may seem strange to those who have read Dr. Hofmann's beau
tiful researches upon the aniline substitutive products, his chloraniline,
 bromaniline, iodaniline, and a multitude of others, that he had not ob
 served this curious reaction ; and this leads me to tell you, en passant,
 for time will not allow me to dwell upon this interesting topic to-night,
 that aniline, when perfectly pure, does not yield any amount of colour
 with most of the reagents mentioned above — a most important fact dis
 covered by Dr. Hofmann and Mr. Nicholson, and which has given rise
 to one of the most difficult questions which yet remain to be answered.
  I   will simply say that it appears that there must be a homologue of
  aniline present with that base to produce the colour you see before you,
  although that homologue, per se, will give no colour whatever. Thus,
  for example, toluidine, C7 IL, N, when treated with oxidizing agents,
  does not produce colour; let it be mixed with aniline, and the dye is
  immediately developed.
         The tintorial power of the salts of magenta is something marvel
   lous.      No dye that     I  have examined, whether from the animal,
    mineral, or vegetable world, can bear comparison for one moment with
   this crimson colour obtained from aniline. One grain in a million
    times its weight of water gives a pure red, in ten millions a rose pink,
    in twenty millions a decided blush, and even in fifty millions, with a
    white screen behind the vessel in which it is dissolved, an evident glow.
     Magenta has been carefully studied and analyzed by Dr. Hofmann, who
    gives us the following formula —
                                 C,0H„N,0,H,0
         Although the salts of magenta are possessed of such wonderful
     colouring capacity, the base itself is colourless ; and it is remarkable
     that the union of base and acid for the formation of a salt does not
     appear to take place in dilute solutions in the cold, at any rate not im
     mediately. In these two vessels, one containing hot and the other cold
     water, an equal quantity of magenta base is added, and also an equal
     amount of dilute sulphuric acid. In the hot liquid colour is instan
     taneously developed ; in the cold solution the liquid remains colourless.
      If now hot water be introduced to raise the temperature, you will
     observe at once the characteristic rose tint.        It may be imagined,
      therefore, that having free acid in a solution of base without production
     of colour, it is possible to have free alkali in a coloured solution of a
     salt of the base without depriving it of its tint.    Such is the case,
      to a hot solution of acetate of magenta, for example, caustic soda is
      added, the colour is immediately discharged, but in a cold solut
      colour remains for a long time unchanged.

440        Mr. Field    on Magenta and its    Derivative Colours.     [May   12,
      Dr. Hofmann discovered, about a year ago, that when magenta, or as
 it  is termed in chemical language, rosaniline, is heated with iodide of
 ethyl, a change is effected, and a substitution product formed, which
 was termed ethyl-rosaniline.         The salts of this new base, unlike
 magenta, dissolve with a beautiful violet colour, and are capable of
 affording most remarkable manifestations.         The dark violet liquid, on
 the addition of sulphuric acid, becomes colourless ; on adding ammonia
 the original purple is restored.     If  hydrochloric acid is added in small
 quantities,  the  liquid changes  to blue ; if in larger quantities, to a bril
 liant green.     When this green solution is thrown into water, so as to
 dilute the acid, the original violet returns.
       When aniline is heated with salts of magenta, purple and blue
 colours are produced, all of which are now extensively employed in
 commerce, and afford tints of great brilliancy and beauty.           The blue
 is perfectly insoluble in water, but readily soluble in alcohol, and is
 capable of dyeing both silk and wool with the greatest facility.
      Mr. Nicholson patented a method a few years ago for obtaining a
 beautiful blue dye, soluble in water, which consisted in heating the
 phenyl blue in strong sulphuric acid until a drop of the semi-liquid
thrown into water was found to be entirely dissolved. This compound,
 however, although very applicable for silks, refuses to impart its colour
 to wool, which may be exemplified by immersing two white tassels in
the liquid — the silk is immediately dyed, while the wool remains un
changed.      The effect is still more striking upon cotton. We have here
the letters R, I. (the initials of the Royal Institution) worked in silk
upon a cotton ground : after dipping it for a few moments in this bath
the letters will become blue, and the cotton continue white.
      Aniline green, which has lately become so popular, is produced by
the action of aldehyde and some other deoxidizing agents upon rosa
niline.     This is one of the most charming colours yet discovered, but
has not been (as far as its chemical nature is concerned) satisfactorily
 investigated.     To judge of its purity of tint, it is only necessary to
compare the commercial greens, prepared by various mixtures of yellow
and blue, with the dye in question, to observe the infinite superiority of
the latter.
      Aniline brown may be formed by the action of chloride of aniline
upon either magenta or violet, at a high temperature. Great destruction
of colour doubtless takes place, but the brown produced is remarkably
beautiful.     The compound, however, is not definite, nor can it be
classed among the true chemical products derived either from aniline
or rosaniline.
      It has been observed that magenta base is colourless : this may be
said, probably, of the bases of most of the colours before you. On this
white board I have traced the letters composing the word "Aniline"
in seven colourless bases derived from that compound.             A, in ethyl-
rosaniline ; N, in phenyl-violet, approaching indigo in colour ; I, in
phenyl-blue;      L, in aniline green; I, in azo-phenylamine ; N, in
chrysaniline; and E, in rosaniline.         On converting these bases into

salts, which is easily effected by sprinkling    them with acetic acid and
spirit, the seven letters should be visible      in the seven colours of the
rainbow — violet, indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, and red.
     I will now throw a beam from the electric lamp upon the specimens
of silk on the screen, and it will be observed how much their brilliancy
is increased under the influence of that pure and beautiful light.      I am
indebted to my kind friends, Messrs. Simpson, Maule, and Nicholson,
for the various splendid specimens of dye and other aniline products,
and to Messrs. Hands, Son, and Co., Coventry, the eminent silk dyers,
for the array of silks so kindly furnished me for the illustration of my
discourse.

 On the Physical and Chemical         Constitution  of the Fixed Stars and
                                   Nebula.
THE speaker     commenced      with a few preliminary remarks on the
 peculiar relation in which the heavenly bodies stand to man.           It is
alone from these lights shining upon us from distant space that we can
 obtain any knowledge of the parts of the universe which are without
 the earth.   The experimentalist who seeks to bring to light the truths
 which lie hidden beneath terrestrial phenomena, can subject the ob
jects of his research to each other's influence and to the various forms
 of force ; but the astronomer is left to the indications afforded by the
 sense of sight alone, for the interpretation of the heavens.       The dis
tances, magnitudes, and relative motions of the sun, moon, and planets
have been obtained with great exactness, but in an important respect
our knowledge of the heavenly bodies was at fault.            Until quite re
cently we possessed no knowledge from observation of the structure
and chemical constitution of the sun, the fixed stars, and the nebulae.
Fortunately, for the increase of our knowledge, the cause of failure
lay not in that the light of these bodies is wanting in sufficient indica
tions of their nature, but in that the unaided eye has no power to per

 442            Mr. Hug gins   on the Physical and Chemical       [May  19,
 ceive the indications by which the light of each of the heavenly bodies
 is specially distinguished.
       Newton opened the way to a knowledge of these unperceived
 qualities of light.    He was the first to show that by the refractive
 power of a prism of glass, the component rays of a beam of light could
  be separated and presented to the eye as a band of blending colours.
 Wollaston and Fraunhofer discovered that the colours of the spectrum
  of solar light are not continuous, but are interrupted by transverse
 linear spaces where the light is wanting. In these lines of darkness of
 the solar and stellar spectra, the chemical nature of the sun and stars
 stands written in cipher, but for half a century the lines of Fraunhofer
 remained uninterpreted.
      In 1859 Kirchhoff announced the law by which these dark lines
 can be deciphered.     He immediately applied his method of interpreta
 tion to the light of the sun, and discovered in that body the presence of
 several of the elementary forms of matter which enter into the compo
 sition of the earth.
      The speaker stated that it was his intention on this occasion to
 bring before the members of the Institution the results of the extension
 of this method of analysis by the prism to the heavenly bodies other
 than the sun.    These researches have been carried on in his observa
 tory during the last three years ; and in respect of the greater part of
 these observations, viz. those on the moon, the planets, and the fixed
 stars, he has had the great pleasure of working conjointly with his dis
 tinguished friend, Prof. W. A. Miller.
      The speaker then referred briefly to the principles of spectrum
 analysis, upon which their interpretation of the phenomena observed
 in the spectra of the heavenly bodies was based, stating that spectra
 may be arranged under three orders, viz. : —
      1. A continuous   spectrum unbroken by bright or dark lines, which
 indicates that the light has not undergone any modification on its way
 to us.    Also that its source is an opaque body, almost certainly in the
 solid or liquid state.   Such a spectrum gives no information of the
 chemical nature of the substance from which the light emanates.
      2. A spectrum of bright lines separated by dark spaces ; this in
 forms us that the source of the light is matter in the gaseous state. By
 a comparison of the bright lines of such a spectrum with the lines of
 terrestrial flames we may discover whether any of these terrestrial
substances exist in the distant and unknown source of light.          The
spectra of many of the nebulae are of this order.
      3. A continuous spectrum     interrupted by dark lines ; this shows
that the light has passed through vapours which have deprived it of
certain refrangibilities by a power of selective absorption.
      Since Kirchhoff has shown that these dark lines agree exactly in
position with the bright lines which the vapours would emit if in a
luminous state, a comparison of these dark lines with the bright lines of
terrestrial vapours will indicate whether any ofthe.se are present in the
vapours through which the light luis passed.         The spectra of the

 1865.]             Constitution   of the Fixed Stars and Nebula:.                    443
 fixed stars are of this order.            In the case of these bodies, the vapours
 that produce the dark lines immediately surround them, and are those
of the substances of their surfaces.              The chemical constitution of the
stellar atmospheres will correspond, at least in part, with that of the
stars themselves.
      The speaker then described the special form of apparatus by
which he and Prof. Miller have compared the spectra of the stars
 by a method of simultaneous observation, with the spectra of many of
 the terrestrial elements.*
       This apparatus is adapted to the eye-end of an achromatic telescope
 of eight inches aperture. The telescope is mounted equatorially, and
 follows the star to which it is directed by means of an accurately ad
justed clock-motion.
       The point of light which            a star forms in the focus of the object-
 glass is lengthened in one direction only by a cylindrical lens.                    The
 short line of light falls upon a narrow slit, and the diverging rays are
 rendered parallel by an achromatic lens.               They are then refracted by
 two prisms of dense flint glass of 60°. The spectrum is viewed with
 a small         achromatic telescope which is carried by a micrometer
 screw.        By means of this the observer can measure with great pre
 cision the position of the stellar lines relatively to those of the solar
 spectrum.
       The spectra for comparison were obtained from the spark of an in
  duction coil taken between electrodes of various metals.                 Sometimes a
  wire of platinum surrounded with cotton and moistened with a solution
  of the substance required was employed. The light from the spark is
  reflected by a small movable mirror upon a reflecting prism covering
  one half of the slit. By this arrangement the spectrum of the star and
  the spectrum of the metal compared with it, are seen in juxtaposition,
  and the coincidence or the relative position of a dark line in the stellar
  spectrum with a bright line in the metallic spectrum can be determined
  with very great precision.              These comparisons are observations of
  great delicacy, and can be satisfactorily made on the finest nights only.

   under varied conditions of illumination.              As yet no strongly marked

   a lunar atmosphere of considerable extent.                The mode of disappear-

   obtained by measurement only, of a few strong lines in several stars.

of the feebleness of its light.             Some     of  the lines  produced by its at

      Mars.—      The lines characterizing the atmospheres of Jupiter and
 Saturn are     not   present in the spectrum of Mars. Groups of lines ap

 predominance       of  the   red rays, may be the cause of the red colour which
 distinguishes the light of this planet.
      Venus.—      All the stronger lines of the solar spectrum were seen in
 the brilliant light of Venus, but no additional lines indicating an ab

       In the case of most of the planets the solar light is probably re
 flected not from the planetary surface, but from clouds at some eleva
  tion above it ; under such circumstances the light would not be
  subjected to the absorbent action of the lower and denser portions of
  the planet's atmosphere, which are precisely those of our atmosphere,
  which are most effectual in producing the so-called atmospheric lines.

        Since these bodies are self-luminous, we may hope to gain by pris

  do of the planets which all shine by reflecting the sun's light.
       What are the stars ? Endeavour with the most powerful telescopes
  to approach them, still they assume no apparent size ; they remain under
  the highest magnifying powers what they appear to the unaided eye,
  diskless, brilliant points.
       Until quite recently, our knowledge of the stars might be summed
 up thus : — that they shine; that they are immensely distant ; that the
 motions of some of them show them to be composed of matter endowed
 with a power of mutual attraction.

      The 70 or 80 lines  measured represent some of the stronger only of
the numerous lines which are seen in the spectra of these stars.   Some
of these are probably due to the vapours of other terrestrial elements
which have not been compared with these stars.       would be assumption         It
to suppose that the 65 so-called elements constitute in its entirety the
primary material of the universe. Doubtless in the spectra of the stars
the chemist is introduced to many new elements — would that it were
possible for him to recognize and to isolate them !

     The dark lines of absorption are strongest in the spectra of stars,
the light of which is tinted with yellow or red. In white stars the lines,
though equally numerous, are very fine and faint, with the exception of
 the lines of hydrogen which are relatively very strong.              This suggests
 a peculiar condition of the investing atmospheres               of white stars ; a
modification depending possibly upon their high temperature.
     A comparison of the spectra of stars which differ in the colour of
their light suggested the opinion that the colours of the stars have their
                                                                        *
origin in the chemical constitution of their atmospheres.
     Since the source of the light of the stars is intensely heated solid
(possibly liquid) matter, the light at the time of emission would be
white alike in all the stars.
     The colours of the spectrum in which the lines of absorption are
most closely grouped, would be subdued in power relatively to the
other colours, which would then predominate in the light of the star.
This opinion is supported by the different arrangements of the lines in the
spectra of the orange and blue components of the double star /8 Cygni.
     From the additional knowledge which these spectrum observations
give us, we are entitled to conclude that in plan of structure the stars
closely resemble the sun. The source of their light is probably solid
matter,* in a highly incandescent state.              Around this photosphere,
there exists an atmosphere of vapours of such of the elements of the
stars as are volatile at their high temperature.
     A community of matter appears to exist throughout the visible
universe, for the stars contain many of the elements which exist in the
sun and earth.
     It is remarkable that the elements most widely diffused through
the host of stars are some of those most closely connected                  with the
living organisms       of   our   globe, including hydrogen,         sodium,    mag
nesium, and iron.       May it not be that, at least, the brighter stars are
like our sun, the upholding and energizing centres of systems of
worlds, adapted to be the abode of living beings ?

     Besides the stars, the heavens are mottled over with feebly shining
cloudlike patches and spots, often presenting strange and fantastic
forms.      Between 5000 and 6000 of these so-called Nebula are
known.      What is the nature of these strange objects ? Dense swarms
of suns melted into one mass by their enormous distance ?                    Chaotic

    * The phenomena of the solar spots appear to show that the solid matter of
the sun's photosphere exists in a finely-divided state, and may be compared to the
carbon in an ordinary gas-flame, or to the cloud of phosphoric      acid when phos
phorus is burnt in oxygen.    The snn'ssurface consists of this matter separated into
masses, which are neither uniform in size nor regular in form ; they may be com
pared to clouds.

 prism of objects so feebly luminous appeared hopeless.
     In August last, the speaker directed his telescope, armed with the
spectrum apparatus, to a small but comparatively bright nebula,
37 H. iv.      His surprise was great to observe, that in place of a band
of coloured light, such as the spectrum of a star would appear, the
light of this object remained concentrated in three bright, bluish-green
lines, separated by dark intervals.          This order of spectrum showed the
source of the light was luminous gas. The brightest of the three lines
has a position in the spectrum about midway between b and F.                   More
refrangible than this line, and separated from it by a dark interval, a
fainter line occurs. The third and faintest line coincides with F, and
with a line of hydrogen. The brightest line agrees in position with
the brightest of the lines of nitrogen.            The line intermediate in re-
frangibility does not correspond with any of the elements compared
with   it

      A careful examination of different portions of the Dumbbell
 nebula, and of the great nebula in Orion, showed that both these
 nebulae are uniform in constitution throughout, the light from one part
 differs from that of another in intensity alone.
      The nebulae 37 H. iv. and 73 H. iv., in addition to the bright lines,
 give a faint continuous spectrum ; this was proved to be due to the
 light of the nucleus.
      These observations appear to authorize the following opinions of
 the nature and structure of those of the nebulae which give a spectrum
 of bright lines.
      1. The light from these nebulae emanates from intensely heated
 matter existing in the state of gas.         This conclusion is corroborated by
 the great feebleness which distinguishes the light from the nebulae.
 A circular portion of the sun's disk subtending 1' would give a light
 equal to 780 full moons, yet many of the nebulae, though they subtend
 a much larger angle, are invisible to the naked eye.*              Upon the earth,

luminous gas emits a light which is very inferior in splendour to in
 candescent solid matter.
      2.   If  these enormous masses of gas are luminous throughout, the
 light   from    the portions of gas beyond the surface visible to us, would
 be in a great measure extinguished by the absorption of the gas through
 which it would have to pass. These gaseous nebulae would, therefore,
 present to us little more than a luminous surface.            This consideration
 may assist in explaining the strange apparent forms of some of the
 nebulae.
      3. It is probable that two of the constituents of these nebulae are
 the elements, hydrogen and nitrogen, unless the absence of the other
 lines of the spectrum of nitrogen indicates a form of matter more
 elementary than nitrogen.         The third gaseous substance is at present
 unrecognized.
      4. The uniformity and extreme simplicity of the spectra of all these
 nebulae oppose the opinion that this gaseous matter represents               the
 " nebulous fluid " suggested by Sir William Herschel, out of which
 stars are elaborated by a process of subsidence and condensation.             In
 such a primordial fluid all the elements entering into the composition of
 the stars should be found.       If these existed in these nebulae, the spectra
of their light would be as crowded with bright lines as the stellar
spectra are with dark lines.
     The supposition can scarcely be entertained that the three bright
lines indicate a more primary and simple condition of matter ; for then,
if the process of elaboration into stars be now taking place, we should
expect to find in some of the nebulae, or in some parts of them, a more
advanced state towards the formation of the separate elements of which
we now know the stars to consist. Such an advance would be indicated
by an increased number of bright lines.           It is difficult to suppose that
the excessively high temperature of the nebulae keeps in check affinities
by which, if unrestrained, the formation of the elements would take
place; for in some of the nebulae a nucleus exists, which from its con
tinuous spectrum, its greater brightness, and apparent separation from
the surrounding gas, we must regard as containing solid or liquid
matter. At a temperature at which matter can become liquid or solid
(though from peculiar conditions that temperature may be a very
exalted one) we cannot suppose the formation of the chemical elements
to be restrained by excessive heat.
     5. A progressive formation of some character is suggested by the
presence of more condensed portions, and in some nebulae, of a nucleus.
Nebulae which give a continuous spectrum and yet show but little
indication of resolvability, such as the great nebula in Andromeda, are
not necessarily clusters of stars.      They may be gaseous nebulae, which
by the loss of heat or the influence of other forces have become crowded
with portions of matter in a more condensed and opaque condition.
     6.   If  the observations of Lord Rosse, Professor Bond, and others
are accepted in favour of the partial resolution of the annular nebula
in Lyra, and the great nebula in Orion into discrete bright points,

1865.]          Dr.  Pence Jones on Chemical Circulation.               449
these nebulae must be regarded not as simple masses of gas, but as
systems formed by the aggregation of gaseous masses.          Is it possible
that the permanence of general form of these nebulae may be maintained
by the motions of these separate masses ?
     7. The opinion of the enormous distance of the nebulae from our
system, since it has been founded upon the supposed extent of remote
ness at which stars of considerable brightness would cease to be sepa
rately visible in our telescopes, has no longer any foundation on which
to rest in reference at least to those of the nebulae which give a spec
trum of bright lines. It may be that some of these are not more dis
tant from us than the brighter stars.
     8. As far as the speaker's observations extend, they appear to be in
favour of the opinion that these nebulae are gaseous systems possessing
a structure and a purpose in relation to the universe altogether distinct
from the great cosmical masses to which the sun and the fixed stars
belong.    What is this special purpose?        Many fascinating theories
present themselves in connection with the great problems of the con
servation of the energy of the universe, and of the source and main
tenance of solar and stellar heat.    In the opinion of the speaker science
will be more advanced by the slow and laborious accumulation of facts,
than by the easier feat of throwing off brilliant speculations.

       our knowledge usually passes through three stages as it advances
 to perfection.   First, a stage in which we think we know everything ;
 then a stage in which we find we know nothing ; and, finally, a stage
 in which we rapidly obtain those clear and connected ideas in which
 all sound knowledge consists.
     As regards the absorbent system of animals and the mode of action
 of remedies, we have long been in the first or second stage, and this
 evening I hope to show you that there is reason for believing that in
 regard to these subjects we are about to enter on the third stage ; for

that, in addition to the circulation of the blood, there is the dawn of
another or chemical circulation, dependent in part on the mechanical
circulation, but carried on mostly by diffusion from the blood into the
textures, and from the textures into the absorbents, which thus become
necessary agents for performing those actions of oxidation and nutrition
on which, in great part, animal life depends.
     Mr. Huggins, in his discourse last week, showed us how the spec
trum-analysis can determine the chemical composition and the physical
constitution even of substances outside those circulating bodies that
constitute our solar system.     And as the nebulae and fixed stars are
beginning to be analyzed, so in the microcosm of our own bodies sub
stances that are outside the circulating system of the blood can (by the
peculiar light they give when burnt) be analyzed with such delicacy
that elements can now be therein discovered which all other modes of
analysis would entirely overlook.
     The human body, in this discourse, may be regarded as consisting
of four parts — a funnel, a circle, an envelope, and a drain.
    The laws of diffusion modified by pressure determine the passage
of all substances from the funnel into the circulation, from the circle
into the envelope, and from the envelope or circle to the drains. To
Mr. Graham we owe the investigation of the laws of diffusion of
gases and liquids ; and the division of substances into crystalloids
and colloids.    One or two experiments, and for them     I  am indebted
to Mr. Ansell and to Mr. Graham, will make the meaning of these
terms more clear to you.     Inside and outside this porous cell there is
at present atmospheric air.    There is no passage of the outer air into
the inside of the cell, nor of the inside air to the outside of the cell ;
but if hydrogen is put outside, being lighter than common air, it
rapidly passes into the inside of the cell, whilst the heavier air inside
more slowly passes out ; and thus pressure is produced inside the cell,
and the index shows how much pressure exists.           So also with this
india-rubber ball.    When the gases inside and out differ, the lighter
gas will pass rapidly in, and such an alteration of form will occur that
a spring will be liberated and this bell will say that light gas has
passed through the india-rubber ball.      Mr. Ansell has invented this
test for the explosive gas in coal mines, that it may ring its own alarm.
In these beautiful illustrations of Mr. Anderson's the same excess
of diffusion of the lighter over the heavier gas is shown more slowly.
Originally over both jars the india-rubber was flat. But throngh this
concave india-rubber the hydrogen has more rapidly passed out than
the air has passed in ; and through the convex rubber the hydrogen has
more rapidly passed in than the atmospheric air has passed out.
    So with these liquids, for which    I am indebted to Mr. Graham.
Here is a very diffusible crystalloid substance, acetate of rosaniline,
or magenta ; and in this other vessel there is a much less diffusible
or colloid substance, cochineal. In half an hour the crystalloid will
pass through the membrane, whilst the colloid will show no signs of
passage.

 1865.J         on the Chemical    Circulation in  the Body.            451
      Here is another semisolid contrast. In the one jar there is bi
chromate of potash in gelatine above, with pure gelatine below; and in
the other cochineal in gelatine above and pure gelatine below : the
bichromate diffuses whilst the cochineal is unmoved.
      The same laws of diffusion modified by pressure determine in the
body the passage of substances from the funnel into the circulation,
from i lie circulation into the tissues or ducts, and from the tissues back
 through the absorbents to the circulation.
      The circulation must not be regarded as the stem of a tree curled
 round on itself, but rather as a series of circles formed by each terminal
 branch-twig joining a terminal twig of the root. The enormous num
ber of these terminal circles may be seen in any injected preparation of
any part of the body. The whole substance seems to consist of these
 vessels alone.   The walls of these vessels are of the finest membrane,
 through which diffusion takes place with the greatest rapidity into the
 tissues beyond the circulation.     These tissues constitute the different
organs of the body, nerves, muscles, glands, ligaments, bones, &c.
 Each particle of each nerve, muscle, or gland, is encompassed by
 blood-vessels on which its growth and its action depend ; but there are
 some few spots in the body where blood-vessels would be dangerous to
 the function of the part.    These parts may be called the fixed stars of
 our microcosm, they seem outside the circulating system which binds
together the rest of the body.
      The most numerous of these fixed stars are the cartilages of the
joints ; and at a far greater distance may be placed the most remarkable
 twin stars of our body, the crystalline lenses, which, without any cir
 culation of their own, are separated from all circulation by an aqueous
 and glassy fluid, which themselves also have no circulation.           The
 lenses then might well be thought to be altogether free from all the
 multitude of disturbing substances that enter through the funnel into
 the circulation of man.     By this model, perhaps, you will best realize
 the distance of the lens from the circulation of the blood.
      The lenses, the humours of the eye, and the cartilages of the joints,
 thus constitute the parts of the envelope most distant from the vessels,
 whilst the proper tissues of the various organs of the body constitute
 the parts of the envelope most immediately touching the circulation.
 The absorbent system and the ducts of glands constitute the drains
 by which substances that have passed out of the circle into the envelope
are taken up into the circulation again or pass out of the body.
      It has long been known that bile would diffuse into every texture ;
 that madder would diffuse into the bones and into the foetus, and urate
 of soda into the joints ; carbazotic or picric acid into the skin ; mer
 cury into the gums ; lead into the gums and muscles, and silver into the
 skin ; and it has long been known that multitudes of substances would
 run through the funnel into the circulation and out through the envelope
 into some of the drains. Ether, asparagus, turpentine, and many
 other such substances require no mention here.
                                                               2*2

      It occurred tome that both in animals and in plants* the spectrum-
analysis ought to determine with certainty where diffusing substances
go to ; how long they are in going out of the circle into the envelope ;
how long they stay in the envelope, and how quickly they cease to
appear in the drain ; and with Dr. Dupre's help a long investigation
into the rate of passage of crystalloids into and out of the textures
of the body was undertaken. The delicacy of the spectrum-analysis may

at by observing the amount of substance that requires to be burnt to
obtain the reaction, and by the necessity, in some cases, for the
removal of interfering substances previous to the combustion. Thus
three degrees may readily be observed.          The highest amount of lithia
is present when each particle of the substance when introduced into the
flame gives the lithia reaction ; and a smaller amount of lithia is
present when the whole of a lens or of an organ must be extracted
with water to remove the lithia previous to the combustion ; and the
smallest trace is present when the substance has to be incinerated, the
ash treated with sulphuric acid, the excess of acid driven off, the dry
residue extracted with absolute alcohol, the alcohol evaporated and the
dry residue tested.       These three quantities may be designated as the
slightest trace, a trace, and plenty.
      As soon as experiments on man and animals showed that the
infinitesimal quantities taken in with the food were rarely to be per
ceived in the envelope, experiments were made to determine how
quickly the lithium diffused from the funnel into the blood circulation,
and from the circulation into the envelope, and whether it was to be found
in those distant parts of the envelope where no circulation existed, and
especially in the lens of the eye.
      The following table gives the experiments made when lithia in
small quantity was poured into the funnel on the rate of its passage
not only into the circulation, but out of the circulation into the
envelope of a guinea-pig.

      It follows from these experiments that three grains of chloride of
lithium given on an empty stomach, may diffuse into the cartilage of
 the hip-joint and the aqueous humour of the eye in a quarter of an
 hour. In very young and very small pigs, the same quantity of
 lithium may in 30 or 32 minutes be found in the lens of the eye, but
in an old pig in this time the lithium will have got no farther
 than the humours of the eye.         If  the stomach was empty when the
chloride of lithium was taken, in one hour the lithium may be very
 evident in the outer part of the lens and very faintly in the inner part ;

 but   if the stomach be full of food the lithium does not in an hour
 teach the lens.        Even in two hours and a half the lithium may be
 more marked in the outer than in the inner part of the lens.                  In four
 hours the lithium will be in every part of the lens, but it will still be
 more evident in the humonrs than in the lens.              Even in eight hours
 the centre of the lens may show less than the outer part.               The lithium
 will be found in as great quantity in the centre of the lens as in the
 outside after twenty-six hours.
      When instead of being put in by the funnel, the lithia was injected
 into the skin : three grains of chloride of lithium in 24 minutes
 showed the lithium in the lens and in every texture; in 10 minutes
slightly in the lens but plenty everywhere else ; in 4 minutes no lithium
 was in the lens but plenty in the aqueous humour of the eye and in the
 bile; one and a half grain in five minutes showed no lithium in the
lens but plenty in the aqueous humour and in the bile.
      Having thus shown that lithium will pass everywhere into the
 textures in between 4 and 15 minutes, when injected into the circulation,
and between 15 minutes and 26 hours when taken in by the funnel,
some experiments were made to determine after how many days the
lithium ceased to be detected in the envelope after it had been taken.
Usually three pigs were taken : to one no lithium was given, the second
was killed in a few hours after a dose of lithium, and the third was
given the same dose and killed after many days.
      The following Table shows the rate at which chloride of lithium
passes out of the textures : —
2 grs.   in 6  hours gave plenty everywhere. In  6 days gave no trace  in the alcoholic

1  gr. in 5J hours showed partly in the lens. „ 3 days gave faint traces in the lens.
      It  follows from these and other experiments that twice in six days
and once in four days two grains of chloride of lithium, which in six
hours gave lithium everywhere, in six days ceased to be detectable in
the lens, and that even in three days the lithium is most probably
diminishing in the lens.
      Having thus gained a clear knowledge of the time it takes for a
small quantity of lithia to pass in and out of the envelope of an animal,
I  proceeded, through the kindness of my friends Mr. Bowman and Mr.
Critchett, to trace the passage of lithium into that part of the envelope
which is most distant from the blood circulation in man.                Lithia water
is by no means an unpleasant drink, and a few minutes, or a few hours,
or a few days before the operation for cataract, twenty grains of car
bonate of lithia dissolved in water were taken.
      No less than seven cataracts were previously examined with the
greatest care, to determine whether lithia was usually absent, and in
only one instance was the very faintest trace of lithium detectable.

       It follows from these experiments, that in the human body twenty
grains of carbonate of lithia poured into the funnel in two and a half
hours will have partly passed into every particle of the envelope and
beyond the blood circulation even into the most distant parts, and in
three and a half hours it will be more distinctly present in each par
ticle of the lens.
      In four days it will still be distinctly present in each particle of the
lens.
       In five days it will have begun most clearly to pass out of the lens,
and in seven days scarcely the smallest trace will be detectable there.
The most striking experiment was in the case of a young girl with two
soft cataracts.         She took twenty grains of carbonate of lithia, and in
seven hours one lens was removed, and the smallest particle of the lens
showed the presence of lithium.           The other cataract was not removed
for seven days after the first operation ; then not the slightest trace of
lithium could be found in the lens.
      A long series of experiments on the passage of lithium out by a
drain, after it had been taken in by the funnel, showed nearly the same
fact, namely, that after a dose of twenty grains, the lithium was not
entirely thrown out of the body under six, seven, or eight days.
      Thus, then, both in animals and man the same law obtains. A
single dose of lithium in a few minutes passes through the circulation
into all the ducts and into every particle of the body, and even into the
parts most distant from the blood-circulation.*               There it remains for a
much longer time than it took to get into the textures, probably for three
or four days, varying with the quantity taken ; then it diminishes,
    * When seven grains of carbonate of lithia were given eight hours
                                                                                  before
delivery, the lithium was detected in each particle of the umbilical cord.

 and finally, in six, seven, or eight days, the whole quantity is thrown
out of the body.
      In animals it is very difficult accurately to determine the time when
 a single dose is removed, for a portion passes out in the perspiration
 and gets into the hair, and the animal thence re-doses itself with the
 lithium which had already passed through the blood-circulation into
 the envelope and out by the skin drain, and this re-dosing may be
 continued over and over again, so that even for thirty or forty days,
 after a dose of three grains, some lithium may be detected in guinea
 pigs still passing out of the body.
      Having thus traced the lithium in and out of the envelope the
 question of far greater importance remains — What does the lithium or
 other alkaline salt do whilst it is in the envelope ? In other words,
 What is the action of alkalies in the system? What is the action of
 carbonated alkali at a temperature of 38 C. ( 100 Fahr.) when oxygen at
 the same time is present, on 1st, organic acids ; 2nd, neutral hydro
carbons ; 3rd, fatty matter ; and 4th, albuminous substances.
      The most remarkable instance of the action of alkali when organic
 acid and oxygen are in contact is in the decomposition of pyrogallic
 acid.    In this vessel I have oxygen and pyrogallic acid in contact, and
 no action takes place and none would take place if alkali were not
 added ; but immediately on the addition of potass, action begins, the
 pyrogallic acid is unable to keep its composition, and is burnt by
 the oxygen aided by the alkali.          More stable acids of lower com
 position are produced, and these combine with the alkali and liberate
 carbonic acid.     If carbonated instead of caustic alkali be used, the
action is not nearly so rapid or complete us with caustic alkali.
      The best example of the destruction of a neutral hydrocarbon by oxy
gen aided by alkali is in the reduction of oxide of copper by sugar. The
 metallic oxide furnishes the oxygen, the alkali assists the formation
 of acid in the sugar, and draws it out of the sugar destroying the
 neutral compound.
      In fatty matters the alkali splits the fat into fatty acid and glycerine,
 and forms a soap with the acid.          Oil of bitter almonds exposed to
common oxygen or ozonized oxygen absorbed in two hours two cubic
centimetres of oxygen ; with carbonate of soda it absorbed in the same
 time -2,75 CC. When mixed with an alcoholic solution of potash, and
heated benzoic acid combines with the potash, and the whole contents
of the tube solidify ; the alkali causes the oxidation of the oil ; and
by extreme oxidation carbonic acid and water would be the final
results.
      The action of alkali and oxygen on albuminous substances at low or
moderate temperatures,      100 Fahr., has not been yet studied. At high
temperatures with alkali the entire decomposition of the substance
with the production of carbonic acid and ammonia, and a multitude of
less perfect products of oxidation have long been known ; the same
substances oxidized at a higher temperature without the presence of
alkali give rise to fewer intermediate products, and to a greater amount

of the ultimate products of oxidation, viz. water, carbonic acid and
ammonia, out of which the albumen was originally formed.
     M. Bechamp stated that by the oxidation of albumen by manganic
acid urea was produced, but this proved to be benzoic acid ; and
probably kreatin, uric acid, urea and other products will not be
obtained from albuminous substances until we follow the method of
oxidation that occurs in the body, viz a temperature of 38 C. (100
Fahr.) a moderately strong solution of carbonate of soda and basic
phosphate of soda, and the action of oxygen possibly in an ozonized
state.    •
     Von Gorup      Basanez (Liebig's ' Annalen,' vol. ex. p. 86, and exxv.
p. 207) has traced the action of ozone at ordinary temperatures
on a multitude of animal and vegetable substances, but of these my
time allows me to mention only one or two striking examples.
     Cane or grape sugar when in contact with ozone undergoes no change,
 but where grape sugar is exposed to ozone with potass, soda, or
carbonate of soda, it is entirely oxidized, and carbonic and formic acids
only result.     When no alkali is present no action occurs. Cane
sugar   oxidizes  with alkali and ozone much slower than grape sugar.
     Olein is quite inactive when exposed to ozone, but with potass or
carbonate of soda the olein is immediately oxidized.           The olein is
saponified and the glycerine is oxidized into acrolein and ultimately
into carbonic, formic, and propionic acids.       The oleic acid is much
more slowly oxidized into formic and carbonic acid.
     Hence the action of alkalies out of the body on the different classes
of substances of which we are built up is sufficiently clear. The alkali
disturbs the equilibrium of the elements in the organic body by its
affinity for acids.    Aided by oxygen and heat, more or less complex
acids are formed from the neutral substances, and if the action of the
alkali is sufficiently continued, carbonic acid water and ammonia alone
remain.
     The progress of therapeutics probably depends on the application
of our knowledge of the action out of the body of different medicines
on the different chemical constituents of the body, to the explanation
of the action of the same substances on the components of the textures
in the body.
     I have shown you how alkali out of the body promotes oxidation.
The chemist can have no doubt that the same action takes place in each
particle of the textures to which the alkali is carried.    Thus carbonate
of lithia, soda, and potass, lime, magnesia, rubidium, caesium, are indi
rectly oxidizing agents, increasing chemical action in the different sub
stances of which the textures are composed, according to the amount
of the different alkalies that can diffuse into the textures, according to
the different properties of the substances capable of oxidation that
happen to be in the textures, and according to the amount and active
state of the oxygen present and the amount of heat that assists the
action, and according to the facilities for the removal of the products
of the combustion.

458                            Dr. Bence Jones                     [May 26,
     Chloride of rubidium and caesium we have proved to follow the same
law as chloride of lithium, in that these substances pass into the crystal
line lens, and can be detected there ; but the evidence is much less dis
tinct than in the case of lithium, so that the rate of the passage of these
substances in and out of the textures cannot so easily be determined.
Twenty grains of chloride of rubidium, and the same quantity of
chloride of caesium were necessary to give traces of the spectrum
 reaction for these substances in the lenses of guinea pigs.
     There can be no reasonable doubt that as alkalies pass in, so we
shall prove that vegetable acids, if not stopped by the alkaline fluid
that is contained in the circulation, will pass into every particle of the
textures, and when there these acids must have exactly the reverse
action to alkalines. By lessening the alkalescence of the tissues,
vegetable acids must tend to stop the oxidizing process.
     As starch, sugar, and alcohol may be looked upon as becoming in
the body vegetable acids, there is here a vast field for research, for
there can be no doubt that the sugar and alcohol of our food pass at
least as quickly as alkalies into the vascalar and non-vascular textures
of our bodies.
     How far mineral acids can penetrate into the textures cannot be de
termined, and it may well be doubted if they reach the textures at all,
although, by rendering the blood less alkaline, they must indirectly
render the diffusing fluid in the textures less alkaline also.             •
     Alkaloids we hope to detect diffusing into the textures in the same
way, if not at the same rate, as alkalies. How they act on the different
components of the textures of the body, chemistry at present has not
determined. The action of alkaloids on sugars, fatty matters, and
albumen at first sight appears altogether unproved. There exists in
the brain and nerves a substance discovered by Dr. Oscar Liebreich,
and named by him protagon (€,„ HWI N, 0, P).         It gives rise to neurin
(6,H,8N), glycerin-phosphoric acid and a fatty acid, when treated with
alkali ; and this substance, of which loiaoth forms a strong jelly with
water, may be acted on by the alkaloid, and thus form a nerve sub
stance, having very different physical and chemical properties from the
protagon in its unaltered state.
     Even the action of ammonia in the different tissues of the body is
                               '
not yet made out. In the Phil. Trans.' part ii., 1851, p. 409,        I have
shown that in passing through the stomach into the blood, or when in
the blood, ammonia is partially oxidized, and that the same oxidation
happens     when urea is taken, and probably when caffein and the
alkaloids pass into the blood, but the action that occurs as soon as
ammonia, urea, or alkaloids come into contact with the different sub
stances in the different textures, and the rate at which these alkaloids
are ultimately oxidized in the textures, has yet to be determined. The
first effect of alkaloids is to increase chemical action ; but the resulting
chemical combinations that take place, and the alterations in the tex
tures that are produced by ammonia, urea, and alkaloids are at present
undetermined.      Moreover, the alterations these substances occasion in

1865.]         on the Chemical       Circulation in   the   Body.     459
the products   of decomposition of  the tissues, whilst being themselves
finally decomposed  and   removed from the body, are still entirely un
known.
     Judging from the action of alkalies, there can be little doubt that
alkaloids in a few minutes diffuse into every texture, and act according
to their powers on the different substances with which they come into
contact.  If  our means of analysis were sufficient, they would be found
probably for three or four or more days in the textures, generally
much longer than the symptoms, which depend upon contrast, would
lead us to expect.
    Lastly, we have proved that     some salts of the metals diffuse like
chloride of lithium into every texture of the body. Three grains of
sulphate of thallium we have followed in twenty-two hours into the
crystalline lens, and into the cartilages, the nerves, the liver, and the
kidneys.    It may be doubted, perhaps, whether thallium is a metal ;
but the same fact we have also determined to be true of sulphate
of silver by a very delicate galvanic arrangement.
     In twelve days a grain and a quarter of sulphate of silver was
given to a guinea pig. The ashes of the liver, kidney, and stomach
showed silver fairly. The ash of the bile showed it rather less distinctly.
The ash of the lenses showed only very slight traces of silver, but
silver was there.   The ash of the brain showed no silver.
     And here again a vast field for inquiry is opened. What is the
action of the metallic salts on the water, salts, hydrocarbons, fats, albu
minous substances of which each tissue is built up? How do the
metallic salts influence the oxidation and nutrition going on in the
textures ? The power of the salts of silver, lead, and mercury, &c., to
form insoluble or soluble compounds with albumen out of the body
seems to indicate the action of these substances on the albuminous
matter in the body. A compound with the albumen may be formed
which may check the action of the organ, or the metal may be reduced
or form a sulphuret, as with silver salts, and may be deposited in the
textures and there remain, rendering the organ useless, as with lead
salts ; or the metallic salt may set up a more active chemical change
in the albuminous textures or substances with which it is brought into
direct contact, and this chemical action may rise to that degree which
is known as inflammation ; and the salts of mercury may be taken as
examples of substances possessing this action.
     From this view of the rapid passage of crystalloid substances into
the vascular and non-vascular textures of our bodies, there arises a
feeling of surprise that under such constantly varying conditions, the
different functions of the different parts can be carried on.    There   is,
however, from these experiments, but little room to doubt that sub
stances like water, alcohol, salt, and sugar, assisted by the mechanical
circulation of the blood, can in      few minutes pass by diffusion into
                                      a
each particle of our textures and;       in them these substances must
                                          if
take part in the changes of matter and force that are proceeding there,

chemical properties that the substance possesses, and according to
the conditions and times during which the action proceeds.
     Thus, this circulation of diffusion rises even to an equal if not
to a greater importance than that other more mechanical circulation of
the blood, which indeed, in two out of the four grand divisions of ani
mals, is almost absent, and during the early weeks of our own foetal life
is entirely wanting ; and in this chemical circulation we recognize a
link between the lowest vegetable and the highest animal creation,
since this diffusion is a necessary condition on which the chemical
actions in both kingdoms of nature depend.
     To sum up then,     I  have tried to show you that there are good
grounds   for believing  that  there exists within us, in addition to the
mechanical or animal circulation of the blood, another, and a greater and
a more strictly chemical circulation, closely resembling, if not identical
with, that which obtains in the lower divisions of animals and in vege
tables.   A circulation in which substances continually pass from tbe
outside of the body into the blood, and through the blood into the
textures, and from the textures either into the ducts, by which they
again pass back into the blood, or are thrown out of the body ; or
into the absorbents, by which they are again taken back into the
blood, again to pass from it into the textures.
     This chemical circulation leads directly to two most important
inquiries: — First, whether substances that diffuse into this larger cir
culation act as they would do out of the body under somewhat similar
circumstances upon the different substances with which they come into
contact in the different textures ; either promoting the formation of
new compounds, or giving rise to decompositions in the substances that
are present in the tissues.
     And, secondly, whether the chemical force, which may have been
latent for ages in the mineral and vegetable substances that can enter
by our vegetable and mineral food and medicine into this larger circu
lation, may be so given out in the textures as to increase or diminish
those actions of oxidation, motion, sensation, and growth, which almost,
although not altogether, constitute that assemblage of correlated actions
which we sum up in two words — Animal Life.

                 WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                          Friday, June 2,    1865.
   SIR HENRY HOIAAND,        BART.   M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. President, in
                                 the Chair.
                       PROFESSOR    HUXLEY, F.R.S.
                On  the Methods and Results    of Ethnology.
 THE lecturer    commenced by defining the nature and the limits of
 Ethnology.    Biology being the name applied to the science of life
 and living things, Zoology is that division of Biology which deals
 especially with animals ; and Anthropology is that branch of Zoology
 which is spwhilly concerned with man.      Ethnology is the more special
 science which determines the distinctive characters of the persistent
 modifications of mankind, ascertains the distribution of these modifi
 cations in present and past times, and searches after the causes or
 conditions of existence, both of the modifications and of their
 distribution.
     Turning to a map of the world, the lecturer next indicated and
 briefly characterized, in successive order, the more obvious and pro
 minent persistent modifications of mankind, commencing with the
 Australians. With dark skins, these people conjoin wavy hair , their
 skulls are always long, but are sometimes           high and sometimes
 depressed.    The antero-posterior and transverse diameters of the brim
 of the pelvis in the male are more nearly equal than is usually the
 case in Europeans.
      The Negritos, inhabiting the belt of islands which lie between
 Australia, Polynesia, and Micronesia, have dark skins and woolly
 hair, the skull sometimes inclining towards the Australian, and some
 times towards the Polynesian type.
      The Amphinesian-t have the colour of the skin brown, in lighter
 or darker shades, and the hair is long, black, and straight or wavy ;
 the skull varies in character. These people cover an enormous area,
 occupying almost all the other islands of the Pacific and Indian oceans.
      The Americans have black straight hair; the skin exhibits various
 shades of reddish and yellowish brown, sometimes inclining to olive ;
 the face is broad and scantily bearded, the skull broad and high.
      The Esquimaux have also straight black hair and broad faces,
*with prominent cheek bones, but their skulls are remarkably long.
 They inhabit the Arctic shores of America and of Eastern Asia. The
 rest of Eastern Asia is peopled by the Mongolians, with skins varying
 in colour from yellow to olive, broad faces with flat noses, obliquely
 set small eyes, and straight black hair ; the skull is never long, and

462                                      Professor         Huxley                                [June 2,
usually is remarkably broad and rounded. The Lapps of North
eastern Europe have strongly-marked Mongolian      characters, but the
immense interval between the western limit of the Eastern Mongolians
and Lapland       in great measure, occupied by people with pale com
                         is,
plexions, blue or light eyes, yellow or red hair, and prominent noses.
These may be termed the Xanthochroi.          They exhibit two very dis
tinct forms of cranium — the Scandinavians having long heads, the
Slavonians, Fins, South Germans, and Swiss, broad heads.
     The Melanochroi have, like the Xanthochroi, prominent noses,
pale skins, wavy hair, and abundant beards, but the hair            black or                is
dark, and the eyes usually so. They inhabit Southern and Western
Europe, Northern Africa, and Western Asia.
     The Negroes with dark skin, woolly hair, projecting jaws, thick lips,
and elongated skulls, people Central Africa           while the Bushmen,  ;
differing from the true negroes           their yellowish-brown
                                                        in            colour,
tufted hair, very small stature, and tendency to fatty and other
integumentary outgrowths, inhabit the southern extremity of that
continent.

lead us back physically as well as geographically towards the Australians,
while the diminutive Mincopies of the Andaman Islands lie midway
between th^Negro and Negrito races.

among the modifications of mankind which have been enumerated,

hand, broad heads preponderate among the Leiotrichi, and only two
of the stocks enumerated among them — the Esquimaux and the
Australian — are exclusively long headed.
     It further worthy of remark that an ethnological chart projected
            is

in such a manner, that the Pacific Ocean occupies its centre, shows an
Australian area occupied by a dark-skinned, smooth-haired people,
separated    by an incomplete inner zone of dark and woolly-haired
Negroes and Negritos, from an outer zone of comparatively pale and
smooth-haired men, occupying the Americas, Asia, North Africa, and
Europe.
      Having thus sketched the physical differences of the chief persistent
modifications of mankind, the lecturer proceeded to consider the nature
 and the value of their other differences, linguistic and physiological.
 Great as is the value of the scientific study of language, philology cannot
afford any basis for ethnological classification, unless it can be shown
 that the mixture or substitution of languages is always accompanied by a
 corresponding mixture or substitution of the blood of the people speaking
those languages.     If in any instance it can be proved that the language
of a nation has changed fundamentally, while its blood has remained
 wholly or comparatively unmixed, or vice versa, language ceases to be
 a test of ethnological affinity.    Cases were adduced in support of each
 of those alternative propositions. With regard to the physiological
 differences of the known persistent modifications of mankind, there
 would appear to be good grounds for the belief that they are differently
affected by the influences which give rise to diseases, but no sufficient
evidence has yet been adduced in support of the doctrine held by some
 ethnologists, that any two of them exhibit the phenomena of hybridity.
      Turning from the present to the past condition of mankind, atten
tion was directed to the fact that our knowledge of most of the per
sistent modifications of mankind is very modern, and of later date than
 the fifteenth century ; while, on the other hand, the oldest historical
 records give us no right to believe that the distribution of mankind
 was, at the time to which they refer, other than it is now.
      Archaeology proves the existence of dolichocephalic and brachyce-
 phalic people side by side, or in succession, in various parts of Europe, but
affords no grounds for believing that they were different from stocks
 now existing in the same or adjacent localities ; while, at present, palaeon
tology does little more than reveal the existence of man in that quarter
of the world before its physical condition had become that which it
 now is.
      The lecturer finally proceeded to discuss the various hypotheses
which have been offered to explain the facts of ethnology, pointing out
that the strength of the Monogenists lies in their recognition of the
anatomical unity of mankind, while the Polygenists have done no less
service by bringing prominently forward the distinctness and perma
 nence of the leading modifications of the human type. And in conclusion,
he endeavoured     to show in what way the application of Mr. Darwin's
views to Ethnology reconciles the doctrine of anatomical unity with
that of persistence of modification, and overcomes difficulties of distri
bution by taking into account the effects of geological change.

     On     Researches      in Organic Chemistry in        the Royal Institution.
The     vast crowd of organic compounds with which modern research
has made us acquainted, have been grouped into a comparatively small
number of families, each containing substances closely allied in
chemical character. Thus, amongst others, the following families or
series of organic bodies are well known and sharply defined : —
           1. The Marsh-gas family.
           2. The Alcohols.
           3. The Organic Ammonias.
           4. The Fatty, or Acetic Series of Acids.
           5. The Organic Oxalic Acids, or Lactic series.
           6. The Acrylic series of Acids.
     The speaker referred especially to the last three families as having
been the subjects of the researches carried on in the laboratory of the
    Vol. IV. (No. 42.)                                                     2 h

himself.      Two of these families had already received the careful
study   of  many chemists ; the acetic having been especially illustrated
by the classic researches of Kolbe and Gerhardt, whilst the lactic
family had quite recently had the advantage of the equally remarkable
investigations of Wurtz and Kolbe. Nevertheless, there seemed to be
still some points of great interest regarding the arrangement of the
atoms of these acids, — their atomic architecture, so to speak, — which
had not yet received elucidation ; whilst the acrylic family had hitherto
enjoyed comparatively but little attention from chemists.
     It had been proved by Kolbe and the speaker, nearly twenty years
ago, that methyl (CH,) is a constituent of acetic acid, and more
recently that acetic acid and acetic ether are constructed upon the
carbonic acid or tetratomic carbon type, the formula of acetic ether
being—

     From this formula it was seen, that the radical methyl in acetic
ether contained three single atoms of hydrogen combined with a
tetratomic atom of carbon ; and the speaker and his friend proposed to
themselves the question : Can this hydrogen be replaced atom for atom
by the alcohol radicals methyl, ethyl, &c. ? In endeavouring to solve
this problem, they availed themselves of that class of chemical reactions
in which an electro-positive atom is expelled from a compound by a
more electro-positive atom.             Acetic ether was submitted to the action
of sodium, by which two compounds of the following composition
were obtained : —

     These compounds, when brought into contact with the iodides of
methyl, ethyl, &c., yielded ethers, exhibiting the substitution which it
was sought to obtain.              In this way there had been produced the
following     ethers   : —

this series of acids are derived from oxalic acid by the substitution of
one atom of diatomic oxygen, in the latter by two of hydrogen, methyl,

three following formulae : —

    The speaker concluded          as  follows : — The day has almost gone by
when the experimenter was asked the use of such investigations as
these ; nevertheless,       it may fairly be demanded, Whither do such
researches tend ? What is their object ?              The sole object that we have
had in view in these investigations has been the discovery of the laws
according to which organic compounds are moulded, — those com
pounds, the transformation of which from one state of combination to
another constitutes an essential part of the phenomena we call life.
There is no royal road to this kind of knowledge. It is only by thus
patiently and laboriously examining every part of the subject, that
the combined efforts of the physicist, the physiologist, and the chemist
will one day be able to solve the organic problems which at the present
moment appear so unapproachable.                  The work before us requires a
vast amount of experiment and thought.                 Would that more labourers
were engaged in it ! How many men of leisure and ability are almost
compelled to pass through life with no higher object than their own
amusement.      Why cannot our schools and universities furnish the next
generation of such men, with the scientific knowledge necessary to enable
them to take part in the glorious work of investigating Nature ?

                                 On Shakespeare.
       " In the autumn of last
     [                          year a communication was made to his Eminence
the late Cardinal Wiseman, by H. Bence Jones, Esq., M.D., as Secretary of
the Royal Institution of Great Britain, requesting him to deliver a lecture
before that Society.     The Cardinal, with the prompt kindness usual to him,
at once assented.       The Shakespeare Tercentenary seemed to prescribe the
subject, which his Eminence therefore selected.          The preparation of this
lecture" (which was to have been delivered on the 27th of January last) " was
his last intellectual exertion, and it overtaxed his failing strength."  He died
on the 15th of February.         His literary executors have published " only a
fragment of a whole which was never completed except in the author's
mind."      " The day before his illness, the Cardinal said to his amanuensis, the
Rev. Dr. Clifford, ' I shall have no more real work, for I have every sentence
that    I am going to dictate already in my mind ; it is only a question of time
                                                    "
now.      I know word for word what I shall say.' *
     The following abbreviation of the intended lecture is printed with the
consent of the Cardinal's literary executors.]
 There       have been some men in the world's history — and they are
 necessarily few — who by their deaths have deprived mankind of the
 power to do justice to their merits, in those particular spheres of excel
                                                                                 "
 lence in which they had been pre-eminent.               When the " immortal
 Raphael for the last time laid down his palette, still moist with the
 brilliant colours which he had spread upon his unfinished masterpiece,
 destined to be exposed to admiration above his bier, he left none
 behind him who could worthily depict and transmit to us his beautiful
 lineaments : so that posterity has had to seek in his own paintings,
 among the guards at a sepulchre, or among the youthful disciples in an
 ancient school, some figure which may be considered as representing
 himself.      »  •   •   •
       No less can it be said that when the pen dropped from Shakespeare's
 hand, when his last mortal illness mastered the strength of even his
 genius, the world was left powerless to describe in writing his noble
 and unrivalled characteristics. Hence we turn back upon himself, and
 endeavour to draw from his own works the only true records of his
 genius and his mind.        We apply to him phrases which he has uttered
 of others ; we believe that he must have involuntarily described himself,
 when he says,
                                       " Take him all in all,
                    We shall not look upon his like again ;"

     The almost total absence of all external information, this drying-up
of the ordinary channels of personal history, forces us to seek for the
character and the very life of Shakespeare in his own works. But how
difficult, in analysing the complex constitution of such a man's principles,
motives, passions, and affections, to discriminate between what he has
drawn from himself, and what he has created by the force of his
imagination.      Dealing habitually with fictions, sometimes in their
noblest, sometimes in their vilest forms — here gross and even savage,
there refined and sometimes ethereal, how shall we discover what
portions of them were copied from the glass which he held before
himself, what from the magic mirrors across which flitted illusive or
fanciful imagery ? The work seems hopeless.          •   •   •   •
     This difficulty of appreciating, and still more of delineating, the cha
racter of our great poet, makes him, without perhaps an exception, the
most difficult literary theme in English letters.       How to reduce the
subject to a lecture seems indeed a literal paradox. But when to this
difficulty is added that of an impossible compression into narrow limits
of the widest and vastest compass ever embraced by any one man's
genius, it must appear an excess of rashness in anyone to presume that
he can do justice to the subject on which     I am addressing yon. • •
     In truth the undertaking required some courage; and to retire
before its difficulties might be stigmatised as a dastardly timidity.      It
is a work of courage at any time and in any place to undertake a
lecture upon Shakespeare, more in fact than to venture on the delivery
of   a series.   •   •   •   "

    After having said thus much of my own probably unenvied position,
I think  I shall not be wrong in assuming that none of Shakespeare's
enthusiastic admirers, one of whom profess myself to be, and that few
                                      I
of my audience are in this exceptional position. They will probably
consider this    adisadvantage on my side    ;  and to some extent      must
                                                                        I

 read.
      But on the other hand is it not something to have approached this
 wonderful man, and to have communed with him in silence and in
 solitude, face to face, alone with him alone ; to have read and studied
and meditated on him in early youth, without gloss or commentary, or
 preface or glossary ? For such was my good or evil fortune ; not
 during the still hours of night, but during that stiller portion of an
 Italian afternoon, when silence is deeper than in the night, under a
bright and sultry sun, when all are at rest, all around you hushed to
 the very footsteps in a well-peopled            house, except the unquelled
 murmuring    of  a fountain beneath     orange trees, which mingled thus the
most delicate of fragrance with the most soothing of sounds, both
stealing together through the half-closed windows of wide and lofty
 corridors.   Is there not more of that reverence and that relish which
 constitute the classical taste to be derived from the concentration of
 thought and feelings which the perusal of the simple unmarred and
 unoverlaid text procures ; when you can ponder on a verse, can linger
over a word, can repeat mentally and even orally with your own
deliberation and your own emphasis, whenever dignity, beauty, or
wisdom invite you to pause, or compel you to ruminate ? • • • •
      You will easily understand, from this long and almost apologetic
 preamble, in the first place, that I take it for granted that            I  am
addressing    an  audience  which    is  not assembled   to receive  elementary
or new information concerning England's greatest poet.                  On the
contrary,   I believe myself to stand before many who are able to judge,
rather than merely accept, my opinions, and in the presence of an
assembly exclusively composed of his admirers, thoroughly conversant
with his works.       * " • •
      Among our native writers no one questions that Shakespeare is
supremely pre-eminent, and most of us will probably assign him as lofty
a position in the whole range of modern         European literature.    Perhaps
 no other nation possesses among its writers any one name to which
there is no rival claim, nor even an approximation of equality, to
make a balance against it.        *    •   •   •
      Shakespeare    has established    his claim to the noblest position in
 English literature on a wider and more solid basis than the mere
composition of skilful plays could deserve.            As the great master of
our language, as almost its regenerator, quite its refiner — as the author
whose use of a word stamps it with the mark of purest English coinage
— whose employment of a phrase makes it household and proverbial —
whose sententious sayings, flowing without effort from his mind, seem
almost sacred, and are quoted as axioms or maxims indisputable — as
the orator whose speeches, not only apt, but, natural to the lips from
which they issue, are more eloquent than the discourses of senators or
finished public speakers — as the poet whose notes are richer, more
wondrously varied than those of the greatest professed bards — as the
writer who has run through the most varied ways and to the greatest

                                    on Shakespeare.                                473
extent through every department of literature and learning, through
the history of many nations, their domestic manners, their characteristics,
and even their personal distinctives, and who seems to have visited
every part of nature, to have intuitively studied the heavens and the
earth — as the man in fine, who has shown himself supreme in so
many things, superiority in any one of which gains reputation in life
and glory after death, he is pre-eminent above all, and beyond the
reach of envy or jealousy.           "   •   •      •
      The question, however, may be raised — Is he so securely placed
upon his pedestal that a rival may not one day thrust him from it ? —
is he so secure upon his throne that a rebel may not usurp it?                      To
these interrogations      I  answer unhesitatingly — Yes.
      In the first place, there have only been two poets in the world
before Shakespeare who have attained the same position with him.
Each came at the moment which closed the volume of the period post,
nnd opened that of a new epoch.             Of what preceded Homer we can
know but little ; the songs by bards or rhapsodists                   had, no doubt,
preceded him,      and    prepared     the  way    for the  first  and  greatest epic.
This, it is acknowledged, has never been surpassed ; it became the
standard of language, the steadfast rule of versification, and the model
of poetical composition. His supremacy, once attained, was shaken
by no competition ; it was as well assured after a hundred years as
it has been by thousands.            Dante again stood between the remnants
of the old Roman civilization and the construction of a new and
Christian system of arts and letters.                   He, too, consolidated the
floating fragments of an indefinite language, and with them built
and thence himself fitted and adorned that stately vessel which
bears him through all the regions of life and of death, of glory, of
 trial, and of perdition.         •    • • •
      The two centuries      and  more   which have elapsed since Shakespeare's
death    have  as completely      confirmed    him in his legitimate command as
 the   same   period    did   his   two   only real predecessors.         No one can
possibly   either  be  placed    in  a similar   position  or  come    up to his great
qualities, except      at   the   expense   of    the  destruction    of  our present
civilization, the annihilation of its past traditions, the resolution of our
 language into jargon, and its regeneration, by a new birth, into some
 thing
         " more rich and strange " than the powerful idiom which so
 splendidly combines the Saxon and the Norman elements.                         Should
such a devastation and reconstruction take place, whether they come
 from New Zealand or from Siberia, then there may spring up the poet
of that time and condition who may be the fourth in that great series
of unrivalled bards, but will no more interfere with his predecessor's
                                                                              •   * •
 rights than Dante or Shakespeare does with those of Homer.
      But still more may we say that,         in  all such positions as that which
we have assigned to Shakespeare, there has always been a culminating
 point to which succeeds decline — if not downfall.                   It is so in art.
 Immediately      after  the   death    of Raphael,     and    the  dispersion of his
school, art took a downward direction, and has never risen again to
the same height.          And while he marks the highest elevation ever

474                          Cardinal Wiseman
reached in the arts of Europe, a similar observation will apply to
their particular schools.        Leonardo and Luini in Lombardy ; the
Carracci in Bologna ; Fra Angelico in Umbria ; Garofalo in Ferrara,
not only take the place of chiefs in their respective districts, but mark
the period from which degeneracy has to date.            And so surely is it in
our case, whatever may have been the course of literature which led
up to Shakespeare, without pronouncing judgment on Spenser, or
" rare Ben Jonson," it is certain that after him, although England
has possessed great poets, there stands not one forward among them as
Shakespeare's competitor.         Milton, and Dryden, and Addison, and
Eowe have given us specimens of high dramatic writing of no mean
quality ; others as well, and even these have written much and nobly,
in lofty as in familiar verse ; yet not one has the public judgment of
the nation placed on a level with him. The intermediate space from
them to our own times has left only the traces of a weak and enervated
school. It would be unbecoming to speak disparagingly of the poets
of the present age ; but no one,        I  believe, has ventured to consider
them as superior to the noble spirits of our Augustan age.                The easy
descent from the loftiest eminence is not easily reclimbed.
     Surely, then, we may consider Shakespeare, as an ancient mytholo-
gist would have done, as " enskied" among " the invulnerable clouds,"
where no shaft, even of envy, can assail him. From this elevation we
                                                             • • " •
may safely predict that he never can be plucked.
     To what does Shakespeare owe this supremacy, or whence flow all
the extraordinary qualities which we attribute to him ?               You are all
prepared with the answer in one single word — his genius.
     The genius of Shakespeare is our familiar thought and ready
expression    when we study him, and when we characterise him.
Nevertheless, simple and intelligible as is the word, it is extremely
difficult to analyse or to define it. Yet everything that is great and
beautiful in his writings seems to require an explanation of the cause
to which it owes its origin.
     One great characteristic of genius easily and universally admitted
is, thatit   is
             a     gift, and not an acquisition.       It belongs inherently to
the person possessing      it;   it cannot be transmitted          by heritage
                                                                             ;   it
cannot be infused by parental affection          ;    cannot be bestowed by
                                                     it
earliest care; neither can       it be communicated by the most finished
culture or the most studied education. It must be congenital, or
rather inborn to its possessor.         It  is  as much        aliving, a   natural
power,    as   isreason    to every man.    As   surely  as  the   very first germ
of the plant contains in itself the faculty of one day evolving from
itself leaves, flowers, and fruit, so does genius hold, however hidden,
however unseen, the power to open, to bring forth, and to mature
what other men cannot do, but what to            it   isinstinctive and almost
spontaneous.      It may begin to manifest itself with the very dawn
of reason  :   itmay remain asleep for years, till         aspark, perhaps acci
dentally, kindles up into       a sudden and irrepressible splendour, that
unseen intellectual fuel which has been almost unknown to its unam
bitious owner.      •    •    " •

                               on Shakespeare.                             475
      We connect in our minds with             genius the ideas of flashing
splendour and eccentric movement. It is an intellectual meteor, the
laws of which cannot be defined or reduced to any given theory. We
regard it with a certain awe, and leave it to soar or to droop, to shine
or disappear, to dash irregularly first in one direction and then in
another ; no one dare curb it or direct it ; but all feel sure that its
course, however inexplicable, is subject to higher and controlling rule.
But in order to define more closely what we in reality understand by
genius, it may be well to consider its action in divided and more
restricted spheres of activity.        For although we habitually attribute
this singular quality to many, and often but on light grounds, it is
seldom that we do so seriously and deliberately without some qualifying
epithet. We speak of a military genius, of a mechanical genius, of a
poetical genius, of a musical genius, or of an artistic genius. All
these expressions contain a restrictive clause.        We do not understand
when we use      them    that the    person to    whom    they were attributed
possessed any power beyond         the  limits of a particular sphere.  We do
not mean by the use of the word genius that the soldier knew anything
of poetry, or the printer of mechanism. We understand that each in
his own profession or stage of excellence possessed a complete eleva
tion over the bulk of those who followed the same pursuits ; a superiority
so visible, so acknowledged, and so clearly individual, that no one else
 considered it inferiority, still less felt shame, at not being able to rise
to the same level.     They gather round them acknowledged disciples
and admirers, who rather glory to have been guided by their teaching,
 and formed on their example.
      And in what consisted that complete though limited excellence ?        If
 I  might venture to express a judgment,          I  would say that genius in
 these different courses of science or art may be defined a natural
 sympathy with all that relates to each of them, with the power of
 giving full and certain execution to the mental conception.
      Stephenson, from the labour of the mine, creating that system of
 mechanical motion, which may be said to have subdued the world, and
 bound the earth in iron links ; Mozart, giving concerts at the age of
 seven, that astonished grey-headed musicians ; Raphael, before the
 ordinary age of finished pupilage, master of every known detail in
 art of oil or fresco, drawing, expression, and grand composition ;
 Giotto, caught in the field as a young shepherd by Cimabue, draw
 ing his sheep upon a stone, and soon becoming the master of modern
 art.   • • • "
      Raphael was before the world a painter, but he could scarcely
 have been so without embracing every other department of art.
 Before the science of perspective was matured or popularly known,
 when, in consequence, defects are to be found in the disposition of
 figures, and in the adjustment of aerial distances, his architecture
 shows an instinctive familiarity          with its rules and proportions ; a
 proof that he possessed an architectural eye.             And consequently the
 one statue which he is supposed to have carved, and the one palace

 476                            Cardinal Wiseman
which he is said to have built, show how easily he could have under
 taken and executed beautiful works in either of those two classes
 of art. • • « "
      It is evident, however, that while a genius has its point of concen
 tration, every remove from this, though wider, will be fainter and less
complete.       We may describe it as Shakespeare himself describes
 glory, and say :
                          •••••
                  " Genius is like a circle in the water,
                    Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself,
                   Till, by broad spreading, it disperse to naught."
                                                      Henry VI., act. i. scene 3.
              •
      All  that I have been saying is applicable in the most complete and
 marvellous way to Shakespeare's genius. His sympathies are uni
 versal, perfect 'in their own immediate use, infinitely varied, and
                                                                      •     •   • •
 strikingly beautiful, when they reach remoter objects.
      The centre-point of his sympathies is clearly his dramatic art.
 From this they expand, for many degrees, with scarce perceptible
 diminution, till they lose themselves in far distant, and, to him, un
 explored space.      This nucleus of his genius has certainly never been
 equalled before or since.       Its essence consists in what is the very soul
of the dramatic idea, the power to throw himself into the situation,
the circumstances, the nature, the acquired habits, the feelings, true
 or fictitious, of every character which he introduces.             This forms, in
 fact, the most perfect of sympathies.            We do not, of course, use the
 word in that more usual sense of harmony of affection, or consent of
feeling. Shakespeare has sympathy as complete for Shylock or Iago,
 as he has for Arthur or King Lear.                For a time he lives in the
 astute villain as in the innocent child ; he works his entire power of
 thought into intricacies of the traitor's brain ; he makes his heart
beat in concord with the usurer's sanguinary spite, and then, like some
 beautiful creature in the animal world, draws himself out of the hateful
 evil, and is himself again ; and able, even, often to hold his own
 noble and gentle qualities as a mirror, or exhibit the loftiest, the most
 generous, and amiable examples of our nature.               And this is all done
 without study, and apparently without effort.              His infinitely varied
 characters come naturally into their places, never for a moment lose
 their proprieties, their personality, and the exact flexibility which
 results from the necessary combination in every man of many qualities.
 From the beginning to the end each one is the same, yet reflecting in
 himself the lights and shadows which flit around him.
      This extraordinary versatility stands in striking contrast with the
dramatic productions of other countries.               The Greek tragedian is
Greek throughout — his subjects, his mythology, his sentences, play won
derfully indeed, but yet restrictedly, within a given sphere. And Rome
is but the imitator in all its literature of its great mistress and model.
                    " Grails cloquium, Graiis dedit ore rotundo,
                      Musa loqui."

                              on Shakespeare.                        477
     Even through the French school, with the strict adhesion to the
ancient rule of the unities, seems to have descended the partiality for
what may be called the chastely classical subjects.        Not so with
Shakespeare.
     Who, a stranger might ask, is the man, and where was he born,
and where did he live, that not only his acts and scenes are placed in
any age, or in any land, but that he can fill his stage with the very
living men of the time and place represented, make them move as
easily as if he held them in strings ; and make them speak not only
with general conformity to their common position, but with individual
and distinctive propriety, so that each is different from the rest ? Did
he live in ancient Rome, strolling the Forum, or climbing the Capitol ;
hear ancient matrons converse with modest dignity ; listen to con
spirators among the columns of its porticoes ; mingle among senators
round Pompey's statue ; or with plebeians crowding to hear Brutus
or Antony harangue ?      Was he one accustomed to idle in the Piazza
of St. Mark, or shoot his gondola under the Rialto ? Or was he a
knight or even archer in the fields of France or England during the
period of the Plantagenets or Tudors, and witnessed and wrote down
the great deeds of those times, and knew intimately and personally
each puissant lord who distinguished himself by his valour, by his
wisdom, or even by his crimes?      Did he live in the courts of princes,
perchance    holding some office which enabled him to listen to the
grave utterances of kings and their counsellors, or to the witty sayings
of court jesters ? Did he consort with banished princes, and partake
of their sports or their sufferings? In fine, did he live in great cities,
or in shepherds' cottages, or in fields and woods ; and does he date
from John and live on to the eighth Henry — a thread connecting in
 himself the different epochs of mediaeval England ? One would almost
say so ; or multiply one man into many, whose works have been
 united under one man.
     This ubiquity, if we may so call      of Shakespeare's sympathies,
                                         it,
constitutes the unlimited extent and might of his dramatic genius.      It

would be difficult to imagine where a boundary line could at length
have been drawn, beyond which nothing original, nothing new, and
nothing beautiful, could be supposed to have come forth from his
 mind.   We are compelled to say that his genius was inexhaustible.

    Many of you, no doubt, are aware that           a controversy has long
existed, whether the madness of Hamlet          intended by Shakespeare to
                                               is
be real or simulated.    If   a dramatist wished to represent one of his
persons  as feigning  madness, that  assumed condition would be naturally
desired  by                                                             If
             the writer to be as like as possible to the real affliction.
the other persons associated with him could at once discover that the
madness was put on, of course the entire action would be marred, and
the object for which the pretended       madness was designed would be
defeated   by  the discovery.   How consummate must be the poet's art,
who can have so skilfully described, to the minutest symptoms, the

478                        Cardinal Wiseman
mental malady of a great mind, as to leave it uncertain to the present
day, even among learned physicians versed in such maladies, whether
Hamlet's madness was real or assumed.
     This controversy may be said to have been brought to a close by
one of the ablest among those in England who have every opportunity
of studying the almost innumerable shades through which alienatioa oV
mind can pass.*      And so delicate are the changeful characteristics
which Shakespeare describes, that Dr. Conolly considers that a twofold
form of disease is placed before us in the Danish prince.      He concludes
that he was labouring under real madness, yet able to put on a fictitious
and artificial derangement for the purposes which he kept in view.
Passing through act by act and scene by scene, analysing, with expe
rienced eye, each new symptom as it occurs, dividing and anatomising,
with the finest scalpel, every fibre of his bruin; be exhibits, step by
step, the transitionary characters of the natural disease in a mind
naturally, and by education, great and noble, but thrown off his pivot
by the anguish of his sufferings and the strain of aroused passion.
And to this is superadded another and not genuine affection, which
serves its turn with that estranged mind when it suits it to act, more
especially that part which the natural ailment did not suffice for.
Now, Dr. Conolly considers these symptoms so accurately as wefl at
minutely described, that he throws out the conjecture that Shakespeare
may have borrowed the account of them from some unknown papers
by his son-in-law, Dr. Hall.
      But let it be remembered that in those days mental phenomena
were by no means accurately examined or generally known.              There
was but little attention paid to the peculiar forms of monomania, or to
its treatment, beyond restraint and often cruelty.       The poor idiot was
allowed, if harmless, to wander about the village or the country to
drivel or gibber amidst the teasing or ill-natured treatment of boys or
rustics.   The poor maniac was chained or tied in some wretched out
house, at the mercy of some heartless guardian, with no protector but
the constable.    Shakespeare could not be supposed, in the little town
of Stratford, nor indeed in London itself, to have had opportunities of
studying the influence and the appearance of mental derangement of a
high-minded and finely-cultivated prince. How then did Shakespeare
contrive to paint so highly-finished and yet so complex an iroafr :
Simply by the exercise of that strong sympathetic will which enabled
him to transport, or rather to transmute, himself into another person
 ality.   While this character was strongly before him he changed
 himself into a maniac ; he felt intuitively what would be bis o«a
 thought, what his feelings, were he in that situation ; he played with
himself the part of the madman, with his own grand mind as the basis
of its action ; he grasped on every side the imagery which be fek
 would have come into his mind, beautiful even when dislorded.subiiaw

      Mrs. Jameson has well distinguished the different forms of mental
aberration in Shakespeare's characters, when she says that " Constance
is frantic, Lear is mad, Ophelia is insane." — Characteristics           of
  Women. • • • •
     It has often been said that in his female characters Shakespeare is
not equal to himself. The work to which        I  have just alluded meets,
I   think, completely, this objection, which,    I  believe, even Schlegel
raises.    It required a lady, with mind highly cultivated, with the
 nicest powers of discrimination, and with happiness of expression, to
 vindicate at once Shakespeare      and her sex.     The difficulty of this
 task can hardly be appreciated without the study of its performance.
 Its great difficulty consists in the almost family resemblance of the
different portraits which make up Shakespeare's female gallery.
 There is scarcely any room for events, even for incident, still less for
 actions, say for bold and unfeminine deeds.       Several of the heroines
 of Shakespeare are subjected to similar persecutions, and almost the
 same trials.     In almost every one the affections and their expression
 have alone to interest us.     From Miranda, the desert-nurtured child
 in the simplicity of untempted innocence, to Isabella, in her cloistered
 virtue, or Hermione in her unyielding fortitude — there are such
 shades, such varying yet delicate tints, that not two of these numerous
 conceptions can be said to resemble another. And whence did Shake
 speare derive his models ?      Some are lofty queens, others most noble
ladies, some foreigners, some native ; different types in mind and
 heart, as in the lineament or complexion.      Where did he find them ?
Where did he meet them? In the cottages of Stratford, or in the
 purlieus of Blackfriars? Among the ladies of the Court, or in the
audience in his pit ? No one can say — no one need say. They were
the formations of his own quickened and fertile brain, which required
 but one stroke, one line, to sketch him a portrait to which he would
give immortality.      Far more difficult was this success, and not less
completely was it achieved, in that character which medical writers
seem hardly to believe could be but a conception.         We may compare
the mind of Shakespeare to a diamond, pellucid, bright, and untinted,
cut into countless polished facets, which, in constant movement, at
every smallest change of direction or of angle, caught a new reflec
tion, so that not one of its brilliant mirrors could be for a moment
idle, but by a power beyond its control was ever busy with the reflec
tion of innumerable images, either distinct or running into one another,
or repeated each so clearly as to allow him, when he chose, to fix it
in his memory.       •  • • •

      The next and most essential quality required for true genius is the
 power to give outward life to the inward conception.           Without this
  the poet is dumb.       He may be a " mute inglorious Milton ;
                                                                        " he
  cannot be a speaking, noble Shakespeare.       I  should think that  I was
 almost insulting such an audience, were    I to descant upon Shakespeare's
 position among the bards and writers of England, and of the modern
 world.     Upon this point there can scarcely be a dissentient opinion.
  His language is the purest and best, his verses the most flowing and
 rich ; and as for his sentiments, it would be difficult without the
 command of his own language to characterise them. No other writer
 has ever given such periods of sententious wisdom.

      I  have spoken of genius as a gift to an individual man.         I will
 conclude by the reflection that that man becomes himself a gift ; a
 gift to his nation ; a gift to his age ; a gift to the world of all times.
 That same Providence which bestows greatness, majesty, abundance,
 and grace, no less presents, from time to time, to a people or a race,
 these few transcendent      men who mark for it periods no less de

 cisively, though more nobly, than victories or conquests.
      It is a double gift that that same creating and directing rule has
 made this country the birthplace and the seat of the two men who,
 within a short period, were made the rulers each of a great and
 separate    intellectual dominion, never to be deposed, never to be
 rivalled, never to be envied.    To Newton was given the sway over the
 science of the civilised world ; to Shakespeare the sovereignty over its
 literature.
      The one stands before us passionless and grave, embracing in his
 intellectual grandeur every portion of the universe, from the stars, to
 him invisible, to the rippling of the tiny waves which the tide brought
 to his feet.    The host of heaven, that seemed in causeless dispersion,
 he marshalled into order, and bound in safest discipline.         He made
 known to his fellow-men the secret laws of heaven, the springs of
 movement, and the chains of connection, which invariably and un
 changeably impel and guide the course of its many worlds.          •  • •
      Beside him stands the ruler of that world, which, though even
 sublimely intellectual, is governed by him with laws in which the
 affections, even the passions, the moralities, and the anxieties of life
 have their share ; in which there is no severity but for vice, no slavery
 but for baseness, no unforgivingness but for calculating wickedness.
 In his hand is not the staff of authority ; whether it take the form of
a royal sceptre or of a knightly lance, whether it be the shepherdess's
crook or the fool's bauble, it is still the same, the magician's wand.
Whether it be the divining rod with which he draws up to light the
most hidden streams of nature's emotions, or the potential instrument
of Prospero's spells, which raises storms in the deep or works spirit-
music in the air, or the wicked
                                      implement with which the witches
mingle their unholy charm, its cunning and its might have no limit
among created things. But it is not a world of
                                                     stately order which he
rules, nor are the laws of
                             unvarying rigour by which it is commanded.

        now the stern mosaic, without colouring, of an ancient pavement,
       now the flowing and intertwining arabesque of the fanciful East ; now
       the rude scenes of ancient mediaeval tapestry like that of Beauvais,
       and then the finished and richly-tinted production of the Gobelins loom.
            And yet through this seeming chaos the light permeates, and that
       so clear and so brilliant as equally to define and to dazzle.           Every
       portion, every fragment, every particle, stands forth separate and
       particular, so as to be handled, measured, and weighed in the balance
       of critic and poet. Each has its own exact form and accurate place,
       so that, while separately they are beautiful, united they are perfect.
       Hence their combinations have become sacred rules, and have given
       inviolable maxims not only to English but to universal literature.
       Germany, as we have seen, studies with love and almost veneration
       every page of Shakespeare ; national sympathies and kindred speech
       make it not merely easy but natural to all people of the Teutonic
       family to assimilate their literature to that its highest standard.
       France has departed, or is fast departing, from its favourite classical
       type, and adopting, though with unequal power, the broader and more
       natural lines of the Shakespearian model. His practice is an example,
       his declarations are oracles.
            Still, as I have said, the wide region of intellectual enjoyment over
       which our great bard exerts dominion, is not one parcelled out or
       divided into formal and state-like provinces.          While the student of
                                                                      "

       he must keep before him the solution of only one problem.             On that
       his mind must undistractedly rest, on that his power of thought be in
       tensely concentrated.        Woe to him if imagination leads his reason
       into truant wanderings ; woe if he drop the thread of finely-drawn
       deductions!      He will find his wearied intelligence drowsily floun
       dering     in a sea   of swimming figures and evanescent quantities, or
       floating    amidst  the  fragments of a shipwrecked diagram.        But over

minister their own varied pleasure or relief; and when by degrees we
have become familiar with the inexhaustible resources of his genius,
there is scarcely a want in mind or the affections that needs no higher
than human succour, which will not find in one or other of his works
that which will soothe suffering, comfort grief, strengthen good desires,
and present some majestic example to copy, or some fearful phantom.
But when we endeavour to contemplate all his infinitely varied con
ceptions as blended together in one picture, so as to take in, if possible,
at one glance the prodigious extent of his prolific genius, we thereby build
up what he himself so beautifully called the
                                               " fabric of a vision," match
less in its architecture, as in the airiness of its materials.     There are
forms fantastically sketched in cloud-shapes, such as Hamlet showed
to Polonius, in the midst of others rounded and full, which open and
unfold ever-changing varieties, now gloomy and threatening, then
tipped with gold and tinted with azure, ever-rolling, ever-moving,
 melting the one into the other, or extricating each itself from the
general mass.      Dwelling upon this maze of things and imaginations
the most incongruous combinations come before the dreamy thought
 fascinated,  spellbound, and entranced.        The wild Ardennes and
 Windsor park seem to run into one another, their firs and their oaks
mingle together ; the boisterous ocean boiling round
                                                            " the still vexed
              "
 Bermoothes runs smoothly into the lagoons of Venice ; the old grey
 porticoes of republican Rome, like the transition in a dissolving view,
are confused and entangled with the slim and fluted pillars of a Gothic
hall ; here the golden orb, dropped from the hand of a captive king,
rolls on the ground side by side with a jester's mouldy skull — both
emblems of a common fate in human things.             Then the grave chief
justice   seems incorporated   in the   bloated   Falstaff;  king John and
his barons are wassailing with Poins and Bardolph at an inn door ;
Coriolanus and Shylock are contending for the right of human sensi
bilities ; Macbeth and Jacques are moralising together on tenderness
even to the brute.     And so of other more delicate creations of the
poet's mind — Isabella and Ophelia, Desdemona and the Scotch thane's
wife produce respectively composite figures of inextricable confusion.
And around and above is that filmy world, Ariel and Titania and
Peasblossom and Cobweb and Moth, who weave us a gossamer cloud
around the vision, dimming it gradually before our eyes, in the last
drooping of weariness, or the last hour of wakefulness.

                    JOHN TYNDALL, Esq.              LL.D. F.R.S.
                          Professor of Natural Philosophy,   R.I.
On Radiation and Absorption with reference to the Colour                      of Bodies
                 and their State of Aggregation.
The speaker referred      to the relation subsisting between the sensible
phenomena    of nature,  and   those processes lying beyond the range of
the senses, on which the phenomena immediately depend.             He spoke
of the function of the imagination in picturing operations, which though
great in their aggregate        results beyond all conception, are too
minute individually     to be capable of observation.        He referred to
the luminiferous ether that fills space as the most striking illustration
hitherto known of the production of a line of thought from the domain
of the senses into that of the imagination, and affirmed the existence
of this wonderful medium to be based upon proofs at least as strong
as those which sustain the theory of gravitation.
     Dwelling briefly on the relation of this ether to the atoms and
molecules which are plunged in            it,
                                         he illustrated, by reference to the
phenomena    of sound,   the  difference  between good and bad radiators.
A   naked tuning-fork vibrating in free air imparted so small an amount
of motion to the air that   it ceased to be heard as sound at an incon
siderable distance   ;the same tuning-fork brought into union with its
resonant case produced    a  sound which could be heard                  by
                                                                thousands at
once.   The naked fork was bad radiator, the combined fork and case
                                 a
was    powerful radiator.
       a                      This combination of the fork and its case, as
regards sound, roughly represented the influence of chemical combina
tion as regards radiant heat.      By the act of combination the power of
the combining atoms as radiators might be augmented ten thousand
fold.   As an example of this the vapour of water was selected         and     ;     it
was affirmed that    pound of this vapour taken to the top of
                     a                                                  high    a
mountain, there heated and exposed before the cloudless heaven, would
radiate nine or ten thousand times — possibly twenty thousand times — as
much heat into stellar space as could be radiated         either of the con
                                                                    by
stituents of the vapour when uncombined.

488          Professor  Tyndall  on  Radiation and Absorption       [Jan. 19,
      The speaker also referred to the well-known analogy between the
 pitch of a sound and the colour of light, and throwing a large spectrum
 upon a white screen mentioned the relation between the various colours
 to the rapidity of ethereal vibration. The space from the red to the blue
 embraced an infinite number of rates of vibration, gradually and con
tinuously shortening without any interruption.        It might be typified by
an infinite number of tuning-forks of gradually augmenting pitch, and
all sounding at the same time.       This spectrum was derived from the
 carbon points of the electric light ; but it was shown that in the case of
 various other incandescent substances the spectrum was not of this con
tinuous character. The magnificent stream of green light produced
by the volatilization of silver in the electric lamp was shown upon a
screen, and afterwards the light was analyzed and found to produce two
 bands of brilliant green, differing but slightly from each other in
 refrangibility.    Here the case is typified, not by an infinite number of
 tuning-forks, but by two tuning-forks of slightly different pitch.      And
just as the rate of vibration in the case of the tuning-fork is a fixed
 rate, so the rate of vibration of the atoms of silver vapour were fixed.
 And as the colour of the vapour depended on its rate of atomic vibra
 tion, the constancy of this rate secured the constancy of colour in the
 vapour.     We cannot make the vapour of silver white hot, however we
 may exalt its temperature. We may augment the brilliancy of the
 particular rays that it emits, but we cannot cause it to emit that variety
 of rays the blending of which together produces the impression of
 white.
      Like the vapour of silver the vapour of water has also its definite
 periods of vibration ; and they are not such as to enable the vapour,
 however high its temperature may be raised, to emit a white light.        It
 can hardly be said to emit any light at all.       The flame of hydrogen,
 for example, is composed of intensely heated aqueous vapour, but it is
 hardly visible ; and it is easy to give the vapour of water a temperature
 sufficient to raise a solid body placed in the vapour to a bright red
 heat, while the vapour itself remains absolutely dark.      Now the powers
 of radiation and absorption go hand in hand, and the body which
cannot emit luminous rays is incompetent to absorb them.           Thus the
sun's luminous rays pass freely through the aqueous vapour of our
atmosphere ; while it is the impediment offered by this same vapour to
the radiation from the earth which checks the sudden drain of terrestrial
heat, and thus renders our planet inhabitable.
     This power of electric absorption was illustrated by the action of
two tuning-forks which sounded the same note.             Both forks being
mounted on their resonant stands, one of them was first sounded.         The
silent fork was then brought near the sounding one, and held near it
for five seconds.       The vibrations of the excited fork were then
quenched, but the sound did not cease to be heard.         In fact the silent
fork had taken up the vibrations of its
                                               neighbour, and continued to
sound after the latter had ceased to vibrate.
                                                     Again, one fork being
permitted to remain upon its stand, the other was dismounted and

  1866.]         with reference    to  Colour and Aggregation.             489
 thrown into strong vibration.        Detached from its stand, its sound was
 too feeble to be heard by the audience ; but on bringing it near the
 mounted fork a mellow sound rose which filled the room.              Thus the
 vibrations of the one fork were transmitted through the air and imparted
 to the other.   To effect this transference it was necessary that the forks
 should be in perfect unison : the fixing upon either of them of a bit of
 wax not larger than a pea was sufficient to destroy the power of the
 forks to influence each other.
      Thus one sounding body absorbs the vibration of another sounding
 body with which it is in unison ; and here we have in acoustics the
 representative of that great principle which in optics lies at the base of
 spectrum analysis, namely, that bodies absorb those rays which they can
 themselves emit.     Thus green vapour of silver if interposed in the path
 of a beam of white light, will absorb the green which it can itself emit.
 Thus also the incandescent vapour of sodium, itself intensely yellow, cuts
 clearly out the yellow band of the spectrum. And the same is true of
 aqueous vapour. Its periods of vibration synchronize with those of the
 rays, or more accurately waves, emitted by the warmed earth, and hence
 its power to intercept those waves by taking up their motion. But it is
 in dissonance with the luminous waves emitted by the sun, and hence
those waves pass through large quantities of it with scarcely sensible
absorption.
     This incompetence of aqueous vapours to absorb luminous rays is
shared by all really transparent bodies ; in fact, they are transparent in
virtue of their incapacity to absorb luminous rays.          Now, transparent
 bodies in a state of powder are always white, and in white bodies
 luminous rays have no power. The light of the sun, for example,
cannot warm white sugar, nor can it warm table salt, nor flour, nor a
white dress ; it cannot even melt snow. The most powerful luminous
beam may be concentrated upon a surface covered with hoar frost
without melting a single spicula of the frost crystals.          How, then, it
may    be asked, does   sunshine    clear away  the  snow  from  the mountain
heads ?     Two or three days' sunshine on the mountains suffices to
obliterate the traces of a heavy snow-fall : how can this occur if sun
shine has no power to melt the snow crystals ? It is not the luminous
rays of the sun which perform this work, but a body of rays which,
though possessing high calorific power, have no light in them.            By a
process of transmutation these dark rays may be converted into
luminous ones, but as they come from the sun, and fall upon the
mountain summits, they are utterly incompetent to excite vision. Every
stream which channels the glaciers or tumbles down the valleys of the
Alps is the direct product of this invisible radiation. To it also the
glaciers owe their birth as well as their dissolution.          For while the
luminous rays    of  the  sun  falling  on  the  tropical ocean  penetrate the
water to great depths without considerable absorption, the dark rays
are in great part absorbed close to the surface of the ocean; they there
fore heat the water at the surface, and are thus almost the sole excitants
of evaporation. Not only, then, do those invisible solar rays, by the

490         Professor      Tyndall   on    Radiation and Absorption     [Jan.   19,
fusion of the ice, give birth to the rivers of Switzerland-, but it is they
that lift the material of these rivers from the sea and store it on the
frozen summits of the mountains.
     Gathering up the rays emitted by a powerful electric lamp, and con
centrating them upon a small focus, water, alcohol, or ether placed at the
focus speedily boils, some of them, indeed, almost instantly. But they are
not boiled by the luminous rays, though these produce an impression too
dazzling to be borne upon the eye.           Interposing in the path of the
concentrated beam a glass cell containing pure distilled water, the light
of the beam is not sensibly diminished, but it is no longer competent to
boil or even heat water at the focus. Placing a piece of ice at the
luminous focus it is not melted, though, if blackened wood be placed
there, it is set on fire. The moment, however, the cell of water is
withdrawn the ice melts —melts because the dark rays previously
absorbed by the water of the cell are now absorbed by it.             There are
liquids of very low boiling points — bisulphide of carbon, for instance—
which, when placed at the focus where the whole radiation, dark and
bright, of the electric lamp is converged, cannot be caused to boil, can
hardly be warmed.          Water, for instance, requires a temperature of
212° Fahr. to boil         bisulphide of carbon requires only 118°
                          it,                                            4'
                                                                          ; still
the former       boiled in
                is              time insufficient to warm the latter. This
                                 a
arises from the fact, that while water powerfully absorbs the dark
calorific rays and allows the luminous ones free transmission, the
bisulphide of carbon        transparent to both classes of rays, and hence
                            is                                                   is
warmed by neither of them. Thus, also, when              was stated that sugar
                                                        it
could not be warmed by the light of the sun, the invisible solar rays
were meant to be excluded, for when the total radiation of the sun               is
converged upon white sugar           itimmediately burnt up, the agent of its
                                          is
combustion being, however, the dark radiation.
     It possible to filter the composite radiation from the sun or from
       is
the electric light, so as to detach almost completely the visible from the
invisible rays.     It has been already stated that bisulphide of carbon         is
transparent to both classes of rays now iodine,;           substance which dis
                                                            a
solves freely in the bisulphide,        eminently transparent to the invisible
                                          is
rays alone.     Hence, a combination of these two substances furnishes
us with a   ray-filter, which, while      pitilessly cuts off the bright rays,
                                               it
allows the dark ones free transmission.         At the dark focus we can boil
water or alcohol, but we cannot warm bisulphide or bichloride of
carbon. Bromine also, notwithstanding its volatility, bears exposure at
the focus without being heated.       Sulphur also bears the temperature of
the focus for a considerable time without ignition.              Common pho
sphorus,    acombustible so quick that the warmth of the fingers when in
contact with     suffices to provoke combustion, bears for twenty or thirty
                it

    We are here naturally reminded of the experiments of Franklin,
which consisted in placing cloths of various colours upon snow, and ob
serving the depth to which they sank in the snow when exposed to direct
sunshine.       Franklin concluded that the lighter the colour of the body
the less      its power of absorption.
               is                              The generalizations founded on this
experiment are for the most part fallacious.            Results long ago obtained,
establishing     the  vast  influence  of  chemical  constitution  on radiant heat,
led the speaker to contrast iodine, an element, with alum, a body of
highly complex character. Both substances were in powder, the one
being dark, the other white.            Exposed to the radiation from various
sources, the white powder proved itself in all cases the most powerful
absorber. The dark powder of amorphous phosphorus was also com
pared with the hydrated oxide of zinc, but the white powder was the
best absorber.        Bodies of the same colour compared together showed
similar differences.        The red oxide of lead for example was contrasted
with the red iodide of mercury, and the oxide proved the most power
ful absorber. So also the white chloride of silver was compared with
the white carbonate of lead, the lead salt proved by far the most
powerful absorber. In this way                  was proved that as regards the
                                               it
absorption      of  radiant   heat,  white  in some  cases exceeds black, black in
some cases exceeds white, and the other colours are equally capricious               ;
all evidently depending on the chemical constitution of the substances.
Here, as in other cases moreover, radiation and absorption go hand
in hand, the substance which absorbs heat most powerfully radiating
the same heat most copiously.
    In the case of Franklin's white cloth exposed on snow to sunshine,
there      no reason why          should sink at all     there   is,
                                                                   on the contrary,
                                  it it
          is                                                 ;
reason to conclude that            must rise relatively to the snow surrounding
it. For, as regards the luminous rays of the sun, they are alike power
less to warm the cloth or to melt the snow.                Whatever effect is   pro
duced     istherefore due to the dark solar rays. Now, snow absorbs these
rays with greater greediness than any other substance             ; hence the white
cloth, which absorbs less than the snow, really defends the snow under
neath      from the action of the sun, and owing to this protection the
          it
cloth,  if exposed for        sufficient time, will rise in relation to the surface
                              a

   respect.    And when, as in the case    of the black cloth, we have added
   to the absorption of a large portion    of  the dark rays by the cloth, the
   absorption of the whole of the luminous rays by the dye, the sum of
   the absorption of both classes of rays exceeds the absorption by the
   snow of the dark rays alone.        The black cloth will therefore sink in
  the snow.     This is the explanation of Franklin's experiment.
        The speaker concluded by referring to various experiments on
  the transmission of radiant heat through rock salt ; to the influence of
  science as a means of intellectual culture ; and to the necessary defects
  of any system of education in which the study of nature is neglected or
  ignored.

                        On    the  Sources   of   the  Nile.
  The primary object of geographical exploration             is the opening to
  general intercourse such portions of the earth as may become useful
  to the human race.       The explorer is the precursor of the colonist,
  and the colonist is the instrument by which the great work must be
  constructed, that greatest and most difficult of all undertakings, the
  civilization of the world.
       The progress of civilization is dependent upon geographical position.
  The surface of the earth presents certain facilities, and obstacles to
 general access ; those points which are easily attainable must always
 enjoy a superior civilization to those that are cut off from association
  with the world.
       We may thus assume that the advance of civilization depends upon
 means of transport ; countries remote from the sea may through the
 ingenuity of man be rendered accessible ; the natural productions of
 those lands may be transported to the sea coast in exchange for
 foreign commodities, and commerce             thus instituted becomes the
pioneer of civilization.
      Rivers are the natural arteries of the world ; providing channels
of communication, they have been from the earliest ages the most
important geographical phenomena.
      Countries that are blessed with navigable rivers invariably prosper ;

1866.]                   on the Sources of the Nile.                 493
the ancients were so cognizant of this fact that all first settlements
were made upon the banks of rivers, and the origin of the human
race dates from an Eden between the Tigris and Euphrates.
     London upon the Thames is a mighty fact significant of the
importance of river communication.       America, that giant offspring of
Great Britain, owes her unexampled prosperity to her navigable rivers.
     Accepting the theory that rivers are the most important geo
graphical points, we turn with increased interest to that great artery of
Africa now before us ; that mysterious stream which has ever absorbed
the attention of both ancient and modern geographers — the Nile.
     Egypt has been created by the Nile. The great Sahara, that
frightful desert of interminable scorching sand which stretches from
the Red Sea to the Atlantic, is cleft by one solitary thread of water.
Ages and ages before man could have existed in that inhospitable land,
this thread of water was at its silent work ; year after year it flooded
and fell, leaving a rich legacy of soil upon the barren sand, until the
delta was created ; and man, at so remote a period that we have no
clue even to an approximate date, occupied the fertile lands thus born
of the river Nile, and that corner of savage Africa rescued from its
barrenness became Egypt.
     The Egyptians claimed the most ancient origin ; their geo
graphical position gave them extraordinary advantages for commercial
enterprise. Bounded on the east by the Red Sea, on the north by the
Mediterranean, while the fertilizing Nile afforded inland communica
tion, Egypt became in the earliest era the most civilized and pros
perous country of the earth.
     Egypt not only was created by the Nile, but the very existence
of the Egyptians depended upon the annual inundation by that river ;
thus, all that pertained to the Nile was of vital importance to the
people ; it was the hand that fed them.
     Two thousand five hundred and eighty years ago a graduated
pillar was erected as a nilometer in a well on the island of Rhoda,
opposite old Cairo, and the rise and fall of the river was measured and
watched with equal anxiety to the present day.
     A  century later, a canal was commenced by Pharaoh Necho to
connect the Nile with the Red Sea ; the undertaking failed, but was
subsequently completed after the Persian conquest, and water com
munication was thus established between the Red Sea and the
Mediterranean.      Egypt was the Nile and the Nile was Egypt.
     Depending   so entirely upon the river as Egypt did, it was natural
that the mysterious origin of those sacred waters should absorb the
speculations of all thinking men.       It was unlike all other rivers.
In July and August, when European streams were at their lowest
in the summer heat, the Nile was at the flood !
     In Egypt there was no rainfall. Not even a drop of dew in those
parched deserts through which the glorious river flowed for 860
thirsty miles of latitude without one single tributary.    Licked up by
the burning air, and gulped down by the exhausting sand of Arabian

494                         Mr. Samuel W. Baker                         [Jan. 26,
deserts, nevertheless     it flowed ; supporting all losses by evaporation
and absorption, the noble flood shed its annual blessings upon Egypt.
An anomaly among rivers ; flooding in the dry season ; everlasting
even in sandy deserts ; where was its hidden origin ? where were the
"Sources of the Nile?"
                                   "
     The " Source of the Nile        was, from the earliest period, the great
geographical question to be solved. Thus, in the ancient days of
Egypt, her kings and priests endeavoured                to unravel this great
mystery, and    to explain   the  cause of  the  annual   flood, upon whica the
existence of the Egyptians depended.
     The most important event of Jewish history commenced about
1706 R. c., when the family of Joseph came from Canaan into Egypt
to purchase corn during the seven years of famine ; and thus com
menced the settlement of the Israelites among the Egyptians.                 The
colonization was due to the river Nile. Seven years of unprecedented
fertility must have been due to seven seasons of extreme inundation,
which so filled the granaries of Pharaoh, that he supported the whole
population of Egypt during seven succeeding years of famine.                That
famine must have been caused by the low level of the river Nile.
There was famine, i. e. want of rain in Canaan, and this drought must
have extended to the mountain range in Abyssinia, and have exhausted
the great tributaries to the Nile from that country.           These tributaries
are the Atbara, Settite or Taccazy, Salaam, Angrab, Rahad, Dinder,
and the great Blue Nile.
     We thus find, as far back as 3570 years, the proof that the popu
lation of Egypt had originally been induced by the Nile, as the
fertility produced by that extraordinary river not only supported the
people of Egypt, but attracted in times of scarcity emigrants from far
countries, as exemplified by the colony of Israelites.                Everything
connected with Egypt was so dependent upon the Nile, that even one
of the seven plagues was a disturbance of its waters.
     * " And the fish that was in the river died ; and the river stank,
and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river ; and
there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt."
     " And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to
drink ; for they could not drink of the water of the river."
     Doubtless this plague was caused by so low a level of the Nile
that the current ceased, and the water stagnating gave birth to a mass
of animalculae of a crimson colour, resembling blood. This is proved
by the words "they digged round about the river for water to drink."
     This custom prevails at the present day among the Arabs, who
refuse to drink the water of the White Nile from the river when low,
on account of minute worms that affect
                                               the stomach.
     Following this curse upon the river in the reign of Pharaoh, is the
plague of frogs : " And the river shall
                                              bring forth frogs abundantly,"!

    The appearance of frogs in such myriads is a further proof of
the general stagnation of the river, caused by an extraordinary dry
season.
    These striking facts, handed down to us by Sacred History, give a
peculiar interest to the Nile.            Civilization and learning had sprung
from the banks of the Egyptian river— we hear of Moses, that he was
" learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians."               But although Egypt
was at that period the centre of the world in all that related to science
and civilization, and dependent upon the river for its actual existence,
not all the learning and wisdom of the Egyptians could determine the
" Sources of the N ile."
    Time will not permit me to allude to the expeditions that, during
some thousand years, have been framed by various nations for this
discovery.      All failed until our countryman, Bruce, discovered the
source of the Blue Nile about ninety years ago.                   He was the first
Englishman who had started upon this mysterious mission. Bruce
confessed that the Blue Nile was not the great river, but merely a
tributary to the main stream known as the White Nile.                    Numerous
expeditions    have     started  since  that time   to explore  the  acknowledged
Nile, — to seek for the sources of the White river.                 All   failed ; a
fatality hung     over    those  marshy regions    of  inner Africa,  and  the Nile
sources seemed doomed to remain for ever sealed.                   There appeared
to be insurmountable difficulties from the north, and it was reserved
for the honour of England to send an expedition to the south rid
Zanzibar.      In command of this expedition, struggling forward with
British tenacity of        purpose, our gallant explorers, Speke and Grant,
reached    the first Nile source in the Victoria Lake.
     In the very heart of Africa, in N. lat. 4° 55',            I met those great
men with open arms.            Gaunt and lean with toil and bad climate, but
elate with having accomplished that which had baffled the whole
world, on the 15th February, 1863, they marched into Gondokoro at
the head of the faithful eighteen followers who had started with them
from Zanzibar.
    It would be vain to attempt the description of this meeting. For
nearly two years         I  had been exploring the tributaries of the Nile,
absorbed with the one idea of discovering its true source, and of
meeting my old friend Speke in some dilemma from which                      I  had a
Quixotic hope of extricating him.
     Having completed the exploration of all the great rivers from
Abyssinia,    I   had descended the Blue Nile to Khartoum, at which
place   I had organized a powerful expedition for the White Nile.                  To
overcome the great difficulty of Central Africa, " want of transport,"
I  had purchased a number of beasts of burden, including horses,
camels, and asses, all of which, to the number of twenty-nine,                 I con
veyed up the White Nile            in three vessels, and.1   landed   them    safe  in
Gondokoro      in  lat.  4°  55' on  3rd Feb.,   1863.
    The voyage from Khartoum to Gondokoro occupied forty-five
days.     Nothing can be more tedious than this journey through inter

 496                         Mr. Samuel W. Baker                   [Jan. 26,
 minable marshes and vast flats of high reeds and papyrus. Well
 might the ancient expeditions have returned disheartened from so
 mournful and hopeless a prospect. Throughout the whole course of
 the White Nile there is not a mountain until Gondokoro is reached.
 There, the scenery changes suddenly ; the boundless marshes cease,
 and dry land is gladly welcomed ; evergreen trees, native villages and
 distant hills, and mountain ranges, relieve the eye long wearied by
 unvarying swamps.
      I  had been twelve days waiting at Gondokoro for the arrival of a
 trader's party from the south with whom       I had intended to travel, and
 to form a depot of heavy baggage at their most advanced station,
 when they suddenly arrived, bringing with them Speke and Grant.
      Delighted as     I  was to have thus met them,     I was nevertheless
 disappointed.     At the first blush it appeared that the great work was
 completed ; and that my expedition, organized at great cost and
 labour, must fruitlessly return.
      Speke relieved me from this despair by giving me a sketch of his
 route, showing that in N. lat. 2° 17' the Nile that he crossed below
 Karuma Falls turned suddenly to the west, and, according to native
 reports, it fell into a great lake called the Luta N'zige.        Thus his
 exploration was incomplete.
      There was evidently much to be done to clear up a most important
 point, and   I  immediately determined, if possible, to accomplish it.
 It lay heavily upon poor Speke's heart that he had been unable to
 follow up that portion of the river.      He said — " Geographers at home
 will raise a question upon this unexplored point, and they will forget
 how hard we have worked to get through what we have done."                 I
 comforted him with the promise that           I would not return without
 completing     the    work   desired.    Speke and Grant sailed from
 Gondokoro for England.           As   I watched their boat disappearing in
 the distance    I  felt the importance of my responsibility.     Bruce had
 succeeded on the Blue Nile.         Speke and Grant had won the Victoria
 Source.    All nations, excepting England, had failed ; and the honour
 of England for the third expedition to the Nile Sources rested upon
 my head.     Had    I   been alone, it would have been no hard task to die
 upon the untrodden ground before me, but there was one who, although
 my greatest comfort, was also my greatest care — one whose presence
 through years of toil and wandering, whether in scorching deserts or
 beneath the shade of some pitying tree, had made each spot my home,
and with a devotion which exists only in a woman's heart had deter
 mined to share my dangers and fatigues. This was my wife ; what
would be her fate in the very heart of Africa, among savages, should
I  die ?
     I  was prepared to start ; my party consisted of forty-five men well
armed ; but my difficulties were about to commence.
     The whole of the so-called trade of the White Nile is a system of
robbery and murder combined with the slave trade ; the atrocities
committed by the parties employed by the traders are beyond description

— robbery of        vast herds of cattle from the unfortunate natives is the
acknowledged
                     " trade ; " and the cold-blooded murder of the tribes is
the pastime of the ruffians who compose the ivory trading parties.
      My men, who, as inhabitants of the Soudan, had formerly been
engaged        in these practices, mutinied when             I was about to start,
refusing to proceed, as in my service they would not be allowed to
indulge in slave hunting and pillage.             They threatened to fire simul
taneously at me should          I  attempt to disarm them ; and all the trading
parties amounting to about 600 armed men threatened to repel me by
force of arms from the interior should               I   attempt to advance.    My
escort dispersed, and joined the various slave hunting parties, leaving
me utterly helpless.           By dint of careful management           I at length
induced seventeen of my mutineers to start from Gondokoro ;                        I
resolved      to quit at all hazards that nefarious spot, trusting that            I
should gain influence over my men when once in the interior.                  They
consented        to start on the condition that        I   should travel east; my
intended course was south.            I  discovered that they had conspired to
desert me at a trader's station, seven days' march east of Gondokoro in
the Latooka country, and to murder me should                   I attempt to disarm
them.       With this escort      I  started at night on the 26th March, 1863,
 without one native attendant ; not an interpreter, nor even a guide
being procurable.          I  followed a few hours' march behind a trader's
 party    that   had  started   on that afternoon, trusting to overcome their
 hostility by all-powerful gold upon the road.
      After seven days' march through a mountainous and fertile country,
 passing the Bari and Ellyria tribes, we arrived at Latooka, about
 100 miles east of Gondokoro.                The promised mutiny broke out ;
 several of my men deserted with their arms and ammunition and
joined a slave hunting party. This party of upwards of 100 men,
 armed with guns, attacked a native village on the mountains ; but the
 Latookas fought bravely, and the slave hunters, losing their way in a
 hasty retreat down the rocky mountain, were forced over a precipice
 by the natives, and massacred almost to a man ; my mutineers being
 among the slain.          This accident was of great service to me ; my
 remaining men regarded the fate of their late comrades as the effect of
 the " evil eye," and were persuaded that           I  was in some way connected
 with the disaster.*
      I had by presents reduced a hostile trader's party to cold civility,

     * The Latookas are a splendid race of savages, inhabiting a beautiful country
 of mountain and plain ; they are extremely wealthy, possessing immense herds of
 cattle, and cultivating a variety of grain upon an extensive scale.     They are a
 warlike race, but I found them particularly friendly, as I fraternized with them
 after their attack on the slave-hunters. Like all the tribes of that part they are
 good blacksmiths, although their tools are limited to a cleft stick for tongs, and
 two stones for hammer and anvil.
     The Latookas are the only tribe that I left with regret ; but it was necessary
 to push for Unyoro.

although     I had marched 140 miles, I was then only fifty-three miles in
a direct line farther south than Gondokoro.                  Obbo is a plateau
3,600 feet above the sea ; a high range of mountains separates it from
the valley of Latooka on the east, which forms the watershed of the
country ; the western side draining to the Nile, while the east side
drains into the Kaniete river through the Latooka valley to the river
Sobat.      Obbo, situated among high mountains, has a great rainfall
from February to November.            With the commencement of the rains
the Tsetse fly appears,     and  every one of my animals died in this fatal
spot.* Being quite helpless, without means of transport, endeavouredI
to gain the confidence of a neighbouring trader's party by daily
repairing their guns, doctoring their sick and wounded, and acting as
umpire in all their disputes for many months, until in January 5,
 1 864, the rains having ceased, the rivers in advance were              fordable,
and    I   started south towards Unyoro, in which country the reported
lake was supposed to exist.          I  had exchanged nearly all my clothes
and shoes with the trader's people for provisions.           I had also purchased
a number of oxen from them in exchange             for guns. These       I trained
for riding ; and leaving nearly all my baggage,          I left Obbo with a few
porters to carry blankets and ammunition, &c., and presents for king
Kamrasi.
      We crossed the Atabbi river in 3" 45', a perennial stream of
considerable volume, flowing into the Asua river.              We arrived at the
 Asua    in  lat. 3° 12'.   That  river  flows  through a deep valley, 1,100
feet below the general level of the Obbo country.               It was nearly dry
at that season, January 9th, where        I crossed above the junction of the
Atabbi, and a slight stream only ankle-deep trickled down its rocky
bed.      Although the Asua during the rains is fifteen feet deep, about
 120 yards wide, with a violent current, it is a simple mountain torrent,
being absolutely nil in the dry season.          The country rises rapidly on
the south bank of the Asua to an equal elevation to that of Obbo ; it
is therefore the main drain of that portion of the country.              Six days'
march south of the Asua we arrived at Karuma Falls, at the ferry
where Speke and Grant had crossed, and where they had left the river
running from them due west.
      Up to this point from Latooka the country had been very lovely,
diversified with granite mountains, forests, prairies, and well watered
     • The chief of Obbo — " Kachiba" — was the great magician of this country,
but he confessed that his magic was of no avail against the flies which killed all
cattle in his country. He was a renowned rain-maker, and he declared that he
had a house full of thunder and lightning and rain quite at his own disposal for
the crops, but he could do nothing with the flies who would assuredly kill my
animals. Unfortunately his prophecy was true.
    This old chief had 116 children living, and was a charmingly quaint old
" pater familias." He told me that he was not naked from choice but from
necessity, and he begged for clothes ; not for mine fortunately, as I had none to
give him, but for my wife's.    He was quickly attired in lady's costume, to the
great delight of his people and the admiration of his wives.

 with numerous rivulets, but very thinly populated.                     The natives
 perfectly naked, all equally ignorant of a Supreme Being, without
 any idea of worship, and free from even a vestige of superstition.
      Like most Africans they were very averse to labour, and their
time was passed in singing, dancing,- drinking a fermented gruel, and
committing raids upon their neighbours' cattle.
      Many parts of the country had been utterly devastated by the
slave traders ; villages were reduced to ashes, and the population scared
away, while hundreds were murdered or carried into slavery.
      The last five days' march had been through uninhabited prairies ;
we now arrived at the Karuma Falls, and the passage of this portion
of the Nile into the country of Unyoro was to introduce a totally
distinct people.
      After a day lost in obtaining permission to cross the river, a canoe
was paddled from the Unyoro side, and we were ferried across about
an hour after sunset.        Uy the light of a fire the boatman showed me a
string of blue beads that Speke had given him. It is impossible to
describe the interest that so trifling an event occasioned, when in that
wild country I came for the first time upon the track of my poor
friend Speke.
      On the following morning the natives positively refused to permit
the passage of my men across              the river, until they .should receive
orders from the king Kamrasi ; we were thus cut off from the main
party.     The river was about 150 yards in width, boiling through a
succession of rapids in its course west between high cliffs covered with
bananas, and a great variety of foliage.
      This was the first spot at which 1 had met with the banana.
      For many days it was impossible to proceed south : the capital of
Unyoro was about forty miles distant, and the king sent word that
   big men were not in a hurry to pay visits, therefore I must wait."
'•
At length his majesty condescended to send for me, but we were
twelve days marching forty-two miles, as spies were ordered to report
upon our conduct daily ; and we were systematically detained until
messengers returned from Kamrasi.*
      At length, after much patience exhausted, we arrived at the
capital M'rooli, the residence of the king.               We had marched from
Karuma Falls parallel with the Nile due south, and at the junction of
the Kafoor river in lat. 1° 37' we were shown a few poor huts on a
miserable swamp opposite the town, which were to form my camp.
            people of this country were far superior in intellip>nce to nny that I had

       The
seen.   They were excellent smiths, using iron hammers instead of stones; they
drew wire; made good pottery; they prepared superior tobacco; and manu
factured -very neat pipes ; they worked fine braid of the plantain fibre, and
cultivated their ground in a superior manner.    Plantains were the staple food, and
a variety of sweet potatoe, beans, and Indian corn.    Their dress consisted of cloth
made of the bark from a species of fig-tree ; this tree was largely cultivated, and
it was the custom for a newly-married man to plant a certain number in his
garden, which were to be the tailors of the expected family.

     At this spot the Nile was exceedingly sluggish, flowing through a
marsh of papyrus rush.         The Kafoor was also a deep river, having at
that season no perceptible stream, and being about seventy yards wide.
I  was now within eighty miles of the first cradle of the river, the
Victoria Lake.       My course to the second-reported lake was west, but
up to that moment         I   had been unable to obtain any information
respecting   its  distance  ;  the natives simply pointed to the west, and
exclaimed " Magungo ;" they appeared greatly amused, and ridiculed
the idea of comparing its size to the Victoria, which they declared to
be very inferior.      This information was exceedingly interesting, as             I
had heard from the natives of Latooka, nearly twelve months previous,
that there was water communication with the far south, as the cowrie
shells were formerly brought in boats by white men* to a place called
Magungo, which I imagined by their description to be on about the
2°N. lat.    I   now heard of the actual existence of the town Magungo.
I  had thus a direct clue to the lake.
     After some days' delay, the great king appeared at the head of
about a thousand men to pay me a formal visit ; he was a tall, dignified
man, remarkably clean and well dressed in bark cloth, arranged like
the Roman toga.         Throughout this country nudity was considered
indecent, and both men and women were clean and attentive to their
personal appearance ; this sudden change from utter nudity and savage-
dom to decency is extraordinary, as on the north bank of the river at
Karuma the natives are quite naked. The river in North lat. 2° 17' is
the boundary of the naked tribes.
     I found the king very suspicious ; he declared the lake to be six
months' march from his capital ; and for many days he amused
himself by deceiving me upon all points, and begging for all that            I had.
His great fear was that        I  intended to go forward to Uganda to visit
his enemy the King M'tese, and to give him presents — thus, he
was determined to fleece me completely, so as to render such
a visit impossible.      He surrounded me with spies, who reported to
him all that they saw me use — thus, he asked me for my watch, sextant,
compass, and a variety of objects that          I had studiously kept from his
 view. The object most coveted was my sword ; this               I had refused to
give him.     I  really 'was without hope of ever reaching the lake. Both
I  and my wife were martyrs to fever ; my quinine was exhausted ; my
original escort was reduced to thirteen men ; the conduct of the king
was extremely suspicious and mistrustful ; and the actual distance of
the lake was unknown.
     Fortune at length favoured me :          I found a native trader in salt.
The supply of salt for this and neighbouring countries was produced
on the borders of the lake ; and having won the trader's confidence by
presents, he gave me the information that the lake was fifteen days'
march from M'rooli for loaded men, but only ten days for a messenger.
                                              I

speech, and    I  offered to present him with my sword as a proof of my
friendly   intentions   ; at the same time I  offered to slice through at one
blow any shield he should produce, as a proof of its temper.             This
completely won his heart ; his manner became quite cordial, and he
said that he was quite assured of my sincerity, but that to prove our
brotherhood we must drink each other's blood — a custom that must
be gone through as a mutual exchange of vows.               This was rather a
strong dose.      I  told him that my countrymen considered the spilling
of blood as a token of hostility ; but to show him my good faith, 1
would order my head man to exchange blood with his greatest chief.
At once he acceded to this proposal ; the arms were bared and pricked
 with a sharp lance, and each licked the other's blood as it flowed from
 the vein.    They requested that a gun might be fired to seal the com
pact, but the report occasioned a great panic among the crowd, who,
in the rush to escape after the second barrel, tumbled over each
other in the greatest confusion. This delighted the king, who was in
the best humour possible ; he promised to send me to the lake, and
 he immediately give me every information, confirming the report             I
 had obtained from the salt dealer.          I  could not help asking him,
 " How so great a king could tell so great a lie ?" as he had now con
 fessed.    Far from being ashamed, he burst out laughing, and replied,
                    I
" Do you think am such a fool as to tell strangers all that concerns
my territory?        I  did not believe in your peaceful intentions until
you gave up your sword.            Now we have exchanged blood we are
 brothers. When would you like to start ?" This looked like business.
 He immediately called one of his chiefs and a guide, and he ordered
them to have porters and an escort ready on the morrow.
      He then told me all concerning the lake and the neighbouring
countries, the whole of which information ultimately proved to be
 minutely correct, both by ocular examination and by the accounts            I
 received from the natives.
                                            I
      The effect of the king's order that was to be escorted to the lake
 was magical ; the tongues of his subjects, that had hitherto been tied
 with the secrecy of freemasonry, were at once loosed, and all were
 ready to give information.
      Kamrasi told me that the lake Luta N'zige was far larger than the
 Victoria Nyanza.         The short road to Zanzibar he declared to be
 south-east of M'rooli on the east bank of the Victoria. He confirmed
 Speke and Grant's account that the Nile (or according to Speke the
 Somerset river) flowed out of the Victoria, and after turning due west
 from Karuma Falls it flowed for seven or eight days' march in a
 succession of rapids, and fell into the Luta N'zige.        From its point of
junction it almost immediately made its exit from the lake in a greatly
 increased    volume, and continued as a navigable river to the north
 through the Koshi and Madi tribes for a distance unknown.
      The Luta N'zige he described as extending south to Karagwrf,
 forming the western frontier of that country, and from that point
 about 2° South lat., it turned to the west, its extent in that direction

 being unknown even to Rumanika, the King of Karagwe.                       Formerly
 this king Rumanika, being in communication with the ivory traders
 from Zanzibar, sent parties in all directions to purchase ivory with
 beads and brass coil bracelets and cowrie shells ; sometimes Arabs
 accompanied his parties, and came down the lake Luta N'zige in large
 boats to Magungo, this latter place being the most northern limit of
 their journey.
      Here was a corroboration of the information           I  had obtained twelve
 months ago.      Magungo was the spot that           I  had always heard named
in connection with the supply of cowrie shells.               The route by which
 they   arrived   was   now   clearly    established      direct   from Zanzibar.
 Nothing    could  be clearer  than   the  geography      of  the  country as given
by   the  king.   The   lake  Luta    N'zige    formed     the  western   frontier of
Unyoro,     Uganda,   and   Karagwe,      and   was     evidently   the  great basin
of the Nile. To reach this great geographical point I was now
determined.
      After several days' delay the hour arrived to start.               A crowd of
about 300 grotesque warriors were to form my escort ; these fellows
were yelling and dancing, engaging in mock fights, and screaming like
demons, being got up in Pandemonium style with horns upon their
heads, false beards, tails of cows, and leopard skin mantles.
     My slight escort of thirteen cowards were much scared at this
exhibition.
     At the last moment the king appeared to take leave, coupled with
the mild request, that as he had agreed to send me to the lake, he
                                              —
expected me to make him a present of my wife ! !
      We were surrounded by hundreds of his yelling savages, and this
insolent demand was his ultimatum.            I  immediately drew a pistol and
threatened to shoot him on the spot should he ever name the demand
again, explaining to him that not all his men could save him should I
touch the trigger.      To my astonishment, at the very moment when
                                                                 " Don't be angry,
                                                                                    I
believed it to be the close of the last act, he said,
I  had not an idea you would be insulted.             I  should be very happy to
give you a nice young wife of mine, and           I  thought you might have no
objection to do the same.       It is my custom to make any distinguished
visitor a present of a pretty wife."       Declining this kind offer,      I insisted
                                                    " faux pas," he
upon starting, and to make amends for his                               immediately
gave the order.
     The march from M'rooli was full of misery ; the rain poured in
torrents ; we were ill with fever ; my wife fell senseless, struck by
coup de soleil, and was carried in a litter insensible for seven days.
We had no supplies, not even tea or coffee ; no tent, nor in fact any
thing but blankets and ammunition, &c. ; all had been left behind
months ago for want of porters.
     At length, after seventeen days' march from M'rooli, our flagging
spirits were revived, the guide assured us that by noon on the following
day we should reach the long-wished-for lake. Our route had been
over park-like country, abounding in deep swampy hollows, overgrown

   with papyrus rush, the laud increasing in elevation from M'rooli, that
   point being at the river level 4,061 feet, while the highest part of the
  route to the west was 4,562.
        That night I hardly slept. For years I had striven to reach the
  " sources of the Nile." In my dreams              I had always failed, but now
  the cup was at my very lips, and          I  was to drink at the mysterious
  fountain before another sun should set — at that great reservoir of
  nature that ever since creation had baffled all discovery.
        I had hoped, and prayed, and striven through all kinds of difficulties,
  in sickness, starvation, and fatigue, to reach that hidden source ; and
  when it had appeared impossible,           I  had determined to die upon the
  path rather than return defeated.         Was it possible that it was so near ?
  and that to-morrow I could say, " My work is accomplished ?"
       The 14th March. The sun had not risen when I was spurring my
  ox after my guide, who having been promised a double handful of
  beads on arrival at the lake, had caught the enthusiasm of the moment.
  The day broke beautifully clear, and having crossed a deep valley
  between the hills, we toiled up the opposite slope.            I hurried to the
  summit ; the glory of my prize burst suddenly upon me ! There, like
  a sea of quicksilver, lay far beneath the grand expanse of water, a
  boundless sea horizon on the south and south-west glittering in the
  noon-day sun ; and on the west, at 50 or 60 miles distance, blue
  mountains rising from the bosom of the lake to a height of some 7,000
 feet.     I cannot describe the feelings of that moment — here was the
 reward for all our labour — England had won the sources of the Kile.
  1 was 1600 feet above the lake, and I looked down from the steep
 granite cliff upon those welcome waters, upon that vast reservoir which
 nourished Egypt and brought fertility where all was wilderness ; upon
 that great source so long a mystery ; that source of bounty and
 of blessing to millions of human beings. As an imperishable memorial
 of one loved and mourned for by our Queen, and lamented by every
 Englishman, I christened this great lake
                                                   " The Albert N'yanza."
       We commenced the descent         of  the  steep zigzag pass, and after a
 toilsome walk of about two hours, weak with years of fever, but
 strengthened for the moment by success, we gained the level shore
 below the cliff.       I  rushed into the lake, and thirsty with heat and
 fatigue,    with  a  heart                      I
                             full of gratitude, drank deeply of the sources
 of   the  Nile.
       The name of this spot       was Vacovia, in N. lat. 1° 14'.     The level
of   the lake was 2,720 feet above the sea.            The shore was sandy, and
 the waves rolled up upon a clean shingle beach.
                                         I
       After eight days' detention, obtained canoes and commenced a
coasting voyage upon the lake towards the north, to search for the
junction of      the Nile.
       After   a voyage of thirteen days,     I arrived at the Nile junction at
 Magungo, N. lat. 2" 16', the spot that          I  had heard of twelve months
before, when        I had but faint hopes of reaching it.       Throughout the
voyage from Vacovia           the lake was deep and clear, the rocky cliffs in

some parts rising      to about 1,500 feet abruptly from the water.                 A
few poor villages at long intervals were on the east shore, the scanty
population engaged in fishing, and in preparing salt from the soil.
They were extremely inhospitable, refusing in many cases to sell
provisions.
     At the Nile junction the lake had contracted to fifteen or twenty
miles ; the shores were no longer clean, but vast masses of reeds
growing in deep water prevented the canoes from landing.                  Mountains
had ceased on the eastern shore, giving place to hills about 500 feet
high, which, instead of ascending abruptly from the lake like the
mountains farther sonth, were five or six miles distant, descending in
undulations to the water's edge.
     The village of Magungo is about 250 feet above the lake, affording
a fine view of the valley of the Nile, marked by a broad course of
green reeds to the north, as it issues from the lake at a distance of
from sixteen to twenty miles. Exactly below Magungo, the river
that   I had formerly crossed at Karuma, lat. 2° 17', running due west,
entered the Albert Lake in lat. 2° 16', after a westerly course of
about seventy miles.
     Mallegga, on the west coast of the lake, is a large and powerful
country governed by king Kajoro, who possesses boats sufficiently
large to cross to the east shore.            The Mallegga trade largely with
Kamrasi, bringing ivory and finely-prepared skins and mantles in
exchange for salt, brass-coil bracelets, cowrie shells, and beads, all of
which, excepting salt, come from Zanzibar vi& KaragwiS, there being
no communication with the west coast of Africa.
      The Albert Lake forms an immense basin, about 1500 feet below
the adjacent country, receiving the entire drainage of extensive moun
tain ranges on the west, and of the TJtumbi, Uganda, and Unyoro
countries on the east, eventually receiving the great tributary from
the Victoria lake at Magungo, its accumulated waters form the start
 ing point of the main river, the White Nile.*              From the junction at
Magungo      I went up the Somerset river in a canoe, the natives refusing
 to proceed farther north, owing to the hostile tribes of the Koshi and
Madi. About ten miles from the junction, the channel contracted to
about 250 yards in width, with little perceptible stream, very deep,

to the Albert N'yanza being the source or basin of the White Nile.         To any one
who knows the locality so intimately as I do, such a doubt appears simply absurd.
I actually saw, from an elevation of about 250 feet, the river, at a distance of about
eighteen miles, make its exit from the Albert N'yanza to the north in a broad
valley of tall green rush, that rush being the characteristic of the White Nile.
Both Kamrasi and the natives knew the river as well as we know the Thames,
and they told me that it flowed through the Koshi and the Madi country.              I
subsequently met the river in those countries, and followed it down to Khartoum.
Should any doubt still remain in minds obtuse, they will shortly contest that the
Thames at Richmond is the river that flows under London Bridge.

 wooded. About twenty miles from Magungo, my voyage suddenly
 terminated ; for some time     I had heard the roar of broken waters, and
 suddenly   the great  cataract of  the Nile burst into view.     The river,
 contracted from a grand stream of perhaps 200 yards width to a
 channel not exceeding fifty yards, rushes through a gap with amazing
 rapidity, and plunges at one leap into a deep basin below. This mag
 nificent cataract I  took the liberty of naming, after the distinguished
  President of the Royal Geographical Society, the " Murchison Falls."
 From that point    I proceeded overland, parallel with the river, through
 Chopi to Karuma, to the identical spot where      I  had formerly crossed
 the river on first entering Unyoro.
      The exploration being thus successfully terminated, the geography
 of the Nile resolves itself into comparative simplicity.
      We will discard the name of " source," as it would be impossible
 to give preference to any individual stream among the many tributaries
 of  the Nile.
      Speke and Grant discovered the outlet from the Victoria Lake, a
 noble stream, named by Speke the Somerset river ; that river flows
 into the northern end of the Albert Lake, which absorbs it without a
 perceptible current.     The Albert Lake, 1500 feet below the general
 level of the country, has a length of about 260 geographical miles,
 and forms the only general reservoir, every river of that portion of
equatorial Africa falling into that great depression ; thus it receives each
drop of water not only from the Victoria, but from a mountain range
extending from the 2" South lat. to 2° 30' North lat., and becomes the
 great basin of the Nile.    From this great basin the Nile starts, a giant
in its birth, receiving in its northern course only two important
tributaries before it reaches Khartoum, the Asua, in lat. 3° 47' (which
is nearly dry for two months), and the Sobat, in lat. 9° 22', both
streams flowing, like all the great affluents of the Nile, from S.E.
to N.W.
      A rainfall of ten months' draining into the Albert Lake enables
that great reservoir to send down to Egypt throughout the year a
stream of sufficient volume to overcome the evaporation and absorption
of the Nubian deserts.        Without the White Nile not one drop of
water from the Blue Nile would ever reach Egypt in the dry season,
it would all be absorbed by the sand and evaportion, but in the month
of June the Abyssinian rainy season floods the Blue Nile and the
Atbara ; thus the Albert Lake keeps up the volume through the dry
season, when without it Egypt would cease to exist ; and the rush of the
Blue Nile and the Atbara in June, July, and August, added suddenly
to the increased volume from the White Nile at that season, causes the
inundations in Lower Egypt.
      Thus is unravelled the whole secret of the Nile ; the mystery that
had baffled both ancient and modern times has yielded to the influence
of England, and the honour belongs to her of having printed the first
footsteps where all was untrodden, and of having brought to light all
that since the world was created has remained in darkness.

     On the Influence   of Arabic Philosophy in Mediaeval Europe•
FKW things in history are more striking than the encounter in divers
parts of Western Europe, between the rising tide of Mahometan invasion
and the settled races of Christendom. In Sicily, the Saracens achieved
a short-lived conquest, one curious token of which may still be traced
in the modern name given to Etna of Mongibello, a name made up of
the Latin Mons, and the Arabic Ghebel ; both words meaning the
same, and conjoined together by the mingled races of the time.            At
the mouth of the Tiber, the victory of Pope Leo IV. over the Moslem
marching on to Home, even if it failed to be recorded by the Muse of
History, would be rescued from oblivion by the Genius of Art, since,
as you will remember, it forms the subject of one of Raphael's glorious
frescoes in the Vatican.     More to the northward, the Arab conquerors
of Spain advancing into France had passed the Garonne, and well-nigh
reached the Loire, when their progress was arrested and hurled back
by Charles Martel.      Then after centuries came the Crusades ; then
after centuries  more,  the final expulsion of the Moslem from Granada

their last stronghold in western Europe.              All this course of history is
more or less familiar to my present hearers ; but perhaps they may
never have had occasion to observe the remarkable fact, not noticed
indeed in many histories, that the race which showed itself the
inferior in warlike prowess, gained the upper hand in some main
points of intellectual influence.         While the Moslem had for the most
part to yield to the Christians on the fields of battle, they acquired an
ascendant in the schools of philosophy.
     The intellectual or literary influence of the Arabs, a strange portent
surely in an age of utter intolerance, and when it was unusual to allow
merit of any kind in a misbeliever, may be mainly ascribed to two men
of high renown, Avicenna and Averroes.                    Avicenna, whom, if we
strove to be quite exact, we should call Aben Sina, flourished in
Central Asia, and died in the year of Christ 1037. Averroes, or more
precisely Abcn Roshd, was born at Cordova, and died according to the
best authorities in the year of our Lord 1198.               Both are combined by
Dante in two lines of his ' Inferno,' where he enumerates the principal
pagan worthies.     I  will give you Dante's lines, as Mr. Cary renders
them   :
                                  ••
                                    Orphans    I marked
                                  Avicen, and him who made
                       That   commentary     vast, Avcrroes." •
     In like manner    are they combined by Chaucer in his ' Prologue to
 the Canterbury Tales.'        Much may be ascribed to the genius of these
 two men.     Yet in the middle ages, when books were few and critics
 fewer still, we may suspect that the two names were sometimes used in
 a collective or representative sense.           We may think, perhaps, that all
 the lore of Central Asia, was taken as summed up in Avicenna, as
 in Averroes all the lore of Mahometan Spain.
     The works of Avicenna, as is believed, were brought to Europe at
 the time of the Crusades, in the form of a Latin translation, with
 which alone    I have now to deal.           This Latin version was put into
 type very soon after the discovery of printing, and there were several
 editions in the course of the sixteenth century, above all at Padua and
 Venice.     Most of his treatises relate to his profession of medicine ;
 but there are some of a more general nature, and bearing on the general
 questions of philosophy.
     The principal work of Avicenna is a so-called ' Canon,' in five
 books, on the ' Art of Healing.'         During several centuries, this canon
 may be said to have reigned supreme in the Christian schools of
 medicine.     M. Jourdain, writing in the ' Biographic Universellc,'
 about the year 1811, observes, that scarce a century back — in the last
 years, therefore, of Louis XIV. — the Canon of Avicenna was still the
 text-book in both the Universities of Montpellier and Louvain.                  At
 present  it might be   difficult  to  name     any   book   which is more entirely
                      »  " AverriK's t-hc  1 gron coinento fco."

 unread, or has fallen into more complete neglect.       One of the last
 writers who seems to have paid it attention is Dr. Freind, the famous
 physician in the time of George I., and he speaks of it in by no means
 favourable terms. " In general," says Dr. Freind, " Avicenna seems
 to be fond of multiplying the signs of distemper without any reason ;
 he often, indeed, sets down some for essential symptoms, which arise
merely by accident, and have no immediate connection with the primary
 disease."
     Of the numerous remedies which the works of Avicenna recom
mend, many seem in a high degree fanciful ; yet some, perhaps, though
we are unconscious that they rest on his authority, have survived to the
present time. Thus, when corals are still placed in the mouths of
infant children, in preference to ivory or any other hard sub
stance, we may probably derive that practice from the words of
Avicenna, where he declares that there is an occult or mysterious
virtue in coral, which makes it the highest of all remedies for the
comfort of the gums.       As is said in the quaint and semi-barbarous
Latin of his translated work, Summus est corattus in conforlatione
ginyivct.• In other passages, we find him share the common belief
of his age as to the planetary influences. " If," he says, " these stars,
which are called unpropitious, are in the ascendant, they bode decay
to animated beings ; but if those which are called propitious, then the
signification is health." f In like manner, he considers the efficacy of
remedies as dependent on the wane or the increase of the moon.
     Another authority on the healing art held in high estimation all
through the Middle Ages was the school of medicine at Salerno.
That school was, as Gibbon expresses        " the legitimate offspring of
                                                          it,
the Saracens."    It was trained by Arabic professors        was taught       ;   it
from Arabic books.      Towards the year of Christ 1100, a curious little
volume was compiled by John of Milan, one of the physicians of this
school, and was dedicated to the King of England, but to which is not
quite clear:
                 Anglorum Regi scribit Schola tota Salerni.
     This volume embodies some of the most approved maxims for
 health, in Latin verses of the kind called Leonine, that is, in rhyme
according to the favourite fashion of the Middle Ages. Thus put into
a  popular form, these maxims appear to have enjoyed        high popu             a
larity until a recent period.    They were annotated with great care
by Arnald do Villanova; and to the edition of 1649          prefixed an           is
elaborate preface by Zacharias Sylvius,      physician of Rotterdam.

imagine,* no doubt at all can exist that all through the Middle Ages
the Arabic School of Medicine was greatly superior to tho Latin.
     Reverting to Avicenna, not in his character of physician but of a
philosopher, we shall find that he is disposed to distinguish between a
higher and a lower spirit or intelligence in man ; that is, as     appre              I
hend      between the life and the soul.
        it,                                He considers the vital spirit
not so much as one, but rather, as the aggregate of the different vital
powers, taking, after Galen, the brain as the seat of thought, the heart
as the seat of courage and other emotions, and the liver as the seat of
the animal exertions or powers.        In general, Avicenna seems only
too ready to assign causes, sometimes with little discretion, for the
various phenomena of created beings.      But in some passages he shows
a deeper humility and      truer wisdom. " This," he says of one mys
                                a
terious process, "      among the secrets known to God alone. All
                           is
glory then be to God, who is the King of all, the source of truth and
praise, the aim of our benedictions, and the first of all things that
have being."*     Surely such words as these ought to have exempted
Avicenna from tho vaguo charges of impiety and atheism, which some
writers of tho Middle Ages, as William of Auvergno, aro, see, quoted,          I
as having with much presumption brought against him.
    The views of Avicenna on our spiritual nature are, however, best
deduced from an Essay, to which, even in the Latin version, there                                is
given the title of Almahad.\        Almahad, then,      the condition or
                                                                      is
the place to which the soul of man will take its flight after his
decease.     The supreme happiness to which the soul aspires has
hero, he says, for obstacle, the body.       Therefore, in another life,
its felicity will be in its separation and enfranchisement from its
earthly trammels.     Its reward would lie in the nearer contemplation
of the Almighty and of those sublime essences which adore him.
On the other hand, its punishment would lie in its exile and its dis
tance from them.       Some souls, however, which though perfect in
speculation were not perfect in deeds, will be consigned to an
intermediate sphere — tho Berzach or purgatory —           mean between    a
felicity and suffering.    Thus    will be seen that the religious aspira
                                     it
tions of Avicenna, although      Mahometan in creed, have none of that
                                    a
material grossness    which      commonly ascribed to the paradise of
                                    is
Mahomet.      On the contrary, adopting as they do tho doctrino of                                a
purgatory, they appear in close accordance with tho teaching of
Catholic theologians in that age.

  5/., which, according to the Dean's calculation, is equivalent to about
   IC0/, of our present money.            A strong proof of the estimation in
  which Avicenna was held at that period, even among the prelates of
  another creed.
         I  come now to Averroes, whose writings are far more voluminous
 than those of Avicenna, and had also an influence far more extensive
 and deep-rooted.          Like those of his predecessor, they were known to
 Christian Europe only through the medium of a Latin translation.
 Of late years, however, the original sources also appear to have been
 carefully explored. Special notice is due to the learned and able work
 of M. Ernest Renan, which in its revised and completed form appeared
 in 1861                        It gives both the life and the doctrines of
 Averroes far more fully than within the limits of this lecture            I could
 hope or attempt to do.
         In philosophy, Averroes professed himself a follower of Aristotle,
 whose works, having them before him in an Arabic version of older
 date, ho made the subject of a long and laborious commentary.
 .    .    .   The " doctrine of Aristotle," he says, " is the Sovereign Truth.
 The researches of Aristotle mark the limits of the human understand
 ing, and there can be no dissent from anything that he has stated.
 The only doubt would be as to the right interpretation of his words,
 or as to the logical consequences to be deduced from them."*
        But in noting this homage to the Stagyrite, we should bear in mind
 that the other wise men of the East in the Middle Ages were nearly
 agreed on this point with Averroes.              All of them were disposed to
acknowledge         Aristotle  as their chief   and  master.     How wonderful,   I
 may say in passing, is this proof of the supremacy of the old Greek
race as shown in the instance of two men who stood to each other in
the relation of pupil and preceptor.            The pupil, Alexander the Great,
by dint of military genius, subjugates Asia ! The preceptor, Aristotle,
after the lapse of centuries, and solely by the force of intellect, holds
Asia in thrall again !
        In considering, however, the relation of the Arabic philosophers to
those of Ancient Greece, there are at the outset two remarks that
present themselves.           It is certain that in some places Averroes
ascribes to Aristotle doctrines which Aristotle never held. Divers
critics — as Bayle, in his Dictionary, draws them out in array — sup
pose that these errors of Averroes may have arisen from the faulty
Arabic version that lay before him. But as it seems to me there is
another conjecture at least equally probable- Some of the speculations
of Averroes, as will presently be seen, were extremely bold. They
greatly displeased the leading Muftis.            They exposed him to no small
amount of obloquy and persecution in his latter years. What more
                          * See these passages in Ectian.

natural, then, than that Averroes and his followers should endeavour
to anticipate attacks like these, and bring forward their tenets with
the great name of Aristotle as their shield
     Avicenna and Averroes were,     I  think, exactly on a level in their
study of Greek.     Both could read it only by means of an Arabic
translation ; both applied themselves mainly to the same two authors,
Aristotle and Galen. But there was this difference between them.
Avicenna desired to hold the balance even between his two Greeks.
Averroes on the other hand, in his almost idolatry for Aristotle,
laboured hard whenever Aristotle and Galen may differ to reconcile
their views ; but if reconcilement seemed to be impossible, he then
invariably sided with the Stagyrite.      .  .  .
     The instance of Averroes is another proof that a prophet hath no
honour in his own country.      His doctrine was of little or no mark
among    the  Moslem   communities.     During his lifetime, indeed, as wo
have seen, it excited sufficient notice to draw upon him a considerable
degree of religious persecution.     But after his decease it was speedily
forgotten.    Thus, in his own Mahometan sphere, he left no followers,
and he founded no school.      It is shown by M. Itenan, who gives the
particular examples, that this author of eleven folio volumes as since
published in a Latin version, is not once mentioned even by name in
several lists of Mahometan philosophers and other worthies, which
were drawn up in the ensuing centuries at Cairo and other main seats
of Oriental learning.
     The renown of Averroes is therefore entirely dependent on tho
great and extraordinary favour which his tenets found among tlio
learned men, both Jews and Christians, in Western Europe.             And
first as to the Jews. When wo consider how that people was per
secuted and down-trodden all through the Middle Ages ; how, without
any fixed country of their own, they were driven to and fro from place
to place to escape the bigot and the spoiler, we must be struck at the
indomitable spirit which enabled their chief men, even amidst these
heavy trials, still to apply themselves to the pursuit of knowledge.
A list is given of eminent Jewish scholars from Maimonidus down
wards, who, in their study of philosophy, have eagerly applied themselves
to Averroes, translating     his principal treatises from Arabic into
Hebrew, and adopting as their own many of his tenets.             Of these
Jewish works upon points of philosophy, apart from the teaching of
Averroes, the latest in point of time, and also,   I should apprehend, by
far the highest in point of ability, is that most ingenious dialogue in
                                      '
the Platonic manner, the ' Phaedo of Moses Mendelsohn
     Next, as to the Christian writers.        The earliest of these who
appears to have translated Averroes, or brought him into note in
Western      Europe, was our own countryman, the reputed wizard,
Michael Scott. He is mentioned by Roger Bacon as having first
brought forward certain books of Aristotle, with certain learned com
mentaries ; and we collect from other sources, that theso commentaries
were no other than those of Averroos.           Throngh him, adds Roger

512                The  Earl  Stankope on the Influence           [Feb. 2,
 Bacon, the philosophy of Aristotle was glorified in tho Latin sphere.
 Magnificata est Arislotelis philosophia api(d Latinos.     This, he says,
was in the year of Christ 1230, that is little more than thirty years
from the death of Averroes.
     Seen by the light of modern science, some of the deductions of
Michael Scott from his Arabic source, are not a little fantastic.    They
seem the stranger when, as in some cases, invested with the forms of
the Aristotelian logic — forms which at one time were considered as
affording one main security for the demonstration of truth.      Here is a
fragment, the Latin original of which is still preserved at Paris, in
the Library of the Sorbonne : — " The firmament of heaven is round,
and all that is round is perfect, therefore the firmament of heaven
is perfect.     But everything that is perfect is free from motion,
because it can want or seek no good gift which it has not already, and
the firmament of heaven is perfect ; therefore, the firmament of
heaven also is free from motion."        Accordingly, as Michael Scott
goes on to say, any danger to the great celestial system would lie in
the possible motion of its parts ; and this, he adds, is what Averroes
teaches.
    Hermannus Alemannus, or the German, is mentioned as the next
in order of   the translators of Averroes into Latin.    Ho also studied
at Toledo, and availed himself of Jews as his Arabic interpreters, in
the version which he made. The doctrine of Averroes being thus made
known to the learned men of France and Italy, it speedily raised up
powerful defenders, and no less powerful opponents. Chief of the
latter, as taking their stand on the theological fastness, were, in the
next age, Albert, surnamed the Great, and Thomas Aquinas.
     But you will naturally ask, What then was that doctrine on the one
hand so extensively adopted ; on the other hand so keenly assailed ?     I
here come, then, to that one distinctive          tenet which has been
the main source of Averroes's fame.          He maintained as the true
Aristotelian doctrine that there is an Anima Mundi — a soul of tho
 world. He held that there exists one common intelligence which is
immaterial and immortal, and which still preserves its numerical unity,
though disseminated among the many millions of mankind.          It might
thus be put, perhaps, that a spark of the intellectual flame flies forth
to join each human being at its birth, and that at the decease of that
human being it flies back, to be again absorbed in the central intelli
gence.   I must observe, however, that it is by no means easy to describe,
with even approximate precision, a doctrine, which was much clouded
over by the animosity of its opponents, and still more frequently
obscured by the fears of its defenders. Several of its points were not
I think expressed in plain terms, and were rather left to be inferred.
One of the necessary deductions arising from it is stated as follows,
by Mr. Hallam, in the first volume of his ' Literary History' :— " If the
human soul, as an universal,
                                  possess an objective reality, it must

1866.]         of Arabic Philosophy in Mediaval Europe.                    513
 surcly bo intelligent ; and being such, it may seem no extravagant
 hypothesis, though one incapable of that demonstration we now require
 in philosophy, to suppose that it acts upon the subordinate intelligences
of the same species, and receives impressions from them."
      Even from so slight a sketch of this doctrine, we may readily see
 how it could happen that a long and stubborn controversy arose
 whether or not it admitted the immortality of the soul.          The disciples
 of Avcrrocs maintained that it did ; his opponents urged that it did
not.    And certainly there is something to be alleged on both sides.
If  the soul, on quitting its tenement of clay, becomes absorbed into a
 superior but still kindred intelligence, it cannot be said to perish ; but
 on the other hand, if it is to preserve no self-consciousness nor personal
identity, then to say the least, there is a wide departure from the idea
 of an immortal soul as commonly understood or received.
     It is not to be supposed that this doctrine of Averroes was under
stood in the same manner by all his disciples.          On the contrary, there
were numerous subtleties and subdivisions, according as learned men,
who were attracted towards        it,
                                    laboured from time to time, and with
more or less success, to bring      it  into harmony with the tenets of
revealed religion.     Thus  it  might be supposed that the spark of tho
Aninui MuntK, which, according to Averroes,         is   sent to animate each
human being, need not at the death of that human being immediately
and of course rejoin the central essence, but may bo destined, in
punishment or in reward, first to pass through either higher or lower
phases of existence.     Such a  view of the case would, therefore, not be
irreconcilable with the doctrine of future retribution for the good or
evil deeds of the present life, though evidently falling short of the
orthodox dogma which teaches an eternity of acceptance or of con
demnation.
     It was not merely on the soul of man that Averroes formed his
speculations.  I   have already found occasion to give you some of his
views on the celestial bodies, as deduced by Michael Scott. In his
own writings these views are still more clearly expounded.                  He
looked upon the heavens as forming together          a     series of animated
beings, whose various orbs represent the members essential to life, and
whose main mover     is to them what in the human frame the heart        is  to
the limbs.    Each of these orbs, according to Averroes, has self-con
sciousness, and knows also what          is passing in the orbs inferior to
itself.   The highest sphere of all, has therefore       a  full knowledge of
whatever  is  passing in the universe. You will see at once how closely
this system connects itself with the idea of central intelligence.
                                                a
     And yet, notwithstanding dreams like these, in which many men of
genius besides Averroes have at times indulged,      it    may
                                                             I    think bo said
with truth that this Arabian, far from being behind his contemporaries
on this subject of astronomy, was greatly in advance of them.            All at
that time clung with undoubting faith to the astronomical system of
Ptolemy.
                       " Cycle and epicycle, orb on orb."

514               The   Earl   Slankopc on the Influence            [Fob. 2,
     Tho system of Ptolemy is well known. He explained the divers
 movements of the stars by the supposition of crystalline spheres
without any stint of numbers, so that, as Fontenelle long afterwards
 observed,   crystalline spheres cost him nothing, and he designed a
 now ono at each fresh occasion that arose.        On this point Averroes,
 greatly to his honour, forsook his Grecian guide. There is a remark
 able passage upon it in the twelfth book, chapter 4 (not the thirteenth
 book, chapter 8, according to the erroneous reference of M. Eenan),
 of his ' Commentary on Aristotle's Metaphysics.'       He gives arguments
 against Ptolemy's whole system of epicycles and eccentrics, which he
 declares to be impossible. " Nature," he adds, " does nothing in vain,
 and it is unworthy a philosopher to suppose that she employs two
instruments when a single one would effect the object in view.          It is
 therefore needful that there should be a renewed investigation of that
 genuine astronomy, which rests on natural foundations. In my youth,
I  hoped that such an investigation might be made by myself.           Now,
 in my old age, I despair of it. But still my observations may stir up
 some other man to pursue these inquiries in my place."
     This wish, as you well know, was fully accomplished, but not until
 centuries after Averroes had ceased to be.
     The doctrines of Averroes then, taken as a further development of
 the doctrines of Aristotle, provoked much keen discussion in the
 Middle Ages ; but that discussion was by no means always uniform ;
 on the contrary, very different phases of it may be traced as it pro
 ceeded.    Under the Emperors of the House of Suabia, engaged as they
 were in ceaseless conflict with the ecclesiastical powers, a sceptical
 spirit was afloat.    Indeed, it has been observed, that in this respect,
 Italy during the thirteenth century bore a striking resemblance to
 France during the eighteenth.         With the sceptics then of the thir
 teenth century, the disciples of Averroes came to be allied.
     But another phase of opinion was near at hand. Not only the race
of the Suabian princes but their traditions having passed away, the scep
tical spirit which had been cherished at their Court subsided as rapidly
as it rose.   The followers of Averrocs were no longer regarded as of
course enemies of the Church.        No stronger proof of this can be given
than that for a long period they held supremacy in the Catholic Uni
versity of Padua.       The faith in Averroes came to mean faith in his
Commentary ; that     is,  to regard him as the best and most trustworthy
of all expounders of Aristotle.      In like manner, the Avcrroist tenet of
a  common intelligence was frittered down until     it  came to little more
than the identity of spiritual principles and powers in the divers souls
of men ;   a dogma to which, as thus modified, no reasonable objection
could be made.       Still, however, we are to understand that the doc
trines of Averroes, in their primitive sense, continued to be held and
even taught in private by no small number of persons.
     In tho mitigated form which Averroism had now assumed, or at
least professed, it    might still have continued during many years to
bear sway in Northern Italy.        But at the commencement      of the six

1866.]                 of Arabic Philosophy in Mediaval Europe.                     515
tccuth contnry, there came that great stir and upheaving of the human
intellect which produced Luther, and in its results tore Christendom
asunder. It was at work even earlier in Italy than in central Europe,
but embraced other topics besides those of the Rcformation, since
even so fundamental a doctrine as the immortality of the soul was in
some quarters frequently denied.       Then, as had already happened in
the thirteenth century, the sceptics, if they were not joined by the
Averroists, endeavoured at least to shelter themselves under their
name and authority. Then, as was natural and reasonable, the theolo
gians took alarm. A council was held at the Lateran, and in Decem
ber, 1512, there was issued a Pontifical Bull, joining in one common
condemnation the men who denied the immortality of the soul, and
the men who maintained the Aniina Mundi.             And in this manner
came forth at last an authoritative decision of the Roman Catholic
Church against, in one form or another, the favourite and distinctive
tenet of Averroes.
     In my view of the case, however, the decline of Averroism may be
traced to a different cause, and to a somewhat earlier period.           Its
decline, as        I
               conceive, dates from the 4th of April, 1497, on which day
a learned man, whose name is given, rose in his professorial chair at
Padua, to lecture upon Aristotle, then first from the original Greek.*
Then fell Averroes, never more to rise. For let it be remembered what
was in truth the Commentary of Averroes.     It was derived by him from
a faulty Arabic version, and it was transmitted by his disciples to the
Western races in a faulty Latin version.      How could a Commentary
thus exposed to a twofold cycle of errors in translation^ontinuo          to
hold its ground against other commentaries founded in the living, the
authoritative, Greek ?
     It is worthy of note, however, that from the time of the Lateran
Council, the Church authorities looked with a suspicious eye, not
merely as was natural on the Commentary of Averroes, but even in some
degree on the original works of Aristotle.      .  .
      To conclude ; there is only one other observation which             I
                                                                    have to
make.        I
             should wish you to notice that the subject which          have     I
chosen does not imply any knowledge of the original Arabic sources.
If            I
    it did could not have undertaken it without the most extreme pre
sumption.     But in truth the subject which           I
                                                   announced, and which
accordingly      have  I
                       now  discussed, is solely  the  " influence " of the
Arabic philosophy — its influence in Mediaeval Europe. Now, as have             I
already had occasion to apprise you, that influence was exerted in every
case, and quite exclusively, by means of Latin translations.          It             is,
therefore, only with these translations or with the testimonies to them,

             On the Deviation         of the  Compass in Iron fillips.
 THE deviation of       the compass is a subject of great and increasing im
 portance, owing      to   the great and increasing amount of iron used in the
 construction of vessels, and the consequent increase in the amount of
 the deviation and in the apparent irregularity of its laws.
      On the present occasion it will be necessary for me to omit alto
 gether some of the most important and most interesting parts of the
 subject — viz. 1st, the mathematical part, including algebraical formula!,
 arithmetical processes, and graphic constructions of great interest and
 utility ; and, 2ndly, the numerical results for different ships and classes
 of ships which have been obtained from the reduction and discussion of
 observations made in a large number of ships of the Royal Navy.                   I
 must confine myself to an attempt to explain the principles on which
  the forces which cause the deviation act, and the principles on which
  the deviations produced can be reduced to law. and to stating generally
  what has been accomplished and what remains to be accomplished.
                                General Considerations.
       1. A magnet       is a bar of steel, the ends of which have opposite pro
  perties. They       are   generally marked N. and S. (north and south), but
  to avoid   the  confusion     which would be occasioned by speaking of the
  magnetism     of  the   north  end of the needle or of the north end of the
  earth   as south    magnetism, it is convenient to distinguish them as red
  and blue (which may be remembered from R occurring in Nouth and U
  occurring in South).
       The property is that the red end of one magnet attracts the blue
  end and repels the red end of another magnet, and vice versd.
       If  we lay two magnets at a little distance in the same line with
  unlike poles turned to each other, and lay a soft iron rod in the interval
  between them, the soft iron rod will be magnetized by induction : the
  end next the blue pole of one magnet will become red, the end next
  the red end of the other magnet will become blue.             If we turn the rod
  about its centre, it will gradually lose its magnetism, till, when at right

1866.]                 of the Compass in Iron Ships.                     519
angles to the line of magnetization, it will be neutral, and if we turn it
further, it will become magnetized in the opposite way.
     The earth is a magnet, having a blue pole in latitude 70° N., long.
96° W., and a red pole in lat. 75° S., and long. 154° E.
     The direction of the magnetic force in London at present is the
same as if there were a blue pole '20y to the west of north, and 68°
below the horizon, and a red pole 204° to the east of south, and 68°
above the horizon.       This direction is called the line of force, or the
line of " dip."    If we hold a soft iron rod in the line of dip, it becomes
instantly magnetised, the north or lower end becoming red, the south
or upper end becoming blue.        If we hold the rod vertically, the lower
end will still be red, but of less intensity, the upper end blue, also of
less intensity.    If we hold the rod horizontally north and south, the
north end will be red, but of still lower intensity, the south end blue,
also of lower intensity.     If we now turn the rod in the same horizontal
plane, its magnetism will diminish till it becomes east and west, when
it will be neutral, and if we turn it still further the magnetism will be
reversed ; the amount of the changes will be greatly increased by ham
mering the rod in each position. In a rod which I used, the effect was
increased by hammering from 12 to 80, or between six and sevenfold.
If   the iron had been perfectly soft, it results from the experiments of
Weber and Thalen that the effect would have been about 36.
     A sphere of soft iron will be magnetized in the same way however
held. The diameter in the line of dip will be the axis of magnetism,
and the lower and north half of the surface will be red, the upper and
south half blue.
      In bodies of any other shape the effects will be similar, though less
regular, if the shape be irregular.
      In an iron ship, on the stocks, intense magnetism is developed by
the process of hammering; red magnetism being developed in the part
of the ship which is below and towards the north, and blue magnetism
in the part which is above and towards the north.
     As the usual position of the compass is near the stern, it follows
that in the case of ships built head north, the compass is in a position
where there is an intense blue magnetism drawing the north end of the
compass strongly to the stern and downwards, and generally producing
a very large deviation, besides a large heeling error.        In such ships
it is of importance to have a standard compass well forward.
      In ships built head south, there will generally be less deviation
and little heeling error in the usual position of the compass.
      In ships built east and west the amount of deviation is generally
small, but is less regular than in ships built head south.
                Theoretical Representation   of the Deviation.
      If we place a magnet before the compass with its blue end turned
 lo the compass, it will draw the north end of the needle to the ship's
head, and as the ship turns round there will be, in the first or eastern
semicircle, a deviation of the north point of the compass to the right
hand or east, in the second or western semicircle, a deviation to the

520                  Mr. A. Smith          on the Deviation          [Feb. 9.
left hand or west.      This would produce one part of what is called the
 " semicircular" deviation.
      If we place a soft iron rod vertically in front of the compass, with
 its upper end at the level of the compass, this end, which will be blue,
 will attract the north end of the needle, and produce a deviation of
 exactly the same kind as the magnet which we have considered.              It
 will, therefore,  simply increase the semicircular    deviation   caused  by
 the first magnet.   If    the red end of the imaginary magnet, or the
 lower end of the imaginary rod, be nearest the compass, or if the
 magnet or rod be abaft the compass, an effect of the same kind, but
 in an opposite direction, will be produced.
     A magnet to starboard or port of the compass will produce a
similar effect, except that a deviation of one kind will be produced
when the ship's head is on the north semicircle, and of the other kind
when on the south semicircle.        This is the other part of the " semi
          "
circular    deviation.
     The effect of the two magnets and the one iron rod, which we have con
sidered, make up the whole of what is called the "semicircular" deviation.
      Ifwe lay a horizontal soft iron rod in front of and directed to the
compass, it will easily be seen that when the ship's head is N., S., E. or W.
it produces no deviation. When N.E. and S.W. it produces a deviation to
the right hand or E., and when S.E. or N.W. a deviation to the left hand
or W., it therefore produces what is called the " quadrantal " deviation.
     A horizontal soft iron rod directed to the compass, but placed
to the starboard or port, will produce an effect of exactly the opposite
kind, and would correct that produced by the first rod ; but if the
second rod, instead of being on one side, passes, as it were, through the
compass, it will produce exactly the same effect as the first rod.        The
two rods will then conspire to produce the quadrantal deviation.
     A quadrantal deviation of the same kind will be produced if the
first rod instead of being on one side of the compass passes through       it,
provided always that its force   is less than that of the transverse rod.
     In almost all known ships the quadrantal deviation       what would be
                                                              is
produced by two such rods, i.e. rods of one or other of the following
types—
               -e-
    Between the two types there     an important difference, which will
                                      is
be easily traced out.   The second type would always diminish the
directive force of the needle, while the first type would increase or

 1866.]                 of the Compass in Iron Shipt.                   521
diminish it according as the force of the fore and aft rods is greater or
less than that of the transverse rod.
      The effect of the magnetism when a ship heels over may be seen by
the diagrams which follow.
      It will easily be seen that as the ship heels over, the upper end of
 the transverse     rod becomes blue and attracts the north end of the
 needle to windward, and also that the upper end of the vertical rod
which is below in the first figure, by the effect of heeling, is moved to
 windward, and draws the north end of the needle to windward, and
 increases the heeling error caused by the transverse beam, while in the
 second figure it is moved to leeward and counteracts the heeling error
 caused by the transverse iron.
      Compasses on the upper decks of iron ships, particularly if they
 have been built head north, are of the first type, and there is generally
 a large heeling error to windward.      Compasses on the main deck, and
 particularly of iron-plated ships, are generally of the second type, and
 the heeling error is often to leeward.
      The amount of error in each case may be easily determined by
 observations of vertical force, and by separating the two parts of the
 quadrantal deviation, without actually heeling the ship.
      The magnets and soft iron rods we have imagined must not be con
 sidered as mere possible cases, but as representing truly the actual case
 in all ships. They are in fact the physical interpretation of Poisson's
 general formulae for the action of induced magnetism, which interpreted
 amount to this, that the effect of the iron of any body, however irregular,
 on a magnetic particle, is exactly the same as that of nine soft iron rods
 and three magnets.       When the iron is symmetrically distributed, as in
 a ship, the rods are reduced five in number, viz. the four we have con
 sidered, and a fifth lying fore and aft, with one end below the compass,
 which would make the heeling error greater or less with the ship's head
 north than it is with the ship's head south, but this is not an effect of
  much importance.
                          Effect in particular Ships.
      In wooden ships the semicircular deviation is represented by the
  effect of a single vertical rod of soft iron in front of the compass, and
  the quadrantal deviation is very small.

622                     Mr. A. Smith     on the Deviation             [Feb. 9,
     In iron ships the semicircular deviation is generally represented by
the effect of a  magnet at the part of the ship which was south in building,
with its blue end turned to the compass.
     Armour-plated ships are generally plated after launching ; the
semicircular magnetism is greatly affected by the position in which they
are plated.     If  they are plated in the direction opposite to that in which
they were built, the deviation is generally diminished ; when they are
plated in the same position in which they are built, the semicircular
deviation is generally increased.
                       Change    of Deviation from Time.
     What we have called the permanent magnetism is in truth only sub-
permanent, and changes much, particularly if the ship is exposed to
blows or strains, so that the semicircular deviation generally alters very
much in the first year after building.         The alteration is generally a
diminution, although it might be an increase if the compass had by
accident or choice been placed in a position where the semicircular
deviation from induced magnetism exactly counteracted that from the
permanent magnetism.
     In consequence of this change the Government has, on the recom
mendation of the Superintendent of the Compass Department, laid
down a rule that no iron ship shall be taken up as a transport till it has
made one long voyage.
     There is a very remarkable change in the capacity of the soft iron
for receiving magnetism by induction, which seems to indicate some
molecular change in the iron, viz. that it becomes less susceptible of
induction by the lapse of time. The effect of this on the strength of
the iron is one of the most important points to which attention is now
directed.
                 Change   cf Deviation from    Change  of Place.
     When a ship sailing south reaches the magnetic equator, the earth's
magnetism acts horizontally.         The vertical soft iron rod which   I have
imagined    will  then  have  no  magnetism,  and  the semicircular  deviation
arising therefrom will disappear. When she goes into south magnetic
latitudes, the upper end will now become red, and will repel the north
end of the needle, and change the direction of the semicircular magnetism
caused by the rod.
     There will be no corresponding change in the semicircular
magnetism caused by the permanent magnetism, except that near the
magnetic equator, the directive force of the earth's magnetism being
greater than in England, the amount of deviation which the same
disturbing force produces will be proportionately diminished.
     Careful observations on the changes which take place in the devia
tion of iron ships in different latitudes are much wanted. They are
being made in some of Her Majesty's ships now in the south, but there
are no means     of procuring   such observations from merchant ships.

1866.]             of the Compass in Iron Ships.                     523
    No change is produced in the quadrantal deviation      by a change   of
the ship's geographical position.
              Effects   of Special Arrangements of Iron.
    The upper or lower ends of all vertical masses of iron produce
powerful effects on the needle.
    The stern post, iron stanchions, funnels, gun turrets, generally pro
duce large deviations, but if the place of the compass is judiciously
selected, they or some of them may be used as correctors.
     Horizontal masses of iron, such as deck-beams, produce a great
effect, generally increasing the quadrantal deviation and diminishing
the directive force.   Both causes of error may be reduced by having
as little iron as possible immediately below the compass, or within a
cone traced out by a line passing through the compass, and making an
angle of 54° 45' with the vertical.
                         History of   the Science.
    What has been said will make a short account of the history of the
science intelligible.   Captain Flinders, in his voyage to Australia in
the beginning of the century, was struck by the fact of the north
end of the compass being drawn to the ship's head in northern, and to
the stern in southern latitudes.   He, with great sagacity, compared it
to the effect produced by a vertical rod of soft iron, and corrected it
by introducing such a rod abaft the compass.
     Afterwards, attention was drawn to the same subject in the voyage
of Eoss and Parry to Baffin's Bay, to which expeditions General, then
Captain, Sabine was attached as astronomer. The very large devia
tions which were found in high latitudes attracted attention, and were
carefully observed and discussed.
     The observations made in these voyages attracted the attention of
Poisson, the great French mathematician, who in his memoirs on mag
netism, published in the year 1824, first gave the general formulae for
the effect of iron, which we have already adverted to, and applied them
to the observations made in these voyages with much success.
     About the year 1840 the British Admiralty, on the report of a
committee of scientific officers, comprising General Sabine, Sir J. Koss,
and the late Captain Johnson, adopted the system ever since followed
in the royal navy, of having a standard compass distinct from the
steering compass, placed in a position selected, not with reference to
the convenience of the steersman, but for the small and uniform amount
of magnetic force at and around         and of having the deviations of
                                      it,
that compass carefully observed by the process of " swinging
                                                              " the

and the deviations of every ship recorded. They also appointed an
officer, whose sole or principal duty was the superintendence of the
compasses.    This office, which has been filled first
                                                     byCaptain Johnson

524                    Mr. A. Smith     on the Deviation              [Feb.   9,
and since his death by Captain Evans, has done more for the advance
ment of the science than anything else.
    No ships in the royal navy have ever been lost from the errors of
the compass ; and the magnetic history of every ship is so well known,
that, in case of the loss of a ship, there would be no difficulty in
arriving at a confident opinion as to the effect of the compass error in
causing it.
    At the same time the attention of Mr. Airy, the astronomer royal,
was directed to the particular question of the deviation of the compass
in iron ships.   Mr. Airy proposed a mode of correcting the semi
circular deviation by the application of magnets, and of correcting the
quadrantal deviation by the application of soft iron cylinders analogous
to the soft iron rods we have supposed, which has been subsequently
extensively adopted in the mercantile marine.
    In the year 1856 the Liverpool Compass Committee commenced
those labours which, principally carried on by their able secretary,
Mr. Rundell, have produced three valuable reports, which have con
tributed greatly to the advancement of this science.      These labours
are, however, now discontinued.
                         Practice in   the   Royal Navy.
    In the royal navy, as we have said, each ship has a standard com
pass in a selected position.      A ship is swung or turned round and the
deviation observed in a certain number of positions, either by com
parison with a compass on shore, or by a comparison with a celestial
body, or by observing a distant object.                A
                                                    table of errors is thus
observed and recorded — they are reduced by obtaining from them the
co-efficients of the semicircular and quadrantal deviation. Observations
of horizontal force and of vertical force are also made, from which the
amount of heeling error is obtained — and if the amount is large, the
heeling error is corrected by the application of a vertical magnet.
    The whole process is described, and all the mathematical formula
and arithmetical processes, and a number of convenient graphic
                                '
methods, are given in the         Admiralty Manual for ascertaining and
applying    the Deviations  of the  Compass caused by the Iron of a Ship.'
(London     :   Potter, 1863.)
                      Practice in   the Mercantile     Marine.
      In                marine there is no regular superintendence of
           the mercantile
the adjustment of the compass ; it  is left to the professional compass
adjusters.  In many cases there is  no separate standard compass, but
the steering compass is used for   the navigation of the ship, and is
often placed so near the stern postand steering gear that it has origin
ally very large and very irregular deviations. These are corrected by
powerful magnets.    The consequence         that the slightest change in
                                                 is,
the magnetism of the ship produces        large error, which
                                             a                   the more

dangerous that the captain believes his compass to be free from error.

    This great disadvantage,              from the indiscriminate use of the method
of correction by magnets,           is,   however, an abuse of the method, and not
necessarily   attendant on it.

                              a
position of the ship in building and plating.    The position of the
standard compass should be shown in the drawings of every ship,
which, before being finally settled, should be submitted for the ob
servations and suggestions   of the Superintendent of the Compass
Department.
    Ships should be built as much as possible head south, and should
be plated in the opposite direction to that of building.
    Careful recommendation as to the special points to be attended to
have been submitted to the Admiralty        the present superintendent of

the Compass Department, and we may hope that much benefit will be
derived from them.
    A proof of what may be effected in this way has already been given
in the case of several of the ships of the Imperial Russian Navy, in
which the arrangements made under the superintendence of Captain
Belavenetz have greatly reduced the amount of deviation.

opportunity of receiving, recording, reducing, and discussing the observ
ations made.
    Till some change    takes place in this respect,   not probable that
                                                              it   is
much improvement will be introduced, or that merchant ships will
make their due contributions to the advancement of science.
    What seems desirable       —    is,
    1.  That in all iron steam passenger ships there should be standard a
compass distinct from the steering compass, placed in    position selected
                                                                    a
for the small and uniform amount of the deviation at and around it.
    2. That the deviations by the standard compass should be ascer
tained and returned to      department of the Government.
                              a
    3. That these deviations should be carefully recorded, reduced, and
discussed by   acompetent superintendent.
    Many indirect advantages might be expected to flow from following,
in these respects, the example of the Royal Navy.
                              Foreign Countries.
    The 'Admiralty         Manual' has been translated

particular, the great zeal of Captain Belavenetz, and above all, the
appointment of a person of his energy and ability, charged exclusively
with the superintendence of this branch of nautical science, has pro
duced, and promises to produce, most important results.                In the
 French and other navies it is not understood that there is any officer
charged exclusively with the duty, and we cannot therefore at present
look for any contributions from them to the science of the deviation
 of the compass.

         His ROYAL HIGHNESS PRINCE ARTHUR, in               the Chair.
              COLONEL SIR HENRY          JAMES, R.E. F.R.S. &c.
                  On   the Ordnance Survey      of Jerusalem.
THE    speaker commenced by stating that the survey of Jerusalem had
 been made under his direction, with the permission of the Secretary of
 State for War, in compliance with the request of the Dean of West
minster, who, on the part of a number of gentlemen interested in
endeavouring to improve the sanitary state of the city, undertook to
pay the cost of the survey.        He also stated, that the Councils of the
Royal Society    and   of  the  Royal Geographical Society had placed the
necessary   funds  at  his  disposal  to cover the cost of levelling from the
 Mediterranean to the Dead Sea ; and that the Syrian Improvement
Society had also contributed the funds required to cover the cost of
levelling from Jerusalem to the Pools of Solomon, and for investi
gating the nature and extent of the present and former supplies of
water to the city.
     For the execution of these duties Sir Henry selected Captain
 Wilson, R.E., and a party of Royal Engineers from the Ordnance Sur
vey, including a good surveyor and photographer, Serjeant McDonald,
R.E., to take views of the most interesting places in and about the city.
     For the illustration of the lecture a plan of the city, on the scale
of 25 inches to a mile, with plans of the Haram and Church of the
Holy Sepulchre, &c., on the scale of 120 inches to a mile, were
exhibited on the wall of the lecture-room, and also plans and sections
of the line levelled from the Mediterranean to the Dead Sea, and from
Jerusalem to the Pools of Solomon ; and several of the photographs
were projected by electric light upon a screen, by Dr. Tyndall.

1866.]             on the Ordnance  Survey   of Jerusalem.             527
     Sir Henry first described the route taken in levelling from Jaffa,
by Jerusalem, to the Dead Sea near Jericho ; and stated the highest
point passed over was at Mount Scopus, which was 2,724 feet above
the level of the sea ; whilst the height of the Mount of Olives was
2665 feet, of Mount Zion 2550 feet, and Mount Moriah 2440 feet.
The level of the Mediterranean was crossed on the road from Jerusalem
by Bethany, at 3i miles beyond Khan Haddur.             At about one mile
from Jericho, the line was carried across the plain to a point on the
shore of the Dead Sea opposite the small island there.
     The depression of the Dead Sea below the Mediterranean was
found to be 1292 feet on the 12th March, 1865; but at certain
seasons of the year the water fell 6 feet lower, making the greatest
 depression 1298 feet.     The depression, as ascertained by Lieutenant
Symonds,      R.E., in  1841 was 1312-2 feet.      Sir Henry then pointed
out the importance of being able to connect the levels of the Jerusalem
survey with that of the Mediterranean, and of having a line of
"Bench Marks" (^), cut on permanent objects, along the whole
line levelled, for any future surveys in Palestine, such as those
contemplated by the Society which has since been formed " for the
" accurate investigation of the Topography, Geology, and Physical
" Geography, &c, of the Holy Land for Biblical illustration."
     The geological structure of the country was described as consisting
of a single great anticlinal fold of strata, of the age of the chalk and
lower tertiaries of this country. Specimens of the rocks, with the
characteristic fossils, Ammonites, Hippurites, and Baculites of the
chalk, with the Nummulites and other tertiary fossils, were exhibited
on the table, and also specimens of the highly bituminous limestone
 found in the cretaceous strata on the eastern slope towards the Dead
 Sea ; the decomposition of which, and the constant flowing up of the
bitumen on the surface of that sea, was the probable cause of its
 having been formerly called the Lake Asphaltitis.
     It was then pointed out that the physical or geographical axis of
 the country between the two seas, which was at Jerusalem itself, from
 whence the rivers flowed east and west, did not correspond with the
 geological anticlinal axis, which was at Ain-Jifna and eight miles
 west of the city ; and that all the strata at Jerusalem dipped to the
 south-east at an angle of about 12°.
     The geological plan and section of the ground upon which the city is
 built was then described. The nummulitic or foraminiferous limestone,
locally known under the name of " Cakooli," caps the hills to the east
 and south of the city, and forms the summits of Mount Scopus, the
 Mount of Olives, and of the Mount of Evil Counsel, and is 290 feet
 thick, composed of a soft white limestone with bands of flints.
     This formation is succeeded by the cretaceous strata, the upper
 most of which is a hard siliceous chalk, called " Misste," about 70 feet
 thick ; it is upon this that the city itself is built. This is succeeded
 by a white soft limestone, or indurated chalk, called
                                                           " Malaki," about
 40 feet thick.      Under this the red indurated chalk, called "Santa

       "   marble, is found, but of an unknown thickness. It is from
 Croce
 this last formation, which has been largely exposed by denudation at
 the Convent of the Cross, and in the bottom of the valley of the
 Kedron at Jacob's fountain, that the marble casing to the Holy
 Sepulchre and the shafts of the beautiful columns in the Mosque el
 Aksa, and most of the ornamental stones used in the buildings of the
 city were taken. The older portions of the wall of the Haram es Sherif
 have been taken from the " Missae
                                         " and " Malaki "
                                                               beds, whilst the
later additions have been taken from the " Cakooli."
     The Topography of the city was then described.
     The city is bounded on the west and south by the valley of
 Hinnom, and on the east by the deep valley of the Kedron, or the
valley of Jehoshaphat ; these valleys unite at the Fountain of Joab,
about half-a-mile to the south of the city, from whence, under the
name of the Kedron, the water-course in it descends to the Dead Sea.
     The western portion of the promontory thus formed is cut off from
the eastern by a valley, which runs southward through the city to join
the valley of the Kedron at the Pool of Siloam.
     This is the Tyropean valley, or valley of the Cheesemongers,              a
branch of which runs westward to the citadel.
     Another small valley to the north of the Haram es Sherif, entered
the valley of the Kedron from the north-west, at St. Stephen's gate.
     The ground is thus formed into two spurs, which run out from the
higher ground to the north-west of the city, the western and highest of
which is the Mount Zion of the Bible, and the Upper city of Josephus ;
whilst the eastern is Mount Moriah, upon which the temple formerly
stood, and the Mosque of Omar, or Dome of the Rock, at present stands.
     The citadel occupies the narrow neck of ground between the
valley of Hinnom and the Tyropean valley, and barred the only level
approach to the ancient city ; for that part of the city which lies to the
north of the citadel, and west of the main street from the Zion to the
Damascus gate,    is, comparatively speaking,     amodern addition.
     The citadel, therefore, was the key of a very strong position for       a
small city.
     A.C. 1048. — "David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which             is
Jebus.     David took the castle of Zion, which           isthe city of David,
and David dwelt in the castle, therefore they called            it   the city of
David."                                                 (1st Chronicles, xi.)
     " David took the stronghold of Zion, the same        isthe city of David."
     " So David dwelt in the fort, and called     itthe city of David."
                                                           (2nd Samuel, v.)
     "David began    the siege of  Jerusalem,   and   he   took the lower city
(Acra) by     force, but  the  citadel  held  out  still.    When David had
cast the Jebusites out of the citadel, he also rebuilt Jerusalem, and
named  it  the city of David, and abode there all the time of his reign."
         (Josephus's    Antiquities of the Jews,' Book vii., chap. 3.)
                        '
     " Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth,    is  Mount Zion,
on the sides of the north, the city of the great king."      (Psalm, xlviii.)

1866.]                on the Ordnance Survey    of Jerusalem.               529
     There can therefore be no doubt but that this hill is Mount Zion ;
it has been so called in all subsequent histories, and is so called at
present.
      From      the 21st chapter of 1st Chronicles we learn that David
bought      the                                                "
                 threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, and built there an
altar unto the Lord."
      Then David said (1st Chronicles, xxii.), "This is the house of the
Lord God, and this is the altar of the burnt-offering for Israel."
      "Then Solomon began to build the house of the Lord at
Jerusalem in Mount Moriah, in the place that David had prepared in
the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite."            (2nd Chronicles, iii.)
      No one has ever questioned that the temple formerly stood within
the Haram e.s Sherif ; and therefore there can be no doubt but that
the hill on which it stands has been properly named Monnt Horiah.
      The city is of an irregular lozenze shape, the longest side facing
the north-west, being three-quarters-of-a-mile          long, and the shorter
sides half-a-mile.         It occupies a space exactly equal to the area
included between Oxford-street and Piccadilly, and between Bond-
street and Park-lane.          It is surrounded by high walls with flanking
towers, in which there are five gates.
      It  is intersected from north to south by its principal street, which
is three-fifths of a mile long, and runs from the Damascus gate to
 Zion gate.          It is about the length of the street running from
St. James's palace along Pall Mall to St. Martin's church.
      From this principal street the others, with the exception of that
 from the Damascus gate down the Tyropean valley, generally run east
and west at right angles to it ; amongst these is the Via Dolorosa
 along the north of the Haram, in which is the Roman archway called
 Ecce Homo.
      The city is divided into quarters, which are occupied by the
 different religious sects.
      The boundaries of these quarters are defined by the intersection of
 the principal street, and that which crosses it at right angles from the
 Jaffa gate to the gate of the Haram, called Bab as Silsile, or gate
 of the Chain.
      The Christians occupy the western half of the city, the northern
  portion of which is called the Christian quarter, and contains the
 Church of the Holy Sepulchre; the southern portion is the Armenian
 Quarter, having the citadel at its north-west angle.
      The Mahometan quarter occupies the north-east portion of the
 city, and includes the Haram es Sherif.            The Jewish quarter is on
 the south, between the Armenian quarter and the Haram.
       Sir Henry then described the present and the ancient means of
 supplying the city with water. Of the drainage of the city, he said,
  there is none in our acceptation of the word, as there is not a single
 drain leading from the city ; and the present water-supply is derived
  principally from the cisterns in which the rain water is collected, and
  from Joab's fountain, from whence it is brought in skins on the backs

530                    Colonel   Sir Henry   James                [Feb.   16,
 of donkeys, and sold in the city. The water from the Pool of Siloara,
 although described by Josephus as sweet and in great plenty, is now
 extremely impure and in small quantity. The ancient conduits for the
 supply of water were remarkable as engineering works, and rivalled
 those which have been most recently executed in this country by our
 most skilful engineers, such as those executed for supplying the city of
 Glasgow.     Two conduits were described and distinguished as the high-
 level and the low-level conduits.     The low-level conduit was brought
 from a great distance by the Wady Urtas to below the lowest of the
 three Pools of Solomon, and from thence passing through two tunnels,
 was led round the lower Pool of Gihon, and round the south end of
 Mount Zion into the city at the west side of Tyropean valley, at an
 altitude of 2420 feet.      The high-level conduit was brought from a
 valley to the south of the Pools of Solomon, and led, after passing
 through a tunnel, above the uppermost of the pools ; and from thence
 by Rachel's Tomb, crossing a valley by means of a syphon made of
 stone, in lengths of about 5 feet, and having collar and socket joints to
 connect them, it was led round the upper Pool of Gihon into the
 Citadel at an altitude of 2528 feet, or 108 feet above the level at which
 the lower conduit entered the city, and at a sufficient height to supply
 every house in the city with water.      By this arrangement the lower
 conduit could be supplied with water either through the Pools of
 Solomon or through pipes in the city.        The low-level conduit was
                                                              '
supposed to be that which is referred to by Josephus in his Antiquities
 of the Jews,' Book xviii., chap. 3, where he says :    " Pilate, the pro
 curator of Judea, undertook to bring a current of water to Jerusalem,
and did it with the sacred money, and derived the origin of the stream
from the distance of 200 furlongs."
      In the Tyropean valley there are three beautiful fountains, which
 are referred to by Moryson, who visited Jerusalem in 1596, who says,
 when describing this part of the city, " Here I   did see pleasant foun
 tains of waters ;" but there is no water to supply them now.
      His Royal Highness Prince Arthur examined a stone syphon,
 similar to that described near Patara, in Lycia, of which a sketch by
 Major Elphinstone, R.E., was exhibited, as well as models of portions
of the two syphons.
      The Holy Sepulchre was described as a small chamber or crypt,
about 6 feet square and 9 feet high, having on the east side so very low
an entrance as to oblige people to stoop down in going in or out.       It
lies exactly east and west, and has a bench on the north side, and to the
right of the entrance, on which the body of our Saviour was laid.
      This was originally a tomb cut out of the solid rock in the side of
the hill, but the Emperor Constantine, A.D. 333, had the rock around
it cut away, so as to leave the tomb standing out by itself.     He then
encased the tomb with marble, and richly ornamented         it,  and sur
rounded it   with
                a    large open court, paved with marble, and built the
Church of the Holy Sepulchre to the east of it. An examination of
the ground fully sustains the descriptions which have been given by

 1866.]             on the Ordnant-e Survey     of Jerusalem.                 531
the contemporary writers, Eusebius and Jerome, and by the Pilgrim of
Bordeaux, both as to the Sepulchre itself and its site.
    The Sepulchre is surrounded by a handsome circular building, with
a dome open at the top ; but it much needs the repairs which the Empress
of the French is exerting herself to obtain the funds to effect. The
Greek church, the principal of the rmmy grouped round the sepulchre,
is immediately to the east of the sepulchre, and in the position of the
one built by Constantine.
    Calvary is 140 feet S.E. of the sepulchre.
    The Haram es Sfierif, or Noble Sanctuary, was described as a
quadrilateral enclosure of 35 acres, and nearly one mile in circuit, the
northern side being 1042 feet long, the eastern 1530, the southern
  922, and the western 1601.
      The magnificent Dome of the Rock or Mosque of Omar, as it is
  commonly called, stands on a platform a little to the west of the centre
  of the area, and was built a.d. 688 to 691, and restored in the 16th
  century by Soliman the Magnificent ; it is erected over and around the
  Sakhrah.     The Sakhrah is a portion of the natural rock — in fact, the
  summit of Mount Moriah, the highest portion of which is 4 feet 9i inches
 above the marble floor of the mosque, and it is 2440 feet above the
  level of the sea.
      Beneath the Sakhrah there is a cave which is entered by descending
 some steps on the south-east side.       The cave itself is about 9 feet high
 in the highest part, and 22 feet 6 inches square ; a hole has been cut
 through from the upper surface of the rock into the chamber beneath,
 and there is a corresponding hole immediately under            it,
                                                                  which leads to
a   drain down to the valley of the Kedron.        This hole supposed to have

 been made for the purpose of carrying off the blood of the animals sacri
 ficed on the rock, when  it   was the altar of burnt-offerings to the Temple.
      The Mosque, splendid specimen of Saracenic architecture, consists
                    a
 of very elegantly-shaped dome, supported on four piers standing in
    a
 the circumference of     a    circle 75 feet in diameter; between each of
 the piers are three pillars, from the capitals of which spring slightly
 elliptical arches, which assist in carrying the tambour of the dome.
 This circle   is   surrounded by an octagonal screen, containing eight
 piers and sixteen pillars, which carry an entablature, above which are
 discharging arches, slightly elliptical in shape.
      There          peculiar feature in the entablature of the screen, that
               is
               a
 over the intercolumnar spaces the architrave        is   entirely omitted, and
 over the pillars   is represented bya   square block cased with marble.
      The pillars are of the Corinthian order, averaging        5 feet1
                                                                      1   inches
 in circumference for the screen, and       7    feet 10 inches for the inner
 circle ;  are of various coloured beautiful marbles, and serpentine.
      Outside the screen  is   the main building, also octagonal, composed
 of the best " Malaki " stone, finely chiselled with close heads and
joints, and having on each side seven recessed spaces or bays with plain
 semicircular heads.
      The exterior of the Mosque      is   richly decorated with marble and

ground to nearly the footof the windows.
  The whole internal surface of the dome and tambour is covered with
arabesques    in mosaic, which, though in some places peeling off, in
others retain much of the original freshness of colouring.
    The windows are remarkable for the beauty of the tracery, no less
than for the brilliancy of the colouring, and the admirable way in which
the different colours are blended, producing perfect harmony in the whole.
    The Mosque El Aksa, on the south side of the Haram, is a
Mahometan place of worship, which has been built upon vaults to
bring up a level surface for it.
    The Crusaders took Jerusalem in a.d. 1099, and called the Dome
of the Rock the "Temple of the Lord," and the Mosque El Aksa, the
" Palace of Solomon ; " and it was here that King Baldwin founded
the celebrated order of Knights Templars.
    In discussing the question as to whether the present area of the
Haram es Sherif corresponded with the area of the Temple as it was
built by Herod. Sir Henry said that a careful examination of this
question had led him to the conclusion that there could be no doubt
but that it was identically the same.
    The northern front is described by Josephus as having the tower
of Antonia built on a precipice at the north-west angle ; this precipice,
in part cut away, still existed, and on the same spot a guard was always
now stationed, as it was at the time when the city was occupied by
the Romans ; this side terminates at the valley of the Kedron, and
" was built over    it,   on which account the depth was frightful," as
Josephus also says and we have in the Pool of Bethesda the immense

Titus found such difficulty in procuring materials to fill up, in front

possible it  should reach any farther   ;              description, with the
manner in which the south-east angle     is  supported on arches, is  exactly
confirmed by     what  we   now  see.   Then turning to the architecture of
the enclosing walls, we find that, as Josephus says, " both the largeness
of the square edifice and its altitudes were immense, and that the vastness
of the stones in the front was plainly visible," and this description
exactly applies to the lowest, and therefore the most ancient parts of
the walls which still remain, as seen at the north-east angle, the south
east, and south-west angles, and at numerous intervening points in
which there are immense stones, some of which range from 24 feet to
40 feet in length, and of proportional depth and width.
    The architecture of these parts of the walls          is  moreover dis
              by the broad " marginal drafts

called " bevelled joints

courses of stones  4   or 5  inches as they were carried up at the angle.

    These facts prove that these remaining portions of the old walls
formed part of one design and one work ; and when we find a portion
of the arch (Robinson's) built in as part of the wall itself, and know
that this was one of the arches of the bridge across the Tyropean
valley, which was built by Herod to lead to the royal cloisters along
the south side of the enclosure — for its position exactly accords with
the dimensions given by Josephus — the conclusion is inevitable, that
the whole enclosure is identically the same as that of the temple of
Herod.     The history, the topography, and the architecture are all in
accord upon this point.
     Sir Henry then described the ancient doorway or postern still existing
in the southern portion of the west wall, the lintel of which was 24 feet
long in one stone, and the Wailing place of the Jews a little to the
north of it, the only part of the wall which is within the Jews' quarter
to which they are permitted to have access, and also the great arch
having a span of 42 feet and a width of 43 feet, covering the cistern
" El Barak," which was discovered by Captain Wilson, and first
recognized by him as forming part of one of the four ancient
approaches to the temple enclosure on the west side.
     The western wall of the enclosure was described as being perfectly
straight throughout its length ; but from Wilson's arch northwards
there is an accumulation of 72 feet of rubbish against it ; upon
which the modern houses of the Mahometans are built too close
together to admit of excavations being made, and which on account
of the tombs of the Turkish Effendis, would not be permitted, even
if there was room. This portion of the wall is therefore entirely hid,
but there is no reason to doubt but that it would be of the same
character as the rest, if it could be examined.
    The piers of the arches supporting the Haram in the south-east
angle are found to range precisely as they should do to support the
triple cloister on the south side, and a double cloister on the east side ;
and if they are not those originally built for that purpose, the present
piers must occupy the exact same positions as the original ones did.
     After the capture of the city by Titus, a.d. 70, Josephus tells us
that he ordered the city to be entirely demolished and its walls to be
overthrown, but that the citadel should be preserved as a monument
of his good fortune. The citadel had been rebuilt by Herod, and from
the description given by Josephus of the towers built by him — viz. that
they were built up to a certain height perfectly solid — and from the
character of the architecture, which corresponds with that found all
round the Haram, there seems no doubt that the tower, called the
Tower of David, is one of those built by Herod.
     Sir Henry concluded by observing that "notwithstanding the very
" opposite views with respect to the sites of the holy places which have
" been
         brought forward in this lecture-room, I feel firmly convinced
" that the traditional sites are the true sites of the Holy Sepulchre, the

                           Friday, February 23,   1866.
    SIR  HE.NRY      HOLLAND,     Bart. M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S.       President,
                                   in the Chair.
                 WILUAM PENGELLY, ESQ. F.R.S. F.G.S.
                          On Kent's Cavern, Torquay.
 AMONGST the        numerous beautiful valleys in the neighbourhood of
 Torquay,     there   is one, about a mile eastward      from the harbour,
 running    north   and  south,  and  terminating in the  latter direction on
 the northern shore of Torbay.         About half-a-mile from this termina
 tion, a transverse valley enters it on the western side, and in the angle
 formed by the junction of the two there stands a small, wooded, lime
 stone hill, which contains the celebrated Kent's Cavern, or Kent's
 Hole.
     The rocks composing        the entire Torquay peninsula are limestone
 with interstratified calcareous shale, greenstone, clay-slate, and a com
 pact reddish grit ; all of which, with the possible exception of the
greenstone, belong to the Devonian system.         The slate and grit, which
 are traversed by quartz veins, underlie the limestone, but form the
 highest hills of the district.       The overlying soil is frequently an
ochreous red loam mixed with angular stones, from a few inches to
 fully twelve feet thick. It is sometimes sufficiently tenacious and free
from stones to be used for making bricks.          Numerous narrow fissures
traverse the limestones ; and many of them are filled with a similar
admixture of clay and stones, or sand, or gravel consisting of well-
rounded materials, and in some cases derived from somewhat distant
parts of the county.       Near Hope's Nose, the northern horn of Torbay,
and scarcely a mile from the cavern, there is a fine example of a raised
beach, about 30 feet above the sea, and containing a large number of
well-rolled flints, as well as the shells of various species of mollusks,
all of which still inhabit the adjacent bay. A considerable accumula
tion of gravel, largely composed of rolled flints and Dartmoor rocks,
occurs on Milbern Down, about five miles north-westerly from the
cavern.
     Omitting one or two mere slits, which have long been blocked up
from within, the cavern has two entrances in one and the same low
natural cliff, which runs north and south on the eastern scarp of the
hill. They are about 50 feet apart, 190 feet above the level of mean

 18GG.J                on  Kent's Cavern, Torquay.                    535
tide, and from 60 to 70 feet above the bottom of the valley imme
diately below.     The northern entrance is a rude triangle, about 6 feet
high and 8 feet wide at the base.        Several lithodomous perforations
occur in the limestone near its vertex.         The southern opening is
somewhat larger, and is a natural arch, having a continuous limestone
base or chord.
     Though the cavern has been known from time immemorial, it did
not attract the attention of scientific men until 1824, when Mr.
Northmore and Mr. W. C. Trevilyan found a few bones in its
deposits.   In 1825 the Rev. Mr. McEnery commenced the investigations
which were continued until 1829, and rendered the scene of his labours
famous.     After his decease his papers passed into the possession of
Mr. Vivian, by whom they were published in 1859.            In 1840 Mr.
Godwin- Austen read to the Geological Society of London a paper
descriptive of researches which he had made in the cavern. In 1847
Mr. Vivian read to the same society, and also to the British Associa
tion, a paper embodying the results of an investigation of the cavern,
made the previous year, by a committee of the Torquay Natural
 History Society.
     These investigations appear to have been made carefully, and the
 explorers are unanimous in stating that flint implements were found
 commingled with the remains of extinct animals, in undisturbed cave
 earth, beneath the stalagmitic floor.    Mr. Godwin-Austen adds that
 the bones of man occurred under precisely the same conditions.
     According to Professor Owen's ' British Fossil Mammalia and
 Birds,' remains of the following animals, of which those in italics are
extinct species, have been found in the cavern: — Great Horse-Shoe
 Bat, Shrew, Ursus priscus, Ursus spelaus, Badger, Polecat, Stoat,
 Wolf, Fox, Hycrna speUea, Felis spelaa, Wild Cat, Machairodus
latidens, Water Vole, Field Vole, Hank Vole, Norway Hare, Rabbit,
 Lagomys spelftus, Elephas primigenius, Rhinoceros tichorhinus, Equus
fossilis. Hippopotamus major, Megaceros hibernicus, Strongyloceros
spetams,   Red deer, and Man. The last is on the authority of Mr.
 Godwin-Austen.
     It is well known that even scientific men either discredited or
 explained away these alleged discoveries of the inosculation of human
 industrial remains with the bones of the extinct mammals, until 1858,
 when the results of the systematic exploration of the Brixham Cavern
 induced many geologists to suspect that the discoveries which again and
 again had been reported from Kent's Cavern might after all be worthy
 of credence ; and in 1864 the British Association appointed a com
 mittee, consisting of Sir C. Lyell, Sir J. Lubbock, Professor Phillips,
 Mr. Vivian, Mr. J. Evans, and Mr. Pengelly, to make a systematic
 exploration of the cavern, which the proprietor, Sir L. Palk, Bart.,
 immediately placed in their exclusive custody.
     Mr. McEnery and his successors, as well as the numerous visitors,
 invariably used the northern entrance. The southern, which had long
 been blocked up, opens at once into a spacious chamber, which the Cora

536                         Mr. W. Pengelly                        [Feb. 23,
mittee selected for their investigations, partly because of its accessibility,
but mainly on account of its deposits being certainly intact. A mode of
exploration was decided on, intelligent and trustworthy workmen were
engaged, and the work, consigned to the superintendence of the two
resident members of the committee, commenced on March 28, 1865.
The encouraging report presented in September last induced the
British Association not only to repeat, but to double their liberal
grant of the previous year.
     The following, in descending order, is the succession of deposits
found in the chamber: —
     1. Huge blocks of limestone which had fallen from the              roof.
 Many of them required blasting in order to their removal.               The
largest measured 194 fe^ long, 9 feet broad, 2J thick, and must have
weighed fully 33 tons.     In some instances two or three blocks lay one
on another. Sheets of stalagmite sometimes lay between and cemented
them together, or invested the whole so as to form a dome-shaped
mass, whilst others were without any trace of this material.
     2. Beneath and between these blocks lay a stratum of black muddy
mould from 3 to upwards of 12 inches in depth.
     3. Next below was a floor of stalagmite from about 1 to 3 feet
in thickness.    It was firmly cemented to the walls, and, with a few
exceptions, extended across the chamber.            In some cases it was
crystalline, compact, and hard ; in others granular or earthy.         Most
commonly it consisted of alternate crystalline and non-crystalline
laminae.    It contained numerous fragments of limestone, some of them
attaining the size of large blocks ; and in the lower portion it gradu
ated into an intractable concrete.
     4. Still lower was the ordinary ochreous red cave-earth, with about
50 per cent, of angular fragments of limestone, varying from thin bits
measuring less than a square inch, to blocks as large as some of those
found on the surface.    In some cases the stones and earth were mixed
in about equal quantities, in others the earth or stones greatly pre
ponderated. Thin films of stalagmite of limited area occurred at all
depths, sometimes encrusting a bone or stone, in others cementing the
materials into small lumps of breccia.
    The entire accumulation was destitute of any approach to stratifi
cation, and the stones lay at all angles, without any tendency to
symmetrical arrangement.       At present the cave-earth has not been
excavated beyond four feet below the stalagmite, so that nothing is
known respecting its depth or what may lie beneath it. The black
muddy soil lies immediately on it in the few spots where there is no
stalagmite, but the line of junction is in all cases sharp and well
defined.
     There can be no doubt that the early explorers abstained from
carrying on researches in this chamber on account of the huge lime
stone blocks overlying the deposits.      They are at once the cause, and
a proof that the accumulation remained intact.
    It is believed that the method of exploration which from the

 1866.]                   oh  Kent's Cavern,     Torquay.                537
commencement has been rigidly followed, is at once simple and trust
 worthy, and that it renders it easy to determine the precise situation of
every object which has been found.          It is as follows : —
       1. The black mould between       the limestone blocks was carefully
examined and removed.
       2. The blocks themselves were blasted, and otherwise broken up,
and taken out of the cavern.
       3. A " datum line
                           "
                             was stretched horizontally from a fixed point
at the entrance to another at the back of the chamber.
      4. At distances of one foot, lines were drawn transversely across the
 chamber at right angles to the datum, so as to divide the entire area
 into belts or " parallels
                             " one foot wide.
       5. In each parallel, the black mould which had underlain the blocks
 of limestone, and then the stalagmite floor, were examined and
 removed, so as to expose the surface of the cave-earth.
      6. The red cave-earth       in each parallel was excavated     in four
 successive    " levels," each a foot deep, and extending across the
 chamber.       Each level was divided into three-feet lengths or " yards,"
 measured on each side from the datum, so as to form a right and left
 series.     For convenience of working, as well as to guard against the
  risk of slips, the sections have been limited to the depth of four
 feet.
      The material contained in each " yard," or horizontal prism,       has
 been first carefully examined in situ by candle-light, next taken to    the
 entrance and re-examined, and then removed outside the cavern and
 once more looked over.        A box has been appropriated exclusively to
 the objects found in each yard, and every evening the boxes, each
 containing a label with the data necessary lor defining the exact posi
 tion of its contents, and securely packed, have been sent, under lock,
 to the honorary secretary,        who at once cleaned and repacked the
 specimens, numbered the labels, and recorded in his diary the results
 of the day's investigation.
      The same method has been followed in the examination of the
 black mould and the stalagmite, with the single exception that they
 have not been divided into " levels" and "yards."
      If  from any cause the position of an object was doubtful, such object
has been placed in a box marked " uncertain," and thus all untrust
worthy evidence has been eliminated. With rare exceptions, the cavern
has been visited daily by the superintendents, and monthly reports
have been forwarded to the chairman of the committee.
      The objects found in the black mould, above the stalagmite, form a
very miscellaneous collection, which includes articles of various eras,
from the present day back to pre-Roman times, and thus represents at
least two thousand years.          It consists of various kinds of stones,
human industrial remains, bones of different animals of existing species,
land and marine shells, and perforated shells of hazel-nuts.            The
stones, in most cases well rounded, and occasionally llthodomized, are
fragments of limestone, quartz, red grit, slate, greenstone, and flint, —

538                         Mr. W. Pengelly                         [Feb. 23,
all, excepting the last, derivable from the rocks of the district.     There
can be no doubt that they were taken to the cavern by man.
     The human industrial remains are pottery, and articles in stone,
bone, and bronze.
     The pottery occurs in fragments ; nothing approaching a perfect
vessel has been found.     The sherds represent a large number of utensils
ranging from pre-Roman, through Roman and mediaeval, to modern
times.    Many of them are black, coarse in texture, and more or less
ornamented.
     Amongst the articles in stone, there are whetstones ; fragments of
slate, some of which are obviously portions of curvilineal plates, used,
perhaps, as covers for the earthenware vessels ;
                                                          " spindle whorls,"
formed of Devonian grit, Triassic sandstone, slate, chloritic schist, and
Kimmeridge clay, and differing in dimensions and finish, some being
very rude, whilst others are even elaborately ornamented ; aquadrantal
fragment of an ellipsoidal quartzite pebble, resembling those which
compose the Triassic
                       " pebble-bed " near Budleigh Salterton, and which
appears to have been used for polishing; and a few flint flakes, some of
a dark, others of an almost white colour.
     The bone implements comprise a comb, resembling in size and out
line a small shoe-lifter, with strong teeth cut in its broad end ; a spoon,
neatly formed out of a rib ; a chisel ; and a wedge.
     The bronze series includes a fibula ; portion of a spoon ; a spear
head ; a socketed celt ; and two or three rings.         In this connection
may be mentioned a large portion of a cake of smelted copper.
     Of the shells, the terrestrial forms are chiefly various species of
snail. They occur in all stages of growth, and are probably the relics
of a colony which had taken possession of the cavern. The marine
species are the limpet, whelk, oyster, solen, pecten, mussel, cockle, and
the internal shell of a small cuttle-fish.      Their presence is due, no
doubt, to human agency.
     The stalagmitic floor, though broken into small fragments and
carefully examined, has not yielded a large collection of objects.         In
it have been found pieces of charcoal ; marine and land shells ; and a
few remains of animals, most of them existing species, but including
teeth of a bear, probably Ursus spelaus.
     The red cave-earth, below the stalagmite, contained pebbles of
various kinds, some of them certainly derived from Dartmoor and other
somewhat distant localities, and varying from the size of peas to that of
a hen's egg ; an immense quantity of bones and teeth of recent and
extinct mammals ; flint implements ; whetstones ; and a stone hammer.
     The bones are of greater specific gravity than those found in the
overlying black mud. Most of them are of a chalky whiteness when
cleaned ; but a few are discoloured, and present such marks as are
sometimes left by mosses and lichens on objects on which they have
grown.      A considerable number of the long bones have been split
longitudinally, as if for the extraction of the marrow ; and all that are
thus split, as well as many others, including fragments of antlers and

even teeth, present distinct indications of having been gnawed.    Most
of those found immediately beneath large blocks of limestone are
crushed.      A
             few have obviously been rolled, and several pieces of burnt
bone have been met with.         A large portion of the osseous debris
occurs in the form of mere splinters.       Lumps composed of finely
comminuted bone, bony fecal matter, and red loam are here and
there abundant.
     Nothing like an entire, or even a considerable portion, of a skeleton
has been found.       The principal identifiable remains are teeth, amongst
which are those of the cave-bear, cave-lion, cave-hyaena, fox, probably
more than one species of horse, ox, several species of deer, the tichorhine,
rhinoceros, and the mammoth.         The hyaena, and, after        it,
                                                                 the horse and
rhinoceros, are the most prevalent forms. The relics of the mammoth
— tusks and teeth — are those of very young animals. The early ex
plorers, however, frequently found, in other parts of the cave, the
remains of adults of this species.
     Without including doubtful specimens and mere chips, about seventy
" flint" implements have been found.          Like the bones, they are least
                                                "
numerous in the uppermost foot or " level of the cave-earth.              Some
are of light grey, others of cream colour, or almost white the latter,

less cherty.      Some of the specimens are fragments only, others were
found broken but with the parts lying in contact, whilst many are
perfect.     A few seem scarcely or never to have been used, and none of
them present any traces of having been rolled.               Some are highly
wrought, but never polished        others seem to have been fashioned with
                                     ;

splinter      met with, such as was probably struck off in fashioning a
             is
 more elaborate tool. The most perfect implements are of two kinds —             :
 flakes, flat or concave on one face, and carinated on the other and         ;
 oval implements, worked to an edge all round.        Of the latter there are
three specimens, all carefully       made   and well finished     one of them
                                                                   ;

     The     whetstones,                are two, are formed of hard, fine
                            of which there

      The results of the exploration now in progress have confirmed
 most, and contradicted none, of those recorded by the earlier investi
 gators.   Compared with the previous evidence, that recently found is
 in a few cases defective, but never conflicting.      The committee, like
 Mr. McEnery, Mr. Godwin-Austen, and the Torquay Natural History
 Society, have found unquestionable human industrial remains, in the
 undisturbed cave-earlh below the stalagmite, mixed up with the bones
 and teeth of the ordinary extinct cave mammals ; but, unlike JMr.
 MeEnery, they have not yet found any traces of Machairodus nor of
 Hippopotamus;       nor have they, like Mr. Godwin-Austen, met with
any part    of the human skeleton.
      The speaker remarked, that he alone must be held responsible for
 any inferences which he might draw from the facts which had been
enunciated ; he also wished it to be understood that, since the evidence
 cannot be considered complete until the exploration has closed, such
 inferences must be regarded as provisional only, and not necessarily
definitive.
      The fall of the blocks of limestone from the roof has been ascribed
 by some to earthquake shocks ; by others, to change of dimensions
arising from changes of temperature. It may be objected to the first
hypothesis, that it renders it necessary to call in the aid of convulsion
very repeatedly, since the blocks fell at intervals throughout the
periods represented by the cave-earth, the stalagmite, and the black
mud, as well as after the greater part, at least, of the latter was intro
duced ; and to the second, that the cavern temperature is constant.       It
seems more probable that, so to speak, the blocks were cut out succes
sively by the action of water charged with carbonic acid, and perco
lating through the roof along the two systems of joints which traverse
the limestone.
      That the stalagmitic floor was not formed by a stream, supersatu
rated with carbonate of lime, flowing through the cavern, but by drip
from the roof, is evinced by its occasional discontinuity on areas by no
means above the common level ; as well as by the fact, that it was
immediately beneath unusually large stalactites depending from the
roof that the floor attained its greatest thickness, and rose in consider
able bosses.
     Since none of the flint implements have been rolled, and some of
them appear new and unused, it may be concluded that man was at
least an occasional visitant of the cavern.    The occurrence, moreover,
of large flint splinters with sharp edges renders it probable that-Uemade
it his habitual residence, and manufactured his tools there.
inference may be drawn from the whetstones, the stone hammer, and
the burnt bones ; and it receives further confirmation in the numerous
long bones split longitudinally, since it is difficult to conceive of this
being achieved by less than human agency.
     But since these as well as many other bones are scored with teeth-
marks, probably by the hyaena in most cases, and a large amount of
bony faecal matter occurred at all levels and in every part of the area,

1866.]                 on  Kent's Cavern, Torquay.                      541
it  seems equally certain that the cavern was at least the occasional
home of this powerful carnivore, which dragged into his domicile the
remains of his brute contemporaries, or made a meal by gnawing
the scattered remnants of the human feast.          As man, however, could
not have shared his home with so undesirable a fellow-lodger, it seems
probable that the latter resided there only whilst the former was
absent ; and when it is remembered           that in a climate such as the
British a savage population must be necessarily sparse, it will be seen
to be not unlikely that hunting expeditions frequently took man con
siderable distances, and for protracted periods, from his home.
     That the cave-earth accumulated gradually and slowly may be
inferred from the facts that traces of this alternate tenancy, large
blocks of limestone, and films of stalagmite encrusting stones and
bones, or cementing them into a firm concrete, occur at all levels and
in all parts of the chamber.
     Much of the red earth forming the staple of the cavern deposit
may be, perhaps, the earthy residuum of the impure limestone of the
district, and especially of the interstratified shale, the calcareous matter
having been removed by the action of acidulated water ; and a portion
of this may have been derived from the interior of the cave itself. It
is obvious, however, that at least parts of the deposit were introduced
from without, since it contains no inconsiderable amount of material
which the cavern hill could not supply, such as pebbles of Devonian
grit — probably from an adjacent and loftier hill — quartz, flint, granite,
and other Dartmoor rocks, and crystalline schists from the southern
angle of the county.
     It cannot be supposed that these pebbles were selected by man, as
many of them are much too small to serve any useful purpose.
     Since there are no open fissures in the roof of the cavern, the
materials from the exterior must have been introduced through the
lateral entrances, and in all probability by the action of water, — an
hypothesis in harmony with the facts that the surface of the deposit is
everywhere below the level of the top of the openings, and that some
of the bones are rolled.
     It may be concluded, too, from the absence of a stratified arrange
 ment of the materials, that the transporting agent was neither the sea
nor an engulfed permanent stream, but in all probability an occasional
 land-flood, which, when the bottom of the valley was but little below
 the level of the base of the entrances, from time to time entered the
 cavern.    That the sea did not introduce the deposit may be inferred
 also from its containing no trace of marine organisms.
     The acceptance of the foregoing hypothesis renders it necessary to
 suppose that since the era of the deposit the adjacent valley has been
 deepened at least 60 feet, either by the excavation of a correspond
 ing amount of hard semi-crystalline limestone, or by the re-excavation
 of a pre-existent valley which had been filled up with gravel. The
hypothesis of excavation is somewhat appalling from the enormous
chronological demand which it necessitates, whilst that of re-excava

 lion, though perfectly compatible with the most extended antiquity,
 renders it possible to compress the change of surface-configuration
 within such moderate time-limits as other related phenomena may
 require.
      It is well known that the valleys of the Bovey and Teign — but a
 few miles from the cavern — not only existed, but were deeper than at
 present in early Tertiary times; that at their confluence a lacustrine
 formation, upwards of 50 fathoms in thickness, was deposited in the
 Lower Miocene period ; that long subsequently a thick accumulation
 of gravel, consisting mainly of fragments of granite and flint, covered
 it unconformably, and extended very far beyond it ; that denuda
 tion has everywhere swept off large portions of this gravel ; that
 on it there lies, on Bovey Heathfield, a white clay containing Betula
 nana, and other plants betokening a very cold, perhaps a glacial
 climate ; that similar gravels fill pockets and fissures in the limestone
 of the Torbay district, and reach the height of nearly 300 feet ; that
 from the Teign eastward, all the Devonshire valleys are partially
 occupied with gravel extending from their lowest level to the summits
 of the hills which bound them, and have certainly been twice exca
 vated — primarily before, secondarily and less completely, after the
 gravel period, — all the old valleys being re-opened, but not deepened,
 and no new ones cut, even in comparatively soft Triassic sandstone ;
 that the valley bounding the cavern hill, and on the slopes of which
 the cavern entrances are situated, was certainly upwards of 200 feet
 deep prior to the introduction of the cave deposit ; and that since that
 time no appreciable effect has been wrought in the slopes of the cavern
hill above the " entrances," since the perforations at their level, drilled
by marine lithodomi prior to the era of the cave-earth, instead of being
effaced by denudation, are still of considerable depth ; — facts, all of
them, harmonizing with the hypothesis of secondary,          rather than of
primary excavation. The former, moreover, accounts for the presence
of the pebbles of distant derivation mixed up with the cavern deposit.
     It is occasionally argued that, in consequence of their greater specific
gravity, the flint implements may have sunk through a pulpy deposit
to a lower level than they would have occupied otherwise, and thus
were mixed up with the bones of animals of earlier times.              This
rejoinder is effectually rebutted by the fact that very large masses of
limestone, as well as the flints, occur at all levels, having no other
support than that afforded by the deposit.         Moreover, the crushed
bones lying immediately beneath these masses show that the deposit
was compact, unyielding, and capable of offering a firm resistance to
even heivy falling bodies.
     It has been asserted that the statement of the inosculation of human
industrial remains with the bones of extinct animals was accepted by
geologists with a haste, and, indeed, an eagerness but little comporting
with the gravity of the subject, or with the spirit of philosophy.        In
reply, it cannot be necessary to do more than to state briefly the
history of the Kent's Cavern explorations.       But for the strong hand

of scientific authority Mr. McEnery would          have published at once his
discoveries made forty years since.        Mr. Godwin-Austen's paper, in
 1840, experienced an undeserved        neglect; and in 1847, the Geolo
gical Society of London, in the three lines they devoted to Mr.
 Vivian's paper, declined to do more than to state that during the
researches of the committee of the Torquay Natural History Society,
" the bones of various extinct species of animals were found in several
situations."    The statement " that relics of human art were found
                                                 "
beneath the unbroken floor of stalagmite            was entirely ignored ; and
this in a journal which, on its wrapper, announces " that the authors
alone are responsible for the facts and opinions contained in their
respective papers."
     The recent researches in the cavern show that the interrogative
objection, " Where are the bones of the implement-makers ? proves
                                                                      "
nothing, or proves too much. It is true that the committee have not
found human remains amongst the implements                 and the bones of
extinct mammals below the stalagmitic floor ; but it is also true that
they have not been more successful in the black mould above. Pottery,
implements and ornaments in metal, bone, and stone, the remnants of
man's fires, and the relics of his feasts are numerous, and betoken the
lapse of at least two millenniums ; but here, as well as below, the only
evidences of his existence are the results of his handiwork.        No vestige
of his osseous system has been met with.

                              English History.
It  will scarcely be necessary to enter into details respecting the origin
and earliest applications of portraiture. The pages of Pliny, Herodotus,
^•Eliati, and Plutarch afford numerous examples; and for the more modern
periods of art, we have but to turn to Vasari, Van Mander, Houbraken,
and Ridolfi, to find abundant historical records in continuation.          The
taste for collecting portraits of eminent persons appears to have pre
vailed in very early times.        Varro, the contemporary of Cicero,
compiled an album or collection of 700 biographies, extending from
the period of Homer and Hesiod to his own day.             These were accom
panied by portraits of the respective persons, which he seems to have
possessed some peculiar means of reproducing and multiplying at will.

 544                 Mr. G. Scharf        on  Porlrniture:             [March 2,
     Even at these early times, we learn from Pliny that, when some
desirable portrait was not to be met with, artists were already in the
 habit of composing ideal features to supply the deficiency.
     In comparatively recent times the system adopted by Varro was
 pursued by Paulus Jovius, Bishop of Nocera, who flourished at the
 beginning of the sixteenth century.         He was born in 1483, the same
 year with Raphael, Rabelais, and Martin Luther. He also formed a
 large collection of portraits of the most illustrious men of all periods,
 which he combined with biographical notices, under the denomination
of a Musaeum.       These were afterwards published with woodcut illus
trations, having pithy epigramatic sentences under each, in imitation
of the system adopted by Pomponius Atticus, the Roman collector.
 This volume is well known as the ' Elogia of Paulus Jovius,' and
deserves especial notice for the spirit and character with which the
woodcut portraits have been executed.
     This curious collection first suggested to Vasari the commencement
of his invaluable volumes, ' Lives of the Italian Painters,' which were
intended originally to illustrate the portraits he had collected, and in
 which now, clever as they undoubtedly are, the woodcut illustrations
hold a very subordinate position.           The book was first published in
 1550, and a second edition appeared at Florence in 1568.                 Vasari
executed for the Grand-Duke, his patron, an extensive series of actual
portraits of the great men who flourished in the time of Cosimo
Vecchio, to serve as decorations for the ducal palace at Florence.
     The taste of Varro, Jovius, and Vasari, was followed in England
by the illustrious John Evelyn, Lord Chancellor                  Clarendon, and
Secretary Pepys,     and it is  to  their exertions   that  we  are indebted for
the preservation   of many interesting facts relating to portraiture, and
for a knowledge of the subjects of some of the finest paintings of that
class.
     The letters written by John Evelyn, in 1667, to his friend Lord
Clarendon, and published in his correspondence,              are well worthy of
consideration by all who are interested in comparing the portraits of
eminent men.      Even as late as August, 1689, we find him earnestly
pursuing this theme, and communicating valuable advice on the subject
to his friend Pepys, whose extensive              collections were eventually
deposited at Magdalen College, Cambridge.
     Unless implicit reliance can be placed on the authenticity of the
likeness, a portrait becomes worthless.           The soundness of claims to
genuineness may      be  tested    and   authenticated    in various ways ; but
especially by    reference    to   pictures   preserved     in family mansions,
historical descriptions, and by a comparison with contemporary en
gravings of the best class, bearing inscriptions which afford both names
and dates of the persons represented and of the artist also who painted
the likeness.    The value of inscriptions upon paintings, medals, and
seals, has been instanced in numerous cases by John Evelyn, Visconti,
and various writers upon the history of art.           The lineaments of a face
do not always correspond with the idea that may be formed from the

1866.]                  its Fallacies and Curiosities.                    545
known actions of an individual, and, consequently, in the absence of
some inscription to convey the necessary information, many interesting
countenances would be in danger of being passed by unnoticed.
       A remarkable instance of this may be cited in a well-known tetra-
drachma, probably struck at Alexandria 33 B.C., bearing on one side a
profile of Cleopatra and Marc Antony on the other.          Neither of these
faces in the least degree accords with the notion that we have formed
of their personal appearance, and yet the legend in Greek characters
around them precludes the possibility even of uncertainty.        Again, the
same profiles are repeated on Roman coins, with the inscriptions in the
 Latin language. — (Visconti, Icon. Grecque, torn. 3, tav. xv. nos.
5, 6.)       It is only too frequently that the artist employs written
characters to record his own name exclusively ; omitting at the same
 time to convey that of the person represented.        Of this omission, both
 in painting and sculpture, ancient and modern, John Evelyn, in his
 'Sculptura,' very justly complains.
       Inscriptions and coats of arms also frequently occur upon painted
 portraits ; these, it need hardly be stated, when genuine, are of the
 greatest possible service.
       But it is not always that they can be relied upon. As the artist
 himself must necessarily have delayed introducing them till the picture
 was completely finished, they rarely appear as if thoroughly incorporated
 or harmonized with the rest of the colours. This circumstance has been
 particularly favourable to the addition by subsequent fabricators of dates,
 combined with armorial bearings, and promoted the forgery of some
  recognisable signatures upon them.
       There are, however, safe and sure tests by which these frauds may be
  detected.     Genuine old colour, that has remained on a panel or canvas
  for centuries, acquires a surprising degree of hardness, sufficient at least
  to resist the application of solvents that would disturb and carry away
  upon the slightest touch a considerable body of modern or comparatively
  new paint.      I have myself seen masses of colour swept off from a
  picture by similar applications, revealing immediately the genuine old
  painting beneath, and in all its original purity.
        The ingenious manner in which names and dates have been
   tampered    with, would form an amusing although not very credit
  able chapter in the history of art.       Engravings also are liable to a
  similar amount of alteration.        Occasionally, when the demand for a
   portrait has unexpectedly ceased, the engraver has found it expedient
   to alter the head to that of some more popular person, leaving the rest
   of the plate untouched, and, by at the same time changing the title
   below, to derive advantage from the sudden production of an apparent
   novelty.     Many plates thus altered are well known.         A harmless
   instance may here be cited in Elstracke's early portrait of Whittington,
   Lord Mayor of London, where, in accordance with the taste of the day,
   the artist had represented    him as resting his hand on a skull.     This
   failing  to take with   the  public, induced the engraver to change the

  skull into a cat, after which, judging by the very worn state of some
  of the impressions, the print met with a very large circulation.*
        The following plates were altered both in faces and figures as far
  as appeared necessary to suit the writing : —
        Queen Elizabeth on her throne in Parliament, to James             I.

 William      III.
       King Christian IV. of Denmark, into Oliver Cromwell.
        The following   changes are instances of the fraudulent practices and
 are intended      to put the unwary on their guard.             In these cases the
 inscriptions    alone  have been    altered  ; the  face in each  instance remain
 ing perfectly     the same  : —
        David    Nuyts, by Suyderhoff, became afterwards Sir Hugh
  Myddleton.
       Archbishop Leighton, of the time of Charles I., became Rev. John
 Horne, parson of Brentford (Horne Tooke).
        Coleridge, the poet, became Lord Cochrane.
        Mr. Incledon, the singer, as Captain Macheath, became Greenacre,
 the murderer, in Newgate.
        Mrs. Humphrey, wife of an engraver, became successively Mrs.
 Fitzherbert and Caroline Princess of Wales.
       Mr. Pond, son of a horsedealer, became Peter Pindar.
       Another important means towards detecting error in the names and
  offices of persons represented in portraiture, may be derived from the
 study of costume.       This, if associated with a general knowledge of the
 various styles of art at different periods, will generally lead to a satis
 factory conclusion.       In nearly all cases, painters unconsciously repre
 sented historical characters and events, however remote the times may
 have been, in dresses and ornaments peculiar to their own day.                Even
 when some deviation was attempted, as in the portraits of our earliest
 kings, some minor details, such as the form of cap, feather, construction
of armour, buckles, or details of ornament, will be found to betray the
 real time when the painting was made.
       It is in this manner that portraits called Rosamond Clifford, orna
mented with lace cap and ruff, and Queen Elizabeth and Queen Mary
as little girls in the costume of young ladies of the seventeenth cen
tury, lose all claim on our acceptance.
       Foreign portraits occasionally have been mistaken for English
ones. Thus, the ' Three Children of Christian II., King of Denmark,'
at Hampton Court Palace, were named by Vertue, and engraved by
him as, the 'Three Children of King Henry VII. of England.'                     Un
fortunately, the figure of the eldest boy in this group has been copied
   * For this, and
                    many of the following instances, I am indebted to the experience

 ber, Westminster, under the denomination of ' Arthur, Prince of

       A second instance of misapplied foreign portraiture occurs in the
 same apartment, where a full-length figure, inscribed with the name,
 and invested by the copyist with the arms of Queen Anne Boleyn, is
 in reality Anne, Queen of Hungary and Bohemia, sister-in-law of the
 Emperor Charles V. The execution of the portrait from which this
 copy had been taken was evidently German. The picture was genuine
 in itself; but there were dates upon it that could not possibly be
 made to accord with facts in English history ; whereas, when applied
 to Mary of Hungary, everything agrees perfectly.
       If, on the one hand, a rigorous investigation of the contents of
 many picture galleries in venerable mansions, may occasionally have the
 effect of depriving a portrait of lofty claims both as regards subject
 and on the ground of artistic merit ; on the other hand, cases must also
occur in which works of genuine value that had fallen into neglect,
 whether from accident, caprice, or dis-esteem,are rescued from unmerited
 oblivion, and gain reinstalment in the position due to them.                The
fine cartoon, by Holbein, of King Henry VIII. and his Father, hitherto
undervalued, had, till recently, been hung at a great height on an
obscure wall in the lofty hall at Hardwick.              It has now been for
warded to the great Exhibition at South Kensington.
       A portrait of a lady, in an anteroom at Windsor Castle, and
 inscribed on the frame ' Unknown,'          I  have recently had the satisfac
tion of assigning to ' Christina, Duchess of Milan,' the lady to
 whom Henry VIII. offered his hand in marriage, and who sent him
 the memorable message in reply, that ''as she had only one head she
 could not oblige him."           This little picture proved, on further inves
 tigation,   to  be the  one   painted in the short space of three hours by
 Holbein, at Brussels, whither he had been despatched by the king
for that express purpose in 1538.*
       The valuable drawings by Holbein, studies of the heads of the
chief nobility and most eminent persons about the court of Henry VIII.,
 were subjects deserving of the most careful study.                   They were
admirably preserved, and had recently gained much of their original
 freshness by judicious cleaning, and by being remounted on separate
sheets, under the scrupulous care of the librarian at Windsor.            Several
of the names could still be traced on them in early characters ; but
a more recent hand, probably that of Vertue, had inserted larger
and not always suitable names and titles in golden letters, which
maintained an undue prominence. Thus, many of the persons be
longing to the family of Sir Thomas More, who formed subjects

the young lady betrothed to his son.                The figure called ' Lady
Henegham,' closely resembles that of Margaret Roper, in Holbein's
original sketch for the subject, still preserved at Basle.          Instances of
this nature may not unfairly be ranked under the denomination of
curiosities as well as fallacies.
      Large private collections of portraits exist in this country, but they
can only be seen under circumstances of considerable difficulty.               The
establishment of a National Portrait Gallery          — founded  in  1857   at  the
instance     of Earl Stanhope — cannot fail to become a source of
pleasure and instruction to multitudes, and, in proportion as the collec
tion increases, to afford extensive facilities for study and comparison,
 wherein the chief benefit of such an institution will consist.         In 1820
 the British Institution first afforded the public an insight into some of
 the portrait treasures hitherto known only by means of Houbraken's
beautiful, although not always accurate or authentic, engravings.
 Above 183 of the finest and most genuine portraits were then collected
for exhibition in I'all Mall.•
      In 1846 the experiment was repeated with a greater number of
 portraits, but not with commensurate success.
      The most striking collection of this nature hitherto seen, was the
 extensive Portrait Gallery formed in the central nave of the Manchester
 Exhibition, in 1857.       Under the able management of Mr. Peter Cun
 ningham, 400 portraits, exclusive of miniatures and full-lengths in
 he ancient and modern picture galleries, were there collected and
judiciously arranged.
      Great expectation is now naturally raised by the preparation of a
 portrait exhibition on a vast scale at the South Kensington Museum,
 under the presidency and powerful interest of the Earl of Derby.
      The present discourse, being in a great measure only an introductory
 lecture to a short course announced to be given about the middle of the
 following month, all special investigation of the portraits of Mary
     * The publication of Lodge's ' Portraits of Illustrious Personages of Great
 Hritain,' in 1821-34, formed in itself a marked era in our acquaintance with
 historical portraits. With the exception, perhaps, of Queen Catharine Parr, John
Knox, and Lord Falkland, they were almost all taken from the best sources, and
the inscriptions upon the plates generally stated the name of the artist, when
known, and the locality from which each portrait had been taken.

                       On the Metamorphoses             of Insects.
The     subkingdom Annulosa, to which insects belong, is divided into
five classes, namely, Annelida, Crustacea, Arachnida,                         Myriapoda,
 Insecta.
     The Annelida, or worms, have a body consisting of more or less
 numerous segments, but without any jointed appendages.
     The Crustacea, or crabs and lobsters, have a jointed body, and each
segment usually bears a pair of appendages.                      They are aquatic in
their habits.
     The Arachnida, or spiders, possess four pairs of legs ; the body is
divided into two parts, the cephalothorax and abdomen.                          The seg
ments composing the abdomen bear no appendages.                        Spiders are  aerial
in their habits.
     The Myriapoda, or centipedes, have a long body consisting of
numerous segments, each of which bears a pair of legs.
     The Insecta, or insects, have three pairs of legs. They are aerial
 in habits, and breathe by means of tracheae or air-tubes, which ramify
throughout the internal organs.             The body is divided into three parts,
the head, thorax, and abdomen.
     In addition to the three pairs of legs, the thorax bears generally
either two or four wings.          The older naturalists collected the wingless
forms into a special order — the Aptera ; but more extended observa
 tions have shown that each of the large orders or groups into which
insects are divided contain some apterous forms.                     The female glow
worm and the working ants are familiar examples of this.
     But though the presence of wings is the rule, and the division of
 insects into orders is founded in great measure on the characters
afforded by these important organs, still they are present only in the
 mature state of the animal, and no known insect is born with wings.
     Not only in the absence of wings, but also generally in many other
important points, the young insect differs from the mature form, and

  552                            Sir John   Lubbock                    [March   9,
   the   changes which it goes through are known as metamorphoses.
   Entomologists have generally considered the life of all insects to be
   divisible into four well-marked periods — that of the egg ; the larva
   or caterpillar ; the pupa or chrysalis ; and, finally, the imago or per
   fect insect. It is true that in some orders, as, for instance, the Coleop-
   tera (beetles), Hymenoptera (bees), Lepidoptera (butterflies),             and
   Diptera (flies), the larvae differ much more from the perfect insects
   than is the case in others, as, for instance, the Orthoptera (grasshoppers),
  or Heteroptera (bugs) ; but even in these latter the stages were still
  supposed to be well marked — that of the larva, by the entire absence of
   wings ; that of the pupa, by the possession of rudimentary wings ;
  finally, the perfect insect, by having perfect wings.
       The lecturer then pointed out that, when the habits were alike,
  similar larvae might be met with in very different families of insects.
  Thus, among beetles, the Melolontha (cockchafer), Anobium (death-
  watch), and Chlamys;are very similar in their larva state, although they
  belong to perfectly distinct families of beetles, namely, the Melolon-
  thidae, Ptinidae, and Chrysomelidae.
       The same fact holds good even in larvae belonging to different
  orders of insects.     Those larvse which, in the words of Mr. Herbert
  Spencer, are " symmetrically related to the environment," and which
  either are surrounded by their food, or which have it brought to them,
  are fat, legless, fleshy grubs or maggots.       Such are almost all the larvae
  of flies. So again, the Hymenopterous larvae are generally of this cha
  racter ; whether they inhabit other insects, like those of the ichneu
  mons ; or live inside galls, like those of the Cynipidae ; or are enclosed
  in cells and fed by the perfect insects, like those of the bees ; practi
  cally any great deviation from that which may be looked upon as the
  normal type, is unnecessary.          The larvae of beetles, on the contrary,
  are generally of a very different character.         But there is one group,
  that of the weevils, which are internal         feeders.  The grub of a nut-
  weevil feeding    inside a nut,  is under  very  similar conditions to those of
 a Cynips-larva in a gall, or an Anthrax-larva living parasitically in a
 bee's cell, and we accordingly find that these larvae, though belonging
 to three different orders of insects, very closely resemble one another.
       To this type belong most Hymenopterous larva) ; but there are two
 exceptional groups, the Tenthrediuidae, or sawflies, and the Siricidre.
 The larvae of the Tenthredinidae feed, like those of butterflies, on leaves,
 and in the general form of the body, in the possession of three pairs of
 legs and several pairs of abdominal prolegs, they very closely resemble
 ordinary caterpillars, and differ extremely from the ordinary type of
Hymenopterous larvae. In the same manner the larvae of the Siricidte,
which are wood-borers, possess thoracic legs, and closely resemble the
larva; of some wood-boring beetles.
      From these facts it may be concluded that the form of a larva depends
more on the conditions in which it lives than on the form which it will
ultimately assume.        But this is shown still more clearly in the case of
Sitaris, a small beetle which is parasitic on a species of solitary bee

(Anthophora), and         the habits of which have been carefully observed
and excellently described by a French naturalist, M. Fabre.                    The
female Sitaris, which comes to maturity in August, never wanders far
away from the sandy banks in which the Anthophora loves to burrow.
At that time no Anthophoras are abroad, their period of maturity is not
in autumn, but in spring, and consequently, though the bee is so
necessary to the beetle, we are at once met with the remarkable fact
that no perfect Sitaris ever saw one of the bees, and it is probable that
no Anthophora has ever yet seen a Sitaris.             The latter lays her eggs,
which are about 2500 in number, in the burrow leading to the cell
of the Anthophora. These eggs are hatched in September, and produce
small, black, active larva-, about 1-25 of an inch in length, with four
eyes, two rather long antennae, and six well-formed legs.              But though
evidently adapted for an active life the young larva? remain quiet among
their empty egg-shells until the spring. Then the Anthophora comes
to maturity, and as it passes out along the burrow the young larvre
spring upon it.          The male bees, however, leave their cells about
a month before the females ; consequently the larva first finds itself
on the male bee, from which, however, at the first opportunity it
passes to the female.         She, poor thing, unconscious of her misfortune,
proceeds    to  excavate     her  burrow in the usual manner, constructs the
usual cell, and fills it with honey.         On the honey she lays her egg, but
at this moment the larva of Sitaris springs on to the egg and floats on              it,
 as on   araft.     It then tears open the egg and devours          it,
                                                                     thus at once
 destroying   a  rival, and making its first meal.       As    ithas by this time
 been seven months without food, this its first food must be very wel
 come.     But     it  necessary on another account.
                        is                                   The larva in its first
 form, though beautifully fitted for its mode of life,          quite unsuited to
                                                               is
 live on honey in bee's cell.
                         a             Hence   a  change of form          is
                                                                        necessary.
 The increase of size produced by devouring the egg enables the larva
 to change its skin, and         now emerges in
                                it                  aform very different indeed
 from the last.       The eyes have disappeared, the legs and antennae are
 rudimentary.        The mouth         so placed that when the larva floats on
                                      is
 the honey    it    just below the surface, while the spiracles are arranged
                   is
 along the back so as to be just above it.         Lastly, the belly     very pro
                                                                          is
 tuberant, and thus prevents the larva from rolling, in which case the
 spiracles might be choked by the honey, and the insect suffocated.
 After living from thirty-five to forty days               this condition, during
                                                          in
 which   it  increases very considerably in size, the larva ceases to feed,
 and contracts into an ovoid body, resembling in many respects the so-
 called pupa of         fly.
                        a        Within this, as in   acase,    forms
                                                               it        new skin,
                                                                          a
 and takes on      a fourth form not very unlike the second.        After four or
  five weeks   it   changes again into     a  chrysalis, from which finally the
  perfect beetle emerges.
      Here then we find, firstly, remarkable change of form accompany
                                       a
  ing change of habits, and secondly, case in which the life

  into more than three well-marked stages.            This phenomenon received
  from M. Fabre the name of Hypermetamorphosis.                    For some time

   the cases of Sitaris and Meloe were looked on a- exceptional ; but in 1862
   the attention of the lecturer was called to the question by observing a
   somewhat similar case in Lonchoptera, a genus of small flies.             More
   over, he found that in many species belonging to the Orthoptera and
   Hemiptera the stages were much less definite and more gradual than had
   hitherto been supposed.
         In illustration of this he described the transformations of Chloeon
    (Ephemeridae), and showed that the perfect form was attained through
    more than twenty changes of skin, each attended by a slight change of
   form. In its preparatory stages this insect lives in the water, but in the last
   two it becomes aerial. Sir John Lubbock had been so fortunate as to see
   more than once the passage from the aquatic to the aerial condition ;
   the larva floated helplessly on the surface of the water, suddenly the
   skin burst, the insect sprang out of the back of its own head and fluttered
   away. The whole process occupied less than ten seconds.
         The speaker in this case wished particularly to impress on his
   hearers, firstly, the gradual nature of the changes, and secondly, that
   some of them have no reference to the form of the perfect insect, but
   are entirely of an adaptational character.           Thus, the young larva is
   born without branchiae, and with two caudal appendages.              It gradu
   ally acquires a thin tail and seven pairs of branchiae, but the perfect
   insect has only two tails and no branchiae.           Thus, then, the changes
   which an insect undergoes are of two kinds, developmental and adap
   tational.
        External forces act upon the larvae as much as on the perfect
  insects.      And we can thus understand the remarkable fact that some
  animals, which differ much when young, are very similar at maturity.
        The speaker then entered into some theoretical considerations as
  to the nature and causes of metamorphoses, dividing the subject into
  three questions.
        Istly. How these changes of form might have originated.
        2ndly. Why they are, in insects, so abrupt in their character ; and
        3rdly. Why the pupa condition, a period of approximate immobility,
 should intervene between the active larva, and the still more active
  imago.
        1. The changes of form depend on the early condition at which
 some insects quit the egg.           There is reason to believe that all insects
 pass through the stage of fat, fleshy grubs, and subsequently acquire
 legs.*      Some, however, are hatched in the first state, while others
 remain in the egg until they attain the second.             In the former case
 additional changes are produced by the fact that external forces do not
affect the larva in the same manner as the perfect insect ; and thus
there is a tendency to still greater differentiation.
     2. The abruptness of the change is more apparent than real.              The
actual change itself is merely the withdrawal of the curtain, the casting

 of the old skin, by which the alterations which have perhaps been in
 preparation for days or even weeks, are rendered visible.    In fact, there
 can be no great change in insects without a moult.       Insects have no
 bones, and the muscles are attached to the skin, which therefore is
 necessarily hardened to afford them a solid and sufficient fulcrum.
 But it follows from this that no change of form can take place without
 a change of skin.
     In Chloeon we have seen that each moult is accompanied by a slight
 change.
     In caterpillars, on the contrary, there is little alteration during
growth, and the changes are concentrated, so to say, on the last two
moults.      The advantage of this is obvious ; the mouth, digestive,
and other organs of the larva are very different from those of the perfect
insect ; and if the change from the one type to the other were gradual
and slow, the insect would be liable to perish of starvation in the midst
of plenty.
     3. Similar considerations throw much light on the immobility of
the pupa.     The organs are altering so rapidly that they are unable to
perform their functions.       When the changes are gradual, as in
Orthoptera, &c., there is no period of quiescence.
     The speaker then pointed out the analogy between metamorphoses
and the alternation of generations.
     Many species of the lower animals are represented by two totally
dissimilar forms; but, so far as the speaker knew, no explanation of
this remarkable phenomenon had yet been given.
     Through the metamorphoses of insects, however, we get a clue.
When an animal is born in a state so early, that external forces act on
it in one way, and on the perfect form in another, they tend to produce
greater and greater differences between the two. As long as the
external organs arrive at their mature form before the generative
organs are fully developed, we have cases of metamorphosis ; but if the
reverse is the case, then alternation of generations is the result.
     The same considerations explain why in alternation of generations
the reproduction is almost invariably agamic in the one form.       This is
because impregnation requires the perfection both of external and
internal organs ; and if the phenomenon arises, as has just been sug
gested, from the fact that the internal organs arrive at maturity before
the external ones, impregnation cannot take place, and reproduction
will only result in those species which have the power of agamic multi
plication.
     However this may be, insects offer every gradation between simple
growth and that phenomenon which is known as alternation of genera
tions.
     In the wingless Orthoptera, the young so closely resemble the
perfect insects, that there is nothing which in ordinary language would
be called even a metamorphosis.
     In those Orthoptera which eventually acquire wings, there is of course
a well-marked difference.

556                          Sir John Lubbock                       [March    9,
    In Chloeon, though the changes are gradual, the difference between
the larva and the imago is very considerable, and we have seen that
the action of external forces produces changes which have no reference
to the form of the perfect insect.
    In caterpillars we have a typical class of metamorphoses.
    Until recently, however, we knew of no case in which a larva pro
duced more than one perfect insect.*     Insects never multiply by buds,
and almost always the external form is acquired before the organs of
reproduction are mature. Recently, however, Professor Wagner of
Kasan has discovered that the larvae of certain Cecidomyias have the
faculty of producing other larvae, so that they present a true case of
alternation of generations. Thus, then, we see that insects present
every gradation from growth to alternation of generations ; we see how,
from a single fact, metamorphoses and alternate generations may have
originated, and we find reason to suppose that in the course of time the
latter phenomenon may become more frequent than it is at present.
     Itis,  moreover, evident that there are in the animal and vegetable
kingdoms two kinds of Dimorphism.              The term has generally been
applied   to those  cases in which  — as in the ant and bee, in animals, and
the Primulas among plants — the perfect individuals are divided into two
forms. In fact, the sexes themselves constitute        kind of Dimorphism.
                                                       a
In these cases the forms are not alternate. When, however, external
forces act on the young in one manner, and on the mature form in
another, they tend to produce different forms, which do not complement,
but succeed, one another.    I     have elsewhere proposed to distinguish
this form of dimorphism, under the name of Dieidism or Polyeidism.
In Polymorphism the chain of being divides at the extremity               ; in
Polyeidism   it  consists of dissimilar links.

adaptational.
     " 3. That the apparent abruptness of the changes which they
undergo arises in great measure from the hardness of their skin, which
permits no gradual alteration of form, and which            isitself rendered
necessary in order to afford sufficient support to the muscles.

rapidity of the changes going on in it.

        6. That the form of the larva of each species depends in great
measure on the conditions in which it lives.
     " When an animal is hatched from the egg in an immature form,
the external forces acting upon it are different from those which affect
the mature form, and thus changes are produced in the young, bearing
reference to its present wants rather than to its ultimate form.

the organs of reproduction are matured, these changes are known as
metamorphoses ; when, on the contrary, the organs of reproduction are
functionally perfect before the external organs, or when the creature
has the power of budding, then the phenomenon            is known as alter
nation of generations.
     " Insects present every gradation, from simple growth to alternation
of generations.
     " 8. Thus, then, it appears probable that this remarkable phe
nomenon may have arisen from the simple circumstance that certain
animals leave the egg at a very early stage of development : and that
the external forces acting on the young are different from those which
affect the mature form.
     " 9. The dimorphism thus produced differs in many important
respects from the dimorphism of the mature form which we find, for
instance, in the ants and bees ; and it would therefore be convenient
to distinguish it by a different name.
      "But there is still another aspect under which, if time had per
mitted, the metamorphoses         of insects might have been regarded.
In one or two cases, indeed,       I  have sketched   very briefly and im
perfectly the habits and mode of life of particular insects.       A whole
course of lectures might be filled with such life histories.    The various
manners in which different insects provide for the wants of their young
are most remarkable ; and all the more so because these wants are so
different from those of the perfect insects themselves.
      " Thus, the butterfly which lives on honey, and did live on leaves,
lays her eggs on a twig.       She seems to feel that honey will not suit
her young, and that the leaves will wither and fall before another spring
comes round.
     " The gnat, which lives in the air and feeds on blood, lays her eggs
on the surface of water ; and the sugar-loving housefly knows that
very different food is necessary for her young.
     " The nut-weevil chooses the embryo of the nut ; the goat-moth the
bark of the willow ; the Rhipiphora braves the dangers of the wasp's
nest; die (Kstrus lays on cattle; the Ichneumon in caterpillars; the
gall-fly in the still almost imperceptible bud ; and some insects even
in the eggs   of others.
      " Generally,  the larvre forage for themselves ; but, in some cases,
the mother supplies her young with food.           Thus, the solitary wasp
builds a cell and fills it with other insects. If, however, she imprisoned
them while alive, their struggles would infallibly destroy her egg ;
 if she killed them, they would soon decay, and the young larva, when

hatched, would find, instead of a store of wholesome food, a mere mass
of corruption.     To avoid these two evils, the wasp stings her victim
in such a manner as to pierce the centre of the nervous system, and
the poison has the quality of paralyzing the victim without killing it.
Thus deprived of all power of movement, but still alive, it remains
some weeks motionless and yet fresh.

their young, they build houses, they make wars, they keep slaves, they
have domestic animals, and it is even said that in some cases they
cultivate the ground.
     " Nor must it be supposed that even now the habits of insects are
anything like thoroughly known to us. In spite of Reaumur and De
Geer, the two Hubers, and many other excellent observers, there is in
this subject still a wide field for patient and conscientious labour ;
the observations already made have been far from exhausting the

    SIR HJSNRY HOLLAND,        BART. M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. President,
                                in the Chair.
                      BALFOUR    STEWART, Esq.    F.R.S.
        On the Existence   of a Material Medium pervading Space.
 The question, whether interstellar       and interplanetary    space is a
 plenum or a vacnum, has for a long time engaged the attention of the
 scientific world.
     As we can hold no communication with these distant regions, except
 through the light which reaches us, it is to this agent we must look to
 enable us to answer this question directly or indirectly, either from its
 own properties and nature, or from its faculty of revealing to us the
 position and motion of the heavenly bodies, or from both of these
 together.
     This twofold aspect of the problem gives rise to the following
questions   : —
     Question first. — Does the nature of light and radiant heat induce us
to believe that space is a plenum or a vacuum ?

  1866.]           of a Material Medium pervading Space.                   559
     Question second. — Is there anything in the motions of the heavenly
 bodit-s that gives us any information on this point?
     These two questions comprise the observational evidence on the
 subject.
      By observational, as distinguished from experimental, we mean
 evidence derived from a region where we may observe what is going
 on, but into which we cannot transport ourselves so as to make any
 experiments ; besides this evidence we may moreover make experiments
 on the surface of the earth in our laboratories, and derive from these
 experiments a certain amount of information bearing upon our question.
     We have thus altogether three sources of evidence.
     First. — Evidence derived from the nature of light and heat.
     Second. — Evidence derived from the motion of the heavenly bodies.
     Third.— Experiments made on the surface of the earth.
     Possibly also the force of gravitation which is exercised by bodies
at a distance, and the connection between solar spots and terrestrial
 magnetism, discovered by General Sabine, imply the existence of an
 interplanetary medium ; but it is better to confine ourselves to light and
 heat, which differ from other influences in this respect.     We know that
 light and heat travel with a certain velocity, and we can suppose, as it
 were, a slice of light to be cut off half-way between the sun and the earth ;
 here then we have a certain amount of energy neither in the sun nor in
the earth, but half-way between ; we cannot, however, at present, make
any such assertion with regard to gravity or magnetic action.
     To begin with the evidence derived from the nature of light and
heat.
     It is supposed by some (or rather perhaps it has been supposed, for
the   advocates of this theory are dying out) that light consists of
exceedingly small particles which are projected            into space by a
luminous body on all sides, particles having different properties, but all
of which,    nevertheless, pass through interplanetary space with the same
enormous velocity of 190,000 miles per second.          On the other hand it
is supposed that light consists in the transmission of some sort of motion
of a medium pervading all space.
     The difference between these two hypotheses may be explained in a
very few words.
     The theory of emission supposes the transit of an individual particle
from the luminous body to the eye; the theory of undulation or similar
theory, on the other hand, merely supposes the progressive motion of a
state of displacement between the luminous body and the eye.           (Illus
trated by an experiment.)
     Thus, according to the former theory, each ray of light which
passes between the sun and the earth is equivalent to the bodily trans
mission of a set of particles 90,000,000 of miles ; while, according to the
theory of undulation, the greatest amount of relative displacement of
the ether whose vibrations form this ray, is probably much less than
the millionth of an inch.

560              Mr. Balfour Stewart,     on the Existence    [March   16,
     Now,   the difference between these two modes of viewing light as
concerns   our subject is this : —
     The existence of an ethereal medium does not appear to be insepa
rably connected with the first theory or that of emission.       The two
ideas may be held and have been held together, but they do not appear
to be inseparably connected ; on the other hand, if light and heat con
sist of the transmission of some sort of motion of a medium pervading
space, we have to start at once with the hypothesis of such a medium.
Hooke and Huyghens were the scientific authors of the undulatory
theory of light, while Newton, on the other hand, was the great
advocate of the theory of emission.
     The scientific repute of Newton seems to have retarded the pro
gress of the undulatory theory for nearly a century ; but of late years it
has been revived and extended in this country by Young, whose name
is inseparably connected with the Royal Institution, and in France by
the illustrious Fresnel.    It is only by an appeal to experiment that we
can decide between the claims of these two rival theories, and we have
to ask ourselves which best accords with the phenomena of optics.
     First of all, if we assume the hypothesis of emission, it is not easy
to conceive why the luminiferous particles discharged by so many dif
ferent kinds of bodies should all pass through space with precisely the
same velocity. In order to escape from this difficulty, it was suggested
by Arago that particles may be originally projected with different
velocities, but that there is only one of these which is adapted to our
organs of vision. This, however, is a very lame explanation, and the
necessity for such explanations is one of the characteristics of a bad
hypothesis. For if a theory be good, it is wonderful how many facts it
will account for without any additional assumption, but a bad hypo
thesis requires to start an additional assumption for almost every new
fact, until at length some one arises which cannot be won over by even
this method, and so the hypothesis fails.
     In the next place, it is difficult to conceive why particles, even
although exceedingly small, moving with such enormous velocity,
should not inflict on us terrific blows on account of their momentum ;
and it has been calculated that if the weight of a molecule of light
amounted to but one grain, its momentum would equal that of a cannon
ball 150 pounds in weight moving with a velocity of 1000 feet per
second.
     Even although a molecule of light should be many million times
smaller than this, its momentum would still be sensible ; and as mil
lions of millions must enter the eye every instant from every visible
 point of every visible body, we should be pounded to atoms.
     A good many years ago, Mr. Bennet made some experiments on
 this point. A slender straw was suspended horizontally by means of a
 spider's thread, and to one end of this lever a small piece of white
 paper was attached, and the whole was enclosed in an exhausted
 receiver of glass, while the sun's rays, concentrated by a large lens,

1866.]              of a Material Medium pervading Space.                             561
were allowed to fall on one side of this paper ; but they did not twist
round the lever in the least.
      The advocates of the theory of emission may perhaps, however,
suppose that they are entitled to make the light molecules, and hence
their momentum, as small as they choose, and of course, if this be
allowed, even the most delicate experiment will not be decisive. But
a short explanation will show that they are not entitled to make the
momentum of a ray of light as small as they choose, but that the
theory of the conservation of energy which has been elaborated by
Grove, Joule, Thomson, and others, and is now universally accepted,
determines this momentum.
      Of course one who denies the undulatory hypothesis may, at the
same time, deny the conservation of energy — we have nothing to say
to such an one ; but we think it can be proved that one cannot at the
same time hold both the theory of emission and the theory of the
conservation of energy.
      In order to show this, let us suppose that such a man exists,
believing the theory of the conservation of energy, but denying the
undulatory hypothesis, and advocating in its stead the theory of
emission. Now, in the first place, the amount of momentum or the
blow which a body is capable of giving must be distinguished from
the energy which it possesses. Thus, if we fire a rifle-bullet so as strike
an iron target (swung by a string) and lodge in              it,
                                                               this target or pen
dulum will be swung to       a     side on account of the momentum or blow
of the ball. But as far as momentum              is    concerned, when       rifle
                                                                             a         is
discharged, action and reaction are equal, so that the momentum of the
 ball is   no greater than that of the recoiling rifle; and hence, if the
 rifle were swung, attached to another pendulum, the recoil of the rifle
 would produce the same effect as the ball in the first pendulum.
(Illustrated by an experiment with small cannon.)
                                          a
      But the ball does something more than swing the pendulum,                  ulti
                                                                                 it
 mately heats  it  ;     and, in fact, this amount of heating forms very much
the energy of the ball.
      Now energy       is     known to be proportional to the momentum or
 blow multiplied by the velocity, and hence             it   isowing to its high
 velocity that a     rifle-ball possesses so much energy.       Let us now return
 to Ilciirii it's experiment, in which   a     powerful beam of light was made
 to strike a      piece of paper fastened to the end of        a  straw, delicately
 suspended in the centre by a spider's thread.              By the theory of the
 conservation of energy, we know that the energy of the light and heat
 which strike the paper in one minute, will, just as in the case of the
 rifle-ball, be represented    by    the whole heating effect produced.
      Now we can roughly estimate this heating effect, and we can
 therefore find the amount of energy produced by these rays in one
 minute, and knowing the amount of energy, we can tell at once the
 blow multiplied       by    the velocity to which the energy      is proportional.
 We therefore know the blow multiplied             by   the velocity of the light,
 but we also know the velocity      ;     hence, dividing the first     by
                                                                        the second,

562                       Mr. Balfour Stewart,     on the Existence       [March        16,
we   know the blow which the light ought to produce in this arrange
ment,  if we suppose the theory of emission to be true. By a rough
calculation it may be shown that the blow ought to be.sensible, but
Bennet found it to be insensible, hence we argue that the theory of
emission is not true.
    The experiment performed by MM. Foucault and Fizeau was then
described.   This experiment proves that light travels slower in water
than in air, and this result is also in favour of the undulatory theory,
but against that of emission.
    Finally it was stated, that a great number of beautiful and
interesting optical experiments can be explained with the greatest ease
by the theory of undulations. (Through the kindness of Professor
Tyndall a selection of these was exhibited.)
    All these various proofs are in favour of the undulatory theory of
light, and we have therefore great reason to believe in its truth, and,
believing in     we are compelled also to believe in the existence of
                         it,                                                             a
material medium in which these undulations may take place.
    We now come to discuss the second branch of our subject, or the
evidence derived from the motions of the heavenly bodies, and as yet
there    only one of these that has afforded us evidence of the existence
          is
of   an ethereal medium.
      In November,    1818, M. Pons, in Marseilles, discovered      comet,  a
 which M. Encke, in Berlin, after calculating its elements, found to be
 identical with the comets seen in 1786, 1795, and 1805. In comparing
 the different observations, he immediately noticed     steady decrease in
                                                               a
the duration of the comet's revolution.    M. Encke conceived that some
permanently retarding force must influence the motion of the comet                       ;
but the nature of that force would only be cleared up                 by
                                                               continuous
and very carefully conducted observations       at each return.     Conse
quently, in 1819, he called the attention of astronomers to this comet;
but the whole of the subsequent observations, and the calculations
founded upon them, were not discussed until forty years had elapsed.
M. Encke, in his first discussion, obtained the following results —            :
     (a.)      It
                impossible by the laws of planetary motion to explain the

motion of this comet.
     (b.l The whole period of revolution has been shortened since the
first observation in 1786 by two days and eight hours, which, in pro
portion to its small period of revolution (about 1210 days),       far too is
large an amount to ascribe      to imperfections of the observations or of
                                     it

     (c.) The amount of decrease       at each revolution constantly the
                                              is
same, and so regularly observed at each return of the comet to
its perihelion that not the least doubt now exists as to the fact
itself.
      (</.)    The mathematical consideration of
                                              the nature of the retarding
force shows     to be entirely

 filling all space, and producing effects analogous to those observed on
our earth. This is, says M. Encke, not an artificial assumption,
but the force is immediately suggested from the nature of its effects.
       An experiment made by the speaker in conjunction with Professor
Tait was then described.       This experiment was carried out by means
of an ingenious mechanical contrivance invented and made by Mr.
 Beckley, of the Kew Observatory.        The object of the experiment was
to produce very rapid rotation in vacuo.        This was accomplished by
carrying    a  slowly revolving   iron shaft  up a barometer tube ; at the
top of this tube there was a large receiver, which might be considered
analogous to the vacuum of a barometer, with the exception that it
was exhausted by an air-pump, and not by the Torricellian process.
In this receiver, by means of multiplying gear connected with the
shaft, an aluminium disk, 13 inches in diameter and ^ith of an
inch in thickness, was made to revolve with great velocity.       When it
was kept for 30 seconds at the full speed of 83 revolutions in a second,
this disk was found to become heated nearly 1° Fahr., and this heating
was independent both of the density and chemical constitution of the
residual air of the vacuum.
      The disk was insulated from its bearings by a piece of ebonite, so
that very little heat could be conveyed from the bearings to the disk;
besides, an experiment made by artificially heating the spindle showed
that the effect observed could not be due to heating of the disk by the
bearings.     This heating effect, it was believed, was not due to rotation
under the earth's magnetic force, nor to vibration of the disk ; but the
experiment was not quite finished : in the meantime, the evidence that
it could not be explained by any known cause was very considerable,
so that perhaps an explanation may be sought for in a resisting
medium which we cannot get rid of.

 On    the existence in the textures of Animals        of   a     Fluorescent
                   substance closely resembling Quinine.
WHEN     I last year brought to your notice the fact that " a single dose
of lithium in a few minutes passes, through the circulation, into all the
ducts, and into every particle of the body, and even into the parts most
distant from the blood circulation, and when I showed you that it
remains there for a much longer time than it took to get into the
textures (probably for three or four days, varying with the quantity
taken), and that then it diminishes, and finally, in six, seven, or eight
days, the whole quantity is thrown out of the body,"      I   little expected
that by prosecuting an investigation into this chemical circulation in
the body    I should come upon that discovery which forms the title for
this evening's discourse.
     No imagination could have anticipated that this line of research
into the rate of passage of substances into and out of the textures would
lead to the supposition that man and all animals possess, in every part
of the body, the most characteristic peculiarity of the bark of the
cinchona trees of Peru.
     After determining the rate of passage of lithia and other mineral
matters into and out of the body, Dr. Dupre and I proceeded to
endeavour to trace the rate of passage of quinine into and out of the
textures of animals.
     We chose quinine because of that splendid test which led Professor
Stokes to the discovery of the change of refrangibility of light.
     Here, for example, are different solutions of quinine of different
strengths, and by means of the production of fluorescence in the electric
light, you see how we can determine which of these solutions contains
the greatest quantity of quinine ; and by forming standard solutions it
would be easy to measure how much quinine existed in each of these
solutions. Moreover, Professor Stokes discovered that when a solution
of common salt was added to this quinine solution, the fluorescence
entirely disappeared.     Though this may be so for sun light, it does not
disappear in this electric light ; and, moreover, on adding a solution of
sulphate of soda to a solution of chloride of quinine, the fluorescence in
great measure returns.

1866.]                   of Quinoidine in Animals.                           565
     Still further, Professor Stokes showed that one solution of quinine
entirely stopped these rays from passing into a second solution of the
same substance, so that you might almost tell whether you had a solu
tion of quinine by seeing whether it cut off the fluorescence from a
second solution of quinine.
     Our first object was to determine the delicacy of this reaction for
quinine.     We arrived at the following results, when the spark from a
Ruhmkorff coil was the source of light : —
Sulphate of quinine gave slight flnorescence when it6iatK, of a grain was present.
                         feeble          „
                         distinct        „
One grain of sulphate of quinine in one million eight hundred parts of
water showed the blue fluorescence distinctly in 20 grs. of the solution.
In another experiment, the same amount of quinine in one million four
hundred and forty-four parts of water showed fluorescence very dis
tinctly.
     Having thus got our test, we proceed to apply it to determine the
passage of quinine into and out of the textures of guinea-pigs.
     A guinea-pig was given quinine, and for comparison another
guinea-pig was killed at the same time, having had no quinine.
     In the pig that had taken quinine, each organ was heated in a
water-bath, with very dilute sulphuric acid. This extraction was
repeated over and over again.            The acid extracts were mixed and
filtered after cooling, neutralized with caustic soda, and repeatedly
shaken up with their own bulk of ether.                The residue left after
evaporation of the ether, was taken up by dilute sulphuric acid, filtered
and tested for fluorescence.
     The pig that had taken no quinine, had each organ treated in a
precisely similar way.      To our great disappointment, at first, we found
that not only had the pig that had taken quinine a fluorescent
substance in the textures, but that an almost exactly similar substance
was extracted from the organs of the pig that had taken no quinine.
Every texture was examined, and in every one this fluorescent
substance occurred.
     We then endeavoured, in every possible way, to find a means of
separating the natural from the induced fluorescence.             And as every
method failed, and we were compelled to recognize the close similarity
of the substance that exists in the textures to quinine itself, we for a
time dropped the original inquiry, and proceeded to a more complete
investigation of the natural fluorescent substance in animals.
     Without any preparation this substance can be shown to exist in
the living and in the dead textures.              There is one transparent
substance which is above all most suited for this inquiry.
     Here are some lenses removed from the eyes of bullocks, guinea-
pigs, and man.       You see how clear, white, and transparent these
substances   are ; and     I
                        if take a bullock's eye, which by gentle pressure
has been flattened so that the structure can be distinctly made out,

 566                Dr. H. Hence Jones     on the Existence        [March  23,
 there   is plainly no colouring matter.     As in quinine, nothing is seen
 until the blue rays of the electric light fall on the lenses ; then look at
 the splendour of the reaction.       Here, with the guinea-pig's lenses, the
 same is seen ; and here, with the flattened bullock's eye. You might be
 tempted to think that this is a post-mortem change, a result of decay ;
 but here is a fresh bullock's eye, look at this blaze of bluish-green light ;
 but still more full of suggestion is an experiment with a dilated pupil
 in a living animal or in man.       Let me show you my own eye, for in it
 you can see the lens shining with this unnatural, because unaccustomed,
 light, looking like an opaque substance, a blue green cataract.
      Life and death then have nothing to do with the existence of this
 substance ; here, it is present in the living lens ; it does not disappear
 from lenses that have been kept for months in glycerine.
       I have already said that this substance not only exists in the lens,
 but that it can be found everywhere by treating any animal substance,
 first with dilute acid, then neutralizing with alkali, and then extracting
 with ether : thus we obtain solutions having exactly the same properties
 as you see in the lens.      Here, for example, is such an extract from
 the liver.     Here, from the kidney.     Here, from the heart.     When an
 acid solution of this substance is treated with ether, no fluorescent
 substance is obtained.       First, as with quinine, the acid must be
 neutralized before this substance or the quinine can be taken up by
 the ether.
      Having then obtained these solutions, we were able to compare
 them with solutions of quinine in their actions on the spectrum.        And
 first, the solution of the natural substance begins to fluoresce a little
 before the solution of quinine ; but on carrying it on through the
 spectrum it ends where quinine ends.
      The fluorescent light of the natural substance is a little more
 greenish than the fluorescent light of quinine.
      If   a quartz cell containing this fluid is interposed     between the
 source of light and a solution of quinine, no fluorescence takes place in
 the quinine ; and    if quinine is interposed between the light and this
natural solution, scarcely any fluorescence is observed in it.
      When a solution of salt is added to the naturally fluorescing
substance, it is almost entirely destroyed, as happens with quinine.
      If  the natural solution is boiled with permanganate       of potass, it
does not lose its fluorescence, nor does quinine ; but when permanganate
with excess of alkali acts upon this substance or upon quinine, the
fluorescent substance is entirely oxidised.
      Hence this substance by the mode of its extraction and by its
remarkable action on light, is very closely related to quinine ; and
this led us to apply the chemical tests for quinine to this natural
fluorescent substance, after extraction from the body.
      The different tests for alkaloids like quinine, as morphia, strychnine
veratrine, atropine, you may see in the following reactions. First,
quinine gives, as you see, a precipitate with iodine in iodide of potassium.
Secondly, iodide of mercury in iodide of potassium also gives a precipitate.
Thirdly, phosphomolybdic acid also gives a precipitate.             Fourthly,

1866.]                  of Quinoidine in Animals.                           567
bichloride of platinum gives a precipitate.         Lastly, terchloride of gold
causes a precipitate, and this precipitate is soluble in alcohol.
     Now each and all these different reactions are obtained with these
same reagents acting on the fluorescent substance that is extracted from
animals.
     So that here again we have chemical proof that this substance is an
alkaloid, and that it, is closely related to quinine.
     We have named it Animal Quinoidine because we have not as yet
been able to crystallize it nor to obtain enough for an analysis.
     Having satisfied ourselves that an alkaline fluorescent substance
resembling quinine existed in the different textures, we endeavoured
to determine the proportion that was present in different parts. For this
purpose standard solutions of quinine of known strength were prepared,
and equal amounts of substance were treated in precisely similar ways,
and then the fluorescence was compared with the standard solutions of
quinine.     No very accurate estimations could thus be made, but
comparative results could be obtained, and these are represented in the
following tables : —

     and of man, measured by the number of grains of quinine in

     What, then, is the meaning of this widely diffused substance in
animals which so closely resembles quinine ? At present we are far
from a perfectly clear answer.       It is not thirty years yet since the pre
sence of ammonia in the products of distillation of coal was considered
" curious," because nitrogen was thought to be the characteristic of an
animal substance, and absence of nitrogen was considered as the dis
tinctive mark of vegetable creation.           Gradually, year by year, each
substance     that has been thought to be the special property of the
 vegetable world has been found to occur in animals.               Thus sugar,
starch, woody fibre, vegetable colouring matter as indigo, albuminous

                         Dr. H. Bence Jones           on the Existence            [March    23,
substances, are common to animals and vegetables ; and at length we
have arrived at the fact that no distinction can truly be drawn between
the three kingdoms of nature.                  In the body, salt and phosphate of lime
and phosphate of soda are animal substances as much as fibrin and
albumen. Sugar is as much an animal substance as albumen is a
vegetable substance, and no separation                     can be made by chemical
analysis between animal, vegetable, and mineral.
      The processes which take place in the three different kingdoms are,
however, very different.               The vegetable generally from carbonic acid
ammonia and water can synthetically build up acids, neutral hydro
carbons, fats, alkaloids, and albuminous substances.                      Whilst the animal
generally from albumen analytically produces alkaloids, fats, neutral
hydro-carbons, acids, and ultimately water, ammonia, and carbonic acid.
      Thus the following table of synthetically and analytically produced
substances common to both kingdoms may even now be formed : —
    From Carbonate of Ammonia and Water.               From Albumen passing down to Carbonate

      From       this  point of view, then, our so-called animal quinoidine is
descended         from albumen, and its ultimate progeny are carbonate of
ammonia and water, out of which substances the cinchona tree, under
favourable circumstances, is able to build up quinine.
      From the large             number of carbon atoms in quinine, it may be
regarded as one of              the early substances produced in the downward
passage of albumen,             and from this we shall very probably find the key
to the question how            quinine acts in the body.

     1866.]                         of Quinoidine in Animals.                                 569
          When sulphate of quinine is taken, like the lithium and other sub
     stances which      I  brought before you last year, it rapidly passes from the
     blood into the textures.
          Even in a quarter of an hour, after four grains of sulphate of
     quinine the fluorescence may rise to 75 grains to 100 litres.                           It is
     found in greatest amount in the liver and kidney ; rather less in the
     blood, urine, and muscles ; still less in the brain, nerves and bile ; and
     is perhaps even in this time increased in the lens of the eye.
          In three hours the maximum effect of the quinine may be reached.
     It amounts then to from 100 to 200 grains of quinine in 100 litres of
     water, and it occurs to this amount in the liver, kidney, urine, bile,
     blood, brain, and muscles.             The nerves and aqueous humour showed
     much less increase, and the lenses showed the least increase of all the
     textures.
          In six hours the amount of fluorescence was rather less than in
     three hours.
          In twenty-four hours it was considerably less than half as much as
     in three hours.
          In forty-eight hours, except in the liver and blood, there was but
     little more fluorescent substance in the textures than naturally exists
      there.
          And in seventy-two hours the liver showed no trace of increase of
     fluorescence.
          Hence, in fifteen minutes the quinine had passed everywhere.                           In
     three hours it was at its maximum, and remained in excess for six hours.
      In twenty-four hours it was much diminished, and in forty-eight hours
     scarcely perceptible.
          These results were obtained by extracting the natural fluorescent
     substance and the quinine together from the textures, determining the
     joint fluorescence by standard solutions ; and by comparing the numbers
      thus obtained with the numbers given when no quinine was taken.
          The following table of the fluorescence of the different textures after
      four grains of quinine had been taken by guinea-pigs was made :

     The following table, which we owe to the kindness of               Mr. Bowman,
who gave us the cataracts, makes this evident : —

    The figures represent the number of grains of sulphate of quinine in 100 litres,
176 pints   of water, required to give a fluorescence equal to that of the substances
extracted.
     Thus, then, the quinine goes everywhere ; and wherever it goes it
meets with the natural fluorescent substance like quinine which most
probably is constantly forming and undergoing oxidation.                             The
incoming quinine causes a temporary excess of quinine in the textures.
Probably it causes a stoppage of the fresh formation of quinine from
albumen ; a temporary arrest of the changes going on ; a transfer of
action probably to the quinine introduced, so that with large doses
deafness and great prostration and almost imperceptible pulse are
produced in man, whilst in guinea-pigs death even is caused by the
extreme prostration.          In small doses, quinine, probably like alcohol,
gives an immediate stimulus when the first chemical action takes place ;
but soon the quinine retards the chemical changes in the nitrogenous
substances, just as alcohol, by its secondary action, retards the chemical
changes in the hydro-carbons in the different textures.
     Possibly the increased resistance to changes in the textures and in
the blood produced by excessive doses of quinine or alcohol, is analogous
to that state well known to medical men under the very indefinite and
probably incorrect name of uremia.
     From these experiments two hopeful prospects of possible discovery
arise — 1st, as to the explanation of the cause and cure of ague ; 2nd, as
to the treatment of diseases in parts of the body external to the blood
vessels.
     1. Assume that a substance like quinine exists, in health, in the
textures, can its rapid destruction and removal through the action of
marsh miasm give rise to ague ? Does quinine cure ague by furnishing
a substance which retards the changes which go on in the textures? and
in the well-known property of arsenic to preserve organic substances
have we also the explanation of its power in curing ague ?
   2.  If   the chemical circulation can carry alkaloids even into the non
 vascular tissues, is it not reasonable to suppose that medicines pass
through the blood and act on the textures ? and is it not most probable
that they take part in every chemical change that occurs outside the
blood vessels, as well as in the blood itself?             Still further, may we not
expect that among the multitude of new substances which synthetical
chemistry is now constantly forming, some medicines may be discovered
which may not only have power to control the excessive chemical

changes of the textures in fevers and inflammations, but may be able to
remove the products of insufficient chemical action even in those
diseases which affect the non-vascular textures, as, for example, in
cataract and in gout ?
                        I
     It remains that should in a very few words tell you what was
already known regarding this fluorescent substance, and on the rate of
passage of alkaloids into and out of the body, before we begin our
work.
     In  1845, Professor Briicke stated that the lens absorbed the blue
rays of light   to a very great extent, and that the cornea and aqueous
humour did so to a less extent. In 1 855, Professor Helmholtz examined
for fluorescence the retina of the eye of a man who had been dead for
eighteen hours.      The first experiment showed that it was very feebly
fluorescent.    The colour of the light dispersed through the retina he
found greenish-white.
     In 1858, M. Jules Regnauld, using sun light, found in man and the
mammifera that the cornea fluoresced in a very slight degree.            In the
sheep, dog, cat, and rabbit the crystalline lens possessed in the highest
degree fluorescent properties. In these animals, and also in many
birds, the central part of the lens, preserved by dedication at a low
temperature, retained this property.        The central portion of the crys
talline of many aquatic vertebrata and mollusca he found almost
entirely without fluorescence.       The vitreous humour possesses only a
very feeble fluorescence, due to the hyaline membrane.             The retina
possessed a certain fluorescence which was not at all comparable in
intensity to that of the crystalline lens.
     In 1859, 1. Setschenow, of Moscow, a pupil of Helmholtz, at his
request, experimented on the eyes of men and rabbits. The fresh retina
showed the same phenomenon as the dead human retina. It diffused a
greenish-white light, which, examined by a prism, gives a spectrum in
which the red is wanting. The vitreous humour in a thin glass vessel
showed only traces of fluorescence.             The lens, on the contrary,
fluoresced very strongly, the colour of the dispersed light being white-
blue, exactly like quinine, only the quinine was a little stronger.
Examined by a prism, the dispersed light gave a spectrum in which
the red was wanting, and in which the blue-tone predominated. The
fluorescence begins as in quinine solutions between G and H, and is
strongest at the outer edge of the violet rays, and extends into the
ultra violet to the same distance in the case of the lens as in the case
of the quinine solution.
     When the cornea was cut out, it fluoresced much feebler than the
lens ; the aqueous humour did not fluoresce at all.
     The appearances in the three last media, he says, can be shown
with the greatest ease, even in the eye of the living man.          When the
eye is brought into the focus      of  the ultra violet rays immediately the
cornea and the lens begin       to glimmer   with  a  white  blue light.    The
cornea   in the living eye  is much   more   fluorescent  than  when  dissected
out, probably from the loss of transparency, consequent on contraction
of the texture, and from evaporation.

 572                         General Monthly Meeting.                       [April 2,
      Professor Donders has carefully investigated the time in which
 atropine and Calabar bean act on the iris in man.
      A solution of atropine dropped on the cornea in 15 minutes begins
 to act, and attains its maximum in from 20 to 25 minutes.                     In 42
 hours the pupil is rather smaller, and even after 13 days the pupil was
 not quite its natural size.
      The fluid extracted from the aqueous humour, injected into another
 eye, caused dilatation of the pupil.
      A solution of Calabar bean began to act in from 5 to 10 minutes ;
 attained its maximum in from 30 to 40 minutes.                At the end of three
 hours it began to diminish, and disappeared entirely in from two to
 four days.

On     the Time required        for    the Transmission of Volition and Sensation
                                      through the Nervrs.
Introduction. — The speaker first pointed out a certain similarity of
action between the nerves and telegraph-wires.        Just as little as tele
graph-wires, do the nerves betray by any external symptom that any
or what news is speeding along them ; and, like those wires, in order to
be fit for service, they must be entire.    But, unlike those wires, they do
not, once cut, recover their conducting power when their ends are
caused to meet again ; in fact, every injury by which the organic structure
of the nerve is impaired, such as bruising it between the blades of
a forceps or by a ligature, or burning             or corrodingit,       some         it   by
chemical substance, will stop the transmission of either the influence of
 the will upon its central, or of the impressions of external objects
 upon its peripheric end.
     This was illustrated by placing the sciatic nerve of           frog, still       a
 attached to the gastrocnemius muscle, on three electrodes, A, B, —                             C

 576            Professor  Du Bois-Reymond       on the Time     [April   13,
 observed to arise only on making the connection with C, because only
 then a portion of the nerve between the ligature and the muscle was
 stimulated, whereas, on making the connection with B, the ligature inter
 cepted the effect produced by the stimulation of the portion AB.
      These facts, the speaker said, are calculated to impress us with a
  notion of something moving along the nerves in the act of volition and
 in that of sensation, which, to preclude any hypothetical view regard
 ing its nature, we will term the nervous agent.      As this agent for its
 conveyance requires an uninjured state of the nerve, being checked by
 so gross an obstacle as a cut or a ligature, it must necessarily be some
 thing material, not, however, the electricity such as it moves along a
 telegraph-wire, for this would readily overleap those impediments.
 But, whatever the nervous agent may be, it obviously must proceed in
 the nerves with a certain definite velocity.     In other words, however
 great this velocity may be, a certain definite time will be required for
 the messages of the brain to reach the muscles and for those of the senses
 to reach the brain.
      In common life, it is true, we never notice any phenomenon indi
 cative of such a delay in the transmission of despatches in our nerves.
 Certainly our limbs do not instantaneously carry out the orders of our
 will ; but this is rather owing to the circumstance of time being
 required for motion.    On the other hand, we fancy we see the light, we
 hear the sound, we feel the prick on the toes as well as on the cheek at
 the very instant the corresponding organs of the senses have been
affected.     But a little reflection shows that this is altogether a
delusion; in fact, if we only had one sense, an indefinite time might
elapse between its organ being affected and the sensation taking place
in the brain, without our perceiving it ; we simply should always be so
much behind the real time, just as we are when listening to distant
music, or when looking at the stars.       The same thing would also
happen if we had two senses, both equally slow in working.               We
should only perceive that something was wrong, if the two senses had
a different rate of working, and if the difference of time resulting
therefrom for the perception of messages conveyed by the two senses
were large enough to become apparent, as is the case when we see
the flash of the gun before hearing its report.       Now we cannot well
distinguish intervals of time smaller than one-tenth of a second at
the most ; so that within that limit any irregularity in the working
of our organs of sense may occur, from any cause whatever, hence
from a delay of the messages in the nerves, without our becoming
aware of it.
     The problem thus suggests itself, to ascertain whether any per
ceptible time is required for the transmission of volition and sensation
through the nerves, and if so, what is the rate of propagation of the
nervous agent.
     Historical Remarks. — This problem     is by no means a new one ; for
a hundred and fifty years it has engaged     the attention of physiologists,

 1866.]          required for Transmission through the Nerves.               577
and many an adventurous hypothesis has been broached in order to
approach to at least a pretence of a solution.
      One of the early latro-matheraaticians preposterously conceived that
the velocity of the nervous agent ought to bear the same proportion to
that of the blood in the aorta as the width of the aorta to that of the
nerve-tubes, and he thus inferred the velocity of the former to be one
hundred and twenty millions of miles in one second, rather more than
six hundred times the velocity of light.*
      Haller himself tried, in reading the JEneid aloud, how many
letters he could pronounce in one minute.          Finding that they were
fifteen hundred, among which the R, according to him, requires for its
formation ten successive contractions of the M. styloglossus, he states
that in one minute a muscle may contract and relax fifteen thousand
times, and as the relaxing lasts as long as the contracting, each con
traction would have lasted only 55^3, of a minute, or ^ of a second.
Hence Haller argues that the nervous agent requires ^ of a second
for travelling from the brain to the M. styloglossus, say a distance of
about four inches, which makes about 160 feet in one second.               Now
this result is not a little remarkable.        In Haller's reasoning every
single step is erroneous, and the whole rests on a perfectly absurd
basis.     Nevertheless, the result to which Haller has thus been led
wonderfully coincides with that which has recently been arrived at by
the methods which it is the object of this lecture to explain ; so that
 in this case the vEneid really has proved a book of oracles.f
      John Miiller, of Berlin, hardly seventeen years ago, used in his
lectures to dwell upon the apparent impossibility of ever solving the
problem under consideration, on account of the enormous rate of pro
pagation, comparable to that of light and electricity, which he ascribed
 to the nervous agent, while the small compass of the animal body did
 not offer sufficient range for its measurement.   J
      These historical details, perhaps, will not be deemed superfluous,
 in as much as they are calculated to bring out more fully the beauty
and the high scientific value of the following researches.
      Description      of M. Pouillet's Chronoscope. — More        than twenty
 years ago, M. Pouillet suggested a very ingenious plan for measuring
 the velocity of projectiles.       If an electric current flows constantly
 through the coil of a galvanometer, the needle is deflected to an
 amount which depends upon the intensity of the current, and upon the
 sensitiveness of the galvanometer.      But if the current be sent through
 the coil only for a time so short that it vanishes when compared
 to the duration of one oscillation of the needle, things happen
 differently.      The needle then receives as it were a single impulse,

  yielding to which it slowly recedes, till its velocity has been an
  nihilated by the magnetic force of the earth, which draws it back
  to zero.      And the initial velocity imparted to the needle by the
  current, provided this be of constant intensity, will be proportional
  to its duration, so that from the velocity, which can be calculated
  from the deflection of the needle, the duration of the current may be
  inferred.    The galvanometer is thus transformed into a chronoscope,
  which can be used for measuring the duration of rapidly transient
  processes, whenever there is a possibility of making the beginning and
  the end of the process coincide with the beginning and the end of the
  chronoscopic current, — for so we will style the current, which, by its
  action on the galvanometer, becomes an indicator of time.                 And
  similarly  we   will style chronoscopic  circuit,  the  circuit of the chrono
  scopic current.
      If, e. g., the velocity of a bullet, within the very barrel of a gun,
 were to be measured, the chronoscopic circuit, in addition to the battery
 and the galvanometer, should comprise a wire stretched out just before
 the muzzle of the gun, the cock, which in some way or other should be
 insulated from the gun, and lastly the gun itself. Then at the moment
 when the cock strikes the percussion-cap, the circuit is made and re
 mains so till the bullet tears the wire ; and so the current will only have
 lasted during the time required for the explosion of the percussion-cap,
 for that of the gunpowder in the gun, and for the moving of the bullet
 along the barrel.      This time has been found to be from ,!, to ^ of a
 second.     By repeating the same experiment with the wire or a net of
 wires at any greater distance from the muzzle, and by taking the dif
ference of the times required in both cases, the time elapsed during
the flight of the bullet through the space comprised between the two
positions of the wire can be ascertained.*
      Application of this Method to our Problem by Professor ffelm-
holtz. — The same method was, a few years later (1850), success
fully applied by Professor Helmholtz to the solution of our problem.
     Suppose that the chronoscopic current, when its circuit is made,
causes the muscle to contract by stimulating a motor nerve at a point
A. It will be easy to arrange things so as to cause the muscle by its
contraction to break the circuit.      The current will then have lasted the
time necessary for the transmission of the nervous agent from the point
A of the nerve to the muscle, and, moreover, that necessary for the mus
cular contraction to break the circuit.         But by repeating the experi
ment, with the sole difference that the chronoscopic current is made to
act upon a point B of the nerve farther from the muscle than A, and
by taking the difference of the times required in both cases, the time
which elapses while the nervous agent is travelling from point B to
point A will be found.

introduced for the sake of convenience,       g is the gastrocnemius muscle
of a frog, fastened by the thigh-bone in the clamp c, which can be

raised or lowered by the screw s.       Through the tendo- A chillis a hook
is thrust, and to this, by an insulating piece t, a brass lever Ik is
attached, turning on the axis k, and, near its end /, supported by
a platinum point resting on a platinum plate p.         Just underneath the
muscle, a scale-pan is suspended from the lever, on which any suitable
weight may be placed. At the end / of the lever an amalgamated
copper point dips into a mercury cup m. G is the galvanometer-coil ;
and it is hardly necessary to mention that the readings are made with
mirror, telescope, and scale.    B, is the battery belonging to the chrono-
scopic circuit. This circuit is formed by B,, G, m, p, L, and the place of
contact n, where for the present it is interrupted.      For several reasons,
which it would take too long here to explain, the chronoscopic current
cannot be employed for directly stimulating the nerve by its beginning,
and this has to be done indirectly, in the following way :

580              Piofessor Du Bois-Reymond       on the Time     [April   13,
     n o q is an insulating lever turning on the axis o, and bearing
at n a platinum plate connected with BI.        This plate corresponds to a
platinum point at the end of the brass lever L, which in its turn is con
nected with p, so that by pressing down L, the chronoscopic circuit is
made.     But by pressing down the extremity n of the lever n o q, its
extremity q is simultaneously raised, and thus another circuit is broken.
This circuit comprises a battery Bs, and the primary coil pc of an
induction apparatus, from whose secondary coil sc wires extend to the
part of the nerve which is to be stimulated, or to the muscle.            No
perceptible    time  elapses between  the  breaking   of the primary  circuit
and the generation of the induced current, and the duration of the
latter does not exceed a few ten-thousandths of a second.        Hence the
stimulation of the nerve can be assumed to happen at the very
instant the chronoscopic circuit is made.
      By means of the screw s, it is easy to make the muscle support the
lever / k so that the platinum point just rests on the plate p. This is
done by lowering the screw, till on percussing the lever above the
platinum point no clattering is heard.         If now the tension of the
 muscle be ever so little increased, the lever will be lifted, and the
 chronoscopic circuit broken at p.
      After the contraction is over, as the lever sinks back into its
original position, the chronoscopic circuit would be made again, and
 the experiment spoilt in consequence       of the new and overpowering
action exercised on the needle, unless some measure were taken to
 prevent it. This very serious difficulty has been met by Professor
 Helmholtz with singular felicity.        The mercury cup into which
 the amalgamated copper point dips is lowered before the experiment,
 till by capillary attraction the mercury is drawn up in a cone con
 nected with the point by a thread. The slightest upward motion of the
 point then will cause the mercury thread to break, after which the
 liquid metal speedily reassumes its spheroidal surface. So that when
 the amalgamated point comes down again, it cannot reach the mercury,
 and the chronoscopic circuit remains open.
      In order to obtain a clear insight into the conditions of the experi
 ment, it should first be made by stimulating, not the nerve, but the
 muscle itself. For this purpose, the ends of the secondary coil should
 be united with the wires 1 and 2 in the diagram.        As, on doing so, all
 the parts of the muscle are acted upon simultaneously at the very
 instant the chronoscopic circuit is made, no delay in the nerves can
 occur ; nevertheless, a deflection of the needle is thus obtained, which
 shows that after the stimulation there is an interval of time of about
 •01 of a second, during which the tension of the muscle still remains
 unaltered. This interval has been styled by Professor Helmholtz the
 stage of latent stimulation.
      If, after having made the muscle support the lever so that it just
 rests on the plate p, a weight be placed upon the scale-pan, the deflec
 tion obtained on stimulating the muscle as before, is increased, and,
 up to a certain limit, the more so the heavier the weight.          It thus

 1866.]         required  for Transmission through     the Nerves.             581
appears that after the stage of latent stimulation is over, the muscle
does not at once acquire its whole energy, but that its tension (at equal
length) gradually increases, and reaches its maximum after about
'05 of a second.
     This result (which the speaker illustrated by two experiments, one
without, and the other with an additional charge on the scale-pan) is
in itself of considerable interest, as it shows that the difference which,
up to the time of Professor Helmholtz's               researches,     had been
admitted between the mode of contracting of the striped and of the
unstriped muscles is only one of gradation.           Of the latter class of
muscles, in contradistinction to the first class, it was said that their
contraction did not immediately follow stimulation, and that their
energy rose, and subsided again, gradually.           But it is now obvious
that all this holds equally with the striped muscles, only that the
whole process here lasts but a few hundredths of a second, whereas with
the unstriped muscles every stage of the contraction may take up as
many seconds, so as to be easily perceptible without artificial means.
     The values obtained in repeated trials for the duration of the
latent stimulation do not accord very well ; but those which repre
sent the time required by the muscle to raise an additional weight
remain almost identical as long as the muscle does not become ex
hausted, provided the stimulation be capable of producing the maxi
mum of contraction which can be called forth by instantaneous stimu
lation.     This also happens when, instead of stimulating the muscle
itself, the induced current, in successive trials, is made to act with
sufficient energy upon always the same part of the nerve, only in this
case the time of latent stimulation is found to be a little longer than in the
case of the muscle itself being stimulated.       But on making the current
pass alternately through the part A of the nerve nearer to the muscle,
by means of the wires 3 and 4 in the diagram, and through the part B
farther from the muscle, by means of the wires 5 and 6, two sets of
observations are obtained, the corresponding figures of which differ
from each other by a small but constant quantity, independent, more
over, of the additional charge placed upon the scale-pan.           This differ
ence obviously indicates the time required by the nervous agent for
travelling from B to A, and the distance between               A  and B being
known, the rate of propagation of the stimulation or the velocity of
the nervous agent can easily be calculated.
     This velocity, in Professor Helmholtz's experiments, has been found
to be 26-4 metres (86'C feet) in one second.* The reason why on stimu
lating the nerve the time of latent stimulation appears a little longer
 than on stimulating the muscle itself, is now also evident.         It is owing
to the time which elapses during the passage of the nervous agent from
the stimulated part of the nerve-tubes to their termination in the
muscle.

      Professor ffelmholt"'x Experiments with the Myographion. — Soon
 after Professor Helmholtz had thus, for the first time, succeeded in
 determining the velocity of the nervous agent, he devised another
 method for obtaining the same result in a manner more simple and
 more adapted to a variety of purposes.
      As before, the gastrocnemius muscle is caused to lift a lever by its
 contraction, but this time with the view of making the muscle itself
 register the beginning, and the successive stages, of the contraction ;
 wherefore the apparatus employed is termed a myoyraphion.           To this
 end, opposite a steel point or style suspended from the lever is placed
 a rotating cylinder of glass, blackened over a lamp.        The cylinder is
 moved by clockwork at an increasing rate, and, when it has acquired
 the proper speed,      the centrifugal force developed    releases a piece
 of mechanism     which  breaks the primary circuit of the  induction appa
 ratus connected with the muscle or nerve.       In consequence of a very
 ingenious arrangement, which will hereafter be explained, this always
 happens when the cylinder is in exactly the same position to the style ;
so that always the same point of the datum-line traced by the style
during the quiescent state of the muscle corresponds to the instant of
stimulation.
      The contracting muscle thus traces a curve on the cylinder, like those
in Fig. 2. The point s of the datum-line marks the instant of stimulation.
The curve does not start from this point, but a little later, from m, the
 distance sm corresponding to the stage of latent stimulation, if we
suppose the muscle to have been acted upon directly by the current.
The muscle then, slowly and gradually, begins to act, in due time
reaches a climax of energy, and then again gradually relaxes.             The
results obtained by M. Pouillet's method regarding the successive stages
                                    Fio. 2.
of contraction   are thus confirmed by the graphic method.        The curve
traced by the contracting muscle of course becomes the more stretched
the quicker the cylinder rotates, but, at an equal rate of rotation, the
curves traced successively by the same muscle stimulated by a current
capable of giving rise to the maximum of contraction, coincide so as
almost entirely to coalesce, so long as the muscle does not become
exhausted.     This also happens when in repeated trials the current,
instead of on the muscle itself, is made to act with sufficient
                                                                      energy
upon always the same part of the nerve,
                                             say the part   A  ; only all the
curves thus obtained are found to start a little further from s on the
datum-line, say at a.
     But, on
                stimulating the nerve alternately at a place A nearer
to, mid       tardier from, the muscle, the curves obtained no longer

coincide.     They separate, and the curves traced on stimulating B
will again be found to lie farther off on the datum-line, starting at b
instead of at a, and keeping everywhere the same horizontal distance
a b from the curve traced when A is stimulated.
     This horizontal distance of the two curves, or sets of curves, evi
dently corresponds to the time the nervous agent has spent in travel
ling along the nerve from B to A. It is, in fact, the displacement of
the surface of the cylinder which, according to its angular velocity,
has occurred during the same time. Determining this angular velocity
by means of an indicator, the velocity of the nervous agent was found
by Professor I1c1ihIk.1i/ to be 21 '25 metres (89 4 feet) in one second,
which agrees very well with the figure formerly obtained by M.
Pouillet's method.* It is hardly necessary to mention that the dif
ference sa — sm corresponds to the time spent by the nervous agent
in travelling from A to the termination of the nerve-tubes in the muscle.
    Different kinds of Myographion proposed; description of the
Apparatus used by the speaker on the present occasion. — The myo-
graphion, as it was originally designed by Professor Helmholtz, is a
rather complicated and expensive apparatus. Various modifications
have been proposed in order to simplify it.    For the clockwork moving
the cylinder, Thiry has substituted a reaction-engine moved by air,
like that in M. Foucault's apparatus for comparing the velocity of
light in air and in water. The rotation of the cylinder in this myo-
graphion is uniform, and its rate is ascertained by the pitch of a siren
connected with it.   JIlarless and Professor Fick altogether abandoned
the rotating scheme, which, in fact, involves great and, perhaps, unne
cessary difficulties, and for the rotating cylinder substituted a glass plate
moving in its own plane. Harless allowed the plate to drop in an
apparatus constructed upon the principle of Atwood's machine, and
thus obtained an uniform velocity, which could easily be determined
theoretically.!     Professor   Fick attached      the plate to a heavy
pendulum, and although the velocity thus was no longer uniform, yet
the law of its variation was known. §
    The speaker himself had formerly devoted much attention to the
improvement of the rotating myographion, and had suggested some
alterations of    it, which, executed by that most skilful instrument-
maker, M. Sauerwald, of Berlin, answer remarkably well, and have
done good service in some very important researches, hereafter to
be mentioned.||      For the present occasion, however, he contrived

584                    Prrfessor Du Bois-Reymond                             on the Time           [April 13,
a new myographion which in simplicity far exceeds every previous
design, and which may be styled the spring-myographion.               As in
Harless's and in Professor Fick's myographion, in the spring-
myographion the cylinder is replaced by a glass plate moving in its
own plane.       But instead of being impelled by gravity, the plate, on
                                       is,                                  by
pulling a trigger,         as    were, shot        spiral spring along two
                                                    it                      a
horizontal    steel  wires   which   act as supports and guides.         The
curve      traced on the plate, after this has reached its greatest velocity,
             is
i. e. after the spring has passed through its position of equilibrium.
On account of the friction, however, the velocity of the plate cannot
be taken as uniform, nor can the law of its variation and its amount
at any given place theoretically be ascertained with any degree of pre
cision.    But,     required, this could easily be done experimentally, by
                       if
recurring to Dr. Thomas Young's original plan* — viz.                causing                       by
a  tuning-fork to record its vibrations upon the plate, together with
the curve traced by the contraction of the muscle. On the present
occasion this would be useless, as             only intended to show that
                                                                   it   is
there        larger interval between the instant of stimulation and the
             is
             a
beginning of contraction,          part of the nerve farther from, than
                                                    if   a                  a                            if
part of      nearer to, the muscle be acted upon. For this purpose
              it                                                                                         it   is
only requisite that the motion of the plate should always follow the
same law and attain the same velocity, and that the point of the datum-
line, corresponding to the instant of stimulation, should always be the
same.
    In the spring-myographion the latter condition     fulfilled in the                 is
same manner as in Professor Helmholtz's, and every other myogra
phion.   The frame carrying the plate has projecting piece or tooth,         a
which, just when the frame has reached its highest speed, strikes a
lever, and thus breaks the primary circuit of the induction apparatus.
This, of course, always happens in exactly the same position of the
plate, whatever may be its velocity          so that in order to find the
                                                                        ;
point of the datum-line corresponding to the instant of stimulation,
it   isonly necessary to move the plate with the hand along its guides
so slowly that the contraction of the muscle, instead of curve, traces                       a
a  vertical line      in Fig.
                            (*   corresponding to the two limbs of the

curve, the ascending and the descending one, which have coalesced.
     A very essential precaution in these, as well as           all experi                    in
ments on nerves and muscles,          that these textures, especially the

nerves, should be carefully preserved from becoming dry. This can be
done by covering the part of the apparatus containing them with                                               a
shade the inner walls of which are lined with moist bibulous paper                                            ;
or, as was the case on the present occasion, by enclosing the nerve
in   a tube of vulcanite, in which    rests on two pairs of platinum elec

trodes, one as near to, the other as far from, the muscle as possible.

This tube of vulcanite            is   also provided     with another contrivance,
which will be more fully mentioned presently.
       The speaker now proceeded to show a complete experiment with
the spring-myographion.             After two curves had been traced, one by
stimulating the nerve near to, the other by stimulating it far from, the
muscle, the magnified image of the curves was exhibited to the
audience by means of the electric light.
      Conditions upon which the rate of Propagation of the Nervous Agent
has been hitherto found to depend. — 1. The figures given above (see
pages 579 and 582) for the rate of propagation of the nervous agent were
obtained at a temperature of from ll"to21°C.                        At a lower tem
perature,      Professor    Helmholtz      found    the  velocity was greatly dimi
 nished.*       This can easily be shown by means of the tube of vulcanite
 belonging to the speaker's new myographion.                  The nerve, inside the
 tube and between the two pairs of electrodes, rests on a varnished
 copper-plate, which forms part of a small vessel, lodged in the wall of
 the vulcanite tube.         Through this vessel water of any temperature may
 be passed.       By thus cooling the nerve, a wider interval is obtained
 between the two curves ; in fact, this artifice was put into practice in
 the above-mentioned experiment to make the result more striking.
 Plates were also exhibited with curves traced on them at a higher and
 a still lower temperature, thus showing that the horizontal distance of
  the two curves is in a measure proportional to the lowering of the
 temperature.
       2. Dr. H. Munk, by delicate researches made in the speaker's
  laboratory, has succeeded in demonstrating that the velocity of the
  nervous agent is not the same in different parts of the same nerve.
  According to him, this velocity in the motor nerves increases as the
  nerve approaches the muscle.t
       3. Professor v. Bezold, also in the speaker's laboratory, has under
  taken to answer the question whether and how the velocity of the
  nervous agent may be altered by the electrotonic state of the nerve
  — as sixteen years ago the speaker ventured to term the remark
  able condition into which he found the whole nerve thrown when
  any part of it is pervaded by an electric current ; a condition mak
  ing itself manifest by a most striking change in the electromotive
  action of the nerve,      J  and, as afterwards demonstrated chiefly by Pro
   fessor Pfluger, also by a change in the excitability of its different
   points.§ These changes, which only last as long as the current itself,
   are found to be the more considerable, the nearer to the electrodes
   the nerves are examined. In addition to these facts, Professor v.

      Rate of Transmission of Sensation in the Nerves and the Spinal
  Cord of Man. — All the preceding experiments were made upon the
 motor fibres in the sciatic nerve of the frog.         Similar results, however,
 have been arrived at with regard to the nerves of sensation in the living
body of man, in the following way.
      An induced current is made to impinge alternately upon two dif
 ferent places on the skin, so as to cause just a slight sensation of pain.
 The two places should be such as are supplied, like the big toe and the
inguinal region, for instance, with sensory fibres emanating from neigh
bouring roots, but of very unequal length.             The person experimented
on is desired, as soon as he becomes aware of the shock, or sensation-
tignal,&s it may be termed, to answer it by another signal, the volition-
signal, which generally consists in making or breaking a circuit at the
instant when the sensation-signal is given ; and means are provided for
 measuring the time, that we shall designate by T, which elapses
between the two signals.           The time T comprises, firstly, the time
required for the transmission of sensation to the brain — for its per
ception there — for volition — for the transmission of volition to the
muscles — for muscular contraction ; secondly, T comprises the time
 lost in the purely mechanical and physical process of signaling.             This
last time, of course, depends upon the experimental method employed,
and by suitable arrangement may even be reduced to nothing.                  Now,
should the value of T, when the more distant place on the skin is
stimulated, always, and by nearly the same amount, exceed its value
when the nearer place is stimulated, then, as everything else in both
experiments remains the same, the difference of time must obviously
depend upon the unequal distance which in both cases the nervous
agent has to travel from the place stimulated to the brain.
      This scheme also, in the main, was suggested by Professor
Helmholtz, as early as 1 850 ;f the first correct results, however, were
thus arrived at eleven years later by Dr. Hirsch, the able astronomer
of Neuchatel in Switzerland, by means of Hipp's chronoscope, which
he so regulated as to obtain the first part of the time T, -t'. e.
that merely occupied by physiological processes, entirely free from
the second-!           For that physiological part of the time T, with
reference to the part it plays in modern astronomical observation,

lie proposed the name of physiological time.         The subject has since
been taken up, and as regards physiology more fully treated by Dr.
Schelske, of Berlin, whose experiments were made at the Utrecht
Observatory, by means of the chronograph now in use among astro
nomers for registering their observations.
     In this chronograph, as constructed by Krille, of Hamburg, there
is again a rotating cylinder, on whose blackened surface two points or
styles, a and b, mark a spiral track. Each of them is fixed to the keeper
of an electro-magnet, and, when the keeper is attracted, deviates a little
from its path, so as to trace a broken line. The circuit of the magnet A
is alternately made and broken by the pendulum of a clock, in accord
ance wherewith the style a traces a broken line like aa' in Fig. 3, every
horizontal segment of which corresponds to one second.        The circuit of
the magnet B contains the primary coil of the induction apparatus,
whose secondary coil is connected with the skin of the person experi
mented on.      Two keys, moreover, form part of this circuit : a lever-
kei/, which, when pressed down, keeps the circuit closed by establishing
a bridge between two points of it ; and a spring-key, which the person
holds in his hand, ready, by           it,
                                  to make the circuit again after  has been             it

the distance de here would correspond to the time we have designated
by T, and would be found to be greater or smaller according to the
distance the nervous agent had to travel from the stimulated place
 on the skin to the brain.
     The velocity of the nervous agent in the nerves of common sensa
 tion, in the living body of man, has thus been found       Dr. Schelske           by
 to be 29-6 metres (97'1 feet) in one second, which      only very little     is
 more than the result obtained for the motor nerves of the frog.     (See

    By similar experiments, Dr. Schelske has ascertained that the trans
mission of sensation through the spinal cord of man takes place at very
nearly the same rate as in the nerves.        This is the more remarkable,
as in other respects     the   nerve-tubes   undergo a material change on
entering   the  spinal cord,   where,  according to Professor van Deen, of
Groningen,     and  others,  they are   no longer capable of stimulation by
electricity, chemical   substances,   mechanical  injuries, &c.

      A glance at this table shows that the velocity of the nervous
agent, far from being enormously great, as most physiologists formerly
supposed,      is,
               on the contrary, wonderfully      small. Not only                                is   it
beyond any comparison smaller than the velocity of electricity and
light, and the so-called planetary velocities, but     even small when   it   is
compared to the velocity of sound in different media, or to the initial
velocity of cannon-ball.

    In order better to realize how slowly sensation and volition are
transmitted through the nerves, let us suppose that large whale, which     a
may be thirty metres long (98^ feet), has its tail struck    harpoon. It           bya
will then take about one whole second before the pain reaches the huge
creature's brain and, neglecting even the time required for the processes
                      ;
in the brain, nearly another second will elapse before the order can
be telegraphed to the muscles of the tail to capsize the boat.

     Again, suppose the engine-driver on the locomotive of an express-
train running a mile a minute, holds his arm extended towards the
tender, and moves his fingers, then the nervous agent in the motor
fibres of his arm will rest in space or nearly so, because its motion is
destroyed by that of the train, just as a cannon-ball, fired at the equator
due west, has its motion destroyed by that of the earth around its axis,
and does not strike the wall or the ship's side, but is struck by them.
And the same thing will happen with the nervous agent in the sensory
fibres of the fireman's arm,             if,
                                   standing on the tender, he should burn
his hand at the locomotive.
      But also in the racehorse and greyhound, when they are running at
full speed, the nervous agent will nearly rest in space, and in the flying
eagle     will even be carried in the opposite direction.

will be less matter of surprise that a man should be able to move his
                      a
hand almost as quickly as that agent moves along his nerves.         This can
be made apparent by the height to which a heavy body,               stone, for        a
instance, may be thrown. Throwing, in fact,         nothing else than impart
                                                                   is
ing the greatest possible velocity to the hand, together with the projectile,
and letting this fly when the tangent to the curve, wherein the hand neces
sarily moves, points in the proper direction. The initial velocity of
the stone, then, can never exceed that of the hand, or the velocity of the
hand, on throwing the stone vertically, must have been equal to that with
which the falling stone passes through the horizontal plane from which
it  started. This reasoning leads to the result put down in the table,
and       may safely be conjectured that the same figure also applies
         it
with tolerable accuracy to the motion of the fist when striking        blow.

     The arterial wave, which in more superficial arteries             felt as
pulse, travels only about three times more slowly than the nervous
agent, according to Professor E. H. Weber's observations.*
     By the velocity      the muscular contraction, we understand the rate
                             of
at which the wave of contraction runs along the fibre, when one end of
the muscle       stimulated.

marked their track.         The lever bearing each style rested on the
muscle with       sort of crutch, and when the wave of contraction passed
                      a

curves were thus obtained, whose horizontal distance was equal to the
 distance of the styles, plus the distance corresponding on the cylinder
to the time spent by the wave of contraction in travelling from the
first to the second crutch.         The velocity of the contraction thus
obtained, falls as much short of that anticipated                         by

of  the nervous agent ; being, in fact, even in muscles           fresh from the
body of the frog, only about one yard in one second.*
      Time required for Reflex Action in the Spinal Cord. — The con
duction of sensation in the spinal cord, according to Dr. Schelske's
above-mentioned experiments, takes place at nearly, perhaps quite, the
same rate as in the nerves ; but a great delay is occasioned by the so-
called reflex-action, when the sensation, impinging upon the spinal
cord, starts an involuntary          motion by the intervention of the
ganglionic     cells.   By  experiments   performed on frogs poisoned with
strychnia, Professor Ilelmholtz has found that the reflex contraction
happens from ^ to ^ of a second later than the contraction directly
produced by the same induced current ; from which observation it
may be concluded, that the reflex action in the spinal cord takes
more than twelve times the time required for the transmission of the
stimulation through the sensory and the motor nerves.f This is doubly
interesting, because it was chiefly by the impossibility of catching with
the eye the slightest lapse of time between the stimulation and the
reflex contraction that John Miiller had been induced to admit, as we
have pointed out, so enormous a velocity for the nervous agent.J
      Time required for Sensation and Volition in the Brain. — More
recently researches of this kind have been extended even to the time
required for one of the simplest operations of the brain — viz. the act
of sensation and subsequent volition. Dr. de Jaager, in Professor
Donders's laboratory, in Utrecht, first repeated Dr. Schelske's experi
ment on the transmission of sensation in the human body ; but with
this modification, that the shock could at will be given either on the
right or on the left side. In one set of experiments, the person had
to answer the right side shock with a spring-key in his right hand,
the left side shock with a similar key in his left hand ; and he knew,
beforehand, on which side he was going to be stimulated, and there
fore would have to answer. In another set of experiments the side
was not known beforehand, and the person, after having received the
shock, had first to consider which side had been struck, and with
 which hand, accordingly, he had to act.        Now the mean result in the
first case was —                                    T, = -205 sec.
                      in the second     .    .  .   T, = -272
                      and the difference  TJ-T!         =  -067
 is obviously the time spent in the operation        of  the brain required     in
 the second, and not required in the first case.
      The physiological time necessary for answering a signal given to
 the eye has also been determined by Dr. Ilirsch by means of Hipp's

quired for doing so.
      Dr. de Jaager repeated these experiments with his chronograph
and with variously coloured light, and he found that with red as well
as with white light, -200 of         second on the average were required
                                             a
for answering the signal. This figure cannot be compared directly
with Dr. Hirsch's figures, with the first of which              so closely agrees,
                                                                    it
because Dr. de Jaager's observations represent the time T, those
of Dr. Hirsch the physiological time only.                  In these trials the
colour of the light to appear was known to the person, and he simply
 had to answer the signal with the right or with the left hand, ac
 cording to what had been agreed upon beforehand. In other expe
riments, however, the colour of the light was not known, and                    was it
agreed that red light should be answered with the right, white light
 with the left hand. Here the time required for answering was found
 = •355 sec, that "154 of a second longer than
                            is                                  the first case, the

                                                                   a

 Hirsch to be "149 sec. Dr. de Jaager, in company with Professor
 Donders, has had recourse to quite another method for determining the
same time.       He has applied to this purpose Air. Scott's phonau-
tograph, as constructed          M. Konig, of Paris. In this apparatus a
                                        by
membrane partakes of the vibrations of any sounding body placed
opposite the mouth of paraboloid cavity over whose bottom that mem
                                 a
 brane     stretched and
              is            ;   point connected with the membrane traces
                                       a
curves, indicative of its vibrations, on        blackened cylinder, on which
                                                     a
simultaneously      tuning-fork records the time.
                       a                                   Two persons, A and
 B, separated by       screen, sit down before the phonautograph.
                           a                                                      A
 utters some sharp, explosive syllable, such as ha, he, hi, or the like.
B   endeavours to repeat the syllable as quickly as possible.           The instant
 at which both persons    have   begun   to utter  the sound       plainly discern
                                                                         is
 ible in the track of the style on the cylinder.        Now,             if
                                                                     the syllable to
 be repeated has been agreed upon before, the time required varies
 from "180 sec. to '250 sec, according to the person experimented upon,
 and to practice      but
                        ;       the syllable be unknown, about "088 sec.

 more are necessary for answering the signal.*             It thus appears that
 " quick as thought," is, after all, not so very quick.

        Concluding Remarks. — The preceding results are not entirely
  without a practical bearing.       In medicine, it is true, they have not yet
  been applied, although, perhaps, in cases of paralysis, the velocity of
  the nervous agent will be found diminished, and diagnostic signs, more
  or less important, might be derived therefrom. But as, strange to say,
  the warlike art of gunnery first supplied physiology with the means
  of measuring the velocity of the nervous agent, so again it is a science
  apparently far remote from this field of inquiry, astronomy, which
  is the first to benefit by the progress achieved in it.            Astronomical
  observations, as regards the exact determination of time, have hitherto
  attained only a limited perfection.       Till very recently, indeed, though
  the observations of the same astronomer might agree ever so closely,
  still, between the observations of several, even first-rate astronomers,
  discrepancies occurred of one second and more, resulting from the
  different estimate formed by the observers of the time between the
  passage of the star at the cross-wire and the next beat of the clock.
  This uncertainty as to the real time of an astronomical event has been
 greatly diminished by the introduction into observatories of the electric
 chronograph. It still subsists, however, and the only way of removing it
 as completely as possible seems to be that adopted by Dr. Hirsch, riz.
 to ascertain by appropriate experiments the time required for register
 ing the passage at the cross-wire of an artificial star moving at a rate
 similar to that of the real stars, and thus, for the knowledge of the
personal equation of two observers, to substitute that of their personal
 corrections, the difference of which corresponds to their personal

       As to the theory of the nervous agent, now that we know that this
 agent moves more than ten times less quickly than sound in air. every
 attempt to identify it with the electric current as it circulates in a
 telegraph-wire must appear hopeless, even if a circuit, such as would
 be necessary for the supposed           nerve current to circulate in, were
 anatomically demonstrated.           Thus to the other arguments against
 this view of the nervous agent — that the resistance of the nerve-
 tubes would be far too great for any battery to send an available current
 through them — that the physiological insulation of the nerve- tubes from
 each other would be impossible to explain — that the effect of ligature
 or of cutting the nerve and causing its ends to meet again, would be
 equally obscure — to these arguments, unanswerable as they are in them
 selves, the researches sketched in this lecture have added corroborative
 evidence of the highest order. What we have termed the nervous
 agent, if we look upon its very small velocity, in all probability is some
 internal motion, perhaps even some chemical change, of the substance
 itself contained in the nerve-tubes, spreading along the tubes, according
 to the speaker's experiments, both ways from any point where the

equilibrium has been disturbed ; being capable of an almost infinite
number of variations or gradations, and of so peculiar a character as to
require the unimpaired condition of the nervous structure.     It would
be out of place on the present occasion to venture upon any more
definite statement regarding the nature of the nervous agent, although
the progress recently made in this line, chiefly by the modern school of
German physiologists, already affords the means of doing so, and of dis
cussing the merits and defects of several solutions proposed.    It may
not, however, be inappropriate to remark, that although the electric
theory of the nervous agent, in the sense just alluded to, cannot any
longer be thought of (as little, indeed, as with any degree of probability
it ever could), yet it would be rash, as the matter stands, entirely
to dismiss the notion of electricity being concerned, and even playing a
prominent part, in the internal mechanism of the nerves.        The electric
currents discovered in the nerves by the speaker four-and-twenty years
ago ; the remarkable changes which these currents undergo whenever
the nervous agent is called into action ; the wonderful phenomena of
electric fish ; those of the muscles and glands ; finally, the extreme
sensitiveness   of the nerves for electricity however applied, and the
beautiful and peculiar laws which govern their reaction thereupon,
all these are facts which certainly ought not to be disregarded as long
as the close connection which they seem to indicate between the two
agents has not otherwise proved a fallacy.        Nor is it by any means
impossible to frame an electrical hypothesis of the nervous agent such
as would embrace that newly-discovered feature of       it,which has formed
the subject of this lecture — its comparative sluggishness.                If

electro-motive molecules, by which the speaker has tried to account
for the electro-motive effects of the nerves, muscles, and electrical
organs,— viz. minute centres of chemical action, all arranged regu
larly so as to turn homologous sides the same way, — are conceived to
act upon each other electrically, mutually determining their position
of equilibrium and controlling their deviations from               in such a

                           G.   A.   MACFARREN,      Esq.
                  On the Music      of  the Church of England.
Though not       educated   in a church choir, nor ever having held a church
engagement,       my  discussion    of the present subject is justified by my
regard   for  its great  artistic  importance,   being confident that, whatever
views I may advance, these are wholly impersonal and prompted only
by general interest in the advancement of music in its application to
ecclesiastical uses.
     England has a National Church.              Our best claims to a national
school of music, and her best hopes of its development, are in
ecclesiastical composition.        These are based on the peculiarity to this
country of our several forms of church music ; our setting of the
so-called Service is as different in structure from the Roman Mass as
from the Lutheran church cantata ; our Psalm tune is equally unlike
the Gregorian chant and the Lutheran hymn ; and our chant has no
parallel.
     The objects of church music are: — 1st, to stimulate devotional
feelings ; 2nd, to express them.
     The importation of music into the western church, by St. Ambrose,
archbishop of Milan, a.d. 374, was at the instigation of Flavian, bishop
of Antioch.       If  the antiphonal form of singing was, in the church, a
direct continuation of Jewish practice; or if the Greeks had before the
time of Thespis adopted it for their dramatic choruses from Oriental
precedent ; certainly the music that was sung was that of the Greek
theatre. The proofs of this are : 1st, that the musical scale was divided,
by the ancient Jews and the nations among whom they sojourned, into
smaller intervals than those of the Greek diatonic genus, whereas the
Ambrosian chant exactly accords with this genus ; 2nd, that the four
modes employed by St. Ambrose — the Dorian, the Phrygian, the Lydian,
and the Mixo- Lydian — are identical with the Greek modes so named,
and are applied, in ecclesiastical use, each to the expression of the
same sentiment as in the Greek theatre.            To pretend that St. Ambrose
founded a new system of music, that superseded the labours of
Pythagoras, Aristoxenes, and their rival partisans, would be to ascribe
to him greater powers as a
                                     philosopher than those he evinced as an
advocate and as a bishop. St.
                                    Ambrose was an innovator in incorporating
music in the service of the
                                  church, and he appropriated the pagan music
which was accessible to his
                                   congregation. nl,d indeed familiar.

     There   being no definite method of notation, the melodies of the
Ambrosian chant       became corrupted through their traditional trans
mission, when another innovator, St. Gregory the Great, a.d. 590,
purified the musical system — the principles of which had, in the
meantime, been elaborately expounded by Boethius, upon the authority
of the best Greek writers — added four additional modes of the Greeks
to those of Ambrose, and perpetuated his revised and extended system
by inventing a method of notation.
     Several centuries later, in accordance with the principle of innova
tion, which always directed the appropriation to ecclesiastical use of
what was best for the purpose, harmony was introduced in the form of
extempore descant upon the Gregorian chant ; and long after this, the
rules of written counterpoint were instituted.
     The ruling principle of the Reformation in England was to mould
the church service into a form " to be understanded of the people."
This was carried out, at first, in the translating of the Latin prayers,
&c., into the vernacular of the country ; and, in course of time, by
the Anglicising of the music. John Marbeck, by Cranmer's direction,
adapted the English version of the canticles, creed, &c., to the Ambro
sian chant, a.d. 1550.      The effect of this crude melody in bald unison
must have been uncongenial to the people, who, from Saxon times,
had always a fondness for simple harmony, to gratify which, the
responses were, in the time of Elizabeth, harmonized by Tallis and
others, for the uses of different cathedrals.        The original Roman
plain song for the canticles, &c., was subsequently harmonized by
Tallis; and, still later, original music was set to these portions of the
service by several composers, whose example has been followed by
church musicians down to the present time, though, for the most part,
with little regard to the primal purpose, which was, that the people
should participate in the performance.
     The Anglican chant was originated for the singing of the un-
metrical Psalms in English, for which it is better fitted than any
other musical form.
     The singing of metrical hymns was at all times a prominent feature
in the worship of religious reformers ; the Waldenses, the Lollards, the
Hussites, the Lutherans, the Calvinists, had each their metrical hymns,
in the performance of which all members of their community took part.
The practice became general in this country at the period of the Reform
ation, but, at first, as a substitution for the obscene songs that were
common among the people.         It was in the hope to purify their mouths
of these gross and profane subjects, that Thomas Sternhold, groom of the
robes to Edward VI., versified some of the Psalms, adapting his metres
to the ballad tunes of the day ; and these versified Psalms were printed,
without music, in 1549.       The desire to sing hymns in the celebration
of the service became so strong among the people, that in the 49th
injunction of Elizabeth, in 1559, it is expressly ordained that this
practice should be
                     " permitted " in churches ; in consequence of which,
the versification of the Psalms, begun by Sternhold, was completed by

596                     Mr. Macfarrtn            on the   Music          {   April 20,
Hopkins and others, and the whole Book of Psalms in metre, with
appropriate tunes — some of continental origin, some of English com
position — was printed in 1563.   These tunes were published without
harmony;    but in  1564  another  edition was printed, in harmony for
four voices, by various composers.      The love of psalm-singing grew
more and more general, as is proved by the many collections of har
monized tunes that followed this, and by Bishop Jewel's statement,
 that four or five thousand persons, assembled to hear the preaching at
  Paul's Cross, would all join in the hymn or psalm at its conclusion.
 The word anthem is substituted for hymn in the later Prayer Book of
  Elizabeth.   This term    is,
                              by many writers, derived from Antiphone,
 somewhat     anomalously, since       the only part of the service that
                                       it   is                                          is
  not usually antiphonal.     Dr. Johnson, more plausibly, traces              to it
  Antihymnus  ;   but the etymology of the Rev. J. P. Metcalf               to be
                                                                             is
 preferred, which assigns its originate Antithema, implying that               at  it
 first denoted free counterpoint against      given theme — the harmony to
                                                  a
  the psalm tune — analogous to Motet, the molettus or moving part
 against the Cantus Fermus of the Roman Church. Several illustrations
 of this definition prove the concise character originally purposed for
  the anthem, and point to the dereliction from this in the lengthy and
 complicated compositions of later times.
      The corruption of English church music had its root in the retention
 of the precentorship as a priestly office at the time of the Reformation,
 the period at which the study of music, like all other civil studies, first
  became common among the laity.        When music, the most modern of
 the arts. was in its embryo, the mastery of its few dogmatical rules
 was easily compatible with the study of theology, and hence                  was
                                                                               it
 as proper for the precentor to be       clerical officer as for the dean, his
                                             a
 only capitulary superior  ; but, now that the resources of this art are
 seemingly unlimited, now that the discovery of the natural principles
 which govern     ithas given      scientific basis, its full comprehension
                                  it

 pursuit of another profession. The effect of this great fundamental
evil was not felt till much later     but there can be now no question of
                                        :
 the impropriety of committing the entire control of the singers, the
choice of the music, and every arrangement and responsibility of this
highly important element of the church service, to an officer who                       is
not compulsorily acquainted with music. That some few precentors
have  a  knowledge of the subject which             their duty to direct, only

choirs, the ill esteem and consequent degradation of the choristers,
the often slovenly and always meagre performance of the service, and —
worst of all — the frequent aggravation of the evil                 by

      The music in parochial institutions has suffered, in proportion, from
 the control   of non-musicians ; and, though measures be taken for its
 improvement, no measures can be efficient that are not confided to
 persons whose education has qualified them for their fulfiment.
      The contributions to psalmody by persons with little musical
 education, or with none, began early in the last century, and have
 tended seriously to vulgarize and emasculate          this noble branch of
 church music. The misappropriation of the glee style of writing to
 church composition has done equally much to deteriorate the music
 special to the cathedral.     The admission of solo anthems has tended to
 make the church an arena for the display of the singers and for the
 indulgence of the audience, who have attended service more for the
 amusement of criticism than for the edification of prayer.         The adap
 tation of irrelevant words to music from the florid masses of composers
 of later times, from oratorios and from instrumental works, has
 perverted the composer's designed expression, which is the highest
quality in music, and has thus degraded the art and its influences.       The
adaptation    of secular  melodies  as  hymn   tunes cannot   be too  strongly
deprecated, since they are never divested of their secular associations.
The introduction of compositions by clerical amateurs or their friends,
whose social position has commanded          attention to their productions,
has often made the church a medium for the gratification of vanity, at
the expense of genuine artistry.       The attempt to revive the use in the
church, of the Greek system of music — which Ambrose introduced and
Gregory continued, because there was then none other accessible, pro
duces, if not an affectation of sanctity, at least a pedantic assumption of
antiquarianism that is as remote from devotion.             Moreover, this is
in direct contradiction to the principle of the Reformation, since the
G reek, or as it is called, the Ecclesiastical modes are not " understanded
of the people," and it would not be more opposed to the spirit of the
Church of England to make the people pray in Latin, than to make
them sing in the dead language of a musical system that is wholly
superseded.
     The capabilities of church    music, for the attainment of its two great
objects, are  only  to be  limited  by the genius and artistic cultivation of
the musicians who may devote themselves to its production and per
formance, where these are not thwarted by the non-musical authorities.
When either of the fine arts is admitted into sacred uses, the utmost
possible endeavour should be made to present that art at its best.        The
ambition of the ablest composers should therefore be stimulated to
seek their highest distinction in writing for the church, not in an
assumed manner that was once general for all subjects, and is now
conventionally considered as sacred, but in the style characteristic
of their own time, which, as such, will naturally best express their
own emotions       and best appeal       to the emotions     of others, and
distinguished from their own secular music by its greater elevation
of purpose and earnestness in the fulfilment of this ; such has been
the case with sacred      music from the madrigal era to our own time         ;

 and the examples        of Orlando Gibbons, Purcell, Bach, Handel,
 and Mendelssohn, are safe precedents.            Notwithstanding very strong
 prejudice to the contrary, the fitness for oratorios for performance
 on particular occasions in sacred edifices, merits earnest consideration,
 if not their unfitness for performance elsewhere ; it being remembered
 that the oratorio, in one of its forms, was originated by Giovanni
 Animuccia, for performance at the oratory meetings of S. Filippo Neri,
 in the church of S. Giovanni Laterano, A.D. 1556; and in its other
 form by Emilio Cavaliere. for performance in the church of Santa
 Maria, in Valice lla ; that the master-pieces of Bach were written for
 the celebration of the Passion in the Lutheran church, and that the
 oratorios of Handel were first given in public with apologies for their
 performance in a secular building.           Every pains should be taken to
 promote   choral  singing among      the laity, but no person should be per
mitted to participate in congregational singing who had not joined in a
 periodical practice for the same, or given proof of qualification.             The
 perfection of the plastic arts in Greece was attained by           the endeavour
 to do honour to the national religion ; the perfection               of Gothic or
 Christian architecture resulted from the same purpose :              be the hearts
of artists attuned to this glorious task, and the music of           the Church of
 England may approach that perfection towards which                  musical art at
 present seems to need some such stimulating impulse.

and hollow trunk, and feeble shoots — the very counterpart of our
English history in Church and State.
     There is one point in which, without any false pride, I may say
that Westminster Abbey stands alone amongst the buildings of the
world.      There are of course many which surpass it in beauty or
grandeur, — many which surpass it in the depth or sublimity of trains
of association ; but none have been entwined by so many long continuous
threads of diverse elements with the history of a whole nation.
     It is obvious that this complexity of interest makes it impossible in
any single lecture to do more than treat one single part of the subject.
I  might trace its gradual origin, from its geographical situation in the
Isle of Thorns ; from the charm of the name of St. Peter ; from
its neighbourhood to the palace of Westminster ; from the strange
enthusiasm of Edward the Confessor. I might show how architecturally
it represents the three great epochs of our national buildings ; how under
its first founder it was the earliest monument of Norman, European
civilization planted on our barbarous Anglo-Saxon soil ; how under
its second founder it was intended to be, and was, the most complete
and beautiful specimen of the most beautiful style that the middle ages
produced ; how under its third founder it exhibits the last magni
ficent decay of medieval art, in the Chapel of Henry VII.            I might
describe its close connection with the whole course of English history,
how it has witnessed the coronation of all, the burial of far the larger
number, of our sovereigns from the Conquest downwards ; how, whilst it
has been the seat of royalty, it has been the cradle of liberty ; how out
of its erection directly sprang, and within its precincts was first
sheltered, that great assembly which at this very moment concentrates
on itself the thoughts of the whole nation.
     I  might describe all the various assemblies and institutions which
it has thus guarded under its wings, not only the House of Commons,
but the ancient Treasury of England; the first English printing-press;
the early Councils of Westminster, the Westminster Assembly of
Presbyterian divines, the Convocations of the province of Canter
bury.     I might show how it is the seat of the great school which has
endeared the name of Westminster to the earliest years of so many
illustrious Englishmen ; how it has been the seat of the most honour
able, the most ancient, and the most meritorious order of English
knighthood.       I might describe its peculiar jurisdiction — its venerable
sanctuary, the refuge of kings as well as of outlaws ; its political
position and its religious functions as the metropolitan church of the
great city of Westminster; the long succession of abbots and of deans,
with the privileges and exemptions which render them and the institu
tion over which they preside one of the most peculiar in the Church
and State of England.
     I  might follow the kind hint thrown out to me by a well-known
Gazette yesterday evening, and lay before you for the consideration
of the Government and the public — what         I fear would be somewhat
more dry    — Mr.   Gilbert  Scott's  estimates for  the restoration of the

 600                       The Dean    of Westminster                 [April 27,
 great northern porch, the restoration of the Chapter House, and the
 building of a magnificent cloister at the south-east corner of the Abbey ;
 or a statement, drier still, of what the Dean and Chapter have been doing
 and are doing, with all the means in their power, for the preservation,
 reparation, and adornment of what already exists ; or the assurance,
 driest of all, that they have taken every precaution which the highest
 professional authorities can advise to ensure the venerable Abbey
 against the slightest danger from the subterranean Metropolitan Eail-
 way.
      I  have thought it best, however, to take one other single aspect of
 the whole subject : its importance as the burial-place of our cele
 brated men. It is this aspect, more than any other that       I  have named,
 which most endears it to the mass of our countrymen.           It is this that,
 more than any other, won for it the delightful visits of Addison, in the
 '                                                                  '
   Spectator ;' of Steele, in the ' Tatler ;' of Goldsmith, in the Citizen of
 the World ;' of Charles Lamb, in Elia ;' of Washington Irving, in the
                                        '
 '
   Sketch-book.'      It is this which intertwines it with so many eloquent
 passages in the writings of Macaulay.          It is this which inspired the
 saying    of  Nelson  — "a Peerage or Westminster Abbey." It is this
 which has twice within the present year given point to the speeches
 of one of our statesmen least likely to draw his illustrations from
 ecclesiastical buildings.     It is this which still gives most promise of
 vitality and immortality to the whole institution.       Kings are no longer
buried within our walls ; even the splendour of pageants has ceased
 to attract ; but the desire to be commemorated amongst the dead in
 Westminster Abbey is still as strong as ever.
      And yet, on the other hand, this very peculiarity is the one which
exposes the Abbey to the most severe criticism and attack.            There are
not a few who would wish, as the first step to any restoration, to clear
out from its venerable walls the strange pile of heterogeneous monu
ments which disfigure its beautiful architecture ; who complain, not
without reason, of the unequal value and unequal fame of the monu
ments themselves ; who protest against the intrusion into a Christian
church of grotesque forms and inappropriate inscriptions, such as exist
in no like degree elsewhere.
      It is to meet these conflicting tides of emotion, to act partly as a
guide through this interesting and intricate labyrinth, partly as an
apologist for these monumental stumbling-blocks and stones of offence,
that   I  propose to give a brief history of the growth of this part of
our institution, and to show that if ever it is to be cleared, it must
be touched with the tenderest care ; if it be a parasitical growth, it is
one which has struck its fibres so deep into the building, that if you
tear it rudely out you will perchance bring down the entire edifice
with it. Sooner or later the pruning must take place ; but for that
very reason let us well consider the whole relation of this sacred
mistletoe to the parent tree.
     In taking this subject, " have left," if I may use the words of
                                  I
Addison,
              " the repository of our English kings for the contemplation

of another    day, when     I shall feel my mind disposed for so serious an
amusement."        But there is a general consideration of the royal tombs

of Westminster which lies at the root of all that shall have to say of
 the private tombs.
     There are two great peculiarities which distinguish them from
 royal sepulchres in any other part of the world.              First, Westminster
 Abbey is connected not only with their deaths but their lives ; it unites
 their coronations with their burials.
                                •to
                                   That antique pile behold
                 Where royal heads receive the sacred gold ;
                 It gives them crowns, and does their ashes keep ;
                 Here made like gods, like mortals here they sleep:
                 Making the circle of their reign complete,
                Those suns of empire, where they rise, they set."
     And this striking connection is rendered more impressive from its
growth out of a noble characteristic of our English monarchy.                 The
Kings of England, unlike the sovereigns of other countries, never
seem to have feared the sight of death.              The Kings of France not
only  did  not  live   at  St. Denys,    but   never  went there.     Louis XIV.
chose Versailles for his residence instead of St. Germains, because
from the terrace of St. Germains he could see the hated towers
of the sepulchral abbey.          But the Anglo-Saxon kings were usually
buried at Winchester, where they also usually held their Court.
The English kings, as soon as they became purely English, were
buried, as they had lived, at Westminster.              As now they lie under
the shadow of their proudest regal residence, in St. George's Chapel,
or in the precincts of Windsor Castle, so in former days they lay
in the very closest neighbourhood to their palace, and in the very
midst of the life of their people.
     And this led yet further to the aspect of the Abbey which we have
now to consider. Had they been buried far away in some conventual
or secluded spot, or had the English nation stood aloof from the English
monarchy, it might have been otherwise.                 The sepulchral chapels
built by Henry III. and Henry          VII.   might    have  stood alone in their
glory : no    meaner    dust  need    ever  have mingled    with  the dust of the
Plantagenets,     Tudors,    Stuarts,   and  Guelphs.      The  Kings  of France
rest almost alone at St. Denys.            The Kings of Spain, the Czars of
Russia, the Emperors of Austria, rest absolutely alone in the vaults
of the Escurial, of Moscow, of St. Petersburg, of Vienna.               But it has
been the peculiar privilege of the Kings of England, that neither in life
nor in death have they been parted from their people. As the council
of the nation and the courts of law have pressed into the palace of West
minster, and engirdled the very throne itself, so the ashes of the great
citizens of England have pressed into the sepulchre of the kings, and
surrounded them, as with a guard of honour, after their death.                You
may remember the tomb of Maximilian at Inspruck, where the Em
peror's effigy lies encircled by the mailed figures of ancient chivalry,
Arthur and Clovis, of Rudolf and Cunegunda, of Ferdinand

602                       The Dean  of Westminster              [April 27,
Isabella.     A noble thought — yet not so noble as that which is in fact
realized in the very structure of Westminster Abbey, as it is in the
very structure of the English constitution.     When you are inclined to
contrast the placid dignity of our recumbent kings with Chatham,
 gesticulating from the northern transept, or Pitt from the western door,
or Shakespeare leaning on his column in Poets' Corner, or Wolfe
expiring beside the Confessor's Chapel, look upon them as each in
their different ways keeping guard over the shrine of our monarchy
and our laws, — and that which seems at first incongruous will then
become a symbol of the harmonious diversity in unity which pervades
 our whole commonwealth.
     Had the abbey of St. Denys admitted within its walls the poets and
 warriors and statesmen of France, who can say but that the kings
 might yet have remained inviolate in their graves? Had the monarchy
 of France connected itself with the great institutions of Church and
 State, assuredly it would not have fallen as it did in its imperial
 isolation.    Let us accept the omen for the Abbey of Westminster ; let
 us accept  it also for the Throne and State of England.
     It was only by slow degrees that this peculiarity of Westminster
 Abbey developed itself: in this respect, also, the counterpart of the
 irregular, uncertain gradual course of English history. There is
 no moment      at which we can fix the date when the idea of its
 becoming the national burial-place was formed, although we can
 trace the successive moments of its formation.         The very idea was
 new.    It is the earliest cemetery of the kind in Europe — we may say
 in the world ; for in classical times, such a segregation of the ashes of
 the greatly gifted from the ordinary mass of men was unknown ; and in
 the middle ages, so far as it existed at all, it was confined to canon
 ized saints.     No theory of the kind existed when the Confessor
 procured the first privileges of the Abbey, nor yet when Henry       III.
 planned the mausoleum of the Plantagenets ; nor even when Henry VII.
 laid the foundation of the mausoleum of the Tudors.
     The first intruders into the sacred floor were the immediate
favourites and retainers of the sovereigns.     It was the burial-place of
 the retainers of the adjacent Court of Westminster, just as now the
precincts of St. George's Chapel contain the burial-place of the
immediate dependents of the Castle of Windsor.
     Hugolin, the Confessor's chamberlain, leads the way — the terrible
financier who kept in check the mild benevolence of the child-like
king.     But he lies outside in the cloisters. He lies hard by the
ancient treasury, which he guarded so well — the tutelary genius of that
august vault, which still can only be entered by the sixfold keys of
the Lords of the Treasury and the Chancellor             and Controller of
the Exchequer.
     It is characteristic of the unbounded favouritism of Richard II.,
that the first who actually reached the interior of the church were those
whom he thus honoured amongst his courtiers.        Out of that temporary
evil, sprang up, as often happens, an immense permanent good.

1866.]                       on  Westminster Abbey.                        603
     The first was John of Waltham, his treasurer, who, amidst the
indignant murmurs of the outside world, was buried in the Confessor's
chapel itself.     His brass effigy can still be seen breaking up its mosaic
pavement, the venerable forerunner of all the statesmen in the Abbey.
The second, his tutor, Robert Waldby, at once physician and divine —
and thus the venerable forerunner of all the men of letters and science
— lies in the chapel at that time next in dignity to the chapel of St.
Edward, the chapel of the other royal Anglo-Saxon saint, St. Ed
mund. It is not without importance in the history of the Abbey to
 note this circumstance.         Next to the immediate neighbourhood of
the altar and the shrine of the patron saint, the most sacred chapels
were built on the south or sunny side, and accordingly the personages
who by rank or power approached most nearly to the king's person,
were interred in the two immediately adjoining the Confessor's
chapel on the south, of which the sanctity of at least the first was yet
more distinctly marked by the saint to whom it was dedicated.             The
two royal Anglo-Saxon saints especially honoured by Henry III.,
were Edward the Confessor, after whom he called his eldest son
Edward, and Edmund the Martyr, after whom he called his second
son.     In this and in the adjacent chapel of St. Nicholas, were interred
the lesser princes and princesses, and the succeeding courtiers of the
Plantagenet kings.
      It is in the age of Elizabeth that the first large increase took
place in the private monuments — the first distinct recognition of the
 Abbey as a Temple of Fame. Her favourites were heroes and heroines,
literally verifying Gray's description of her court : —
                    " Girt with many a Baron bold,
                        Sublime their starry fronts they rear;
                      And gorgeous dames, and statesmen old
                         In bearded majesty, appear."
      From that moment the chapels all round the Confessor's shrine, in
cluding those on the less frequented northern side, start into life, with the
tombs of Burleigh and Russell, and the warriors of the Flanders campaign,
all except the one unforgotten hero of those now forgotten wars, Sir
 Philip Sidney, who sleeps at St. Paul's, the forerunner by a long inter
 val of Nelson and Wellington.           In them the first-fruits of England's
 naval and military glory, by the special grace of the Virgin Queen,
 were offered up in the royal Abbey.           Then, amidst many dark shades
and stormy lights, follow the less worthy courtiers of James and
 Charles.     The towering grandeur and the tragical fall of George
 Villiers,  Duke     of Buckingham, is marked not only by the august
 monuments      of his parents and of himself, but by the fact that he, first
 of any subject not of royal descent, was deposited in the Chapel of
 Henry    VII.
      Then comes the strange period in the history of the Abbey which
 more than any other indicates the strong hold which it had laid on
the national feelings.        Not only did Cromwell prepare the vault for
the sepulchre of himself and his family in Henry VII. 's chapel (this

604                      1 he Dean of Westminster               [April 27,
might have been regarded as a purely dynastic ambition), but the
grandees of the Commonwealth, to whom it might have been thought
that the last home of royalty would have been in the highest degree
distasteful, could not part with the link which united them with the
Abbey.
     Indeed, this more than any other single epoch must be selected as
the point in which the thought of making the Abbey the mausoleum,
not only of kings, but of heroes, became firmly and ineradicably fixed
in the public mind.
     Pym and Strode, the leaders, and May, the historian of the
Long Parliamenl, Ireton and Bradshaw, the regicide chiefs, the
Parliamentary divines of the Westminster Assembly — and last, not
least, the great Admiral Blake, founder of our naval empire, were
amongst those worthies ; he, by the desire of the Protector, was
brought from Plymouth, where he died (to use the words of Clarendon),
" with all the state that could be, to encourage his officers to venture
their lives, that they might be pompously buried, and he was, with all
the solemnity possible, and at the charge of the public, interred in
Henry VII.'s chapel, among the monuments of the kings."
     This is the first distinct assertion that interment in Westminster
Abbey was, like ancient knighthood or modern peerage, an incentive
to heroic deeds.
     These great men, by what Dr. Johnson justly calls " the mean
revenge" of the Restoration, were cast out of the Abbey. They still,
however, repose beneath its shade, and the impulse their burial gave
to its historical glories transmitted itself to the next generation with a
force that has gone on increasing ever since.
     The crowd of monuments takes a new start after the Eestoration
and Revolution.       The warriors, for the most part, are where Sir
Roger de Coverley saw them, in the nave and in the northern chapels,
and in one or other of those spots they have always continued to be
laid.   The statesmen, after the example of the Commonwealth, were
allowed to throng the vacant spaces in Henry VII.'s chapel till no
more remained. By the middle of the eighteenth century the race of
English statesmen not only had increased in importance, but also had
become so much more of a class separate from the mere magnates of
the court or camp, as to require, if possible, a separate resting-place.
In this the history of the Abbey and the history of England alike
coincided. At that same juncture, every important part of the church
was more or less occupied, with one exception. The northern transept,
like the northern side of a country churchyard — like the Pelasgicum
under the dark shadow of the north wall of the Athenian Acropolis —
had remained in comparative solitude ; but, like the Pelasgicum under
the pressure of the Peloponnesian war, this too was now to be occupied.
One great name determined its fate for ever. For the body of William
Pitt, Earl of Chatham, the two great sepulchral churches of the
metropolis contended ; but Parliament decided against St. Paul's and
in favour of Westminster, on the ground that the imperial statesman

 1866.]                       on Westminster Abbey.                              605
should be brought near to the dust of kings — and Chatham, accordingly,
was buried with almost regal pomp in the vault by the northern
entrance. From that time the northern transept has been appropriated
to the burial of statesmen.           " In no other country," says Macaulay,
"do so many great citizens lie within so narrow a space. High over
those venerable graves towers the stately monument of Chatham, and
from above, his effigy, graven by a. cunning hand, seems, with eagle
face and outstretched arm, to bid England be of good cheer and hurl
defiance at her foes ;" that eagle face " which seemed to Wilberforce,
as he bore the banner before the hearse of the second Pitt, to look
down from above with consternation into the dark house which was
receiving all that remained of so much power and glory."
     " Death," as Bossuet finely says, " is closing up the ranks," and
already a new statesmen's corner (the Whigs' corner, as it is some
times called) is forming in the north-west corner of the nave, near the
monument of Fox ; but whether there or elsewhere,                 I trust that the
time will never come when the succession of English statesmen, of what
ever party, will look to any other place than the Abbey as their long
last home.
     From the north transept         I  turn to the south.       This, the sunny,
propitious side of the Abbey, had already been long filled before the
occupation of its counterpart on the north. The fate of this, too, was
determined by a single grave.
     In the time of Henry IV., in the first year of the fifteenth century,
there was laid in this transept, doubtless from his official connection with
the Court, the Clerk of the Works at Westminster.                   That Clerk of
the Works, thus humbly interred in what was then the outer court of
the temple, was Geoffrey Chaucer.             The simple slab of gray marble
which covered his grave — broken up, alas ! two centuries ago— was
the first nucleus of Poets' Corner.             But, if it was merely an acci
dental connection which brought him within that close proximity to
his royal masters, the sense of the royal character of genius clenched
the prominence thus gained.            Henceforth, as one of themselves ex
pressed  it —
                      "  Our poets near our princes sleep,
                        And in one grave their mansion keep."
     Accordingly, in the great burst of Elizabethan literature, this was
the spot to which Spenser was naturally brought.               The wish which he
had expressed     in  his   life, to follow   "  Dan  Chaucer,    well of English
undefiled," was distinctly carried out in the original epitaph on his
gravestone : — Hie prope Chaucerum situs est Spenserius                 ille Proxi-
mus ingenio, proximus et tumulo."
     And it is over his grave that the cry arose on the death          of  a greater
than either  :—
                "  Renowned Spenser — lie a thought more nigh
                   To learned Chaucer — and rare Beaumont lie
                   A little nearer Spenser — to make room
                   For Shakespeare   in your threefold fourfold tomb."

606                       The Dean    of Westminster                [April 27,
     Shakespeare, it is true, came not, nor was his monument erected
even till years afterwards.        But the sacred line was never broken.
The quaint expression of Fuller has become more appropriate with
each succeeding generation : that
                                        " this royal company of poets in the
southern transept     of  Westminster     Abbey is enough almost to make
passengers'   feet  move  metrically,  who   go over the place where so much
poetical  dust  is interred."   If  a new   Poets' Corner should be needed,
a single name has again predestined the spot.               In the south-west
corner of the nave the religious feeling of a near kinsman has fixed
the statue of Wordsworth,         beside the font in the baptistry.      There
may many a childlike spirit catch its first impression of the purest and
simplest of English poets, — the fitting Chaucer of a new generation.
     Close beside the poets, yet distinct from them, gradually rose
another group of tombs.         Isaac Casaubon, scholar, divine, and histo
rian, "lieth entombed," I again quote Fuller, "in the south transept of
Westminster Abbey ;" and then he adds, with an emphasis which marks
the first in a new and long succession, " not in the east or poetical side
thereof, but in the west or historical side of the aisle."        Immediately
following, and immediately adjoining, so as to continue and confirm
this idea, is the memorial of Camden. " Both of them," I must use
the words in which Fuller describes their appearance in his day,
 " both plain tombs, made of white marble, show the simplicity of
their intentions, the candidness of their natures, and the perpetuity of
their memorials."
     The historical branch could not be kept long apart from the
poetical branch which grew so near.             Gradually the south transept
became equally devoted to them both.              Their junction in the same
corner of the Abbey is a proof of the instinctive need for the indis
soluble union of fact and poetry, of learning and imagination ; and
when the last grave was opened in that aisle to receive the remains of
Macaulay, although he fitly lies on the historical side of the transept,
yet his companionship would not have been disdained by the brightest
and loftiest of the poets who look down upon his tomb from the
opposite wall.      The union of the historical and poetical corner in the
 Abbey is a standing protest against the vulgar literary heresy which
 denies Clio to be a Muse.
      Connected with the historians and poets is a group of celebrities
 whose introduction into the Abbey has a peculiar signification of its
 own. There is a remarkable passage in Mr. Lecky's ' History of
 Rationalism in Europe,' in which he contrasts the conduct of the
 French and English churches towards dramatists and actors : whilst
 the great French actors were buried with the burial of dogs, the great
 English actors, during the whole of the last century, were interred
 without a murmur in our chief sanctuary. Of all the visits recorded to
 the Abbey, next after Addison in the ' Spectator,' the most impressive
 is the account which Steele, in the ' Tatler,' gives of his waiting in the
 cloisters for the funeral of Betterton.        In those cloisters, perhaps, or
 in the nave, from a natural sense of congruity, was buried, rather

1866.]                     on  Westminster Abbey.                       607
than in the transept, that first of English actors, with some of his
compeers ; but they soon readied the interior portions of the church.
Garrick lies — where else could he lie ? — at the feet of Shakespeare.
Charles Kemble took his place amongst the statesmen :          I trust that
I   shall be considered to have exercised a not unwise discretion in
having moved him to the chapel of St. Andrew, by the side of his
sister, Mrs. Siddons.
      This admission of actors is an amount of tolerance against which
not only the religious world, but the gentle and genial spirit of
Charles Lamb lifted up his voice ; but the same eminent writer whom
I  just now cited, has truly said that " this forbearance of the Church of
England towards the stage has received its reward ; and that, if we
except the short period after the Restoration, the English theatre has
been that in which the moralist can find least to condemn."
      Closely connected with the lessons of the stage come the musicians
— in their first beginnings equally balanced between the Theatre and
the Church.      They, too, in the person of Henry Lawes, the friend of
Milton, first appear in the cloisters, but finally find their Musicians'
 Corner where it was most fitting — in the north aisle, behind the organ
— as it was inscribed on the grave of the first and most illustrious who
 was there interred, Henry Purcell, " dum vicina organa spirant,"
 " where the neighbouring organs breathe." One only, greatest of all,
 stands apart from his musical brethren, in Poets' Corner.          Handel,
 the author of the ' Messiah,' was not unfitly interred amongst the
 prophets of English song.
      With the musicians the history of art in the Abbey exhausts itself.
 The sculptors and architects are only very imperfectly represented,
 painting not at all, with the single exception of Sir Godfrey Kneller,
 whose monument is here against his will, and as the result of a personal
 quarrel at Twickenham.        Sir Joshua Reynolds's burial in St. Paul's
 has carried with it the commemoration of all future painters to that
 great cathedral.
      It is a proof of the slow and gradual growth of science in England
 that it has not appropriated to itself any special place in the Abbey,
 but has penetrated promiscuously and imperceptibly into every part,
 much as it has in like manner influenced all our social and literary
  relations.
       Sir Isaac Newton was the first. It must, perhaps, be said that of
 all the graves in the Abbey, his is the only one which retains the dust
 of an absolutely world-wide fame. The place that was given to him
  was in proportion to the just admiration for his prodigious genius. It
  was that conspicuous spot, coveted by many nobles and statesmen, on
  the right hand of the entrance of the nave from the choir.      It may be
  that this was the cause of the attraction of other scientific men round
  the walls of the nave — Conduitt, Koikes ; then that splendid generation
  of illustrious physicians who, in that age, as some of their successors in
  our own, combined with their healing art the keenest interest in scholar
  ship and science — Chamberlen, Woodward, Mead, and Freind. From

 608                            The Dean     of Westminster                      [April   27,
 that time the memorials of the victories of science spread irregularly
 from chapel to chapel, till they culminated in the gigantic monument
  of James Watt. Of all the monuments in the Abbey, perhaps this is
  the one which calls forth the loudest execration from those who look
  only for congruity or uniformity of design.                    Well might the ancient
  pavement       of the   church    crack  and   yawn,    as  it did, when the enormous
  monster moved into its place, disclosing rows upon rows of gilded
  coffins in the vaults beneath.              Well might the standard bearer of
  Agincourt and the stately worthies of the courts of Elizabeth and James
  have started from their tombs in the chapel of St. Paul as they saw this
  colossal champion of a new plebeian art enter their aristocratic resting-
  place, and take up his position in the centre of the little sanctuary,
  regardless of all proportion or style in the surrounding objects.                      Yet
  when we consider what this vast figure represents — what worlds of
  interest before unknown, what revolutions in the whole outward frame
  work of modern society lie in that capacious lap — there is surely a
  fitness even in its very incongruity.             If  it be an exaggeration, it repre
  sents an exaggeration which has almost overrun the Abbey itself, and
  which meets us in street and field, on sea and land, down vale and
  over hill, from end to end of the civilized world.
        I  have thus gone very rapidly through the monumental structure
  of the Abbey.          It is the mere skeleton, or rather joints of the skeleton.
  The flesh and colour and features would require hours to describe.
  But there are a few general remarks which this rapid survey suggests.
        1. First, observe how extremely irregular, and, as it would seem,
 capricious, is the commemoration, or absence of commemoration, of our
  famous men.           It is this which renders the interment or notice within
 our walls an uncertain honour, and makes the Abbey itself a very im
 perfect mausoleum of greatness.                 But it is this also which gives to it
 that perfectly natural character of which any artificial collection is
 entirely destitute. In the Valhalla of Bavaria, every niche is carefully
 portioned out, and if a single bust is wanting from the catalogue of
 German worthies, its absence becomes the subject of a literary contro
 versy, and the vacant space is at last filled.                   Not so in the Abbey :
 there, as in English institutions generally, no fixed principle has
 prevailed.        Graves have been opened or closed — monuments erected
 or not       erected,   from the most various feelings of the time.                It is the
 general      wave    only   that  has  borne   in  the   great   celebrities.    Viewed   in
 this way,      the absences     of  which  I  speak    have   a touching significance of
 their    own.    They    are  eloquent  of the   force   of domestic   and local affection
over      the  desire   for  metropolitan     or  cosmopolitan      distinction  — eloquent
of    the   force  of  the  political  and  ecclesiastical      prejudice   at the  moment.
 Why are men so famous as Burke or Peel amongst statesmen, as Pope
or Gray amongst poets, not in the Statesmen's or the Poets' Corner?
Because the patriarchal feeling in each of these men — so different each
from the other, yet alike in this — drew them from the neighbourhood of
the great, with whom they consorted in the tumult of life, to the graves
of father and mother, or beloved child, far away to the country church

  1866.]                   on  Westminster Abbey.                         609
 yards of Twickenham, Stoke Pogis, Tamworth, Beaconsfield — in each
 perhaps not unmingled with the feeling which is expressed in Pope's
 epitaph on himself at Twickenham, " for one that would not be buried
 in Westminster Abbey ": —
                    **
                       Heroes and kings your distance keep,
                       In peace let one poor poet sleep,
                       Who never flattered folk like you.
                       Let Horace blush, and Virgil too."
     Why is it that Montague, Earl of Sandwich, George Monk, Earl
of   Albemarle, restorers of the monarchy, Archbishop              Usher, the
glory of the Irish Church, Clarendon, the historian of the Great
 Rebellion, rest here with no cotemporary monument, three of them
with none at all ?       That blank void tells again in the bare stones
the often repeated story of the ingratitude of Charles      II. towards those
to whom he owed so much and gave so little.
     Why is it that Wordsworth and Southey have no grave ? Scott and
Burns no grave or monument ? Because the affection of the two first for
their homes by their mountain lakes, the association of the two others
with their mother-country, was too strong to be sacrificed to any uni
formity in the distribution of sepulchral honours.
     Westminster Abbey is, as Dr. Johnson well said, the natural
resting-place of those great men who have no bond elsewhere. Its
metropolitan position has. in this respect, powerfully contributed to
its fame. But even London is or ought to be insignificant compared
with England ; even Westminster Abbey must at times yield to the
more venerable, more enduring claims of home and of race.               Those
quiet graves far away are the Poets' Corners of a yet vaster temple ;
or may we take it yet another way, and say that Stratford-on-Avon,
or Dryburgh, or Grasmere are Chapels-of-ease united by invisible
cloisters with Westminster Abbey itself?
     2. Again, within the circle of those who are buried or commemo
rated here, the selection of particular spots are again and again to be
traced to the sentiment of the man or of the moment, rather than to
any general plan or permanent scheme.            I have shown how the main
groups have formed themselves, as it were accidentally, round par
ticular centres of death.     But, besides this, the same principle applies
in the exceptional details.      Why was Atterbury buried at the extreme
west end ? Because, as he himself said, he wished to lie as far as
possible removed from kings and kaisers — from the royal races at the
eastern end, to those he had so little reason, either in life or death,
to be grateful.      Why is Addison buried apart from his tuneful
brethren, in the royal shades of Henry VII. 's chapel?            Because he
wished, and was permitted, to lie in the vault of his" own loved
Montague, who had achieved his place there by long and powerful
statesmanship. Why was Usher buried in the chapel of St. Paul ?
Because he wished to rest beside his earliest instructor, Sir John
Fullerton. Why (to take a less known instance) did the tablet of
                                                                2i2

610                         The Dean   of Westminster             [April   27,
Captain Creed, in the Dutch wars, hang where it once did (nor is it
now far removed), in the northern aisle of the nave?              Because, as
the inscription tells us, he used often in life to look at the neighbouring
monument, where his kinsman, the Earl of Sandwich, is mentioned,
whose virtues he strove to emulate.        Why was Vertue, the engraver,
buried in the west cloister ? Because he was a Roman Catholic, and
wished to be interred by a collateral ancestor who had been a monk
in the Abbey in its older days. Why was Lord Palmerston's grave
chosen exactly where it           in the northern, or Macaulay's in the
                                is,
southern, transept?      Because      was fitting that the one should lie as
                                      it
near as possible to his first patron, Canning       ;   the other, as near as
possible to the foot of the statue of his favourite Addison.
     These special attractions towards particular graves and monuments
may interfere with the general uniformity of the Abbey, but they
immensely enhance its interest and its instruction      ;   they make us feel
that  it   not
           is    mere dead museum, but that its cold stones are warmed
                    a
with the life-blood of human ,affections and personal partiality.         Itis
said that the celebrated French sculptor of the monument of Peter
the Great, at St. Petersburg, after showing its superiority in detail to
the famous equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius at Rome, ended by
the candid avowal, " Et cependant cette mauvaise bete est vivante, et
la mienne est morte."        Perhaps       may be allowed to reverse the
                                           I
saying, and when        contrast the irregularities of Westminster Abbey
                        I
with the uniform congruity of Salisbury or of the Valhalla, may say,
" Cette belle bfite est morte, mais la mienne est vivante."
     3. Again, observe how magnificently the strange conjunction of
tombs in what has been truly called this Temple of silence and recon
ciliation exemplifies the wide toleration of Death      ;  may
                                                            I     not add, the
comprehensiveness     of the true religion of the Church of England   ?   .Not
only does Elizabeth lie in the same vault with Mary her persecutor, and
in the same chapel with Mary her victim not only does Pitt lie side
                                               ;                            by
side with Fox, and Macpherson with Johnson, and Outram with Clyde,
but those other deeper differences, which are often thought to part
more widely asunder than any political or literary or military jealousy,
here have sunk into the shade.             Goldsmith, in his visit to the
Abbey, puts    into the  mouth  of  his Chinese   philosopher an exclamation
of wonder that the guardianship of a national temple should be con
fided to " college of priests."
                a                     I do not claim for my predecessors the
Deans of Westminster any exemption from the ordinary infirmities of
their profession     but the variety of the monuments, in country and in
                        ;
creed, as well as in taste and in politics,    is
                                               a    proof that the successive
 Deans who have held the keys of St. Peter's Abbey have, on the
whole, risen to the greatness of their situation, and have endeavoured
to embrace within the wide sympathy of their consecrated precincts,
those whom a narrow and sectarian spirit might have excluded, but
whom the precepts of their common Master, no less than the instincts
of their common humanity, should have bid them welcome. The
exclusiveness of Englishmen has given way before the claims of the

 1866.]                     on Westminster Abbey.                            6H
French Casaubon, the German Spanheim, the Corsican Paoli. The ex-
clusiveness of churchmen has allowed the entrance of the Nonconformist
 Watts, of the Roman Catholic Dryden.             Courayer, the French priest
who ended as an English latitudinarian of the extremest kind — the
Blanco White of his day ; Ephraim Chambers, the sceptic of the humbler,
and Sheffield, the sceptic of the higher ranks, were buried with all
respect and honour by the "college of priests" at Westminster, who
 knew that the bruised reed was not to be broken, nor the smoking flax
quenched.      Even the yet harder question of high intellectual gifts,
united with moral infirmity or depravity, has on the whole here met
with the only solution which on earth can be given.               If Byron was
turned away from our doors, many a one as questionable as Byron has
been admitted.      The godlike gift of genius was recognized, the baser
earthly part was left to the merciful judgment of its Creator.           So long
as Westminster Abbey maintains its hold on the affections or respect
of the English Church and nation, so long will it remain a standing
proof that there is in the truest feelings of human nature, and in the
highest aspirations of religion, something deeper and wider than the
partial judgments of the day and the technical distinctions of sects,
— even than the just, though it may for the moment be misplaced,
indignation against the errors and sins of our brethren.               It is the
involuntary homage which perverted genius pays to the superior worth
of goodness and of holiness, that it seeks to be at last laid within the
building consecrated to the highest and purest hopes of the soul of man ;
and when we consent to receive such within our walls, it is the best
acknowledgment of the truth uttered by our departed Christian poet —
          " There is no light but Thine — with Thee all beauty glows."
     There is yet another interest attaching to the tombs, even the worst
and humblest, namely, as a record of the vicissitudes of art.         Doubtless,
this is shared by Westminster Abbey with other great cathedrals and
churches. Still the record here is more continuous and more striking
than anywhere else.         We trace here, better than anywhere else, the
gradual rising of the recumbent effigies : first, to lean their heads on
their elbows, then to kneel, then to sit, then to rise, stand on their feet,
then to gesticulate, then to ascend out of flimsy waves into still flimsier
clouds. Every stage of sepulchral attitude is visible, from the
crusader of the thirteenth century, with his legs crossed on his stony
couch, to the philanthropist of the nineteenth century, with his
legs crossed far otherwise, as he lounges in his easy arm-chair.
Forgive them : it may be a breach of the rules of medieval art, but
it is also the life of the nation, awkwardly, untowardly struggling into
upward existence.
     We trace also the evanescent phases of the judgments of art,
which ought to make the artists and the critics of each successive age
if not sceptical, at least modest, as to their own immortality. We
are shocked sometimes at the ruthless disregard of ancient days, in
which the old altars of the separate chapels were stamped out for tht

Reformers or the Puritans.           But the same disregard of antiquity
reaches back far earlier.      Ecclesiam strarit istam quam tunc renovavit
•— -was the
             inscription which long glorified the memory of Henry      III.  for
 destroying the venerable Norman church of the Confessor.           Henry V.'s
chantry absorbed a large part of the tombs of Eleanor and Philippa.
The first prodigious intrusion of Pagan allegories, the first reckless
mutilation of medieval architecture by modern monuments, is the tomb
of George Villiers, the favourite of our first high-church king, the
patron and friend of our first high-church archbishop.            It was their
sanction and influence that began the desecration,         as it is now often
thought, which to no section of church or state is so repugnant as
to the spiritual descendants of those to whom it seemed the height of
ecclesiastical propriety.
     Or again, look at the enormous structures which Roubilliac raised
in the nave to General Wade and General Hargrave.              We pass them
by with scorn, but a great London antiquary declared of one of them,
that " Europe could hardly show a parallel to it," — and the other was
deemed by the artist himself so splendid a work, that he used to come
and weep before    it,  to see that  itwas put too high to be appreciated.
We pass with ridicule the clumsy rocks and the wretched allegories
of the latter part of the eighteenth century. Yet the germ of Admiral
Tyrrel's maritime monsters may be seen in Addison's plaintive wish,
— " that our naval monuments might, like the Dutch, be adorned with
rostral courses and naval ornaments, with beautiful festoons of sea
weed, shells, and coral."       And listen to the criticisms of   a  fastidious
correspondent of Pope, and observe the remedy which he proposes —
     " chose        place for my wife," says Aaron Hill, " in the Abbey
                                                                          :
      I        a

to leave me no room to distinguish her monument.               But there   is
                                                                           a
low and unmeaning lumpishness in the vulgar style of monuments
which disgusts me as often as        I    look upon them   ;  and, because    I
would avoid the censure   I     am giving, let me beg you to say whether
there  is   significance in the draught, of which        I    enclose you     a
copy. The flat table behind          is black, the figures are white marble.
The whole of what you see       is   but part of the monument, and will be
surrounded by pilasters, arising from        a    pediment of white marble,
having its foundation on    a    black marble mountain, and supporting a
cornice and dome that will ascend to the point of the cloister arch.
About half-way up craggy path, on the black mountain below, will
                     a
be the figure of Time in white marble, in an attitude of climbing,
obstructed by little Cupids, of the same colour; some rolling stones
into his path from above, some throwing nets at his feet and arms from
below ;   others in ambuscade, shooting at him from both sides        ;   while
the Death you see in the draught will seem, from an opening between
hills in relievo, to have found admission by shorter way, and prevented
                                                a
Time at distance."
          a
     Look at the monument of General Wolfe, and then tremble for the
narrow escape which we have had that       it   did not thrust itself into the

1866.]                       on Westminster Abbey.                        613
place of the exquisite mediaeval tomb of Aymer de Valence, nephew of
Henry III., as it actually did with the tomb and screen of Abbot
Estenby.
         I
       " will give you one instance that will sum up the vanity of
                                                                         great
men, learned men, and buildings altogether.            I heard lately, that
Dr. Pearce, a very learned personage, had consented to let the tomb of
Aymer de Valence, Earl of Pembroke, a very great personage, be
removed for Wolfe's monument ; that at first he had objected, but was
wrought upon by being told that hight Aymer was a Templar, a
very wicked set of people, as his lordship had heard, though he knew
nothing of them, as they are not mentioned by Longinus, and I wrote
to his lordship, expressing my concern that one of the finest and most
ancient monuments in the Abbey should be removed, and begging, if
 it was removed, that he would bestow it on me, who would erect and
 preserve it at Strawberry Hill.       After a fortnight's deliberation, the
 bishop sent me an answer, civil indeed, and commending my zeal for
 antiquity ! but, avowing the story under his own hand. He said that at
 first they had taken Pembroke's tomb for a Knight Templar's, — that,
 upon discovering whose it was, he had been very unwilling to consent
 to the removal, and at last had obliged Wilton to engage to set the
 monument up within ten feet of where it stands at present."
       In this attack on my good predecessor, Horace Walpole had all
 the world on his side, and possibly the world's judgment is now fixed
 for   ever.   Yet, perhaps, if some successor of Dean Pearce were now,
  in the enthusiasm of modern restoration, to remove General Wolfe,
  I  am not sure whether he might not incur the wrath of some future
  Walpole, the ridicule of some future Royal Institution.
       There are, doubtless, " lumpish
                                           " monuments which obstruct
                                                                           the
  architecture, which have no historical reason for being where they are,
  which might be much more fittingly placed in other parts of the
  Abbey. On these, so far as friends and survivors will permit, I would
  have no mercy. But still, even in these cases, and much more in
 others, I shall always have before my eyes the salutary terror of the
  projected misdeed of Zachary Pearce.
       4. Lastly, the same mixture of mortification and satisfaction which
  is impressed upon us as we see, in the monuments, the proof of the
  fallibility of artistic judgment, is impressed upon us in a deeper sense
  as we read in the history of their graves, or their epitaphs, a like
  fallibility of moral and literary judgment.
       In this way the obscure poets and warriors who have attained the
  places which we now so bitterly grudge them, teach us a lesson never
  to be despised.    They tell us the works or the deeds in which our fathers
  delighted ; they remind us that the tombs and the graves which now so
  absorb our minds may in like manner cease to attract our posterity ;
  they put forward their successors to plead for their perpetuation — at
  least in the one place where alone, perhaps, a hundred years hence
  neither will be remembered.      And if a mournful feeling is left upon our
  minds by the thought that so many celebrities, great in their day, have

  614        The Dean   of Westminster      on Westminster Abbey.  [April 27,
  been wholly forgotten, yet here and there the monuments contain the
  more reassuring record, that there are glories which increase instead of
  diminishing as time rolls on, and that there are judgments in art and in
  literature, as well as in character, which never will be reversed.
       As in Henry    VII. 's chapel, the eye rests with peculiar interest on
  Lord Dundonald's banner, fifty          years ago torn from its place, and
  kicked ignominiously down the flight of steps, yet within our own time,
  on the day of the old sailor's funeral, reinstated by the herald at the
  gracious order of the Sovereign — so the like reparation is constantly
  working on a larger scale elsewhere.
       The inscription on Spenser's tomb shows that even then the time
 had not arrived when the true Prince of Poets was acknowledged
 in his rightful supremacy ; yet he came at last, and the statue of

 Camden's monument, defaced by some " base villain in the civil wars,
 was restored as we now see it by the University of Oxford — that same
 University from which in his earlier struggles he had vainly sought a
 Fellowship or a Degree, — one of the many instances of generous
 repentance by which Oxford has repaid her shortcomings to her eminent
 sons.    The slow growth of Milton's fame is yet more clearly marked.
 Not only were his remains laid unregarded by the great and learned in
 their obscure grave, at St. Giles's, Cripplegate, whilst Cowley, a few
 years before, had been conveyed to his resting-place in Poets' Corner with
 all the honours that the rank and wit of London could furnish, — but
 when the tablet of John Philipps, the author of ' The Splendid
 Shilling,' was erected in the Abbey, containing two lines in which he
 was described in the epitaph as uni Miltono secundus, " second to
 Milton alone," the then Dean of Westminster, Bishop Sprat, insisted
 on their erasure, not because of their absurd exaggeration, but because
 his royalist prejudices could not bear that the name of the regicide
 Milton should appear anywhere within the walls of the Abbey. But
 Sprat was succeeded by Atterbury, and Atterbury, even if he did not
 write the inscription on Phillips, was one of the first profound
 admirers of ' Paradise Lost.'         When the Westminster scholars came
 to visit him in the Tower, before his exile, to bid him farewell, he
 could find no words so appropriate as those from his beloved poet : —
                 " The world   was all before him where to choose
                   His place of rest, and Providence his guide."
      He  at once admitted the obnoxious comparison. Another few years,
and    " such was the change of public opinion," said Dr. Gregory to
                        I
Dr. Johnson, "that have seen erected within the church a bust of that
man whose name       I once knew considered a pollution of its walls." And
yet a few years pass again, and when Gray's monument was erected, it
was not to Chaucer or even to Shakespeare, but to Milton, that the
refined and courtly Muse is pointing, with words which celebrate the
glory of Milton even more than the glory of Gray.                 Who would

      On Recent Progress in the History of proposed Substitutes                 for
                                       Gunpowder.
The changes which have been effected in the composition of gunpowder
since its first application as a propelling agent, have been limited to
small variations in the proportions of its constituents.                      But the
modifications which have from time to time been introduced into
the details of its manufacture, e. g. the preparation of the ingredients,
their incorporation, and the conversion of the mixture into compact
masses (grains, &c.) of different size and density, have been sufficiently
important and successful to secure the fulfilment by gunpowder, in a
more or less efficient manner, of the very various requirements of
military science and of different branches of industry.
     The characteristics of gunpowder, as an explosive material of
permanent character, the action of which is susceptible of great modifi
cation, are mainly ascribable to the peculiar properties of the oxidizing
agent, saltpetre.        Frequent attempts have been made to replace this
constituent of gunpowder by other nitrates (such as those of sodium,
lead, and barium) ; but, although materials suitable for blasting opera
tions have been thus prepared (such as soda-gunpowder, and barytic
powder, or poudre saxifragine),              all mixtures of this class, hitherto
produced,     have    exhibited   important   defects, when compared with gun
powder     manufactured      for   propelling  purposes.
     The well-known oxidizing agent, chlorate of potash, which differs

1866.]        History of proposed Substitutes for  Gunpowder.         617
from saltpetre only in containing chlorine in the place of nitrogen, is
far more energetic in its action upon oxidizable bodies than any of the
nitrates.    Thus, a mixture of chlorate of potash with charcoal alone,
deflagrates as violently as gunpowder, and is far more readily inflamed
by percussion than the latter ; while a mixture analogous to gunpowder,
containing chlorate of potash in place of saltpetre, detonates violently
when struck with moderate force, and acts far too destructively, on
account of the rapidity of its explosion, to admit of its safe employ
ment in fire-arms.
     Many years ago, a mixture known as German or white gunpowder,
and consisting of chlorate of potash, ferrocyanide of potassium, and
sugar, was proposed and tried without success as a substitute for
gunpowder ; and since then many preparations of similar character
have been suggested for employment either as blasting and mining
agents, or for use in shells, or even for all the purposes to which
gunpowder is applied.        The most promising of these, claimed as
discoveries by Mr. Horsley and Dr. Ehrhardt, are mixtures of chlorate
of potash with substances of permanent character and readily obtained,
containing both carbon and hydrogen ; such as tannic and gallic acids,
and some kinds of resins.      These mixtures are much less violently
detonating than most of the explosive mixtures containing chlorate of
potash, while, if well prepared, they are decidedly more powerful, as
 explosives, than gunpowder.      For blasting purposes, some of these
 mixtures probably possess decided advantages over ordinary blasting
 powder, and possibly they may also be susceptible of employment for
sporting purposes ; but they are not applicable to fire-arms used for
war-purposes, because, in order to ensure the requisite uniformity of
action, the ingredients must be submitted to proper processes of
 incorporation. &c, such as are applied to the manufacture of gun
powder ; and this treatment would render the mixtures far more
violent, and consequently destructive in their action upon fire-arms,
 than if used in the form of crude mixtures.
     A comparatively very safe application of chlorate of potash to the
 production of a substitute for gunpowder was made about six years
ago by a German chemical manufacturer, M. Hochstadter.            Unsized
 (blotting) paper was thoroughly soaked in, and coated with, a thin
 paste consisting of chlorate of potash, finely-divided charcoal, a small
 quantity of sulphide of antimony, and a little starch, gum, or some
similar binding material, water being used as the solvent and mixing
 agent. The paper was rolled up very compactly and dried in that
 form.    In this manner, very firm rolls of an explosive material are
 obtained, which burns with considerable violence in open air, and the
 propelling effect of which, in small arms, has occasionally been found
 greater than that of a corresponding charge of rifle powder.      More
 over, the material, if submitted in small portions to violent percussion,
 exhibits but little tendency to detonation.      But as no reliance can
 be placed on a sufficient uniformity of action, in a fire-arm, of these
 explosive rolls, this alone sufficed to prevent their competing with

618          Professor Abel    on the Recent  Progress in   the    [May   4,
powder.    The same description of explosive preparation, differing only
from that of M. Hochstfidter in a trifling modification of its compo
sition, which is certainly not likely to lead to its greater success, has
recently been brought forward in this country by M. Reichen and
Mr. Melland.
     One or two other much cruder explosive preparations, containing
chlorate of potash, alone or in conjunction with saltpetre, have met with
some application to blasting purposes.      One of these consisted of spent
tan, in small fragments, which was saturated with the oxidizing agent,
and afterwards dusted over with sulphur.         When flame or a red-hot
iron is applied to this preparation, it deflagrates very slowly and im
perfectly; but when employed in blast-holes, where it is confined within
a small space, it develops sufficient explosive force to do good work.
In addition to comparative cheapness, the great advantage of safety
was claimed for this material by its inventor, a claim which was sub
stantiated by the partial destruction by fire, on two occasions, of a
manufactory of the substance near Plymouth, without the occurrence
of an explosion.
     The accidental explosions of gunpowder which are occasionally
heard of, occur, in most instances, at the manufactories, and in the
course of some operation (especially that of incorporation) to which
the explosive mixture is submitted.         The only means of guarding
against, or reducing as much as possible, the liability to the occurrence
of these accidents, consist in the strictest attention to the precautionary
measures and regulations, which experience has proved to be essential
to safety, and which, in spite of the strictest supervision, are unques
tionably sometimes overlooked or imperfectly carried out by work
men.    Explosions of gunpowder, generally of a serious character, do
occur, however, though very rarely, during the transport of the
material, or in the magazines where it is stored.      The great explosion
of a gunpowder magazine at Erith in September, 1864, specially
directed the attention of government and the public generally, to the
necessity of adopting measures for reducing, as much as possible, the
risk of occurrence of such disastrous accidents.      Hence, much interest
has recently been excited by a well-known method of rendering gun
powder less dangerous in its character, which has been brought promi
nently before the public by Mr. Gale, and which consists of diluting
powder, or separating its grains from each other, by means of a finely
powdered non-explosive substance.       Attempts have several times been
made in past years, to apply to practical purposes the obvious fact, of
which nobody acquainted with the nature of gunpowder could be
ignorant, that, by interposing between the grains of powder a sufficient
quantity of a finely divided material, which offers great resistance to
the transmission of heat, the ignition of separate grains of the entire
mass may be accomplished without risk of inflaming contiguous
grains. In 1835, Piobert made a series of experiments with the view
to apply this fact practically, to reduce the explosiveness of gunpowder,
and similar experiments of an extensive character were carried on by a

1866.]      History of proposed Substitutes for Gunpowder.              619
Russian chemist, Fadeiff, between 1841 and 1844.             These experi
menters found that the object in view might be attained by diluting gun
powder with any one of its components ; they also employed very fine
sand (a substance closely allied in its physical characters to the pow
dered glass, which Mr. Gale now proposes to use) ; but the preference
appears to have been given to a particular form of carbon.       It was not
attempted   altogether to prevent  the burning  of   a mass of gunpowder,
when a spark or flame reached any portion, but to reduce the rapidity
of combustion so greatly as to prevent the occurrence of a violent
explosion.    No more than this is accomplished by the employment of
powdered glass in the proportions directed by Mr. Gale.          Indeed, as
the quantity of diluent required to give to different kinds of gunpowder
the character of equally slow-burning       materials, increases with the
explosiveness of the particular powder and with the size of its grain,
the proportion of powdered glass with which the gunpowder employed
in rifled cannon would have to be mixed to render it only slow-burning,
would be about double the quantity required for almost altogether
preventing the ignition of fine-grain powder, or of the comparatively
weak blasting powder with which Mr. Gale's public experiments appear
generally to have been instituted.      Although a sufficient dilution of
gunpowder may secure such comparative safety to the neighbourhoods
of large magazines, or to the crews of merchant-vessels in which gun
powder (for blasting purposes, &c.) is transported, as to compensate
fully for the inconvenience attending the great increase of volume of
the powder, there is no doubt that such a treatment of gunpowder
actually issued for military and naval service would be attended by
more than one serious obstacle ; such as, the tendency of the powder,
unless very largely diluted, to separate from the glass, during transport
 by land or sea, to so considerable an extent as very greatly to diminish
the degree of security originally aimed at ; the very great addition
which would have to be made to the arrangements           for carrying the
necessary ammunition, in active service ; the necessity for introducing,
in the field or on board ship, the operations of separating the powder
from the glass and transferring it to cartridges and shells (which, what
ever sifting and other arrangements were adopted, would be time-taking
and very dangerous), instead of preserving the ammunition ready for
immediate use ; and, above all, the incalculable mischief which would
inevitably result from the establishment, in the minds of the soldier
and sailor, of an erroneous feeling of security, in dealing with gun
powder, which, however harmless it may, for a time, be rendered, must
finally be handled by the men in its explosive form. The extremely
rare occurrence of accidents with gunpowder, on board ship or in
active land-service, is mainly due to the strictest enforcement of pre
cautionary regulations, some of which may appear at first sight
exaggerated or almost absurd, but which combine to maintain a con
sciousness of danger and a consequent          vigilance indispensable to
safety.
     One of the most remarkable materials recently employed to replace

620            Professor Abel       on the Recent  Progress in     the    [May 4,
gunpowder as a destructive agent, is nitre-glycerine.              This substance
was discovered by Sobrero, in 1847, and is produced by adding glyce
rine in successive small quantities to a mixture of one volume of nitric
acid of sp. gr. 1-43, and two volumes of sulphuric acid of sp. gr.
 l-83.   The acid is cooled artificially during the addition of glycerine,
and the mixture is afterwards poured into water, when an amber-
coloured oily fluid separates, which is insoluble in water, and possesses
no odour, but has a sweet, pungent flavour, and is very poisonous, a
minute quantity placed upon the tongue producing violent headache,
which lasts for several hours.
     The liquid has a specific gravity of 1-6, and solidifies at about 5°C.
(40° F.) ; if flame is applied, nitro-glycerine simply burns ; and if
placed upon paper or metal, and held over a source of heat, it explodes
feebly after a short time, burning with a smoky flame.             If  paper mois
tened with it be sharply struck, a somewhat violent detonation is pro
duced.     Alfred Nobel, a Swedish engineer, was the first to attempt
the application of nitro-glycerine as an explosive agent, in 1864.
     Some experiments were, in the first instance, made with gunpowder,
the grains of which had been saturated with nitro-glycerine.                 This
powder burnt     much     as  usual,  but  with a brighter flame,     in open air.
When confined       in shells  or  blast-holes, greater   effects  were, however,
produced   with  it  than  with   ordinary gunpowder    ;  its destructive  action
is described as having been from three to six times greater than that
of powder. The liquid could not be employed as a blasting agent in
the ordinary manner, as the application of flame to it from a common
fuze would not cause it to explode.                 But Mr. Nobel has suc
ceeded, by employing a special description of fuze, in applying the
liquid alone as a very powerful destructive agent.                 The charge of
nitro-glycerine having been introduced, in a suitable case, into the
blast-hole, a fuze, to the extremity of which is attached a small charge
of gunpowder, is fixed immediately over the liquid.               The concussion
produced by the exploding powder, upon ignition of the fuze, effects
the explosion of the nitro-glycerine.
     The destructive action of this material is estimated, by those who
have made experiments in Sweden and Germany, as about ten times
that of an equal weight of gunpowder.            Therefore, although its cost is
about seven times that of blasting-powder, its use is stated to be
attended with great economy, more especially in hard rocks, a consider
able saving being effected by its means in the labour of the miners, and
in the time occupied in performing a given amount of work, as much
fewer and smaller blast-holes are required than when gunpowder is
employed. The material appears to have recently received consider
able application in some parts of Germany and in Sweden ; but, in
England, its employment has been confined to one set of experiments
instituted in Cornwall last summer, upon which occasion a wrought-
iron block, weighing about three hundredweight, was rent into frag
ments by the explosion of a charge of less than one ounce of nitro
glycerine placed in a central cavity.

     Nitro-glycerine appears, therefore, to possess very important advan
tages over gunpowder as a blasting and destructive agent, but the
attempts to introduce it as a substitute for gunpowder have already
been attended by most disastrous results, ascribable in part to some of
its properties and the evident instability of the commercial product,
but principally to the thoughtlessness of those interested in its applica
tion, who appear to have been induced, either by undue confidence in
its permanence and comparative safety, or from less excusable motives,
to leave the masters of ships, or others who had to deal with the trans
port of the material, in ignorance of its dangerous character.
     The precise causes of the fearful explosions of nitro-glycerine which
occurred at Aspinwall and San Francisco will, in all probability, never be
ascertained   ; but they are likely to have been due, at any rate indirectly,
to the spontaneous decomposition of the substance, induced or accelerated
by the elevated temperature of the atmosphere in those parts of the
ships where it was stored.         Instances are on record in which the
violent rupture of closed vessels containing commercial nitro-glycerine
has been occasioned       by the accumulation of gases generated by its
gradual decomposition ; and it is at any rate not improbable that a
similar result, favoured by the warmth of the atmosphere, and eventually
determined by some accidental agitation of the contents of the package
of nitro-glycerine, was the cause of those lamentable accidents.         The
great difficulties attending the purification of nitro-glycerine upon a
practical scale, and the uncertainty, as regards stability, of the material,
even when purified (leaving out of consideration its very poisonous cha
racter and its extreme sensitiveness to explosion by percussion when in
the solid form), appear to present insurmountable obstacles to its safe
application as a substitute for gunpowder.
      The conversion of purified lignin or wood fibre into an explosive
substance    of the same nature as gun-cotton, was accomplished by
chemists   soon after Schonbein's discovery of gun-cotton was made
known.      Finely divided wood, or sawdust, may, by treatment with
 suitable agents, be to a very considerable extent purified of substances
foreign to cellulose ; and, if then submitted to careful digestion in
 a mixture of the strongest nitric and sulphuric acids, and properly
 purified, it furnishes a highly explosive material similar to the most
 explosive gun-cotton, and possessed apparently of considerable sta
 bility.   Captain Schultze, a Prussian         artillery officer, who was
entrusted by his government a few years ago with the investigation of
gun-cotton, appears to have come to the conclusion that finely-divided
wood offered greater prospect of conversion into a controllable explo
sive agent than cotton wool.       The ultimate result of his investigations
has been the production of a " gun-sawdust," the explosive properties
of which depend in great measure upon its impregnation with a con
 siderable proportion of an oxidizing agent, either saltpetre or a mixture
 of that salt and nitrate of barium. The wood, having been reduced to
 a tolerably uniform state of division, is submitted by Captain Schultze
 to purifying processes, for the separation of resinous and other sub

622            Professor Abel  on the Receut   Progrets in the    [May 4,
stances from the lignin, and the product is converted by digestion in a
mixture of sulphuric and nitric acids into a very feebly explosive
material, which leaves a considerable carbonaceous residue when burnt.
This product after purification is impregnated with a sufficient pro
portion of nitrates to give it rapidly explosive power, the oxidation of
the carbon being now almost complete.       The objects which appear to
be aimed at by Captain Schultze in following this method of manu
facturing a wood-gunpowder, are, the production of a more gradually
explosive material than is obtained by the most perfect action of nitric
acid upon wood-fibre, and the possibility of preserving the material in a
slightly explosive and therefore comparatively harmless form, until it is
required for use, when it may be soon rendered powerfully explosive
by impregnation with the nitrates.      It is asserted that this powder is
considerably   more  powerful   than gunpowder as a mining agent ; and
that, by its employment in mines, the operators are enabled to return to
work sooner than when gunpowder is used, because there is little or
no smoke produced by its explosion.         The latter is an undoubted
advantage     which Schultze's powder shares with gun-cotton.         Ad
vantages are also claimed for this material when employed in fire
arms, and it is possible that, when applied to sporting purposes, it may
compete successfully with gunpowder in this direction also ; but its
behaviour as an explosive, and the peculiarities of its structure, afford
little promise of its advantageous employment in arms for military and
naval purposes.
     Important progress has been made in the history and the practical
application of gun-cotton since its study was resumed in this country
about three years ago. Very considerable quantities of the material
have been manufactured at the works of Messrs. Prentice at Stow-
market, and at the Government Gunpowder Works at Waltham Abbey ;
its application to mining and artillery purposes, and to small arms, has
been, and is still the subject of systematic experiment, conducted by
the Government Committee on Gun-cotton ; its employment as a
blasting agent is steadily increasing in several important English
mining districts ; and considerable, though not uniform, success has
already attended the employment of gun-cotton cartridges for sporting
purposes.
     The system of manufacture of gun-cotton, as perfected by Baron
Von Lenk, has undergone but trifling modifications in its employment in
this country.    It has been made the subject of careful investigation
by Mr. Abel, and the results furnished by many experimental manu
facturing operations, and an examination of the products, have shown
that the process of converting cotton into the most explosive form of
pyroxilin or gun-cotton, and of purifying the material, have been so
greatly perfected by v. Lenk as to render a strict adherence to his
simple and precise instructions alone necessary to ensure the pre
paration of very uniform products, which exhibit in their composition
a very much closer approximation to purity than those obtained in the
earlier days of the history of gun-cotton.

18GG.J       History of proposed Substitutes for Gunpowder.             623
     Although the conclusions arrived at by the many chemists who
investigated the composition of gun-cotton, soon after Sehonbein's
discovery, varied very considerably, the constitution has been very
generally regarded as definitely established by the researches of Hadow,
published in 1854.      According to that chemist, the most explosive
gun-cotton has the composition expressed by the formula Ca H7 N„ (_),,
(which was first assigned to the substance by W. Crura, in 1847), and
may be regarded as cellulose, in which three atoms of hydrogen are
replaced by three molecules of peroxide of nitrogen. The name trinitro-
cellulose has therefore been assigned to gun-cotton, its constitution
being expressed by the formula C,     J, -»,!U >05.   Hadow's conclusions
have since been confirmed by other chemists, more especially by Ued-
tenbacher, Schrotter, and Schneider, who have analyzed specimens of
gun-cotton prepared under Von Lenk's directions.         But a Report upon
the Austrian Gun-cotton was published in 1864 by Pelouze and
 Maury, in which the formula Cs, H8, 0,„ 5 N, 05 is assigned to the
product of v. Lenk's process ; the conclusions of those chemists being
 founded partly upon some analytical results, and partly upon the
 increase of weight which they found cotton to sustain, when submitted
to treatment with the mixed acids.      They found the greatest increase
 iu weight to be 78 percent. — a number slightly in excess of that which
 would correspond to the requirements of the formula which they adopt.
     An experimental inquiry into the composition of gun-cotton, as
 obtained by v. Lenk's process, has been instituted by Mr. Abel ; and
 the very numerous analytical and synthetical results which he has
 obtained, confirm the correctness of the formula assigned by Crum and
 Hadow to the most explosive gun-cotton, and demonstrate satisfactorily
 that the products obtained by following strictly the instructions given
 by v. Lenk, are invariably trinitro-cellulose, in a condition as nearly
 approaching purity as a manufacturing operation can be expected to
 furnish.
      The most explosive gun-cotton is perfectly insoluble in mixtures of
 ether and alcohol ; but by varying the proportions and strength of the
 acids employed for the conversion of cotton, products of less explosive
 character are obtained, which are more or less freely soluble in ether
 and alcohol (furnishing the well-known material collodion).      If, there
 fore, in manufacturing gun-cotton, the conditions essential to the pro
 duction of insoluble pyroxilin are not strictly fulfilled, the uniformity
 of the product will suffer.
     The ordinary products of manufacture are never altogether free
 from soluble gun-cotton ; but the proportion present is small and very
 uniform, amounting to about L5 per cent.         They contain, besides, a
 small quantity (about 0-5 per cent.) of matter soluble in alcohol alone,
 and possessed of acid characters, which is evidently produced by the
 action of nitric acid upon such small quantities of resinous or other
 matters foreign to pure cellulose, as are not completely removed from
 the cotton fibre by the purification which it receives.

624               Professor Abel on the Recent Progress in the       [May  4,
      There appears good reason to believe that this impurity in gun-
cotton is of comparatively unstable character, and that the great
proneness to spontaneous decomposition which has been observed by
 Pelouze and Maury, De Luca, and others, in some specimens of gun-
cotton, is to be ascribed in great measure to the existence in those
specimens of comparatively large proportions of those unstable bye-
products.
      One hundred parts of carefully-purified cotton wool have been found
by   Mr.    Abel to furnish from 1818 to 182-5 parts of gun-cotton. The
increase which perfectly pure cellulose should sustain by absolutely
complete       conversion into a substance of the formula C, H7 N, Oa
 (tritiitro-cellulose) is 83-3 : the above results are therefore strong con
firmations of the correctness of this generally-accepted view of the
 composition of gun-cotton.        In carrying out the actual manufacturing
 process, as prescribed by v. Lenk, somewhat lower results are ob
tained, because of impurities existing in the cotton employed, and of
 loss of product during its purification.
      Very extensive experiments are in progress at Woolwich, with the
view of examining fully into the extent of liability to change of gun-
cotton when preserved in store, or exposed for prolonged periods to
light and to degrees of heat ranging between the ordinary atmospheric
temperatures and that of boiling water. The results hitherto arrived
at, though they have shown that, under severe conditions, gun-
 cotton is liable to decompose, have not confirmed the conclusions
arrived at by the French chemists, with regard to the great instability of
the material.       Thus De Luca states that, all specimens exposed by him
 to sunlight decomposed either on the first day or within a few days.
But, at Woolwich, no single instance of such rapid decomposition of
gun-cotton, made by the present process, has been noticed.            A very
gradual and slight development of gas occurs after a time when the
substance is exposed to sunlight ; but the quantity which has been
collected from specimens exposed at Woolwich to direct day- and sun
light for two years and a half, is very small, and the gun-cotton has in
all instances preserved its original appearance.        Pelouze and Maury
state that gun-cotton always decomposes perfectly within a few days,
by exposure to temperatures of 55°— 60°C. (130° — 140 F°.), and they
lay great stress upon the explosion of a specimen directly it was intro
duced into a vessel heated to 47° C. (1 16°»6 F.).       But, at Woolwich, a
specimen      of ordinary  product  which  has been  exposed now for twelve
months to 65° C. (150° F.), has evolved only a small quantity of gas, and
retains its original appearance perfectly.         Several specimens, after
having been exposed for some hours to a temperature of 90° C. (194° F.),
during which period some nitrous vapours were in all instances evolved,
have since been exposed to light in closed vessels for about twenty
months, and still retain their original appearance            and explosive
characters.       Several large ammunition-cases, closely packed with gun-
cotton, have been preserved for six months in a chamber, the tempera
ture of which was maintained for three months at 49° C. (120° F.), and

    afterwards at 54° — 55°   C. ( 130° F.), arrangements having been made for
    periodically registering the temperature within the boxes, which were
   kept closed.      In no instance has the latter temperature risen to an
   extent to indicate serious chemical change, t. e. it has always been
   below the temperature of the air in the chamber.        These few examples
   of results already obtained are given to show that the behaviour of
   gun-cotton     manufactured in England by v. Lenk's process does not,
   as yet, at  all justify the condemnation which the material has recently
   received in France.
        One most important point in connection with the preservation of
   gun-cotton appears to have been lost sight of by the French experi
   menters.     The material may be most perfectly preserved, apparently
   for any period, either by immersion in water, or, still more simply, by
   being impregnated with just sufficient moisture to render it perfectly
   uninflammable.        In this condition, gun-cotton is much safer than gun
   powder can be rendered, even by mixture with very large proportions of
  incombustible materials.          It may be transported with quite as much
  safety as the unconverted cotton ; indeed, it appears to be very much
  less prone to gradual decay, if preserved for very long periods in a damp
  condition, than cotton or other vegetable substances.        Many specimens
  of gun-cotton, preserved for several months in a very damp chamber,
  together with paper, cotton fabrics, and wood, retained their strength of
  fibre and all their original properties, and had no signs even of mildew
  upon them, while the paper fabrics in immediate contact with them had
  completely rotted away, and the wood was covered with fungi.
       Considerable progress has been made in the manipulation of gun-
  cotton, with the object of modifying its explosive action. The rapidity
 with which gun-cotton burns in open air admits of ready and very con
 siderable variation by applying the simple expedients of winding, twist
 ing, or plaiting gun-cotton yarn of different sizes. But, although a mass
 of gun-cotton may be made to burn in a comparatively gradual manner
 by being very tightly wound, a charge of the material in that form acts
 quite as destructively when exploded in the bore of a gun as an equal
 charge consisting of the yarn wound very loosely, because the pressure
 of gas established by the first ignition of the charge renders the compact
 packing of the gun-cotton powerless to resist the instantaneous penetra
 tion of flame between the separate layers of the material.       The assertion
 that a power had been acquired of controlling the explosive action of
 gun-cotton in a fire-arm by simply varying the compactness with which
the material was twisted or wound, has, therefore, proved quite erro
neous.       There are, however, two methods of reducing the rapidity of
explosion of gun-cotton, which are much more likely to furnish suc
cessful results. The one consists in diluting the material by its admix
ture either with a less explosive variety of gun-cotton or with some
inexplosive substance, such, for instance, as the cotton in its original
form.       The latter mode of dilution has recently been applied by Messrs.
Prentice to the construction of cartridges for sporting purposes, and
they describe the results already arrived at as very promising.            The
                                                                   2z2

6:26
            Professor Abel on Substitutes      for Gunpowder.       [May    4,
second method of controlling the explosion of gun-cotton consists in con
solidating the material by pressure into compact homogeneous masses,
and in confining the first ignition of such compressed gun-cotton in
the bore of the gun, to certain surfaces.  The gun-cotton fibre in the
form of yarn or plait may be compressed into very compact masses by
 being rammed into strong cylinders of pasteboard or other suitable
 material ; but much more perfectly homogeneous and solid masses are
produced, independently of cylinders or other cases, by a method which
 Mr. Abel has recently elaborated, and which consists in reducing the
 gun-cotton fibre to a fine state of division or pulp, as in the process
of paper-making, and in converting this pulp by pressure into solid
masses of any suitable form or density.
     This method of operating affords also special facilities for combining
both methods, dilution and compression,       of reducing the explosive
violence of gun-cotton.     The material    is,in fact, operated upon by
 this system, in a   manner exactly corresponding to the processes by
which the explosive action of gunpowder     is regulated to so remarkable
an extent.    Some results, which are admitted by the most sceptical as
encouraging, have already been arrived at, in the systematic course of
experiments which are in progress, with the object of applying the
methods of regulation, pointed out, to the reduction of gun-cotton to a
safe form for artillery purposes.   Its arrangement in     a  form suitable
for small arms   is
                 a     much less difficult problem, which may be con
sidered as approaching  a  perfect solution.  For employment in shells
and for military mines, both land and submarine, the compressed or
solid form of gun-cotton presents special advantages, on account of the
great compactness which may be imparted to           it;   a  given weight
arranged so as to ignite instantaneously under pressure (i.e. in strong
vessels), may be made to occupy the same space as an equal weight of
gunpowder, whereas the forms of gun-cotton hitherto applied to these
purposes occupy about three times the space of gunpowder.
     Beautiful pyrotechnic effects may be readily produced by means of
gun-cotton, though the absence of smoke, which, in some of its appli
cations (especially in mines), would constitute an important advantage,
detracts from some of the effects which may be obtained with pyro
technic compositions. On the other hand, gun-cotton fireworks may
be displayed in-doors without inconvenience.
     There appears at present no reason to doubt that the application
of gun-cotton with great advantage to at least some of the more im
portant purposes for which gunpowder      is used, will, ere long, be fully
established, and that this interesting explosive agent         isdestined to
occupy a   permanent and prominent position among the most important
products of chemical industry.

   i \ this communication        I   propose to direct attention to the following

       First.— Mud volcanoes generally, and especially those of the
  Crimea and Sicily, as phenomena of subdued volcanic action.
        Secondly. — The frequent occurrence of petroleum, naphtha, and
  other hydro-carbons in the vicinity of mud volcanoes.

  vegetable or animal organic matter near mud volcanoes.
       Fourthly. — The geological relation probably existing between mud
  volcanoes, recognized lines of volcanic energy, main lines of elevation
 affecting great tracts of land, and the metamorphoses that have pro
 duced the hydro-carbons in the form of petroleum, naphtha, bitumen,
 and bituminous shales.
                                  I. MUD     VOLCANOES.
       The phenomena of mud volcanoes are illustrated on a grand scale
 in the eastern part of the Crimea, near Kertch, and on the adjacent
 peninsula of Taman.            The eastern shore of the Cimmerian Bosphorus
 is nearly level, but in certain places presents a multitude of hil
 locks and some considerable hills.             These hills are due to eruptions
 of mud.        Some are large and lofty, and do not now erupt mud.
 Others are also of large dimensions, but are continually or occasionally
 active.      I  visited the Crimea in the course of last summer, and
although for some months previously none of the older and larger mud
volcanoes had broken out afresh, and no new ones had appeared, it was
not difficult from the number of examples in different states of activity
to make out the principal varieties of appearance.                 Before describing
them, however, I think it will be better to give a brief account of an

  1866.]             on Mud    Volcanoes   and Petroleum.                629
 eruption of the same nature that occurred in Sicily during my stay in
 the island.    I was on that occasion fortunate enough to be able to visit
 a mud volcano from its commencement,             and thus, combining the
 observations in Sicily and the Crimea,     I have been able to judge of and
 describe from my own observation the whole history of one of these
 curious phenomena.        The Sicilian eruption commenced seven days
 only before the commencement of the eruption in the island of Santorin.
 It should be borne in mind that the eruption of Etna of last year was
 accompanied by subterranean action in the JEge&n sea, both near the
 extremity of the Morea and also in Santorin itself; and although the
 distance is five hundred miles, a subterranean communication must be
 considered proved.
      At Patern6, close to the south-western extremity of the Etna lavas,
a mud eruption took place on the 23rd of last January, in a flat plain
 below the steep hill on which Paterno' is built, and not far from the
 bed of the Simeto.      It commenced by the outburst of a strong jet of
 water, which must have issued through a crevice in underlying lava.
 The crack is not traceable in the conglomerate and sandy gravel of the
 surface, except from the indications afforded by the eruptions.        The
 water at first rose about six feet in a strong jet, at boiling temperature,
 from only one point. Several such jets followed from other places a
 few yards off, the volume of the first jet diminishing though the total
quantity of water erupted was increased.           The temperature of the
erupted water diminished slowly from the commencement.            There was
 no noise, no flame, and no visible vapour, but much gas bubbling
 through the water, and some naphtha.
      The water issuing was muddy from the commencement, but no
stones or lumps of solid matter were erupted.        The level of the point
 of eruption was about 600 feet above the sea, as determined by an
aneroid.     The water erupted ran off into the Simeto, leaving behind a
 thin coating of tenacious mud, which covered the ground for some
distance.
      I visited the spot on the eighth day from the commencement.
 From the principal jet there then issued a large column of dirty water,
 with much gas.      A considerable quantity of petroleum of dark-green
 colour floated on the surface of the water, but had not been collected.
 The temperature of the water was above 1 10° Fah., but observations
 were difficult to make and uncertain, owing to the absence of a maximum
 thermometer.      The heat was certainly much greater than was recorded,
 as the water scalded the hand.     The gas bubbles were large, and issued
 at intervals by puffs, of which forty per minute were counted. The
 gas was chiefly carbonic acid gas.      There were four other considerable
jets of warm but not hot water all in a line, and all in the direction of
 a line joining the original point of eruption with the principal cone of
 Etna.     They were about four yards apart. A multitude of much
 smaller jets of cold muddy water came out from cracks in the ground
at various points within an area of about twenty acres.          None of the
 issuing fluid could be called thick mud, but on exposure to the air and

630                         Professor    D. T. Ans'ed              [May  11,
evaporation it left a tenacious paste.      About 300 yards beyond, in the
direction of the great cone of Etna, there is a remarkable spring of
water loaded with carbonic acid gas, rising at a temperature of 64° Fah.
Though well known and used this spring does not seem to have been
affected by the eruption.      Except at Pyrmont, I have never seen water
so charged    with  gas.  A  short distance beyond this spring is another of
subacid water issuing from beneath old lava, at a temperature of
60° Fah.
     About a mile from the mud volcano, and in the direction opposite
to the springs, are blocks of very tough basaltic lava, on a natural slope.
They had apparently fallen from a basaltic cliff above.        These blocks,
when struck with a hammer, give out a strong bituminous odour, and
when a fragment is broken off, innumerable small cavities full of naphtha
may be observed on examining the broken surface.
     The mud volcanoes of the Crimea and Taman are very numerous,
and all within a belt of country nearly parallel with the axis of the
Caucasus.      It is known that similar phenomena exist near Teflis, half
way between the Black Sea and the Caspian, at Baku, on the western
shore of the Caspian, and in islands near the eastern shores of the
Caspian.     The district   I  chiefly examined reached about fifty miles
from the straits of Kertch, towards the east, and about twenty miles
towards the west.
     Near Enikale are several distinct cones.          Of these some are
moderately active, many quite inactive. The date of activity can often
be guessed at by the state of the slopes ; for the mud as it first issues,
and for some time afterwards, is perfectly unfit for vegetation, but after
about two years' exposure it begins to acquire properties and materials
allowing vegetable growth.         By noticing the state of vegetation,    I
was thus able to make out that many of the hills had been very recently
subject to a flow of mud, though quite dry at the time of my visit.
     The erupting cones are all of the same general character. The
mud is poured out very slowly from the top, and is tenacious and often
as thick as treacle.     Bubbles of gas accompany the mud. In one case
I  counted fifteen large bubbles per minute, in another thirty. The
temperature of the issuing mud was in one case 56° Fah., in another
close by as much as 66° Fah.         I measured the length of one coulee of
mud, and found it to be about 60 yards from the outlet before it was
completely checked.        The various cones are accumulated from the
material erupted, and in no other way. In the cone I measured              I
found the fall to be 20 feet, the slope therefore being one in nine.
Other cones, and the upper part of all the cones, are much steeper
than this.
     In all this group   a north wind is universally understood to increase
the flow   of mud, and   the quantity of mud issuing varies from month to
month and at different seasons.         It not unfrequently stops altogether
for some time.
     A short distance to the west of Enikale is another tract of con
siderable area completely covered with recently erupted mud. The

mud is always of the same kind, blackish when dry, very tenacious, and
as it runs exceedingly fine.              I
                                        observed, however, in each place a
number of fragments of clay ironstone, all of small size, and distributed
pretty evenly over the mud hills ; and this fact I also noticed on all
the cones both at Kertch and Tainan.                  I
                                                   have seen and possess parts
of a fragment of lignite erupted from a mud volcano at Sassuolo, near
Modena.
     Not far from Kertch, towards the south-west, is another and similar
mud volcano, and near it a large old cone evidently due to the same
cause.    Several small mud springs are close by.
     On the opposite or eastern side of the straits of Kertch, and within
the peninsula of Taman, which is formed by the delta of the Kuban (the
largest of the rivers coming from the northern watershed of the
Caucasus), there is a very important and extensive group of conical
hills of marl and mud, which beyond a doubt are due to the issue of
mud under circumstances identical with those just described.                    They
occupy an area of many square miles. The Kuban itself terminates in
a wide expanse of mud, covered for the most part with less than a foot
of water, and the whole of the peninsula of Taman is an alternation of
mud banks above and below the water's edge, with a few narrow channels
passable for vessels of small burden.          It is only the mud cones that
relieve the monotony of the surface.
     We owe to Pallas a detailed account of an eruption that took place
in tliis peninsula towards the close of the last century.                  This erup
tion resulted in the formation of a large conical hill visible from
Kertch, which is about 14 miles distant, and a prominent object to
vessels passing through the straits.              I
                                                visited this cone, though with
some difficulty, as no one on the spot knew anything about              it, and there
is  neither    alanding place   near   nor  any  road   leading   to   it.   It    on
                                                                                  is
 the opposite side of the creek, on which             the village of Taman.
                                                          is                           I
found  it  extinct, but with marks of recent eruption of mud on               a small
scale.    The main cone lias been much weathered.              It consists of clay,
 with small angular lumps of limestone and small fragments of earthy
oxide of iron. There       is   adepression or crater at the top.          The height
I   estimated at about two hundred and fifty feet, but                 I    could not
quite trust my aneroid.       It    now called Gorela,
                                    is                        name which merely

means      ahill. It seems to have been known by other names                  a   few
 years ago, being called Kakuoba in Col. Jervis's map.
     Several miles from this old cone, towards the east,           is the village of
 Aktiuisorka, near which    I   found     remarkable group of mud volcanoes
                                              a
 in activity at tlie time of my visit.      There were four of large size, all
 issuing mud. Another, which had been active in 1863,              1 found covered
 with vegetation.       These hills were about the same height as that
 described     by Pallas (vihich      now called Gorela), and form
                                     is                                       a  con
 siderable group. They are called Luvarka.                Like the others, their
 slopes contained numerous fragments of iron oxide.                 A ridge, some
 miles long, behind and near the village of Taman,                 is   also entirely
 formed of erupted mud          ; but these mud hills are detached from

the   group just described.       Indications of mud volcanoes extend
eastwards    beneath    the  Caucasus    to the Caspian, and westwards
towards and into the Putrid Sea, so that the belt of mud volcano
country on the southern slopes of the Caucasus is almost unbroken,
and extends across the low flat plains of the south of Russia to a
very great distance, being everywhere marked by the same peculiar
condition and with similar proofs of communication with the interior of
the earth. The distances referred to are roughly as follows : — From the
eastern Caspian to Teflis, about 500 miles with various connecting links.
From Teflis to Anapa, nearly 400 miles without such links. From
Anapa to the Putrid Sea, unquestionably connected by similar phe
nomena, 200 miles.
     Crossing a large part of Eastern Europe we do not again meet with
distinct indications of mud volcanoes till we reach North Italy, where
there are some well known and remarkable examples at Sassuola and
elsewhere, on the northern slopes of the Apennines, in the provinces of
Modena and Parma.         These have exhibited all the phenomena above
described within the last century, and they are also described in classical
works.     From one of these there have been eruptions of solid matter,
and even of lignite, already alluded to.         On the other side of the
Apennines the boracic springs near Volterra are of the same nature, but
true active mud volcanoes have not, I believe, been observed or de
scribed till we reach Sicily. There, both on the slopes of Etna and
near the southern coast at Girgenti, they recur with the usual charac
teristics.   The latter have often been described.
     From the Caspian sea, eastward, at various places on the northern
slopes of the Himalayan chain, and so into China, mud volcanoes have
been noticed.     They appear to exist on a very large scale in Java.
They belong also to the volcanic system of the new world, where the
Mexican examples are recent and very extensive, the phenomena being
nearly the same as those described. The most remarkable and instruc
tive of those that have been less prominently referred to by geological
writers are those in Trinidad, others occurring in California, and some
in Iceland.
     It will be useful to say a few words with regard to some of these
before passing on to the next division of the subject.       The Trinidad
mud volcanoes have been described recently by Mr. G. P. Wall.
According to Bunsen, the mud eruptions of Ilecla appear to be chiefly
dirty water, slightly impregnated with mud, and very hot. In this respect
they agree rather with that of Paterno than those of the Crimea.
Being nearer the great centre of volcanic heat, the phenomena are less
sluggish.     The corresponding phenomena          in California   (in the
Colorado district)   are  near extinct volcanic rocks of the ordinary kind.
Here also the heat is intense, and the mud is erupted in jets to the
height of several feet, and sometimes even to a hundred feet.         Frag
ments of pumice are scattered over the plain, and the mud runs off in a
slimy stream towards a neighbouring salt lake. In other respects tlte
conditions appear identical with those of Asia and Europe, and to
connect these with the great geysers and hot muddy springs of Heela.

 1866.]                on  Mud    Volcanoes  and Petroleum.                 633
      On the whole, then, it may be concluded that mud volcanoes repre
 sent in a very striking manner the declining stage of volcanic activity
 under certain conditions which are not by any means universal. There
 are certainly many volcanic districts where there does not seem any
 thing of the kind ; many, where hot water alone or thermal mineral
 springs are ejected, others where there are special minerals, as borax,
 in exceptional abundance.            True mud of the ordinary kind may
 be erupted, thin or thick, with or without foreign substances, and at
 temperatures varying between a heat much exceeding the boiling point
 of water and the equivalent of the mean annual temperature of the
 district.    The phenomena also, though they vary in details, are on the
 whole constant in their nature and in the order of their occurrence.
 The eruption may be described as commencing with heated water and
 gases, occasionally accompanied by mud, and even considerable frag
 ments of rock. The eruptive force exerted being comparatively small,
 the result in this respect is also small ; but, as in other volcanic
districts, the force exhibits itself by forming crevices in the earth,
along certain lines of least resistance.          In mud volcanoes the steam
issuing from the crevices has been condensed into water before it
 reaches the surface.         The erupted water also brings with it such
earthy     substances  as  it meets  on its way, and thus mud more or less
 thick issues from the crevice instead of lava. With regard to the
 carbonic acid and other gases, the thin mud allows of their passage to
the surface in bubbles.
                         II.  Petroleum and Bitumen.
     In all the mud volcanoes above alluded to, and in all others that have
been minutely described by competent observers, it appears that mineral
oil (either naphtha or petroleum) either issues with the muddy stream
that forms the erupting matter (which is very commonly the case) or
comes out in some quantity from springs or wells immediately adjacent.
Thus at Baku, and at other points across the Caspian, the quantity of
naphtha obtained from springs near the mud volcanoes is enormously
great, and has continued to flow from time immemorial.             Near Teflis
there are important naphtha springs. At Anapa there has recently been
obtained a spouting well.            In the peninsula of Taman there are
abundant indications of petroleum proceeding through tertiary rocks.
Near Kertch, in the neighbourhood of all the mud volcanoes alluded
to, there are numerous shallow wells dug into tertiary marls, whence
a supply of oil has been obtained by the Tatars from time imme
morial.      The number of such old wells is too great to be estimated.
In one instance I noticed a well yielding a considerable quantity of
naphtha, sunk within less than a dozen yards from erupting mud, and
on the very slope of an extinct cone of mud.           In another the water, as
it rose with the mud, was covered with a film of naphtha.           A smell of
naphtha pervades large        tracts of country, and, mixing with sulphuretted
and perhaps phosphuretted hydrogen, effects the whole atmosphere of
the Putrid Sea.       In all these cases there is distinct geological evidence

634                          Professor  D. T. A nsted                [May   11,
 that the petroleum springs are connected with crevices usually in clayey
 and shaly rocks, which are often quite saturated with the oil. Some
 times they pass through limestones,        or compact sandstones, and then
 these rocks are rendered highly bituminous.           In the south of Italy
 there is an issue of mineral oil floating on water at one spot, and
not far off is a vast deposit of bitumen nearly pure. The whole length
of the Apennines, on the eastern side, exhibits at frequent intervals the
most direct proof of the existence of bitumen.        Towards the north, and
where the mountains change their direction, and range parallel to the
main chain of the Alps, there are numerous wells of petroleum and
 naphtha of remarkable purity rising through the rocks under similar
circumstances, In Asia Minor, again, at the Dead Sea, and on the
 former sites of Sodom and Gomorrah, are similar phenomena, which,
indeed, are continued across Greece into the Ionian Islands.        Zante has
been celebrated since the time of Herodotus for its wells of petroleum,
while Egypt and Arabia continue the oil district towards the south.
In all these parts of the world there are places where petroleum, either
in a fluid, semi-fluid, or recently solidified state, exists within the earth,
and in many spots it runs out to the surface like water. Trinidad and
the adjoining part of South America afford numerous and magnificent
instances of mud volcanoes, accompanied by large issues of naphtha and
petroleum in all varieties of condition.
     But besides the spots already mentioned, in which petroleum issues
in the neighbourhood of mud volcanoes, or in such direct volcanic
association that we can at once trace the connecting links, there are
others, and those the most remarkable in the world for the actual
quantity of mineral oil obtained, where no mud volcanoes are known
to be near, and even where there is no volcanic influence of any kind
at hand.     I allude, of course, to the oil-bearing districts in North
America, where the oil rises in quantities proportionate to the magni
tude of the coal-fields and to the vast folds of the strata through which
it reaches the surface.        These indicate geological axes of extreme
importance and magnitude ; and, although there are no evidences of
communication with the interior such as volcanoes offer, there is clear
geological proof of the action of upheaving forces on the grandest
scale.
     Wherever there are deposits of mineral fuel and of large quantities
of organic matter accumulated during         some past period of the earth's
history, there are in the neighbourhood, either oils or bituminous
minerals. Bituminous shales, grits, limestones, and even ironstones, so
saturated with bitumen that they will yield mineral oils on distillation
at a low heat, are met with in most of the coal-fields throughout the
world.    It does not matter what may be the geological age of the
coal, or whether it be coal or lignite.        The bituminous mineral also
may be of any kind.
     If we distinguish between
                                   petroleum, in a fluid or thickened state,
and bituminous shales, commonly so-called, we shall find that springs
of mineral oil rise chieflyin lines parallel tocertain great mountain chains.

  1866.]               on   Mud   Volcanoes  and Petroleum                  635
  On the other hand many great deposits of bitumen and bituminized
 minerals, are less clearly brought into relation with similar causation.
      The petroleum springs, so abundant in the Caspian, range along
  the foot of the Caucasus, and are continued for a long distance in the
 same direction.       They commence again at the foot of the Carpathians,
 where they abound in Galicia, and are numerous in Wallachia.         In both
 countries the quantity of oil is probably large, and the number of spots
  whence the mineral has been obtained is, certainly, enormous.             We
 lose sight of them as the Carpathians pass into the Alps, but they
 recur where the Apennines pass away from the Alps.             We find them
 occasionally on the flanks of the Apennines, but more abundantly in
 France, where the Alps themselves die away into the plains. They
 are met with near the outlying coal-fields in the south of France.
      But most of all are they abundant and productive in the folds of
 the great anticlinals in North America.
      On the other hand, the richest and most valuable shales and cannel
 coals are those found in parts of the Scotch, Lancashire, and Flintshire
 coal-fields, in neither case far from basaltic eruptions of ancient or
 modern date, but very far from the great mountain chains and axes of
 main elevation.       Other bituminous shales of value occur in other coal
 fields, and with or near lignites in many districts, and of all geological
 ages.    Throughout the great plains of Europe there are cases in point
 which   I need not here quote.        Others have been described, some very
 recently,  in   Australia.    Many are known in Asia and America, but
 most of them are less important.           There is hardly a coal-field, and
not many beds of available lignite, without bituminous rocks adjoining
 or enclosing them.        This relation, so universal and so widely spread,
 cannot be without some distinct meaning in the history of the earth.
      It would seem clear that the hydro-carbons locked up among the
strata of the earth, and now only beginning to be released and rendered
 useful, are parts of the great history of metamorphosis and change that
has affected every deposit during all time.
            III.    ORGANIC DEPOSITS NEAR MUD VOLCANOES.
      The various minerals that, under the names of petroleum, naphtha,
bitumen, cannel-coal, and bituminous shales, are now so much sought
after, and mostof them so valuable, have, in all probability,obtained their
carbon from organic deposits. Their hydrogen may have been derived
partly from the excess of that gas present in all organic matter, partly
from the decomposition of water; and their history, in either case, is
connected with that great and systematic metamorphosis          induced and
constantly    in  progress  in the interior of the earth.  A slow distillation
of coal or lignite, effected with comparatively little heat, and enduring
for a long time under favourable circumstances, must be accepted as
the general explanation of the various phenomena.              Where, as in
Trinidad, the quantity of bitumen is so large, and the production so
recent that we can see the process as it has gone on and its actual

636                        Professor
                                         D,   T. Ansted            [May      1 1,
  progress, we find large deposits of lignite adjacent. In the Caspian
  Sea, where the flow of naphtha is also enormous, and has continued
  uninterruptedly for at least 2000 years, there are also lignites near.
  All along the flanks of the Caucasus, and at the foot of the Carpa
  thians and Alps, and on the Apennines, the same general fact is
  notorious.    The position of the beds of lignite affected is not always
 traceable, but that the rocks adjoining are loaded with this mineral
  there is no doubt. The tertiary coal has, in these countries, been
 largely converted into oil ; and if the same has not happened with the
 coal-fields of Western Europe to so great an extent, the result has
 been, at any rate, partially produced ; and in other old coal-fields, as
 in North America, the increased thickness and magnitude of the coal
 deposit is accompanied by a corresponding yield of oil.         Everywhere
 the oils seem to have been obtained as secondary products, and to be
 due to changes of the nature of distillation.      It is probable that the
 process is one that has always been going on, and that the increased
 proportion of carbonaceous and bituminous schists among older rocks,
 is the result of an action continued through much longer time.
      It is not difficult to understand that while the slow distillation, at a
low heat, capable of producing mineral oil and causing rocks to absorb
it,  but insufficient to produce combustion, may be most consistent with
 salses and mud volcanoes, the effect of repeated volcanic eruptions of
 the ordinary kind may be to destroy the carbonaceous deposits passed
through by the conversion of the whole into carbonic acid, carbonic
oxide, or, perhaps, in rare cases, by actual combustion.       It is, at any
rate, certain that while petroleum or bitumen        isalways  the   associate
of such slow volcanic action as     is  exhibited in mud volcanoes,     it   is
by no means always to be found in or near volcanoes commonly
so called.
      It cannot be necessary to point out that the determination of an
invariable dependence of mineral oil on organic deposits would be an
important step in the discovery of the localities where petroleum            is
likely to be present.       According to present experience, coal and lig
nites are usually either accompanied      by bituminous shales. sandstones,
or limestones, or by petroleum springs. On the other hand, petroleum
springs are not always to be found where lignites or coal are at hand.
It requires another element — namely, disruption of strata or some
other indication of disturbance and subterranean movement — in order
to ensure the important and useful chemical action by which the
hydro-carbons are obtained.

state, or solidbitumen — (4) those which have undergone recent and
systematic elevation on a large scale — and (o) those remarkable for
evidences of recent chemical change or metamorphosis, these would,
in the main, correspond, or would at any rate present so much mutual
relation as to show that all were connected, and that the various phenom
ena must be produced by some one-ruling cause.           That this cause has
determined the whole form and position of the land on the earth — that
it     therefore, cosmical in the strictest sense, and not merely local —
     is,
and that     results from the general constitution of the earth, and from
            it
the nature of the relations between the external crust and the condition
of the interior   is also certain.   If, however, we admit these axioms,
it will result that the geological history of the world, at any rate from
the close of the secondary period up to the present time,          isone long
and uninterrupted chapter. During all, or         large part of that period,
                                                     a
there has been continuous subterranean action along certain lines which
are the geographical as well as geological axes of our earth, and which
in the main have never changed.         One of these lines extends for a
length of several thousand miles equatorially across what               isnow
Europe and Asia, and the other for an equal distance meridianally
through the two Americas.        The force thus exerted has determined
the form of the principal land on the earth          by
                                                    its axial directions, and
in the same direction and within the same limits have acted the causes
which, under certain conditions, have produced marbles, schists, gneiss,
and granite.     These same causes have in certain cases produced vol
canoes, or deposited basalt and lava, and on        smaller scale may have

exhibited such results as mud volcanoes, sulphur deposits, and petroleum
springs.    I  think   it clear that we must regard all these results as
                            is
mutually related and bearing upon the general question of the earth's
history, and as demanding due consideration before any theory                 is
admitted which ignores or neglects them.
     It does not seem likely that there could have continued to exist for

water agency on some part of the ocean floor.              Uniform igneous
fluidity at a small depth seems inconsistent with steady, long-continued,
and elevatory action, affecting opposite and very large areas of the
solid crust.    There must have been independent action in order that
the upheavals in the two great tracts of land should be in directions
nearly at right angles to each other, and any such cause as the shifting
of an axis must have affected the whole earth in such manner, and to

     Everything known of volcanic eruptions in all parts of the earth,
and all facts recorded concerning the variety and magnitude of the
disturbances produced, points to water in the form of steam as their

proximate cause ; and also to inter-communication of volcanoes in the
same district, if not throughout the same hemisphere.     No eruption has
ever taken place without the evolution of enormous quantities of steam.
Puffs of steam, occurring at intervals, are the first phenomena of
volcanic action, whether on a small or large scale.    Water issues from
mud volcanoes.      The presence of soda, often in the state of carbonate,
amongst lavas is a fact well known, and of which        I have seen many
examples in recent eruptions, both of Etna and Vesuvius.          Chlorine
also is a gas invariably present during the early and active times of
an eruption.     Thus it is more than probable that sea-water obtains
access to the cavities in which the eruptions originate, or through
which the erupting matter passes.       The substances erupted from all
volcanoes— mud volcanoes included — consist of the materials, more or
less altered, of the deposited rocks adjacent.      From mud volcanoes
iron-oxide, and even lignite, have been thrown out in addition to the
tenacious clay.
     Whatever may have been the original cause determining the
direction of cavities within the earth's crust, it would seem that they
cannot be very far beneath the surface, and that they affect only
limited though large areas.      Nor do they stem to demand a tempera
ture greater than may be due to the interruption of magnetic currents
through materials of different conducting powers. The access of sea-
water through natural fissures into such cavities moderately heated,
accounts for the phenomena produced ; namely, the upheaval of con
tinents by the expansive action of steam, and the occasional interruption
of upheaval by volcanic eruptions ; the steam thus finding partial and
interrupted vent through cracks and fissures produced during elevation.
No doubt, to render this explanation sufficient, it must be granted that
such systematic cavities extend for thousands      of miles beneath the
outer surface of the earth, and are at no considerable depth in propor
tion to the earth's radius.
     I  believe that to water, and the circulation of water, upheaval as
well as denudation are probably due. It is not the whole or any part of
the compact and continuous dense crust of the earth that is disturbed
by volcanic upheavals or the elevation of continents, but only a few of
the upper films, so that in different parts of the crust such upheavals
may be produced in very different directions.       At the same time, the
causes that act in producing volcanoes and elevating the earth's surface
act on a grand scale, even when measured in reference to the whole
surface of the earth, and as they affect large areas, so do they range
over very extended periods.
     That during the progress of eruptions, and for a very long time
after every eruption, vapours and gases continuing to pass through the
crevices and pores of rocks, greatly modify them, and produce an
enormous and never-ceasing amount of chemical change there cannot
 be a doubt.    It is in reference to considerations of this kind that the
 whole subject of metamorphosis comes under the domain of the geo
 logical chemist rather than the mere geologist, and renders it difficult

for the latter to satisfy himself, or arrive at definite results without the
aid of chemistry. The production of petroleum is one among many such
changes.    A mud volcano and the petroleum spring adjacent are derived
from eruptions of steam and certain gases passing through certain
minerals, of which shale and lignite are the best examples. The vapour,
originally at high temperature, on passing through organic deposits has
become itself decomposed, and has also slowly decomposed and distilled
the organic matter.     One portion of its carbon has combined with the
liberated hydrogen, and another part with the liberated oxygen. The
decomposed vapour of naphtha and the carbonic acid gas having thus
risen together towards the surface, the steam and naphtha vapour have
liquefied as they cooled.    When they have risen through clay and not
through melted lava, they have become loaded with mud and cooled as
they approached the surface.       Cold mud is then erupted instead of hot
steam and volcanic dust.        The jet is less violent and the eruption
slower but more continuous.        Part of the naphtha floats on the water,
and part is absorbed by the rocks through which it passes.
    It often happens that mere heated waters or thermal springs rise
through sandstones, limestones, or granite, where there has been no
clay, lignite, or coal. When this is the case, a water instead of a mud
volcano is produced ; and here there is no naphtha or bitumen. Under
some circumstances, again, the naphtha is forced up to the surface,
through a crevice, without the water ; and then there is a naphtha
spring, subject to the same mechanical laws as sometimes produce
natural artesian jets, with or without water. In the other case, the
mineral oil, if unable to reach the surface, penetrates the rocks, and
renders them bituminous.        Hence we have bituminous shales, sand
stones, and limestones, or even, as shown at Paternd, bituminous basalts
— the rocks being more or less valuable, according to the degree with
which they have been charged with bitumen.           In this way also have
been formed the richer varieties of cannel, such as those of Flintshire,
and also those valuable Scotch deposits of exceptional minerals known
as Boghead, Torbane Hill mineral, &c.            The coal measures also
everywhere abound with bituminous shales, clays, and even ironstones.
These are very common, though they are rarely bituminous to such an
extent as to pay for distillation.
    I have already pointed out that where these deposits are chiefly
valuable there is generally proof of volcanic action not far off. Thus the
Boghead mineral is not far from the basalts of Edinburgh, while the rich
Leeswood and other cannelsare not far from the line of eruption of the
basalts of Shropshire.    Although on a far grander scale, the great oil
deposits  of North  America    seem to have had a similar origin, and to be
connected with upheaval.      On the east side of North America it is true
there is a little appearance of recent volcanic action, but the rich oil
wells are in the line of the great folds of the strata, the geological
axis of the country.
    I believe then, that the study of mud volcanoes and petroleum
deposits leads to the conclusion that both belong to one great system-

 atic series of movements, identical with those which have elevated the
 great continents ; and that the existence of mineral oil in available
  quantities is determined by the previous accumulation of organic de
 posits, and the metamorphosis of these on lines of volcanic action.
       Where volcanic force is powerfully exercised, and where it occurs
 from time to time at some one or other definite point in a wide area, it
 seems to have affected, with tolerable regularity, certain belts of land.
 In these cases, the liberated steam and gases, in their passage to the
 surface, have sometimes met the conditions rendering a very slow dis
 tillation of organic matter possible or inevitable.           The result of such
 distillation has been the production either of naphtha or petroleum,
 rising in oil springs, or of bituminous rocks retaining the naphtha or
 petroleum in their solid substance.           To know the probable state of
 any deposit, the geological conditions therefore must be studied, as it
 is only thus that we can determine where and how oil is likely to be
 found, by boring or sinking. On the other hand, there can be no doubt
 that a practical knowledge of the conditions and localities in which
 mineral oil has been hitherto obtained in oil-bearing districts, must
 be extremely suggestive         to the geologist and physicist ; for there is
 much still to be learnt by close observation, which, when thoroughly
 understood, will render intelligible numerous changes                   and trans
 formations in reference to this matter which are now sufficiently
mysterious.

     Note.— Since the above was in type, I have received from Professor Sylvestri,
of Catania, a detailed account of the eruption of Paterno. The muddy water
issuing at a temperature   of 16° C. was of the S. G. 1-1469, and gave an alkaline
reaction.   The marly matter suspended in the matter was 12-63 per cent. of the
whole.    When filtered the S. G. of the water was 1 • 053, taste very salt and
slightly bitter.    It contained 6-84 per cent. of soluble salts, including bi-
carbonates, sulphates, phosphates, nitrates (trace), chlorides, bromides,      iodides,
and fluorides.    The bases included sodium, potassium. caesium, rubidium, calcium,
magnesium, aluminium, lithium, and iron.       As much as 6 per cent. consisted of
chloride of sodium. The gas contained in the water was almost entirely carbonic
acid gas, with a small quantity of oxygen and nitrogen.
     The erupted gases were as follows (mean of four analyses) :—

In  the museum      at Naples,       among other articles exhumed           from the
volcanic mud of Herculaneum, will be found the contents of a
lapidary's shop ; the visitor may there see the half-finished gems, and
the tools with which they were being engraved at the moment of the
workmen's fright.        By the side of them is a piece of glass, rudely
shaped into a convex form         ;  and this appears to be the first record of
the  existence  of  a lens.    It   had evidently been used for the purpose of
magnifying the microscopic cuttings on the gems necessary to produce
the intended effect.
     Thirteen hundred years after this, spectacle-glasses                had become
somewhat common in Europe, and it was by a combination of these
that one Hans Lippershey. in the year 1608, at Middleburg, in the
Netherlands, invented a telescope, by means of which distant objects
" were brought nearer." Several of these instruments, very early in the
year 1609, were provided in a binocular form, for and at the expense of
the States-General of the Netherlands ; but there is no record of their
having    been  directed to any astronomical object.                 In May, 1609,
Galileo, at Venice,       heard of this new invention, without, so far as
is known, any precise intimation of the method by which the effect was
produced.      He hastened home to Padua, and on the day after his
arrival he produced the form of telescope which still bears his name.
His first instrument magnified but three times. Very shortly after
wards he constructed a second telescope, possessing a power of about
six linear.     With this he discovered the satellites of Jupiter, in
January, 1C10. He also observed spots in the sun, and mountains in
the moon. Very soon after these discoveries, Galileo succeeded in
constructing a telescope which magnified about thirty-three times
linear ; and with this he discovered the long-suspected phases of the
planet Venus, thereby completing the proof which was still wanting of
the truth of the Copernican system.            There can be little doubt that
                                                                        8a2

the intellectual   convictions which necessarily followed upon this dis
covery, emancipated mankind from the thraldom of the dogmas of the
Aristotelians and the Schoolmen, while, at the same time, they con
signed Galileo to the persecutions of the Inquisition, and deprived
him ultimately of his personal liberty.      It is remarkable that, so far
as the means then in existence permitted, Galileo carried his particular
form of telescope to its furthest practicable limit of perfection.
     For some forty years the telescope remained in the form in which
Galileo left it. In 1656, Huyghens, at the Hague, substituted two
convex lenses in contact for the eye-glass instead of the single concave
lens employed by Galileo. This contrivance materially increased the
field of view, and with such a telescope, now extended to the lengths
of twelve feet and of twenty-three feet, Huyghens discovered Saturn's
ring, supposed by Galileo to consist of two small spheres, one on
either side of the planet.     He also discovered one of the satellites of
Saturn,   and  he contrived  that admirable form of eye-piece called the
Huyghenian,     which,   with  no  material improvement, is still in con
stant use at the present day.     The field of view was again so greatly
increased by this invention that Huyghens was enabled to make use of
telescopes of the length of even 120 to 160 feet.
     The enormous length which was at this time necessary to assign
to a telescope in order to produce what is now considered a small
amount of amplifying power, put a natural and very confined limit to
the practical application of the instrument.      The causes which neces
sitated this great length of the instrument, combined at the same time
with very narrow limits to the size of the object-glass, were princi
pally two, independently of the impossibility of procuring homo
geneous glass of large dimensions.
     First, the effect of a lens upon a pencil of light incident upon it,
is to spread it out into a coloured circle, of which the diameter is,
with ordinary glass, about one-fiftieth part of the diameter of the
object-glass. This defect— if the consequence of a natural law can be
properly termed a defect— evidently set a natural limit not only to
the size of the object-glass, but to the amount of magnifying power
applicable to the eye-piece, thus necessitating        the twofold incon
venience of contracting the size of the object-glass, and of producing
power in the telescope by the increase of its length.
     Newton, by unfortunately making use of a certain species of
Venetian glass of low specific gravity, and very much resembling
water in its optical properties, came to the conclusion that it was not
possible to obtain optical or magnifying power without, at the same
time, producing the dispersion of colour, which, as we have seen, is
inconsistent with clear definition in telescopes of manageable dimen
sions.
     In 1758, John Dollond, by experimenting with glass of a different
character to that employed by Newton, discovered the source of that
great philosopher's mistake. He found that a lens of the ordinary
heavy metallic glass of his day, called flint-glass, dispersed the colour

  1866.]                        on the Telescope.                           643
  of a pencil   of light about as much as a lens of crown or plate-glass,
  possessing  double the general deflective or magnifying power of the
  former.    Hence, by combining a convex lens of plate-glass with a
  concave lens of flint-glass, but possessing only half the power (in this
  case a diminishing power), he obtained a combination which was
  capable of forming a nearly colourless image.
      We say nearly colourless, because the powerful plate lens acts,
  from the nature of the material, more powerfully in refracting the
  middle or green portion of the spectrum than can be recovered by the
 contrary action of the correcting or flint concave lens.         Hence, there
 remains behind an uncorrected or residuary spectrum of about ^,th of
 the breadth of the original spectrum produced by the convex plate
 lens — that is to say, a pencil of white light is now dispersed over a
 circle whose diameter is about s^th part of that of the object-glass.
 In the best modern telescopes this defect is left to its fate.            Mr.
 Cooke is at this moment engaged in the construction of an object-glass
 twenty-five inches in diameter, by far the largest ever yet attempted.
 The diameter of the circle and chromatic diffusion in this magnificent
 object-glass, when completed, cannot be less than about i^th of an
 inch : unless, therefore, some secondary combination is introduced,
 this circumstance will unavoidably prevent the employment of any
 powerful eye-piece.
      The necessity of employing small object-glasses was thus satisfac
 torily removed by the discovery of Dollond in 1758. Nevertheless,
 there still remains another serious cause of imperfection in the com
 pound object-glass. Generally speaking, any lens, of which the surfaces
 are spherical, is much more powerful towards the margin than are the
 parts of it near to the centre.    A pencil of light, incident on the whole
 aperture of a lens will, in general, be diffused over a circle whose diameter
 bears a very appreciable ratio to the thickness of the lens.         Happily,
 however, the actions of a convex and of a concave lens are, in this
 respect, in opposite directions, and hence they have, when combined, a
 tendency to correct or compensate the spherical aberrations of each
 other. Still more happily, the amount of this spherical aberration
depends very materially on the relative curvatures of the two surfaces
of the lens. Without altering the focal length of a lens, it is quite
 possible very seriously to alter the amount of the spherical aberration.
 For instance, in lenses of any material, the aberration of a plano-con
 vex lens is four times that of a lens of equal power, where the curva
 ture of the side facing the incident light is three times that of the
other surface.     This remarkable effect arises from the circumstance
that, although upon the whole, the same total deviation of the light is
produced in the two lenses, the distribution of the amount of deviation
to be produced by each surface in its turn is very different.           By the
application of these principles it has become comparatively easy to
 produce a combination free both from primary chromatic, and
from spherical aberration. The correction of the colour by a concave
flint lens depends, speaking roughly and in general, on its focal

644             The Rev. C.    Pritchard     on the Telescope.     [Hay     18,
 length, and not upon the relative curvatures of its surfaces ; conse
 quently these relative curvatures can be altered until those are found
 which balance the spherical aberration of the convex plate-glass lens.
 The investigation of the best methods of obtaining these appropriate
relative curvatures is attended with extreme labour and much
difficulty, and has occupied the thoughts of a long succession of accom
plished mathematicians.       The main source of difficulty has been sup
 posed to arise from the necessity of taking the thicknesses of the lenses
 into the account. Mr. Pritchard, however, has recently shown that
the thicknesses of the two lenses have a tendency to compensate           one
another in the amounts of spherical aberration which they respec
 tively either introduce or remove, and he has demonstrated that tables
constructed on the principle of neglecting the thicknesses, are prac
tically applicable to all such cases as ordinarily arise in the construc
tion of the aplanatic object-glasses of modern telescopes.
     We may consider then that the once difficult question of the
removal of spherical aberration in an object-glass as now practically
solved, and that too in a manner which requires but little further
trouble than the inspection of a set of tables.        There does, however,
still exist a practical difficulty, where theoretically there was, or even
now   is,  supposed to be none.       Itis  almost universally asserted in
treatises upon the subject, that in order to produce an achromatic
combination nothing further       isrequired than to make the focal lengths
of the two lenses proportional to the dispersive powers of the materials
of which they consist.       Practically, and even theoretically, this is  not
the case but, on the contrary, the proper ratio of the focal lengths of
        ;
the two lenses  is  perceptibly influenced     bythe forms or curvatures of
the lenses themselves.     It herein that the eye and the skill of the

that we are to look for one of the weakest and most troublesome
elements in the construction of the object-glasses of telescopes.       Such,
however, has been the improvement in the manufacture of glass in
England, and such     is the ability of modern English artists, that there
is  good reason for believing they have now regained the ancient
supremacy, which in this respect existed in the time of Dollond.

On   the     Shooting-stars of the years 1865-6, and on the Probability
                   of the Cosmical Theory of their Origin.
Attention           recently directed by Professor Newton,* of Yale
                  was
College, U.S.,          probability, on well-considered grounds, that in
                     to the
the current year, 1866, a prodigious flight of meteors, the most
imposing of its kind, and visible over a large area of the earth's
surface, will make its appearance — perhaps for the last time in the
present century — either on the morning of the 13th, or on the 14th
of November. The rare opportunity thus afforded of deciding some
important questions in the theory of shooting-stars makes it a matter
of special interest for persons skilled in such accurate observations,
to watch for its return on each of the mornings named (wherever
practicable, between one and two o'clockf), to obtain the necessary
data. The phenomenon at its maximum was seen by Humboldt, at
Cumana, on the morning of the 12th of November, 1799; and again
by Dr. Denison Olmsted, in its greatest brilliancy, at Newhaven, U.S.,
on the morning of the 13th of November, 1833.           Olmsted was the
first to sum up, in the following general language, the chief charac
teristics of the display : —
    1 . The number, especially of bright meteors, is much larger than
usual.
   2. An uncommonly large proportion leave luminous trains.
   3. They proceed, with few exceptions, from a common centre in
some part of the constellation Leo.
   4. They are seen from midnight to sunrise, and in greatest
abundance between three and four a.m.

meteors    as possible   may be simultaneously   observed   at distant places.

646                             Mr. A. S. Herschel                        [May 25,
     These characteristics were regarded by Olmsted as sufficient to
identify for the future the return of the November shower.               Observers
who endeavour to verify the truth of this description for themselves
will be enabled by so doing, to furnish invaluable materials for future
investigations. The same features are, moreover, of peculiar interest,
since they have been found to characterize, with certain differences, a
number of other meteoric showers.
      The periodicity of the well-known shower of meteors on the 10th of
August was discovered independently by Quetelet, in the year 1836,
and by Herrick (not knowing what Quetelet had predicted) on the
reappearance of the same meteors in the year 1837.*                  At their next
return, on the 10th of August, 1839, it was shown by Littrowf that
a star-shower, whose occurrence in a.d. 1451, on the 5th of August,
N.S., is cited by Biot from the ' Chinese Annals,' — compared with
another that appeared, according to the same authority, in a.d. 830, on
the 26th July, N.S., — gives 365 d. 6 h. 12 m. as the average length of
 the interval between any two successive returns of the August
meteors ; and again, that the same star-shower compared with that of
the 10th of August, 1839, gives 365 d. 6 h. 8 m. as the average
length of the same period, — the mean of the two determinations being
 365 d. 6 h. 10 m., which is twenty minutes longer than the civil or
tropical year ; but differs less than one minute from the sideral year.
 Besides the displays of the August meteors which happened about the
year a.d. 830, other returns of the August meteors, of the nature of
star-showers, are recorded in the ' Chinese Annals 'J to have happened
at the end of July, N.S., about the year a.d. 933 ; and another is
 cited by Herrick which happened on the 2nd of August, N.S , in the
 year 1243.       The meteoric year of August, therefore, coincides with
 the sidereal year ; and a period of 103 years brings all the star-showers
 of a.d. 830, 933, 1243, and 1451 into conjunction with the remarkable
 star-shower of the 10th of August, 1863.                A star-shower is cited,
 moreover, by Biot, which happened at the end of July, N.S., in the
 year a.d. 833. A return of this star-shower may not unreasonably
 be expected to occur on the night of the 10th of August, 1866.
      Between the 13th of October and the 13th of November, during
 the years from a.d. 903 to 1833, not less than thirteen great star-
 showers have been recorded.          They are separated from each other by
 the third part of a century, or by some multiple of this period,
 and are periodical re-appearances          of one grand meteoric shower,

viz. that      seen by Humboldt in 1799, and by Olmsted in 1833 —
the star-shower expected to return in the present year, and known by
the name of the ' Great November Shower.'                    Its encounter with the
earth takes place one day later in the year at each of its principal
returns.       According to the exact calculations of Professor Newton,
the next passage of the earth through the centre of the meteoric
group will take place two hours after sunrise at Greenwich, on the
morning of the 14th of November, 1866.*                           As, however, the
phenomenon occurred upon the morning of the 13th, in each of
the years 1864 and 1865 (and not so brightly upon the 14th), its
moment of greatest brightness may, possibly, fall one day earlier than
 the predicted time, and a watch on both mornings, of the 13th and
 14th, is accordingly recommended to be kept.                     The meteors being
 seen from midnight to sunrise, the hour from one to two o'clock is
 the best that can be chosen, as being the most convenient for making
 simultaneous observations.
       On the morning of the 13th of November, 1865, the meteoric
 shower in England was observed at the Greenwich and Cambridge
 Observatories, at Hawkhurst, and at other places. The hourly number
 of meteors is stated by Mr. Glaisher and by Prof. Challis to have
 exceeded all before recorded at either of those Observatories.                    More
 than 250 meteors (279) were recorded at Greenwich from midnight
 until five o'clock, when for a space of nearly a quarter of an hour
 the paths of the meteors among the stars, &c., were not noted, but
 their number was simply counted. The result was, that at this time
 meteors of the first class were appearing at the rate of 250 per hour.
  At least a thousand meteors must have been visible at Greenwich
 from one to five o'clock on the morning of the 13th.                 They were only
 seen after midnight, until near sunrise, and they were most abundant
 during the hour from one to two o'clock.                  The maximum display of
  the November meteors expected in the year 1866, is still several
  hundred times greater than that observed at Greenwich on the 13th of
  November, 1865.          Two hundred and forty thousand meteors are com
  puted by Arago to have been visible above the horizon of Boston on
  the morning of the 13th of November, 1833. f                      Hundreds of the
  meteors seen on that occasion appeared brighter than the planets; and
  some of them were fireballs of the largest class.
        Nearly two-thirds (172) of the meteors seen at Greenwich left
  luminous trains, visible for several seconds after the disappearance of
  the meteors.         Their unusual number, and the appearance of the
  luminous trains which they left behind them, agree with Olmsted's
  description of the meteors in 1833, and leave no doubt of the return
  of the November shower. Its reappearance in the present year, there

  the   west coast of Mexico, " The number of meteors seen at once, often equalled
   the apparent   number of the fixed stars seen at a

' Great November Shower' of 1866.
     Amongst the list of shooting-stars seen at Hawkhurst last Novem

Fifteen other meteors of the list were identical with meteors seen at
Cambridge.          The heights, lengths of path, &c., of ten of these
accordant meteors were calculated, and this is also the number of
accordances calculated by Dr. Heis of Miinster.                     The average heights

     A number of observations of luminous meteors contained in the
Catalogue of the British Association, from the year 1845 until the
present time, are capable of being classified in a similar manner, and
upwards of fifty radiant points of shower-meteors throughout the year
are recognized as coinciding in their epochs and positions with the
epochs and positions of similar radiant points observed by Dr. Heis.
Charts of these meteors are now in process of completion, and a first
step will be gained thereby, towards establishing a regular shower-
meteor theory.            When the principal meteoric showers, and their
connected radiant points, and epochs are pointed out, what are com
                   "              "
monly called sporadic shooting-stars will become extremely scarce.
      A few instances lately brought to light will show that aerolites
and fireballs are not only independent                  of geographical position, but
that they are also fixed in their dates of appearance and directions.
Two stonefalls took place on the 25th of August, 1865 ; one at
Aumale, in Algeria, the other at Shergotty, in India. Two detonating
meteors of the largest class were seen in December, 1865; one on
the 7th, at the mouth of the Loire, the other on the 9th, at Charleston,
U.S. Three detonating meteors, on the east coast of England alone,
during the last five years (1861-5), occurred between the 19th and
the 21st of November.                  Two of the latter meteors, whose paths
could be traced, proceeded from a common centre in some part of
the constellation Cetus. A bright fireball was seen at Hawk hurst
on the morning of the 9th of December, and another at Manchester on
the morning of the 13th of December, 1864, whose paths (continued
backwards) proceeded directly from the radiant point of the period
mentioned last in the foregoing list.                 A notable peculiarity in respect
of general geographical distribution, periodical returns, and fixed
directions would evidently connect aerolites and fireballs in true
astronomical relation with ordinary shooting-stars. Nevertheless it
appears that out of 72 aerolites whose hour of fall is certainly known,
by far the greater number (58) occurred after midday, during the
hours from noon_to nine p.m.             J    Shooting-stars, on the contrary, reach

 their maximum at an opposite hour of the day, being found to be most
 abundant after midnight ; or twelve hours later. An astronomical
difference accordingly exists between aerolites and shooting-stars, to
 which it is not impossible that a physical difference of a kind not yet
established should correspond.         It is noticed, for example, that on the
 10th of August, and the 13th November, dates on which shooting-stars
and fireballs are more abundant than on any other nights in the year,
but one stone has fallen on each date.         The average height of seventy-
 eight meteors observed in America on the 13th of November, 1863,
exceeded the usual height of meteors by fifteen or twenty miles.*               On
 these grounds Professor Newton supposes that the November shower-
meteors are composed of more easily destructible, or of more inflam
 mable materials than aerolitic bodies.          An examination of the light
of shooting-stars (and particularly of the November meteors) by means
 of the spectroscope, would at once reveal the fact if these meteors and
their luminous trains are composed of substances in a gaseous state ;
the presumption is that they are solid, although probably in a state of
fine division.     Whether shooting-stars consist of particles in a state of
dust, or vapour, which the spectroscope can alone reveal, the return of
 the Great November Shower is a favourable opportunity for advancing
our knowledge by its use, and a discovery is in store for refracting
prisms, which should not (if possible) be allowed to pass away
unheeded.
    The spectrum of an entire star-shower was shown, by Dr. Tyndall's
assistance, upon the screen with a straight-vision prism having a direct
field of view of at least 20° of the sky.-f The meteors were illuminated
first by the carbon points of the electric lamp, and afterwards by the
vapour of silver in the electric arc, showing the different appearances
in the prismatic field of view, of a solid, or a gaseous source of light.
Some tinder was ignited by a fire-syringe;                 and experiments with
Gassiot's Geissler tubes were shown to illustrate the difference that
exists, between the diffuse glow of an electric discharge, resembling
the aurora in the highest and rarest strata of the atmosphere, and the
massive light of meteors, resembling an ordinary spark.
                                                                    [A.  S. H.]

                     On the Opalescence          of    the Atmosphere.
On    a previous occasion (May 22, 1864) the speaker explained the
principles of a method by the application of which we are able to
gain some knowledge of the distribution of the chemically active rays
on the earth's surface, and their variation from time to time.                       This
method depends upon the comparison of tints gained by sensitive photo
graphic paper when exposed to daylight ; and it is evident that we must
define the "chemical rays" to be all those which are able to produce a
darkening effect upon chloride of silver paper.                    In order that such a
mode of measurement should be possible, it is necessary, in the first
place, that paper can be prepared of a uniform degree of sensitiveness;
and secondly, that the relation between the several tints and the inten
sity of the light necessary to produce such tints should be known.
These relations have been accurately ascertained, and the method is
now so far perfected that the observations can be very easily and accu
rately made.*
      The whole apparatus needed for these experiments is contained in
a small box, and all the observations for a day can be made in the
course of a few minutes.
      Through the kindness of Mr. Balfour Stewart, determinations of
the Chemical Intensity of Total Daylight have been carried on at Kew
Observatory for the past year by Mr. T. W. Baker.                        The mean daily
intensity    can   be   readily  obtained    from      the  separate observations,    and
these, when plotted out as a curve, show the daily mean intensities
for the year.

     It is seen that the condition of the sky and weather materially
influences the chemical intensity of the month — thus June, 1865, was
cloudy (2 days rain ; 21 days cloudy ; average amount of cloud, 5'5),
and the mean intensity is 76'9; whereas September was a very bright
month (0 days rain; 20 days cloudy; average amount of cloud, 2 -5),
and the chemical intensity reached 110 '2.
     If  we compare the mean intensities for the summer and winter

     The above numbers show that the increase of chemical action from
 December to March is not nearly so great as that from March to June.
 This difference cannot be attributed to the common absorption exerted
 by the atmosphere, but may be explained as being the necessary con
sequence of a peculiar absorptive action which the atmosphere effects
upon the chemically active rays, and to which the name of opalescence
may be given.
     It has frequently been stated* that the chemical intensity of light on
snowy peaks and in tropical climates is much less than that in our own
latitudes, and that photographers in Mexico have found it impossible
amidst the glaring rays of a tropical sun to obtain a picture which in
the gloomy atmosphere          of England would need an exposure of only
one minute.        In order to ascertain the degree of truth attaching to
these extraordinary statements,          and to obtain some insight into the
chemical intensity of tropical climates, the speaker was fortunate to be
able to send his assistant, Mr. T. E. Thorpe, to Para, on the Amazons
(long. 48° 30' W., and lat. 1° 28' S.). The measurements there made
have already furnished some very interesting results ; in the first place,
                         ....
we find that the daily mean chemical intensities at Para and at Kew
on the same days are represented by the following numbers : —

     The curves for these days show the enormous variation of chemical
intensity which occurs under a tropical sun during the rainy season.
Every afternoon regularly, and sometimes at other periods of the day,
the enormous thunder-clouds discharge their contents in the form of
deluging rain, and the chemical action sinks to zero ; then the storm
passes over, and the chemical intensity again rises (see woodeut on
opposite page).       It is thus seen that any difficulties which a photo
grapher may have in the tropics cannot be ascribed to an insufficient
supply of the sun's chemically active rays.

1866.]            on the Opalescence  of the Atmosphere.               653
     The speaker desired, however, chiefly        to direct attention this
evening   to   some  experiments  which  appear  to  throw light upon that
much vexed question of the cause of the blue colour of the heavens and
the ruddy tints of sunrise and sunset.    Since the time of Leonardo da
Vinci this subject has been a favourite ground for the display of
meteorological speculations. Leonardo, and afterwards Goethe, believed
that the blueness of an unclouded sky was due to the passage of the
white light through the atmosphere containing finely-divided par
ticles.    Newton explained the blue colour of the heavens by the exist
ence in the atmosphere of hollow very minute vesicles of water, upon
which, as on a soap-bubble, the colours of thin plates become percep
tible ; and according as the thickness of the walls of these vesicles
increased, so would the colour change from blue to yellow, orange, and
red ; and thus, by very frequent reflections, the various tints from sky-
blue to sunset-red could be explained.         Founded upon this theory
Clausius has calculated the relative intensities of direct sunlight and the
diffuse reflected light of the sky for varying altitudes of the sun.
     Some physicists have assumed that the air itself has a blue colour,
whilst others have admitted that if air be of a blue colour by reflected
light, it must appear red by transmitted light.
     Others again, in order to avoid the difficulty of explaining the

 654                          Prof. H. E. Roscoe                        [June  1,
 great variety of sunset tints, have assumed these tints to be an ocular
 deception, or caused by the presence of clouds which receive and repeat
 the colour !
      Many physicists have suggested that the atmosphere, being filled with
 small particles of floating solid matter, acts like an opalescent medium and
 transmits only red light ; but it is to Briicke• that we are indebted for
 a complete statement and masterly investigation of this view of the sub
ject.     Forbes, again, t explains the phenomena in an entirely different
 manner; for he, observing that under certain circumstances aqueous
 vapour, or rather water in finely divided particles, is able to absorb the
 blue rays, and that the sun looked red when seen through a particular
 portion of a jet of escaping steam, attributes the sunset-red solely to
 the presence of water in this peculiar state of division.
      In order to appreciate the val ue of these various opi nions, it appears of
 special interest to obtain a knowledge of some quantitative facts re
 specting the intensity of the light transmitted directly fiom the sun, and
 that reflected by the air or particles in the atmosphere        The possibility
 of making such measurements with respect to those parts of the sun's
 light which may be expected to show great differences in reflection and
 transmission,   viz. the most refrangible portions, is rendered at once
 evident by the employment of the simple method of measuring the
 chemical intensity of light which has been above alluded to. The
 method employed consists simply in determining the chemical intensity
 of the total daylight (sunlight and diffused light), and immediately after
 wards shading off the sun's direct rays by means of a small disc or sphere
 of metal, whose apparent diameter is only slightly greater than that of
 the solar disc seen from the position of the sensitive paper. In this way
 the chemical intensity of the total (direct and diffused) light is compared
 with that given off by the whole of the heavens alone, and the differ
ence gives the chemical intensity of the direct sunlight.
      Experiment soon proved that the relative intensity of the chemical
light coming directly from the sun is very much less than we should ordi
narily suppose, judging from the intensity of the visible light. Thus, at
Owen's College, Manchester, it was found when the sun was 12° 3' above
the horizon, that of 100 chemically active rays falling on the horizontal
surface, less than 5 were due to the direct sunlight, whilst 95 came
from the diffused light of the heavens, even when the sky was un
clouded.      At the same instant, of 100 rays of visible light as affecting
the eye, 60 came directly from the sun, and only 40 from the diffuse
sky-light. This singular result was also observed at Cheetham Hill, by
Mr. Baxendell, and at Heidelberg, by Dr. Wolkoff; indeed, at this
latter station, it was found on several occasions that whilst the sun
was shining brightly, it was totally devoid of chemical rays, the

     Thus, whilst the theory requires that at an elevation of 20° the
relation of diffuse light to sunlight was as 100 to 49-1, the expe
riments at Heidelberg showed a relation of 100 to 35, those of
Kew of 100 to 30, at Cheetham Hill of 100 to 19, and at Owens
College of 100 to 10, whilst the differences                                 at higher altitudes

 becomes still greater.      The Heidelberg observations were made
 on    the summit of the Konigstuhl, at an elevation of nearly
 2000 feet above the sea level, and therefore at a position beneath
 which a very considerable portion of the densest air was situated ;
 when the sun attained an altitude of 40°, the direct sun's rays exert
 the same amount of chemical action as the diffused light of a cloudless
 sky. At Kew Observatory, this point of equality is not nearly reached
 when the altitude of the sun is 42°.     At Para, under the equator, this
difference between the chemical intensity of direct and diffuse sunlight
becomes even more striking, for with an altitude of 77° the ratio of
direct to diffuse is less than 0-5 ; that    is,   if
                                                   100 rays come from the
diffused daylight only 50 come from the direct sunlight.         This     cer         is
tainlya   very remarkable result.     We thus see that the high tropical
light curves are mainly caused, not by the increase of the chemically
active rays in the direct sunlight, but    by  the enormous increase in the
chemical activity of the diffuse light.     It must, however, be borne in
mind, that in the Para observations        the sky was not cloudless, and
much light  is  reflected from the heavy cumuli         ;        is,
                                                            nevertheless, re

markable, that under tropical sun at an altitude of 80°, the diffuse day
                      a
light should exert a chemical action twice as great as the direct sunlight.
     That the relation between the chemically active constituents of sun
light, direct and diffused,   quite different from the relation of the visible
                             is
rays, can be easily ascertained.    In some of the experiments made at
Ciir< Hi. mi Hill, the shadow of  a  small disc was thrown on     horizontal a
surface of white paper, and careful estimations made of the relative
brightness of the shaded and unshaded portions of the surface.          com           A
parison of these results with those obtained at the same time for the
chemical rays showed that when the sun's mean altitude was 25° 16', the
mean ratio of the chemical intensities of direct and diffuse light was
0-23 (or for 100 of diffuse light there was 23 of direct sunlight),
whilst the ratio of the visible intensities was 4'0 (or for 100 of diffuse
light there was 400 of direct sunlight).        This shows that the action
of the atmosphere was l-74 times greater on the chemical than on the
visible rays.      Again, at Owens College, with          mean altitude of
                                                                 a
 12° 3', the ratio of chemical intensity was 0'053, that of the visible
intensity being 1'4; or the action of the atmosphere was 26-4 times
 as great upon the chemical as upon the visible rays.
     How can we seek to explain this unexpected result — that the sun
 shining brightly, and casting    a dark shadow, should at     height of 20°
                                                                         a

     The explanation may be rendered plain by an experiment. Let us
 take very slightly milky liquid — such as water containing
     a                                                               grain of

 we can scarcely detect it.       Nevertheless, this minute trace of most
finely-divided sulphur  is sufficient to cut off the chemically active rays                 ;
 the bright flash of carbonic disulphide in nitric oxide cannot explode
 the bulb when the opalescent solution       is  placed between      and the     it

bulb   ;    but the bulb explodes instantly when the light is allowed to
pass through pure water.
     We have here an exact imitation of the condition of the atmosphere
as regards the chemically active rays.       We see that light of a high
degree of refrangibility cannot pass through the water containing the
finely-divided sulphur ; it is reflected back again by the particles of
sulphur.     So, too, the atmosphere is filled with particles which reflect
the blue rays and transmit the red.      What the exact nature of these
particles may be, it is hard to say.     We know, however, that the air
is always filled with minute solid bodies.     We see that in the sporules
which are constantly present and cause fermentation and putrefactive
decomposition. We see it also in the fact that particles of soda can
always be detected in the atmosphere             by spectrum-analysis.      We
notice these particles as motes dancing in the sunbeam, or in those
grander paths of light which sometimes shoot up into the sky from a
setting sun.     The phenomenon may, perhaps be caused by that finely-
divided extra-terrestrial meteoric dust, which        is, according to many
physicists, constantly falling through the atmosphere to the earth's
surface.      These solid particles in the air may produce the above
effects, and certainly do produce them      ;  but we must remember that
small particles of water are also able to transmit only red rays, and
that, as Forbes has shown, the glorious ruddy tints of the setting sun
are doubtless partly caused by aqueous vapour.
      Ifthe white beam of the electric lamp be passed through          a   tube
3  feet long, fitted with glass plates at each end, and filled witha   scarcely
visibly opalescent liquid, all the blue, green, and yellow rays will be
completely cut off, and the immerging beam of light           deep red. Here
                                                             is
indeed we have an artificial sunset.      The finely divided sulphur reflects
blue light and transmits red.     If  the visible light is diminished to one-
third      means of opalescent sulphur, the chemically active rays are
           by
altogether cut off.     The variation in the amount of this finely-divided
matter, whether solid or liquid, in the air, will naturally produce varia
tion in the tints of sunrise and sunset, and the presence at sunset of
more aqueous vapour on the point of being condensed than at sun
rise will explain the greater depth of colour in the setting than in
the rising sun   ;  the tints of dawn being, according to Mr. Brayley,
those of evening in the reverse order.
     In opal glass we have perhaps a still better illustration of the
action of the atmosphere upon the chemically active rays.            The opal
escence of the glass    iscaused by the presence of very minute particles
of bone-ash (calcium phosphate), or of arsenic trioxide, which are dis
seminated throughout the mass.           By reflected light this glass appears
white or blueish-white,      bytransmitted light it   appears orange.   If   we
place  a  bright source of white light behind the glass, we see that the
direct rays are red, whilst the general diffused light reflected from the
particles of the finely-divided matter in the glass    is blueish-white.
     That the size of the particles between which the light passes
modifies the character of the transmitted ray scarcely admits of doubt.

1  866.]           on the Opalescence   of the Atmosphere.               659
This   is most clearly exemplified in the beautiful phenomena of blue and
ruby gold investigated by Mr. Faraday.          Gold in thin plates reflects
yellow, and transmits green light ; but when suspended in a very fine
state of division in water, it transmits blue, purple, or ruby light,
according to the state of division in which it is precipitated.
     The blue, purple, and ruby solutions all contain metallic gold in
suspension, as Mr. Faraday has most conclusively shown, and yet they
transmit totally different rays.
     Hence we may fairly suppose that the varying size of the reflecting
particles may aid in producing the widely differing sunset tints, from
deep ruby-red to yellow and even blue ; for we are not without several
well-authenticated cases in which the sun has been seen to be blue.
Thus, in the year 1831, a blue sun was noticed over a great part of
Europe, as also in America.
     We have seen that the light transmitted by finely-divided sulphur
is red — it is, however, singular that blue sulphur can be formed.          If
we add ferric chloride to solution of sulphuretted hydrogen, we get a
transient butvery splendid purple tint; and we may ask ourselves
whether this can be due to the size of the particle.     If we heat sulphu
retted hydrogen water up to 200° C. the gas decomposes, sulphur being
deposited, and the solution attains a deep blue colour.        Can this pos
sibly be due to the minute division, almost approaching solution, which
the sulphur attains?       We find that on cooling the colour disappears,
sulphur is deposited, and the liquid becomes milky.           If we dissolve
sulphur    in sulphuric  trioxide (anhydrous sulphuric acid), no chemical
action that we know of occurs, and we get a magnificent deep-blue
colour. Can this again be due to the minute division of the sulphur, thus
permitting the blue rays alone to pass?
     Finally, it is interesting to learn that both the analogues of sulphur,
selenium and tellurium, yield magnificently coloured liquids when acted
 upon by sulphuric trioxide.      Selenium in this state yields a deep olive-
green solution, and tellurium a magnificent ruby-red colour.
     Can these colours likewise be caused by the reflection or absorp
 tion of one kind of light and the preferential transmission of another
 kind by finely-divided particles?
     The ruby-red gold liquid and ruby-red gold glass are both as trans
 parent, and the one is apparently as truly a liquid as the red solution
of tellurium. Yet we know that finely suspended metallic gold is the
cause of this red tint.     Are we acting contrary to analogy in supposing
 that the colour of this red liquid is caused by the particles of finely-
divided tellurium, or that of these blue and green liquids by the particles
of sulphur and selenium ?
     The speaker felt that he was here entering upon debateablc ground,
 that, namely, of the cause of the colour of natural bodies ; it was with
 much diffidence that he brought forward these examples of coloured
 solutions, and he did so only because they forced themselves on to
 his notice in the consideration of the plainer and now somewhat better
 understood phenomenon of the Opalescence of the Atmosphere.

                       On the   Source    of Muscular Power.
What is the source of muscular power                ?   Twenty years ago, if this
question had been asked, there were but few philosophers who
would have hesitated to reply, " The source of muscular power is that
peculiar force which is developed by living animals, and which we
                           "
term the vital force !         but the progress of scientific discovery has
rendered the view implied in such an answer so utterly untenable
that, at the present moment, no one possessing any knowledge of
physical science would venture to return such a reply. We now
know that an animal, however high its organization may be, can no
more generate an amount of force capable of moving a grain of sand,
than a stone can fall upwards or a locomotive drive a train without
fuel.    All that such an animal can do is to liberate that store of force,
or potential energy, which is locked up in its food. It is the chemical
change which food suffers in the body of an animal that liberates tho
previously pent-up forces of that food, which now make their appear
ance in the form of actual energy — as heat and mechanical motion.
     From food, and food alone, comes the matter of which the animal
body is built up ; and from food alone come all the different kinds of
physical force which an animal is capablo of manifesting.
     The two chief forms of force thus manifested are Heat and Muscular
motion or mechanical work, and these have been almost universally
traced to two distinct sources — the heat to tho oxidation of tho food,
and tho mechanical work to the oxidation of the muscles.
     This doctrine, first promulgated, the speaker believed, by Liebig,
occupies a prominent position in that philosopher's justly celebrated
'
  Chemico-Physiological Essays.'
     In his work entitled ' Die organische Chcmie in ihrcr Anwcndung
auf Physiologie und Pathologic, Braunschweig, 1842,' Liebig says,
" All experience teaches that tin re is only one source of mechanical

power in the organism, and this source is the transformation of the
living parts of the body into lifeless compounds. . . . This trans
formation occurs in consequence of the combination of oxygen with
the substance of the living parts of the body."                      And again, in his
' Letters on                                                     to  these living parts
               Chemistry, 1851,' p. 366, referring
of the body, he says, " All these organized tissues, all the parts which
in any way manifest force in the body are derived from the albumen
of the blood ; all the albumen of the blood is derived from the plastic
or sanguineous constituents of the food, whether animal or vegetable.
It is clear, therefore, that the plastic constituents of food, the ultimate
source of which is the vegetable kingdom, are the conditions essential
to all production or manifestation of force, to all these effects which
the animal organism produces by means of its organs of sense,
thought, and motion."               And again, at page 374, he says, " The
sulphurized and nitrogenous constituents of food determine the con
tinuance of the manifestations of force ; the non-nitrogenous serve to
produce heat.           The former are the builders of organs and organized
structures, and the producers of force ; the latter support the respi
ratory process, they are materials for respiration."
     This doctrine has since been treated as an almost self-evident
truth in most physiological text-books; it has been quite recently
                                                           '
supported by Eanke ;• and, in his lecture On the Food of Man in
relation  to  his Useful Work, 1865,' Playfair says, page 37, " From the
considerations which have preceded, we consider Liebig amply justi
fied in viewing the non-nitrogenous portions of food as mere heat-
givers.    .   .      .   While we have been led to the conclusion that
the transformation of the tissues is the source of dynamical power in
the animal."                                                 I
                      At page 30 he also says, " agree with Draper and
others in considering the contraction of a muscle due to a disintegra
tion of its particles, and its relaxation to their restoration.                   .  .   .
All these facts prove that transformation of the muscle through the
agency of oxygen is the condition of muscular action."                          Finally,
in a masterly review of the present relations of chemistry to animal
life, published in March last,t Gelling says, page 98, " Seeing, then,
that muscular exertion is really dependent upon muscular oxidation,
wo have to consider what should be the products, and what the value
of this oxidation."         .   .   .  And again, page 103, " The slow oxidation
of so much carbon and hydrogen in the human body, therefore, will
always produce its due amount of heat, or an equivalent in some other
form of energy ; for while the latent force liberated by the combustion
of the carbon and hydrogen of fat is expressed solely in the form of
heat, the combustion of an equal quantity of the carbon and hydrogen
of voluntary muscle is expressed chiefly in the form of motion."
     Nevertheless, this view of the origin of muscular power has not
escaped challenge.            Immediately after its first promulgation, Dr.            J.

R. Mayer wrote,• " A muscle is only an apparatus by means of which
the transformation of force is effected, but it is iwt the material by the
chemical change of which mechanical work is produced."                 He showed
that the 15 lbs. of dry muscles of a man weighing 150 lbs. would, if
their mechanical work were due to their chemical change, be com
pletely oxidized in 80 days, the heart itself in 8 days, and the
ventricles of the heart in 2£ days.          After endeavouring to prove by
physiological arguments        that  not one per cent, of the oxygen absorbed
in the lungs could possibly come into contact with the substance of
the muscles, Mayer says, " The fire-place in which this combustion
goes on is the interior of the blood-vessels, the blood however — a
slowly-burning liquid — is the oil in the flame of life. . . . Just
as a plant-leaf transforms a given mechanical effect, light, into another
force, chemical difference, so does the muscle produce mechanical work
at the cost of the chemical difference consumed in its capillaries.
Heat can neither replace the sun's rays for the plant, nor the chemical
process in the animal : every act of motion in an animal is attended
by the consumption of oxygen and the production of carbonic acid
and water ; every muscle to which atmospheric oxygen does not gain
access ceases to perform its functions."
      But Mayer was not the first to conceive this view of muscular
action.       Nearly 200 years ago, a Bath physician, Dr. John Mayow.f
 distinctly stated that for the production of muscular motion two
 things are necessary — the conveyance of combustible substances to
 the muscle by the blood, and the access of oxygen by respiration.
 He concluded that the chief combustible substance so used was fat.
 A century before Priestley isolated oxygen, Mayow was aware of its
 existence in the air, in nitre, and in nitric acid ; he knew that com
 bustion is supported by the oxygen of the air, and that this gas is
 absorbed in the lungs by the blood, and is absolutely necessary for
 muscular activity.
      For two decades this doctrine sank into oblivion ; and it is only
 within the last two years that it has been again advanced, chiefly by
 Haideuhain,} Traube, and, to a limited extent, by Donders. ||
       Experimental evidence was, however, still wanting to give per
 manent vitality to the resuscitated doctrine ; for although tho laborions
 and remarkable investigations of Voit § and of Edward Smithlf point
 unmistakably in the direction of Mayow and Mayer's hypothesis, yet

the results of these physiologists were not sufficiently conclusive to
render the opposite view untenable.       This want of data of a suffi
ciently conclusive character has been supplied by a happily conceived
experiment undertaken by Fick and Wislicenus in the autumn of last
                             '
year, and described in the Philosophical Magazine,' vol. xxxi . p. 485.
 In the application of these data, however, to the problem now under
 consideration, one important link was found to be wanting, viz. the
amount of actual energy generated by the oxidation of a given weight
of muscle in the human body. Fick and Wislicenus refer to this
                                            "
missing link in the following words : — The question now arises
what quantity of heat is generated when muscle is burnt to the
products in which its constituent elements leave the human body
 through the lungs and kidneys ? At present, unfortunately, there are
not the experimental data required to give an accurate answer to this
 important question, for neither the heat of combustion of muscle nor
 of the nitrogenous residue (urea) of muscle is known."         Owing to
 the want of these data, the numerical results of the experiment of
 Fick and Wislicenus are rendered less conclusive against the
hypothesis of muscle combustion than they otherwise would have
been, whilst similar determinations, which have been            made    by
 Edward Smith, Haughton, Playfair, and others, are even liable to a
total misinterpretation from the same cause.
     The speaker stated that he had supplied this want by the calori-
metrical determination of the actual energy evolved by the combustion
of muscle and of urea in oxygen. Availing himself of these data ho
 then proceeded to the consideration of the problem to be solved, the
present condition of which might be thus summed up : — It is agreed
on all hands that muscular power is derived exclusively from the
mutual chemical action of the food and atmospheric oxygen ; but
opinions differ as to whether that food must first be converted into the
actual organized substance of the muscle, before its oxidation can give
rise to mechanical force, or whether it is not also possible that
muscular work may be derived from the oxidation of the food, which
has only arrived at the condition of blood and not of organized
muscular tissue.
     The importance of this problem can scarcely bo overrated ; it is
a corner-stone of the physiological      edifice, and the key to the
phenomena of the nutrition of animals.      For its satisfactory solution
the following data require to be determined : —
     1st. The amount of force or actual energy generated by the
oxidation of a given amount of muscle in the body.
     2nd. The amount of mechanical force exerted by the muscles of
the body during a given time.                                             m
     3rd. The quantity of muscle oxidized in the body during the same
time.
     If the total amount of force involved in muscular action, as mea
sured by the mechanical work performed, be greater than that which
could possibly be generated by the quantity of muscle oxidized during

18G6.]               on the Source   of Muscular Power.                     665
the same time, it necessarily follows that the power of the muscles is
not derived exclusively from the oxidation of their own substance.
     As regards the first datum to be determined, it is necessary to agree
upon some unit for the measurement of mechanical force. The unit
most commonly adopted is that represented by the lifting of a kilogram
weight to the height of one metre.        The researches of Joule and Mayer
have connected this standard unit with heat; — they prove that the
force required to elevate this weight 425 times will, when converted
into heat, raise the temperature of an equal weight of water 1° C.
If  this weight were let fall from a height of 425 metres, its collision
with the earth would produce an amount of heat sufficient to raise the
temperature     of 1 kilogram of water 1° C. The same heating effect
would also of course be produced by the fall of 425 kilograms through
1 metre.     This standard of force is termed a metrekilogram ;* and 425
metrekilograms are equal to that amount of heat which is necessary to
raiso tho temperature of 1 kilogram of water through 1° C. If then it
be found that the heat evolved by the combustion of a certain weight
of charcoal or muscle, for instance, raises the temperature of 1 kilogram
of water through 1° C, this means, when translated into mechanical
power, 425 metrekilograms.         Again, if a man weighing 64 kilograms
climbs to a height of 1,000 metres, the ascent of his body to this
height represents 64,000 metrekilograms of work ; that is, the labour
necessary to raise a kilogram weight to the height of 1 metre 64,000
times.
     In order to estimate the amount of actual energy generated by the
oxidation of a given amount of muscle in the body, it is necessary to
determine, first, the amount of actual energy generated by the com
bustion of that amount of muscle in oxygen, and then to deduct from
the number thus obtained the amount of energy still remaining in the
products of the oxidation of this quantity of muscle which leave the
body. Of these products, urea and uric and hippuric acids are the
only ones in appreciable quantity which still retain potential energy
on leaving the body, and of these the two latter are excreted in such
small proportions that they may be considered as urea without intro
ducing any material error into the results.
     These determinations were made in Lewis Thompson's calorimeter,
which consists of a copper tube to contain a mixture of chlorate of
potash with the combustible substance, and which can be enclosed in
a kind of diving-bell, also of copper, and so lowered to the bottom of a
suitable vessel containing a known quantity (2 litres) of water.            The
determinations were made with this instrument in the following man
ner : — 19-5 grams of chlorate of potash, to which about Jth of peroxide
of manganese was added was intimately mixed with a known weight
(generally about 2 grams) of the substance whose potential energy

word gramme to gram.

                          Professor    Frankland                 [Juno   8,
was to bo determined, and the mixture being then placed in the copper
tube above mentioned, a small piece of cotton thread previously steeped
in chlorate of potash and dried was inserted in the mixture. The
temperature of the water in the calorimeter was now carefully ascer
tained by a delicate thermometer ; and the end of the cotton thread
being ignited the tube with its contents was placed in the copper bell
and lowered to the bottom of the water. As soon as the combustion
reached the mixture a stream of gases issued from numerous small
openings at the lower edge of the bell and rose to the surface of the
water — a height of about 10 inches.
    At the termination of the deflagration, the water was allowed free
access to the interior of the bell, by opening a stopcock connected
with the bell by a small tube rising above the surface of the water in
the calorimeter.   The gases in the interior of the bell were thus dis
placed by the incumbent column of water, and by moving the bell up
and down repeatedly a perfect equilibrium of temperature throughout
the entire mass of water was quickly established.      The temperature
of the water was again carefully observed, and the difference between
this and the previous observation determines the calorific power or
potential energy, expressed as heat, of the substance consumed.
    The value thus obtained      is,however, obviously subject to tho
following corrections —
                      :
    1. The amount of heat absorbed by the calorimeter and apparatus
employed, to be added.
    2. The amount of heat carried away by the escaping gases, after
issuing from the water, to be added.
    3. The amount of heat due to the decomposition of the chlorate of
potash employed, to be deducted.
    4. Tho amount of heat equivalent to the work performed by the
gases generated in overcoming the pressure of tho atmosphere, to be
added.
    Although the errors due to these causes to some extent neutralize
each other, thereis  still an outstanding balance of sufficient importance
to require that the necessary corrections should be carefully attended to.
     The amount of error from the first cause was once for all experi
mentally determined, and was added to the increase of temperature
observed in each experiment.
    Tho amount of heat carried away by the escaping gases after
issuing from the water may be divided into two items, viz. :—
    a. Tho amount of heat rendered latent by tho water which             is
carried off by the gases in the form of vapour.
    b. Tho amount of heat carried off by these gases by reason of
their temperature being above that of tho water from which they
issue.
    It was ascertained that stream of dry air when passed through the
                            a
water of the calorimeter, at about the same rate and for the same
period of time as the gaseous products of combustion, depressed the
temperature of the water by only 0°-02 C.

1866.]              on the Source of Muscular Power.                 667
     By placing a delicate thermometer in the escaping gases, and
another in the water, no appreciable difference of temperature could
be observed.     Both these items may therefore be safely neglected.
     The two remaining corrections can be best considered together,
since a single careful determination eliminates both. When a com
bustible substance is burnt in gaseous oxygen, the conditions arc
essentially different from those which obtain when the same sub
stance is consumed at the expense of the combined or solid oxygen
of chlorate of potash. In the first case the products of combustion,
when cooled to the temperature of the water in the calorimeter, occupy
less space than the substances concerned in the combustion, and no
part of the energy developed is therefore expended in external work,
that is, in overcoming the pressure of the atmosphere.    In the second
case, both the combustible and the supporter of combustion are in the
solid condition, whilst a considerable proportion of the products of
combustion are gases.       The generation of the latter cannot take
place without the performance of external work, for every cubic inch
produced must obviously, in overcoming atmospheric pressure, per
form an amount of work equivalent, in round numbers, to the lifting
of a weight of 15 lbs. to the height of one inch. In performing this
work the gases aro cooled, and consequently less heat is com
municated to tho water of the calorimeter.      Nevertheless, tho loss of
heat due to this cause is but small.    Under the actual conditions of
the experiments detailed below, its amount would only have increased
the temperature of the water in the calorimeter by Cf'Ql C. Even this
slight error is entirely eliminated by the final correction which wo
have now to consider.
     It is well known that the decomposition of chlorate of potash into
chloride of potassium and free oxygen is attended with the evolution
of heat.     If a few grains of peroxide of manganese, or better, of
peroxide of iron, be dropped into an ounce or two of fused chlorate of
potash which is slowly disengaging oxygen, the evolution of gas
 immediately proceeds with great violence, and tho mixturo becomes
visibly red hot, although the external application of heat be discon
tinued from the moment when the metallic peroxide is added.          Tho
 latter remains unaltered at the close of the operation.      It is thus
 obvious that chlorate of potash, on being decomposed, furnishes
considerably more heat than that which is necessary to gasify tho
 oxygen which it evolves.      It was therefore necessary to determine
 the amount of heat thus evolved by the quantity of chlorate of
 potash (9-75 grams) mixed with one gram of tho substance burnt
 in each of the following determinations.      This was effected by the
 use of two copper tubes, the one placed within the other.           The
 interior tube was charged with a known weight of the same mixture of
 chlorate of potash and peroxide of manganese as that used for tho
 subsequent experiments, whilst tho annular space between the two
 tubes was filled with a combustible mixture of chlorate and spermaceti,
 the calorific value of which had been previously ascertained. Tlie

 latter mixture was ignited in the calorimeter as before, and the heat
 generated during its combustion effected the complete decomposition
 of the chlorate in the interior cylinder, as was proved by a subsequent
 examination of the liquid in the calorimeter, which contained no traces

position of 9-75 grams of chlorate of potash, furnishing the numbers
378, 326, and 341, agree as closely as could be expected, when it is
considered that all experimental errors are necessarily thrown upon
the calorific value of the chlorate of potash.
     The mean of the above five experimental numbers was, in all
cases, deducted from the actual values read off in the following
determinations.
     It was ascertained by numerous trials that all the chlorate of
potash was decomposed in the deflagrations, and that but mere traces
of carbonic oxide were produced.

     It  is evident that the           above determination of the actual energy
developed       by the combustion of muscle in oxygen represents more
than the amount of actual energy produced by the oxidation of
musclo within tho body, because, when musclo burns in oxygen its
carbon is converted into carbonic acid, and its hydrogen into water ;
the nitrogen being, to a great extent, evolved in the elementary state ;
whereas, when muscle is most completely consumed in the body, the
products are carbonic acid water and urea ; the whole of the nitrogen
passes out of the body as urea— a substance which still retains a
considerable amount of potential energy. Dry muscle and pure
albumen yield, under these circumstances, almost exactly one-third of
their weight of urea, and this fact, together with the above deter
mination of the actual energy developed on the combustion of urea,
enables us to deduce with certainty the amount of actual energy
developed by muscle and albumen respectively when consumed in the
human body. It is as follows : —

      We have tlnis aficertained the first of .our three data, viz. the
 amount of force or actual energy generated by the oxidation of a given
 amount of muscle in the body ; and we now proceed to ascertain the
 second, viz. the amount of mechanical force exerted by the muscles of
  the body during a given time. For this purpose we have only to avail
 ourselves of the details of Fick and Wislicenus's          conclusive ex
 periment already referred to, and which consisted in the ascent of
 the Faulhorn in Switzerland from the lake of Brienz. This moun
 tain can bo ascended by a very steep path from Iseltwald, which
 was of course favourable for the experiment,        and there is an hotel
 on the summit which allowed the experimenters to pass the following
 night under tolerably normal circumstances. The following is their
 own description and estimate of the amount of work performed in
 the ascent.*
      " Let us now inquire how much work was really done by our
muscles.     One item necessary for the reply is already at hand, viz.
the height of the summit of the Faulhorn above the level of the hike
 of Brienz multiplied by the weight of the body ; the former reckoned
 in metres, the latter in kilograms.        The weight of the body with
the equipments (hat, clothes, stick) amounted to 66 kilograms in
 Fick's case, and 76 in Wislicenus's.        The height of the Faulhorn
above the level of the lake of Brienz                  is,
                                                according to trigonometric
measurements,      exactly 1956 metres.       Therefore Fick performed
 129,096 and Wislicenus 148,656 -metrekilograms of muscular work."
      But in addition to this measurable external work there        another     is
item of force " which can bo expressed in units of work     and though its
                                                                         ;
value cannot be quite accurately calculated, yet tolerable approximation
                                                               a
can bo made.      It consists of the force consumed in respiration and the
heart's action. The work performed by the heart has been estimated,
in healthy full-grown man, at about 0'64 metrekilogramf for each
     a
systole.    During the ascent, Fick's pulse was about 120 per minute.
That gives for the 5P5 hours of the ascent an amount of work which
 may be estimated at 25,344 metrekilograms, entirely employed in
the maintenance of the circulation.       No attempt has yet been made to
estimate the labour of respiration.      One of us has shown, however, in
the second edition of his Medical Physics (p. 206), that Bonders'
                                      '                      '
well-known investigations concerning the conditions of pressure in the
cavity of the thorax give sufficient data for such an estimate.    He has
there shown that the amount of work performed in an inspiration of
600 cubic centims. may be rated at about 0'63 metrckilogram.
Fick breathed during the ascent at an average rate of about 25 respira
tions per minute, which gives, according to this estimation, an amount
of respiratory work for the whole ascent of 5197 metrekilograms.
If  we add this, and the number representing the work of the heart, to

the external work performed by Fick, we obtain a total of 159,637
metrekilograms.       If  we suppose that Wislicenus's     respiratory and
circulatory work bore the same proportion to Fick's as his bodily
weight did to Fick's, i. e. 7 : 6, we obtain for Wislicenus's amount of
work, as far as it is possible to calculate  it,
                                               a  total of 184,287 metro-
kilograms.
    " Besides these estimated
                                  (and certainly not over-estimated) items,
there are several others which cannot be even approximately calculated,
but the sum of which,      if  could be obtained, would probably exceed
                                it
even our present large total.       We will try to give at least some sort
of an account of them. It must first be remembered that in the
steepest mountain path there are occasional level portions, or even
descents.    In traversing such places the muscles of the leg are exerted
as they are in ascending, but the whole work performed         transformed
                                                                  is
back into heat.     The same force-producing process, however, must be
going on in the muscles as       work were being performed which did not
                                 if
undergo this transformation.       In order to make this point yet clearer
we may take into consideration that the whole work of the ascent, only
existed temporarily as work.        On the following day the result was
reversed our bodies approached the centre of the earth by as much as
          ;
they had receded from      itthe day before, and, in consequence, on the
second day an amount of heat was liberated equal to the amount of
work previously performed.         The two parts of the action, which in
this case were performed on two separate days, take place in walking
on level ground in the space of footstep.
                                      a
    " Let us observe, besides, that in an ascent        it  not only those
                                                             is
muscles of the leg specially devoted to climbing which are exerted,
the arms, head, and trunk are continually in motion.          For all these
movements force-generating processes are necessary, the result of
which cannot, however, figure in our total of work, but must appear
entirely in the form of heat, since all the mechanical effects of these
movements are immediately undone again.            Ifwo raise an arm, we
immediately let  it  drop again, &c.
    " There was besides large portion of our muscular system employed
                           a
during the ascent, which was performing no external work (not even
temporary work, or mechanical effects immediately reversed), but
which cannot be employed withont tho same force-generating processes
which render external work possible.       As long as we hold the body in
an upright position, individual groups of muscles (as, for instance, the
muscles of the back, neck, &c.) must be maintained in              state of
                                                                       a
continual tetanus in order to prevent the body from collapsing.         Wo
may conceive of   a   tetanized muscle as holding up         weight which
                                                             a
would immediately fall     ifthe supply of actual energy were to cease.
It is active butit   performs no work, and therefore all the force pro
duced     liberated in the form of heat."

    The results of these determinations add a new link to the chain
of experimental evidence, that muscular exertion does not necessarily
increase the excretion of nitrogen through tho urino.             From mid-day
before the ascent (August 29th, 1865) to the following evening at
seven o'clock       (August 30th) both gentlemen abstained from all
nitrogenous food. During these thirty-one hours they had nothing
in the way of solid food except starch, fat, and sugar. The two
former were taken in tho form of cakes.               Starch was made up with
water into     a thin paste, which was then made            into small cakes and

addition to this there was tho sugar contained in the beer and wine,
which were taken in quantities usual in mountain excursions.                 It
was doubtless owing to this absence from food containing nitrogen
that the amount of this element secreted through the urine, declined
tolerably regularly from tho 29th of August till the evening of the
30th. Even in the night of the 30th to the 31st, in spite of the plentiful
meal of albuminous food on the evening of the 30th, the secretion
of nitrogen was less than on the preceding night. The reason of
this is probably to bo songht for in the circumstance that during the
period of abstinence, the secretion of nitrogen was carried on at tho
expense of tissues, and now these tissues required reparation.
     It is perhaps scarcely worthy of record that during the ascent
neither of the experimenters perspired perceptibly, since it has been
proved by Ranke that no appreciable amount of nitrogen leaves tho
system in tho matter of perspiration ; and as Thiry has also shown
that no nitrogen is got rid of by respiration, it follows that in
addition to the nitrogen contained in the urine, the only other mode
of exit for this element is through tho froces. Now the proportion
secreted through tho fauces has been estimated by Ranke at about
one-twelfth of that in tho urine ; but inasmuch as all experiments
on the subject tend to show that this alviuo nitrogen                is,
                                                                     as voided,

     There  is   still another circumstance which requires to be taken
into consideration before wo proceed to apply our three data to the
solution of the problem before us.           It this — Is possible that at
                                                 is   :        it
the termination of the ascent of the Faulhorn there might be               con a
siderable quantity of the nitrogenous products of decomposition
retained in the body    ?      Considering the physiological effect of tho
retention of urea in the system, as exemplified whenever the secretion
of urine  is   interrupted, it   isdifficult to imagine the possibility of any
considerable quantity of urea being retained in tho system of healthy      a
man.      It
           is,  however, otherwise with creatin, another of the products
of tho metamorphosis of tissue for    ;    ithas been repeatedly shown that         a
muscle which has been hard worked contains more creatin than one
that has been at rest.       Thus the quantity of creatin contained in the
heart of an ox was found to bo • 1-1 per cent. (Gregory), and that in
other ox-flesh only • 06 per cent. (Stacdcler).       Now the muscles which
extend tho leg in walking, and which do tho essential work in
ascending, have been estimated by Weber to weigh in both legs
      kilograms, and if    wo assume that before the ascent these muscles
5•

contained -06 per cent, of creatin, whilst after the ascent the per
centage had increased to          14 per cent., then the amount of creatin
                                 •
thus exceptionally       retained   would amount to       4•64 grams, which
would    bo  derived  from8 •

     The speaker had been unable to determine the calorific effect of
                                                                      3c2

croatin, and consequently the actual energy developed by the transforma
tion of muscle into creatin ; for, although he was kindly furnished with an
ample supply of this material by Dr. Dittmar, yet all 'attempts to burn
it in the calorimeter were fruitless. Even when mixed in very small
proportions with chlorate of potash and other combustibles of known
value, the mixture invariably exploded violently on ignition.     Although
actual determination thus fails us, there can be no doubt that the
transformation of muscle into creatin and other non-nitrogenous pro
ducts must be attended by the liberation of far less actual energy than
its transformation into urea, carbonic acid, and water. To be con
vinced of this, it is only necessary to compare (under equal nitrogen
value) the formulae of muscle, creatin, and urea, remembering at the
same time that the nitrogen probably possess no thermal value, and
that each atom of oxygen destroys approximately the thermal effect of
two atoms of hydrogen.

    Thus it is evident that the amount of creatin exceptionally retained
in the system could not greatly affect the result of the experiment as
regards the possible amount of actual energy derivable from the
metamorphosed tissues during the ascent ; firstly, on account of tho
small quantity of creatin so retained, and, secondly, because creatin
still contains about one-third of the potential energy of tho muscle
from which it is derived.    But as this point cannot be experimentally
demonstrated the speaker followed the example of Fick and Wislicenus,
and made a very liberal allowance on this score.     Ho allowed, as they
had done, that the whole of the nitrogen secreted during the sis hours
after the ascent was exceptionally retained in the system as urea during
the ascent.   This is equivalent to an admission that the muscles of the
legs contained at the end of the ascent eleven times as much creatin
as was present in them before the ascent.    In the above tabular state
ment of results provision has been made for this allowance by adding
together, on tho one hand, the amounts of nitrogen secreted during
the ascent and six hours after        and, on the other, the weights of
                                      it,
dry muscle corresponding to these two amounts of nitrogen.
    Having thus far cleared the ground, let us now compare the amount
of measured and calculated work performed by each of the experi
menters during the ascent of the Faulhorn, with the actual energy
capable of being developed by the maximum amount of muscle that
could have been consumed in their bodies, this amount being repre
sented by the total quantity of nitrogen excreted in each case during
the ascent and for six hours afterwards.

      It is thus evident that the muscular power expended by these gen
tlemen in the ascent of the Faulhorn could not be exclusively derived
from the oxidation, either of their muscles, or of other nitrogenous
constituents of their bodies, since the maximum of power capable of
 being derived from this source even under very favourable assumptions
 is, in both cases, less than one-half of the work actually performed.
 But the deficiency becomes much greater if we take into consideration
the fact, that the actual energy developed by oxidation or combustion
cannot be wholly transformed into mechanical work.           In the best
constructed steam-engine for instance, only ^th of the actual energy
developed by the burning fuel can be obtained in the form of me
chanical power ; and in the case of man, Helmholtz estimates that not
more than |th of the actual energy developed in the body can be made
to appear as external work.        The experiments of Haidenhain, how
ever, show that, under favourable circumstances, a muscle may be made
to yield in the shape of mechanical work as much as one-half of the
actual energy developed within         the remainder taking the form of
                                        it,

chanical work capable of being got out of actual energy,        becomes it
necessary to multiply by      2the above numbers representing the ascer
tainable work performed, in order to express the actual energy involved
in the production of that work. We then get the following comparison
of the actual energy capable of being developed by the amount of
muscle consumed, with the actual energy necessary for the performance
of the work executed in the ascent of the Faulhorn.

     In these experiments the conditions were obviously very unfavour
able for the comparison of the amount of actual energy producible
from muscle metamorphosis, with the quantity of actual energy ex
pended in the performance of estimable work ; since, during that
portion of the twenty-four hours not occupied in the actual experiment,
a largo amount of unestimablo internal work, such as the statical
activity of tho muscles, peristaltic motion, &c., was being performed.
Nevertheless, these experiments show that the average actual energy
developed in producing work in tho body of each man was nearly
twice as great as that which could possibly be produced by the whole
of the nitrogenous matter oxidized in the body during 24 hours. It
must also be remarked that the prisoners were fed upon a nitrogenous
diet containing six ounces of cooked moat, without bone ; a diet
which, as is well known, would favour the production of urea.

the heart alone, for 24 hours, at 86,000 metrokilograma,      a figure which is higher
than that above for the combined work of circulation and respiration.

wheel work. The other conditions were, however, equally unfavourable
for showing the excess of work performed, over the amount derivable
from muscle metamorphosis.
     In shot-drill, each man lifts a 32 lb. shot from a tressel to his
breast, a height of 3 feet ; he then carries it a distance of 9 feet, and
                                      ...
lays it down on a similar support, returning unloaded. Six of these

     Owing chiefly to the vegetable diet of these prisoners, the result is
more conclusive than that obtained upon the treadwheel, the amount
of work actually performed being considerably more than twice as
great as that which could possibly be obtained through the muscle
metamorphosis occurring in the-bodies of the prisoners.

     In these determinations the number 109,496 metrekilograms was
obtained as the average amount of daily work performed by pedestrians,
pile-drivers, porters, paviours, &c. ; but, as the amount of muscle
 consumption is calculated from the nitrogen taken in the food, the
 conditions are as unfavourable as possible with regard to the point the
speaker was seeking to establish ; for it is here assumed, not only that
 all the nitrogen taken in the food enters the blood, but also that it is

     Thus, even under the extremely unfavourable conditions of these
determinations, the actual work performed exceeded that which could
possibly be produced through the oxidation of the nitrogenous con
stituents of the daily food by more than 30 per cent.
     We have seen, therefore, in the above four sets of experiments,
interpreted by the data afforded by the combustion of muscle and
urea in oxygen, that the transformation of tissue alone cannot account
for more than a small fraction of the muscular power developed by
animals ; in fact, this transformation goes on at a rate almost entirely
independent of the amount of muscular power developed.                        If   the
mechanical work of an animal be doubled or trebled there is no
corresponding increase of nitrogen in the secretions ; whilst it was
proved on the other hand by Lawes and Gilbert, as early as the year
1854, that animals, under the same conditions as regarded exercise,
had the amount of nitrogen in their secretions increased twofold by
merely doubling the amount of nitrogen in their food. Whence
then comes the muscular power of animals ? What are the substances
which, by their oxidation in the body, furnish the actual energy,
whereof a part is converted into muscular work ? In the light of the
experimental results detailed above, can it be doubted that a large
proportion of the muscular power developed in the bodies of animals
has its origin in the oxidation of non-nitrogenous substances?                    For
whilst the secretion of nitrogen remains nearly stationary under
widely different degrees of muscular exertion, the production of
carbonic acid increases most markedly with every augmentation of
muscular work, as is shown by the following tabulated results of
E. Smith's highly important experiments regarding the amount of car
bonic acid evolved from his own lungs under different circumstances.•

     It  has been already stated as a proposition upon which all are
 agreed,   that food, and food alone, is the ultimate source from which
 muscular power is derived ; but the above determinations and con
 siderations, the speaker believed, prove conclusively, firstly, that the
 non-nitrogenous constituents of the food, such as starch, fat, &c., are
 the chief sources of the actual energy, which becomes partially trans
 formed into muscular work; and secondly, that the food does not
 require to become organized tissue before its metamorphosis can
 be rendered available for muscular power ; its digestion and assimula-
 tion into the circulating fluid — the blood — being all that is necessary
 for this purpose. It is, however, by no means the non-nitrogenous
portions of food alone that are capable of being so employed, the
nitrogenous also, inasmuch as they are combustible, and consequently
capable of furnishing actual energy, might be expected to be available
for the same purpose, and such an expectation is confirmed by the
experiments of Savory upon rats,* in which it is proved that these
animals can live for weeks in good health upon food consisting almost
exclusively of muscular fibre. Even supposing these rats to have per
formed no external work, nearly tho whole of their internal muscular
work must have had its source in the actual energy developed by the
oxidation of their strictly nitrogenous food.
     It can scarcely be doubted, however, that the chief use of tho
nitrogenous constituents of food is for the renewal of muscular tissue ;
the latter, like every other part of the body, requiring a continuous
change of substance, whilst the chief function of the non-nitrogenous
is to furnish by their oxidation the actual energy which is in part
transmuted into muscular force.
     The combustible food and oxygen coexist in the blood which
courses through the muscle, but when the muscle is at rest there is no
chemical action between them.            A command is sent from the brain to
the muscle, the nervous agent determines oxidation.                  The potential
energy becomes active energy, one portion assuming the form of
motion, another appearing as heat.                Here is the source of animal
heat, here the origin of muscular power I                  Like the piston and
cylinder of a steam-engine, the muscle itself is only a machine for
the transformation of heat into motion ; both are subject to wear and

degree by its own oxidation to the actual production of the mechanical
power which it exerts.
     From this point of view it is interesting to examine the various
articles of food in common use, as to their capabilities for the pro
duction of muscular power.        The speaker had therefore made careful
estimations of the calorific value of different materials used as food,
by the same apparatus and in the same manner as described above for
the determination of the actual energy in muscle, urea, uric acid, and
hippuric acid.
     The results are embodied in the following series of tables, but it
must bo borno in mind that it is only on the condition that tho food
is digested and passes into the blood, that the results given in these
tables are realized.      If, for instance, sawdust or paraffin oil had
been experimented upon, numbers would have been obtained for these
substances, the one about equal to that assigned to starch, and the
other surpassing that of any article in the table ; but theso numbers
would obviously have been utterly fallacious, inasmuch as neither
sawdust nor paraffin oil       to any appreciable extent, digested in the
                                        is,
alimentary canal. Whilst the force values experimentally obtained
for the different articles in these tables must therefore be understood
as the maxima assignable to tho substances to which they belong, yet
it must not bo forgotten that          largo majority of these substances
                                                       a

     These results are in many instances fully borne out by experience.
The food of      the agricultural    labourers in Lancashire contains a
large proportion      of fat.   Besides  the very fat bacon which con
stitutes their animal food proper, they consume large quantities of
so-called apple dumplings, the chief portion of which consists of
paste in which dripping and suet are largo ingredients, in fact these
dumplings frequently contain no fruit at all. Egg and bacon pies
and potato pies are also very common pieces de resistance during
harvest-time, and whenever very hard work is required from the
men. The speaker well remembers being profoundly impressed with
the dinners of the navigators employed in the construction of the
Lancaster and Preston Railway : they consisted of thick slices of
bread surmounted with massive blocks of bacon, in which mere streaks
of lean were visible.      Dr. Piccard states that the Chamois hunters of
Western Switzerland are accustomed, when starting on long and
fatiguing expeditions, to take with them, as provisions, nothing but
bacon-fat and sugar, because, as they say, these substances are more
nourishing than meat.       They doubtless find that in fat and sugar they
can most conveniently carry with them a store of force-producing
matter.    The above tables affirm the same thing. They show that
 •
   55 lb. of fat will perform the work of 1 • 15 lb. cheese, 5 lbs. potatoes,
   •
1 3 lb. of flour or peameal or of 3£ Ibs. of lean beef.      Donders, in his
admirable pamphlet ' On the Constituents of Food and their Relation
to Muscular Work and Animal Heat,' mentions the observations of
Dr. M. C. Verloren on the food of insects. The latter remarks,
"Many insects use during a period in which very little muscular
work is performed food containing chiefly albuminous matter ; on the
contrary, at a time when the muscular work is very considerable, they
live exclusively, or almost exclusively, on food free from nitrogen."
lie also mentions bees and butterflies as instances of insects per
forming enormous muscular work, and subsisting upon a diet con
taining but the merest traces of nitrogen.
     We thus arrive at the following conclusions : —
      1. The muscle is a machine for the conversion of potential energy
into mechanical force.
     2. The mechanical force of the muscles is derived chiefly, if not
entirely, from the oxidation of matters contained in the blood, and not
from the oxidation of the muscles themselves.
     3. In man the chief materials used for the production of muscular
power are non-nitrogenous ; but nitrogenous matters can also be em
ployed for the same purpose, and hence the greatly increased evolution
of nitrogen under the influence of a flesh diet, even with no greater
muscular exertion.
     4. Like every other part of the body, the muscles are constantly
being renewed ; but this renewal is not perceptibly more rapid during
great muscular activity than during comparative quiescence.
     5. After the supply of sufficient albuminized matters in the food
of man to provide for the necessary renewal of the tissues, the best

materials for the production, both of internal and external work, are
non-nitrogenous matters, such as oil, fat, sugar, starch, gum, &c.
     6. The non-nitrogenous matters of food, which find their way into
the blood, yield up all their potential energy as actual energy j the
nitrogenous matters, on the other hand, leave the body with a portion
(one-seventh) of their potential energy unexpended.
     7. The transformation of potential energy into muscular power is
necessarily accompanied by the production of heat within the body,
even when the muscular power is exerted externally.                      This is, doubt
less, the chief and, probably, the only source of animal heat.

                 Experiments     on    the  Vibrations       of Strings.
     1. I   lay hold of one end of this India-rubber rope, the other end
of which      is fixed to the ceiling, and by a jerk raise a protuberance
upon it. The protuberance runs along the rope to its fixed end, is
there reflected, and reversing itself, returns to my hand.                       In this
case, where the points of the rope rise in succession to form the pro
tuberance, we have an example of a progressive wave or undulation.
     2. After the first wave        I  now send a second, so that it shall meet
the reflected wave on its return.            The foremost ends of both waves
now meet in the centre of the rope ; they there neutralize each other,
and the two halves continue to swing with an apparently motionless
point called a node between them.
     3.  I   now stop the rope, send a wave forward, and then another
 wave so quickly after it that this second wave shall meet the first at
 one-third of the length of the rope from its fixed end.                   At that point
 a  node   is   produced.    But    I  have  already    sent     a third  wave  after the
 second.      The second wave being reflected at the node, meets this third
 one and a second node is formed.           The whole rope is now divided into
 three vibrating parts, separated from each other by two nodes.
     4. By properly timing the impulses imparted to the rope                        I  can
 divide it into four, five, six, ten, and even twenty vibrating parts,

                                   Professor Tyndull,                    [June  15,
 separated      from each other by the appropriate number of nodes,
 With a certain rapidity of vibration on the part of my hand               I cause
 the rope to swing to and fro as a whole. Twice that rapidity divides
it into two equal vibrating parts ; three times that rapidity into three
 vibrating parts, and so on.         The number of vibrating parts, or ventral
 segments,    as   they   are  called,  is in fact directly proportional to the
rapidity of my       hand's   vibration.
     5.   In   these cases, where every point of every ventral segment
moves      to and fro at the same time, we have examples of stationary
undulations.
     6. My hand, which produces this vibration, does not move through
more than half- an - inch of space, while the ventral segments
oscillate through a space of four-and-twenty.              This wide vibration is
in fact produced and maintained by the addition together of small
impulses properly timed.            The nodes, moreover, thongh apparently
motionless, are not strictly so ; for if they were, the vibration of the
segments would soon come to an end. In fact, it is by the motion trans
mitted through the nodes that the vibrations of the rope are sustained.
     7.   I  might attach the free end of this rope to any suitable vibrating
body instead of taking it in my hand.             If the rate of vibration of the
body were that of any aliquot part of the rope, it would divide
itself accordingly.
     8. The effect may also be produced by causing the vibrations of an
aliquot part of our rope to excite vibrations in the remaining portion.
Stretched vertically from top to bottom of this wooden frame is an
India-rubber tube.          I  encircle the middle of the tube with the finger
and thumb of my left hand, and pull the lower half aside with my
right.      The lower half vibrates, but the upper half vibrates also. In
fact, the small amount of play permitted by my hand has enabled
the pulse to transmit itself, to be reflected, and to accumulate its
motion to this extent.          I withdraw my left hand : the tube continues
to vibrate in two equal parts, divided from each other by a node.
     9.   I  encircle the tube at one-third of its length from the lower
end, and pull aside the shorter segment ; it vibrates more quickly than
the half tube, and the vibration immediately causes the upper and
longer portion to divide into two equal parts.              I now withdraw my
hand, and the tube continues to vibrate in three equal segments, which
are separated from each other by two nodes.
     10. In like manner        I encircle  the tube at one-quarter of its length
from its lower end, and         pull the lower and shorter segment aside ; it
vibrates, and forthwith         the longer segment above divides into three
vibrating parts.        I now   withdraw my hand, and the tube continues to
oscillate in four equal        segments, separated from each other by three
nodes.
     1 1 . Again, from side to side of the room is stretched       this stout iron
wire twenty-four feet long.           I  seize the wire at a point which divide,;

it into two parts,  one three times as long as the other, and pulling
the shorter segment aside permit it to vibrate ; the remaining portion
of the wire divides itself into three ventral segments.        have placed     I
silvered beads at the nodes and at the centres of the vibrating segments ;
you see the light shining from those beads, and you notice that while
the nodal beads remain stationary, the others describe luminous lines.
    12.       If I
              place sheets of paper across the wire at the nodes and at
the ventral segments, on causing it to vibrate thus, the sheets placed
across the ventral segments are tossed off, while those at the nodes
remain undisturbed.
     13. From these effects which you can actually see,            might                 I
pass on to vibrating strings, and show you that they divide themselves
similarly.           I
               might also show you that it is hardly possible for a
musical string to vibrate as a whole without having these smaller
vibrations riding like parasites upon the large one.       The addition
of these smaller vibrations gives quality or timbre, or, as the Germans
call     Klangfarbe to the note. They constitute the harmonics of the
        it,
string.

through the combination of direct and reflected waves, for the illustra
tion of which we nre mainly indebted to the brothers Weber, forms a fit
introduction to the experiments of M. Melde, of Marburg, who has
obtained    series of very beautiful effects
               a                                         by
                                             associating with vibrating
bodies suitably stretched strings.
     6. In M. Melde's first experiment he stretched
       1                                               string across  abell,                 a
or bell-jar, from edge to edge     when the bell was caused to vibrate,
                                             ;
the string vibrated also.     By varying the tension of the string      was                  it
caused to vibrate as      whole, or to divide itself into two, three, four,
                                   a
five or more vibrating parts, separated from each other          the appro         by
priate number   of nodes.
    17. He then attached his strings to tuning-forks, and obtained the
same effect in more marked and beautiful manner.
                         a                             To this tuning-
fork have attached
       I               silk string which passes round distant peg, by

eight feet.   The  tension at the present moment is such, that when the
fork   is caused to vibrate, the string swings as whole ; its periods of
vibration being synchronous with the impulses imparted to it by the
fork.   We have here a beautiful gauzy spindle produced by the silk,
fully six inches wide at its point of greatest amplitude.
    18. The motion of the end of the string in contact with the fork
is hardly sensible, and still through this apparently motionless part of
the string the whole of its motion is transmitted.
     19. I relax the string by turning the peg, and now it suddenly
divides itself into two ventral segments, separated from each other
by a node.     When the synchronism between the fork and string is
perfect, the vibrations of the string are steady and long-continued ;
but a slight departure from synchronism introduces unsteadiness, and
the vibrations, though they may show themselves for a time, quickly
disappear.
    20.  Irelax the string still further; it now divides itself into three
vibrating parts ; relaxing still further, it divides into four vibrating
parts; and thus         I
                     might continue to subdivide the string into ten or
even twenty equal parts, separated from each other by a number of
nodes one less than the number of ventral segments.
     21. In the arrangement now before you, the fork vibrates in the
direction of the length of the string ; its tendency, therefore, is to throw
the string into longitudinal vibration. But, in fact, every forward stroke
of the fork raises a protuberance upon the string, which runs to its
fixed end and is there reflected, so that when the longitudinal impulses
are properly timed, they produce a transverse vibration.         Itake a heavy
string in my hand, stretch           it,
                                    and move my hand to and fro in the
direction of the string.      It vibrates as whole, and notice that
                                               a                 I                it
is  always   when  the string      at the two limits of its excursion that
                                     is
my    hand  moves   forward.         If
                                    the string vibrate in a vertical plane,
my   hand,  in order  to time  the impulses   properly, must move forward
at the moment the string reaches the upper and also at the moment                 it
reaches the lower limit of its excursion.       A little reflection will make
it plain, that, in order to accomplish this, my hand must execute                  a
complete vibration while the string executes            asemi-vibration     in
                                                                             ;*
other words, the vibrations of my hand must be exactly twice as rapid
as those of the string.
    22. Precisely the same must be true of       tuning-fork to which
                                                    a                              a
proper string     attached.
                   is         When the fork vibrates in the direction
of the string, the number of complete vibrations which        executes in
                                                                     it
a certain time will be twice the number executed            by
                                                      the string.
     A complete vibration,       will be borne in mind, consists of one complete
                                it
excursion to and fro.    semi-vibration, on the contrary, consists of an excursion
                            A
from one limit of the vibration to the other.

     23.  If  in this case the fork and string vibrate with sufficient
rapidity   to produce    musical notes, the note of the fork will be an
octave above that of the string.       That it is so has been proved by
M. Melde's direct observations.
                                                         I
     24. Taking hold of the end of this heavy string, cause my hand to
move to and fro, not in the direction of the string, but at right angles to
that direction.    The string now swings as a whole in a vertical plane.
Here every upward movement of my hand coincides with an upward
movement of the string, every downward movement of my hand with
a downward movement            of the string. In fact, the vibrations of
hand and string in this case synchronise perfectly ; and if the hand
could emit a musical note, the string would emit a note of the same
pitch.    The same holds good when a vibrating fork is substituted for
the vibrating hand.       While, therefore, when the vibrations are longi
tudinal, a complete vibration of the fork synchronises with a semi-
vibration of the string : when the vibrations are transversal, a com
plete vibration of the fork corresponds to a complete vibration of the
string.
     25. Hence, if the string vibrate as a whole when the vibrations are
longitudinal, it will divide itself into two ventral segments when the
vibrations are transversal ; or, more generally expressed, preserving
the tension constant, whatever be the number of ventral segments
produced by the fork when its vibrations are longitudinal, twice that
number are produced when the vibrations are transverse.            Here, for
example, is a string eight feet long, vibrating longitudinally ; the
fork divides the string into four equal vibrating parts. I place the
fork so that it shall vibrate at right angles to the string. The number
of ventral segments is now eight, or double the former number. This
result was amply illustrated by the experiments of M. Melde.
     26. Attaching two strings of the same length to the two prongs
of  the  same fork, stretching one string in the direction of the prongs,
and the other at right angles to that direction, and subjecting the
strings to the same tension, when the fork is caused to vibrate, the
one string divides itself into double the number of vibrating segments
exhibited by the other.
     27. When white silk strings vibrate thus, the beauty            of  the
ventral segments      is  extreme.    The  nodes appear    white  and fixed,
while the vibrating parts form delicate gauzy spindles in the air ; every
protuberance of the twisted string writes its motion in a more or less
luminous line on the surface of the aerial gauze.
     28.  Certain  twisted    strings do not adhere   to   the  same  plane.
They vibrate simultaneously in two rectangular directions, and every
one of their points describes a closed curve.     When the two vibrations
are of the same amplitude, and have the proper difference of phase,
the ventral segments describe surfaces of revolution.
                                                               3  d 2

      29. The path described by the various points of the string may be
studied after the manner of Dr. Young, by throwing light upon them
and watching the lines described by the illuminated points.                 By
twisting a flat and burnished silver wire we form a spiral surface,
from which at regular intervals the light flashes, when the whole wire
is illuminated.     Attaching the wire to a tuning-fork and causing it to
vibrate, its luminous spots describe luminous lines.              If  the wire
vibrate as a whole without any sensible admixture of its harmonic
divisions, these spots describe straight lines which are drawn brilliantly
across the ventral gauze ; but when by slackening or tightening the
wire, other vibrations are caused to mingle with the fundamental one,
the combination of vibrations expresses itself in luminous scrolls of
extraordinary beauty.
      30.  But  to  see   this beauty you must be close to it.             The
vibrating segments      of our silk strings were, I fear, also too faint to be
seen at a distance.      For the silk string    I  substitute a fine platinum
wire, which now stretches from this tuning-fork over a bridge of
copper, and then round a peg.            I send an electric current through
the wire, which now glows brightly.             I  sound the fork : the wire
vibrates as a whole : its two ends are brilliant, but its middle is
chilled by its rapid passage through the air.        Thus you have a shading
off of incandescence from the ends to the centre of the wire.           I relax
the tension ; the wire now divides itself into two vibrating parts ;           I
relax still further and obtain three ; still further, and now you have
the wire divided into four, ventral segments separated from each other
by these three brilliant nodes.        Right and left from every node, the
incandescence     shades away until it disappears.       You notice also that
when the wire settles into steady vibration the nodes shine out more
brilliantly than the wire shone before the vibration commenced.            This
is due to the cooling of the vibrating segments.               When they are
chilled by their swift passage through the air, their conductivity is
improved.      More electricity passes through the vibrating than through
the unvibrating wire, and hence the augmented glow of the nodes.
      31. Certain twisted chords, as        I  have said, when attached       to
tuning-forks execute circular instead of plane vibrations.             Circular
vibrations may always be obtained by attaching one end of a string to
a rotating point, and timing the velocity of rotation to suit the periods
of vibration possible to the string.
      32. Thus, suspended from the ceiling is this white cotton rope, the
lower     end of which is attached to a hook belonging to this whirling
 table.    When this handle is turned the hook rotates, describing a circle
 less than an inch in diameter.      By properly regulating the velocity of
 rotation   I cause the rope to divide into a series of spindles, which
 appear like gray gauze when projected against a dark background.
 I  can cause the number of these spindles to
                                                     vary from one to twenty
 by varying the velocity of rotation.

    33.   In this experiment  the rope is vertical and the rotating wheel
horizontal, but     I
                   have  here  an arrangement in which the wheel is ver
tical and the vibrating chord horizontal.       Instead of a rope    now           I
employ  a  burnished  silver chain.   Turning   this wheel slowly   cause         I
the chain to swing as a whole, and describe a spindle twelve feet long
and nearly two feet in diameter at its widest part. Augmenting the
speed of rotation        I
                      divide the chain into two spindles, each six feet
long and more than a foot in diameter ; a still higher velocity gives
us three spindles, a still higher four, and so on.     The gas-light here
flashes at intervals from the burnished links of the chain, and each
of those brilliant points describes a curve of light.
    34. As soon as synchronism is established between the wheel and
the chain, the amount of work performed by the arm which turns the
wheel is very sensibly augmented. Indeed it may be augmented until
the strain thrown upon the chain by the accumulation of small impulses
is sufficient to break it.
     35.  Isubstitute for the chain this lighter cotton-rope, round which
a silver band has been coiled as a spiral ; and from an electric lamp
placed at the end of the rope I send a beam of light along its entire
length.       I
            now turn the wheel and divide the rope successively into two,
three, four, or five ventral segments.    The spindles show a graduated
brilliancy, which is intensified until it becomes almost dazzling at the
nodes.    The vibrating chord     indeed, better seen when the light that
                                      is,
falls upon    has been caused to pass through coloured glass.

obtain at pleasure green, blue, and red spindles, with nodes like
tire shading off into the more subdued light of the ventral seg

beauty of another kind.       The experiments with tuning-forks above

     38. Hence the rapidity         of vibration is inversely proportional      to
 the length of the string.
     39. Here the string, eight feet long, vibrates as a whole when at
 tached to the fork a.       I  now transfer it to b, still keeping it stretched
 by the same weight.           It vibrates when b vibrates ; but how ? By
 dividing into two equal ventral segments.              In this way alone can it
 accommodate itself to the vibrating period of b.             Attached to c, the
 same string separates into four, while when attached to d it divides
 into eight ventral segments.          This may be deduced immediately from
 the law enunciated in 38, and its experimental realization reacts as a
 proof of that law.
     40. This result admits of extension.             I  have here two tuning-
forks separated from each other by the musical interval called a fifth.

same weight, the string divides instantly into three segments when the
 fork is set in vibration.      Now to form the interval of a fifth the vibra
tions of the one fork must be to those of the other in the ratio of 2 : 3.
The division of the string, therefore, declares the interval. Here also are
two forks separated by an interval of a fourth.           With a certain tension
one of the forks divides our string into three ventral segments ; with
the same tension the other fork divides it into four, which two numbers
express the ratio of the vibrations.           In the same way the division of
the string in relation to all other musical intervals may be illustrated.
     41. Again.      Here are two tuning-forks, a and b, one of which (a)
vibrates twice as rapidly as the other. I attach this string of silk to
 a, and stretch the string until it synchronises with the fork and
vibrates as a whole.       I   now form a second string of silk of the same
length, by laying four strands of the first side by side.           I attach this
compound thread to b, and keeping the tension the same as in the last
experiment, set b in vibration.           The compound thread synchronises
with b, and swings as a whole. Now, by quadrupling the original
thread,   I  obtained a string of twice the diameter of the original one :
for the transverse section of any string is as the square of its diameter.
Hence, as the fork b vibrates with half the rapidity of a, by doubling
the diameter of the string,          I  halved its rapidity of vibration.      In
the same simple way it might be proved that by trebling the diameter
of the string we reduce the number of its vibrations to one third. In
general terms: —
     42.  The    rapidity of vibration       is inversely proportional     to the
diameter    of the string.
     43. A beautiful confirmation of this result is thus obtained : —
Attached to this tuning-fork is a silk string six feet long. Two feet of
this string are composed of four strands of the single thread, placed
side by side, the remaining four feet are a single thread.             I apply a
tension, which causes the string to divide into two ventral segments.

 But how    does it divide ?        Not at its centre, as is the case when the
 string is of uniform thickness throughout, but at the point where the
thick string terminates.           This thick segment, two feet long, is now
vibrating at the same rate as the thin segment four feet long, a result
which must manifestly follow from the combination of the two laws
which we have already established.                 I   need hardly say that if the
lengths    were     in   any  other   ratio   than   1  : 2, the node would      not be
formed at the point of union of the two strings.
     44. We have now to establish the third law of vibrating chords.
Here   are two strings of the same length and thickness.                   One of them
is attached to the fork b, the other to the fork a, which vibrates with
twice the rapidity of b. Stretched by a weight of 20 grains placed on
this balanced scale-pan, the string attached to b vibrates as a whole.
Substituting the fork a for b,         I  find that a weight of 80 grains causes
the string to vibrate as a whole.               Hence to double the rapidity of
vibration we must quadruple the stretching weight.                    In the same way
it might be proved that to treble the rapidity of vibration we should
have to make the stretching weight nine-fold.                 In general terms : —
     45. The     rapidity of vibration is proportional          to the   square root of
the tension.
     46.  In the foregoing experiment              both the tension and the rate
of vibration were       caused to vary.      We will now cause the tension alone
to vary, and observe the effect upon the entire string.                    I carry this
silk chord from this tuning-fork to the scale-pan, and stretch it by a
weight of 80 grains. The string vibrates as a whole.                    By diminishing
the weight     I   relax the string, which finally divides sharply into two
ventral segments.           What is now the stretching weight? 20 grains.
With a stretching weight of almost exactly 9 grains it divides into
three segments,          while with a stretching weight of 5 grains it
divides into four segments.           Thus then a tension of one-fourth doubles,
a tension of one-ninth trebles, a tension of one-sixteenth quadruples
the number of ventral segments.                 In general terms, the number of
segments is inversely proportional to the square root of the tension.
This result may be deduced by reasoning from the laws enunciated in
38 and 45, and its realization in fact confirms their correctness.*
     47. Finally,      I  have here three wires of the same length and thick
ness,  but of very different densities ; one of them is of the light
metal aluminium, another of silver, and another of the heavy metal
platinum.      I   attach the wires in succession to this tuning-fork, and
determine the weights necessary to cause them to vibrate as a whole,
or to form the same number of ventral segments.                         The stretching
weights    here   necessary    I find  to  be  directly proportional to the specific
    * This
             experiment, in whole or in part,          has been   already performed  by

gravities of the wires. From this result, combined with that enunciated
in 45, it follows that —
    48. The rapidity of vibration of different chords of the same
length and thickness is inversely proportional to the square root of
their densities.

fork, the specific gravities of all metals capable of being drawn into
wires of sufficient fineness and tenacity may be determined.
   The foregoing laws have been combined in various ways and the      ;
deductions drawn from them, when subjected to the test of direct
experiment, have, in every instance, been verified.
