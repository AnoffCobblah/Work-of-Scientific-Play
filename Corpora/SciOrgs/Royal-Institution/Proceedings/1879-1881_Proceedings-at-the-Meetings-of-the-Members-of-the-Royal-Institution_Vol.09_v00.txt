                                    The Electric Light.
THE subject of this evening's discourse        was proposed by our late
Honorary Secretary.*               That word "late"
                                              has for me its own connota
tions.    It implies, among other things, the loss of a comrade by whose
side I  have worked for thirteen years. On the other hand, regret is
not without its opposite in the feeling with which               I
                                                           have seen him
rise by sheer intrinsic merit, moral and intellectual, to the highest
official position which it is in the power of English science to bestow.
Well, he, whoso constant desire and practice were to promote the
interests and extend the usefulness of this Institution, thought that at
a time when the electric light occupied so much of public attention, a
few sound notions regarding              it,
                                      on the more purely scientific side,
                                                           " in
might,   to  use his  own  pithy expression, be " planted       the public
mind.    I   am hero to-night with the view of trying, to the best of my
ability, to realize the idea of our friend.
     In the year 1800, Volta announced his immortal discovery of the
 pile. Whetted to eagerness by the previous conflict between him and
 Galvani, the scientific men of the age flung themselves with ardour
 upon the new discovery, repeating Volta's experiments, and extending
 them in many ways.         The light and heat of the Voltaic circuit
 attracted   marked  attention, and in the innumerable tests and trials to
 which this question was subjected, the utility of platinum and charcoal,
 as means of exalting the light, was on all hands recognized.          Mr.
Children, with    battery surpassing in strength all its predecessors,

produced     light so vivid that the sunshine, compared with it,
              a

1808, through the liberality of few members of the Royal Institu

with which he afterwards obtained calorific and luminous effects far
transcending anything previously observed. The arc of flame between

9                                Professor Tyndall                            [Jan.  17,
 the carbon terminals was four inches long, and by its heat quartz,
 sapphire, magnesia, and lime, were melted like wax in a candle flame ;
 while fragments of diamond and plumbago rapidly disappeared as if
 reduced to vapour.*
      The first condition to be fulfilled in the development of heat and
 light by the electric current is that it shall encounter and overcome
 resistance.     Flowing through a perfect conductor, no matter what the
 strength    of  the current might be, neither heat nor light could bo
 developed.      A  rod of unresisting copper carries away uninjured and
 nn warmed an atmospheric discharge competent to shiver to splinters
 a resisting oak.     I send the self-same current through a wire composed
 of alternate lengths of silver and platinum. The silver offers little
 resistance, the platinum offers much.             The consequence is that tho
 platinum is raised to a white heat, while the silver is not visibly warmed.
 The same holds good with regard to the carbon terminals employed for
 the production of tho electric light.                The interval between tho
 terminals offers a powerful resistance to the passage of the current,
 and it is by the gathering up of the force necessary to burst across
 this interval that the voltaic current is able to throw the carbon into
 that state of violent intestine commotion which wo call heat, and to
 which its effulgence is due.
      The smallest interval of air usually suffices to stop the current. But
 when tho carbon points are first brought together and then separated,
 there occurs between them a discharge of incandescent matter which
 carries, or may carry, tho current over a considerable space.                      The
 vapours of the metals, for example, yield arcs of extraordinary length.
 When a pellet of silver is substituted for the positive carbon, an arc of
 incandescent     silver vapour is obtained many times the length of that
 obtainable between the pure carbons.             Tho part played by resistance
 is strikingly illustrated by the deportment of silver and thallium
 when mixed together and volatilized in the arc.                   The current first
 selects as its carrier the most volatile metal, which in this case is
 thallium.      While it continues abundant, the passage of the current is
so free — the resistance to it is so small — that the heat generated is
incompetent to volatilize the silver, f          As the thallium disappears tho
current is forced to concentrate its power; it presses the silver into its
 service, and finally fills the space between the carbons with a vapour
which, as long as the necessary resistance is absent, it is incompetent
to produce.
     * In the concluding lecture at the Royal Institution in June, 1810, Davy fused
iridium, the alloy of iridium and osmium, and other refractory substances.           See
' Philosophical Magazine," vol. 35, p. 463.
                                               Quetelet assigns the first production
of the spark between coal-points to Curtet in 1802.             Davy, certainly, in that
year showed the carbon light with a battery of 150 pairs of plates in the theatre
of the Eoyal Institution.    'Jour. Roy. Inst.,' vol. i. p. 166.
     t I have already drawn attention to a danger which besets the spectroscopist
when operating upon a mixture of constituents            volatile in different degrees.
When, ia 1872, I first observed the effect described in the text, had I not Itnoicn
that silver was present, I should have inferred its absence.

1879.]                     o» the Electric Light.                          3
     For seventy years, then, we have boon in possession of this trans
cendent light without applying it to the illumination of our streets
and houses.     Such applications suggested themselves at the outset,
but there were grave difficulties in their way.       The first difficulty
arose from the waste of the carbons, which are dissipated in part by
ordinary combustion, and in part by the electric transfer of matter
from the one carbon to the other.     To keep the carbons at the proper
distance asunder regulators were devised, the first of them,   I believe,
by Staite, and the most successful by Duboscq, Foucault, and Serrin,
who have been succeeded by a multitude of other inventors, to some
of whom    I shall subsequently refer. By such arrangements the first
difficulty was practically overcome ; but the second is a graver one,
being probably inseparable from the construction of the voltaic
battery. It arises from the operation of that inexorable law which
throughout the material universe demands an eye for an eye, and
a tooth for a tooth, refusing to yield the faintest glow of heat, or
glimmer of light, without the expenditure of an absolutely equal
quantity of some other power.       Hence, in practice, the desirability
of any transformation must depend upon the value of the product
in relation to that of the power expended.          We could boil water
by electricity, but it would not be an economical way of supplying
our baths and washhouses.         These considerations are now to bo
applied.     The metal zinc can be burnt like paper ; it might bo
iguited in a flame, but   I  will avoid the introduction of all foreign
heat and burn the zinc in air of the temperature of this room.        This
is done by placing zinc foil at the focus of a concave mirror, which
concentrates to a point the divergent electric beam, but which does
not warm the air. The zinc burns at the focus with a violet flame,
and we could readily determine the amount of heat generated by its
combustion. But zinc can be burnt not only in air but in liquids.
It  is thus burnt when acidulated water is poured over it; it is also
thus burnt in the voltaic battery.          Here, however, to obtain the
oxygen necessary for its combustion, the zinc has to dislodge the
hydrogen with which the oxygen is combined.           The consequence is
that the heat duo to the combustion of the metal in the liquid falls
short of that developed by its combustion in air by the exact quantity
necessary to separate the oxygen from the hydrogen.          Fully four-
fifths of the total heat are used up in this molecular work, only one-
fifth remaining to warm the battery. It is upon this residue that wo
must now fix our attention, for it is solely out of it that wo manu
facture our electric light.
     Before you are two small voltaic batteries of ten cells each. The
two ends of one of them are united by a thick copper wire, while
into the circuit of the other a thin platinum wire is introduced.
The platinum glows with a white heat, while the copper wire is not
sensibly warmed.       Now an ounce of zinc, like an ounce of coal,
produces by its complete combustion        in air a constant quantity of
heat. The total heat developed by an ounce of zinc through its union
                                                              B 2

 with oxygen in the hattcry is also absolutely invariable. Let our two
 batteries, then, continue in action until an ounce of zinc in each of
 them is consumed.        In the one case the heat generated is purely
 domestic, being liberated on the hearth where the fuel is burnt, that
 is to say in the cells of the battery itself. In the other case, the heat
 is in part domestic and in part foreign — in part within the battery
 and in part outside.       One of the fundamental truths which our late
 Secretary would wish you to bear in mind is that the sum of the
 foreign and domestics — of the external and internal — heats is fixed
 and invariable.     To have heat outside you must draw upon the
 heat within.     These remarks apply to the electric light.            By the
 intermediation of the electric current the moderate warmth of the
 battery is not only carried away but concentrated, so as to produce,
 at any distance from its origin, a heat next in order to that of the
sun. The current might therefore be defined as the swift carrier
of heat.    Loading itself hero with invisible power, by a process of
 transmutation which outstrips the dreams of the alchemist, it can
discharge its load, in the fraction of a second, as light and hoat at the
opposite side of tho world.
     Thus, the light and heat produced outside the battery are derived
from the metallic fuel burnt within the battery ; and, as zinc happens
to be an expensive fuel, though we have possessed the electric light
for more than seventy years, it has been too costly to come into
general use. But within these walls, in the autumn of 1831, Faraday
discovered a new source of electricity, which we have now to investi
 gate.   On the table before me lies a coil of covered copper wire, with
its ends disunited.     I  lift one side of tho coil from the table, and in
doing so exert the muscular effort necessary to overcome the simple
weight of the ooil.     I  unite its two ends and repeat the experiment.
The effort now required, if accurately measured, would be found greater
than before. In lifting the coil      I cut the lines of the earth's magnetic
force, such cutting,   as  proved by Faraday, being always accompanied,
in a closed conductor, by the production of an "induced" electric
current which, as long as the ends of the coil remained separate, had
no circuit through which it could pass.            The current here evoked
subsides immediately as heat ; this heat being the exact equivalent of
the excess of effort just referred to as over and above that necessary
to overcome the simple weight of the coil.         When the coil is liberated
it falls back to the table, and when its ends are united it encounters a
resistance over and above that of the air.           It generates an electric
current opposed in direction to the first, and reaches the table with a
diminished shock. The amount of the diminution is accurately repre
sented by the warmth which the momentary current develops in the
coil. Various devices have been employed to exalt these induced
currents.    Faraday, indeed, foresaw that such attempts were sure to be
made ; but he chose to leave them in the hands of the mechanician,
while he himself pursued the deeper study of facts and principles. "         I
have rather," he writes in 1831,
                                        " boon desirous of discovering new

facts and new relations dependent on magneto-electric induction than
of exalting the force of those already obtained ; being assured that the
latter would find their full development hereafter."
     This fuller development was aimed at by Pixii, Clark, Saxton,
 and others, who caused magnets to rotate near coils of wire, or coils
 of wire surrounding iron cores to rotate near the poles of powerful
 steel magnets. The presence of the iron cores, as shown by Faraday,
 greatly intensified the action, the play of which was this : — When the
 coils approached the poles of the permanent magnets, currents were
 excited in one direction : when they retreated from the poles, currents
 were excited in the opposite direction.      On passing a pole, therefore,
 a reversal of the current always occurred in the coil.      To gather up
 these opposing currents, and send them in a common direction, an
 arrangement called a commutator was associated with the magneto-
 electric machine.     I have here a model of an old Saxton machine
 with which Faraday used to illustrate what were then considered the
 larger phenomena of induced currents.          It was considered a great
 result when half an inch of exceedingly thin platinum wire, inclosed
 in a glass tube to protect it from air currents, was caused to glow.
 In 1853   I had the pleasure of witnessing, in company with M. Biot
and Professor Magnus, the performance of the first BuhmkerfFs
machine, which you know is a generator of Faraday's electricity, and
I  well remember the ecstasy and surprise of the grand old man, evoked
by effects which wo should now deem utterly insignificant.            Thus
science grows.      Forgetting, as it were, the things which are behind,
it reaches ever forward to the things which are before. In connection
with the development of the Buhmkerff coil, besides Buhmkerff
himself, Apps in this country, and Ritchie in America, are especially
deserving of honourable mention.
     For more than twenty years magneto-electricity had subserved its
first and noblest purpose of augmenting our knowledge of the powers
of nature. It had been discovered and applied to intellectual ends, its
application to practical ends being still to be realized. The Drummond
light had raised thoughts and hopes of vast improvements in public
illumination. Many inventors tried to obtain it cheaply; and in 1853
an attempt was made to organize a company in Paris for the purpose of
procuring, through the decomposition of water by a poworful magneto-
electric machine constructed by M. Nollet, the oxygen and hydrogen
necessary for the lime light. The experiment failed, but the apparatus
by which it was attempted suggested to Mr. Holmes other and more
hopeful applications.     Abandoning the attempt to produce the lime
light,  with persevering skill Holmes continued to improve the appa
ratus and to augment its power, until it was finally able to yield a
magneto-electric light comparable to that of the voltaic battery.
Judged by later knowledge, this first machine would bo considered
cumbrous and defective in the extreme ; but judged by the light of
antecedent events, it marked a great step forward.
     Faraday was profoundly interested in the growth of his own

the wisdom to make him their " Scientific Adviser ;
interesting to notice in his reports regarding the light the mixture
of enthusiasm and caution which characterized him. Enthusiasm was
with him a motive power, guided and controlled by a disciplined judg
ment.     He rode it as a charger, holding it in by a strong rein.
While dealing with Holmes, he states the case of the light pro and
con.   He checks the ardour of the inventor, and, as regards cost,
rejecting sanguine estimates, he insists over and over again on the
necessity of continued experiment for the solution of this important
question. His matured opinion was however strongly in favour of the
light. With reference to an experiment made at the South Foreland
on the 20th of April, 1859, he thus expresses himself : — " The beauty
of the light was wonderful.       At a mile off, the apparent streams of
light issuing from tho lantern were twice as long as those from the
lower lighthouse, and apparently three or four times as bright.       The
horizontal plane in which they chiefly took their way made all above
or below it black.    The tops of the hills, the churches, and the houses
illuminated by it were striking in their effect upon the eye." Further
on in his report he expresses himself thus : — " In fulfilment of this
part of my duty,  I   beg to state that, in my opinion, Professor Holmes
has practically established the fitness and sufficiency of the magneto-
electric light for lighthouse purposes, so far as its nature and manage
ment are concerned. The light produced is powerful beyond any other
     I
that have yet seen so applied, and in principle may be accumulated to
any degree ; its regularity in the lantern is great ; its management
easy, and its care there may be confided to attentive keepers of the
ordinary degree of intellect and knowledge."       Finally, as regards the
conduct of Professor Holmes during these memorable experiments, it
is only fair to add the following remark with which Faraday closes the
report submitted to the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House on the
                          I
 29th of April, 1859 : — " must bear my testimony," he says, " to the
perfect openness, candour, and honour of Professor Holmes.         He has
answered every question, concealed no weak point, explained every
applied principle, given every reason for a change either in this or
that direction, during several periods of closo questioning, in a
manner that was very agreeable to me, whose duty it was to search
for real faults or possible objections, in respect both of the present
time and the future."
     Soon afterwards, the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House had tho
intelligent courage to establish the machines of Holmes permanently
at Dungeness, where the magneto-electric light continued to shine
fur many years.
   • The
           magneto-electric machine of the Alliance Company soon
 succeeded to that of Holmes, being in various ways a very marked
 improvement on the latter.      Its currents wore stronger and its light
 was brighter than those of it.s predecessor.        In it, moreover, the
 commutator, the flashing and destruction of which were sources of

irregularity      and   deterioration in the machine of Holmes, was, at
the      suggestion   of M. Masson,* entirely abandoned ; alternating
currents instead       of the direct current being employed.            M. Serrin
modified his excellent lamp with the express view of enabling it to
cope with alternating currents.            During the International Exhibition
of 1862, where the machine was shown, M. Berlioz offered to
dispose of the invention to the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House.
They referred the matter to Faraday, and he replied as follows:
    I
" am not aware that the Trinity House authorities have advanced
 so far as to be able to decide whether they will require more
magneto-electric machines,            or whether, if they should require them,
they see reason to suppose the means of their supply in this country,
from the source already open to them, would not be sufficient.
Therefore       I  do not see that at present they want to purchase a
 machine." Faraday was obviously swayed by the desire to protect
 the interests of Holmes, who had borne the burden and heat which
fall upon the pioneer.          The Alliance machines were introduced with
success at Cape la Heve, near Havre ; and the Elder Brethren of the
Trinity House, determined to have the best available apparatus,
 decided, in 1868, on the introduction of machines on the Alliance
 principle into the lighthouses at Souter Point and the South Foreland.
 These machines were constructed by Professor Holmes, and they
 still continue in operation.f
      As their present scientific adviser,               the Elder Brethren did
 me     the  honour of asking my opinion as to the course which they
 proposed to pursue with regard to the introduction of these new
 machines.       That opinion is expressed in the following extract from
 a report dated May 16th, 1868 : " There is no doubt that elec
 tricity places at the disposal of the Elder Brethren a source of
 light next to the sun itself in power, and fer .transcending any
 light obtainable from the combustion of oil. With regard to the
 practical application of the magneto-electric light, the question, in
 my opinion, has been solved by the performance of the machine at
 Dungeness.        That machine was one of the first, if not the very first,
 constructed with a view to lighthouse illumination.              Defects inherent
 in first constructions were associated with the machine.             If, notwith
 standing these defects, some of which were very grave, the interrup
 tions have been so few, it may be safely inferred that with our
 augmented experience, and with the improved apparatus now within
 our reach, the performance of the magneto-electric machine may bo
 rendered practically perfect.           It is with the profound conviction that
 the decision is a wise one that            I  learn the intention of the Elder

 Inflow the specified power.      A new and very jtowerful machine being imported
 from F'aris, Mr. Hnlmes was required so to blrcngthen his magnets as to muke his

Brethren to introduce this powerful source of illumination with all
its recent improvements at certain prominent points on the coast of
England." With regard to the application of electricity to light
house purposes, the course of events was this : The Dungeness light
was introduced on January 31, 1862 ; the light at La Hove on
December 26, 1863, or nearly two years later.              But Faraday's ex
perimental trial at the South Foreland preceded the lighting of
Dungeness by more than two years.              The electric light was after
wards established at Gape Grisnez.          It was started at Souter Point on
January 11, 1871 ; and at the South Foreland on January 1, 1872.
At the Lizard, which probably enjoys the newest and most powerful
development of the electric light, it began to shine on January 1, 1878.
     I  have now to revert to a point of apparently small moment, but
 which really constitutes an important step in the development of this
subject.    I refer to the form given to the rotating armature in 1857 by
Dr. Werner Siemens, of Berlin. Instead of employing coils wound
transversely round cores of iron, as in the machine of Saxton,
Siemens, after giving a bar of iron the proper shape, wound his wire
longitudinally round it, and obtained thereby greatly augmented
 effects between suitably placed magnetic poles.          Such an armature is
 employed in the small magneto-electric machine which             I  now intro
 duce to your notice, and for which the Institution is indebted to
 Mr. Henry Wilde, of Manchester. There are here sixteen permanent
 horse-shoe magnets placed parallel to each other, and between their
 poles a Siemens' armature.         The two ends of the wire which sur
 rounds   the  armature    are  now   disconnected. In turning the handlo
 and causing     the  armature     to  rotate,  I  simply overcome ordinary
 mechanical friction. But the two ends of the armature coil can be
 united in a moment, and when this is done, I immediately expe
 rience a greatly increased resistance to rotation.            Something over
 and above the ordinary friction of the machine is now to be over
 come, and by the expenditure of an additional amount of muscular
 force  I am able to overcome it.         The excess of labour thus thrown
 upon    my arm   has  its  exact  equivalent   in the electric currents gener
 ated, and the heat produced by their subsidence in the coil of the
 armature.     A portion of this heat may be rendered visible by con
 necting the two ends of the coil with a thin platinum wire.              When
 the handle of the machine is rapidly turned the wire glows, first
 with a rod heat, then with a white heat, and finally with the heat of
  fusion.   The moment the wire melts, the circuit round the armature
  is broken, an instant relief from the labour thrown upon the arm being
  the consequence.     Clearly realize,   I  beg of you, the equivalent of the
  light here developed. During the period of turning the machine a
  certain amount of combustible substance was oxidized or burnt in the
  muscles of my arm.          Had it done no external work, the matter
  consumed would havo produced a definite amount of heat.              Now, the
  muscular heat actually developed during the rotation of the machine

fell short of this definite amount, the missing heat being reproduced
to the last fraction in the glowing platinum wire and the other parts
of the machine.     Here, then, the electric current intervenes between
my muscles and the generated heat, exactly as it did a moment ago
between the voltaic battery and its generated heat.         The electric
current is to all intents and purposes a vehicle which transports the
heat both of muscle and battery to any distance from the hearth
where the fuel is consumed.        Not only is the current a messenger,
but it is also an intensifier of magical power.         The temperature of
my arm    is,in round numbers, 100° Fahr., and             by the intensifi
                                                            it   is
cation of this heat that one of the most refractory of metals, which
requires  a heat of 3600° Fahr. to fuse         it,
                                                  has been reduced to the
molten condition.
    Zinc, as    I have said,    is   afuel far too expensive to permit
of the electric light produced by its combustion being used for
the common      purposes    of life, and you will readily perceive in
reference to our last experiment that the human muscles, or even
the muscles of         horse, would be also very expensive.
                       a                                              Here,
however, we can employ the force of burning coal to turn our
machine, and      it  this employment of our cheapest fuel, rendered
                       is
possible by Faraday's discovery, which opens out to us the prospect of
being able to apply the electric light to public use.
     In 1866    agreat step in the intensification of induced currents,
and the consequent augmentation         of the magneto-electric light, was
taken by Mr. Henry Wilde.         It fell to my lot to report upon them to
the Royal Society, but before doing so       I  took the trouble of going
to Manchester to witness Mr. Wilde's experiments.           He operated in
this way, starting from     a  small machine like that worked in your
presence  a moment ago, he employed its current to excite an electro
magnet of     apeculiar shape, between whose poles rotated         Siemens'
                                                                      a
armature * from this armature currents were obtained vastly stronger
          ;
than those generated by the small magneto-electric machine. These
currents might have been immediately employed to produce the electric
light but instead of this they were conducted round second electro
      ;                                                           a
magnet of vast size, between whose poles rotated Siemens' armature
                                                             a
of corresponding dimensions.            Three armatures     therefore  were
involved in this series of operations         ;first, the armature of the
small magneto-electric machine secondly, the armature of the first
                                      ;
electro-magnet, which was of considerable size; and thirdly, the
armature of the second electro-magnet, which was of vast dimensions.
With the currents drawn from this third armature Mr. Wilde ob
tained effects, both as regards heat and light, enormously transcending
those previously known.')'
    * Page and Moigno had previously shown that the magneto-electric current
could produce powerful electro-magnets.

    But the discovery which, above all others, brought the practical
question to the front is now to be considered.         On the 4th of
February, 1867,   a paper    was received by  the Royal Society from
Dr. William Siemens bearing the title, " On the conversion of Dynamic
into Electrical Force without the use of Permanent Magnetism." *
On the 14th of February a paper from Sir Charles Wheatstone .was
recoived, bearing the title, " On the augmentation of the Power of a
Magnet by the reaction thereon of Currents induced by tho Magnet
itself." Both papors, which dealt with the same discovery, and which
were illustrated by experiments, were read upon the same night, viz. on
tho 14th of February.           It
                            would be difficult to find in the whole field
of scieiico a more beautiful example of the interaction of natural
forces than that set forth in these two papers. You can hardly find
a bit of iron — you can hardly pick up an old horse-shoe, for example
— that does not possess a trace of permanent magnetism ; and from
such small beginnings Siemens and Wheatstone have taught us to
rise by a series of interactions between magnet and armature to a
magnetic intensity previously unapproached.       Conceive the Siemens'
armature placed between the poles of a suitablo electro-magnet.
Suvipose    this latter to possess at starting the faintest trace of
magnetism ; then when the armature rotates, currents of infini
tesimal strength arc generated in its coil.     Let the onds of that coil
bo connocted with the wire surrounding        the electro-magnet.    The
infinitesimal current generated in the armature will then circulate
round the magnet, augmenting its intensity by an infinitesimal
amount.      The strengthened magnet instantly reacts upon the coil
which feeds    it,
                 producing    current of greater strength. This current
                                 a
again passes round the magnet, which immediately brings its enhanced
power to bear upon the coil.       By this play of mutual give and take
between magnet and armature, the strength of tho former            raised  is
in   a very brief interval from almost nothing to complete magnetic
saturation. Such     amagnet and armature are able to produce currents
was briefly expressed in  a      report to the Elder brethren of the Trinity House on
the 17th of May, 1800    :      " It gives me pleasure to state that the machine     is
exi'criliiifxly effective, and that  itfar transc<nds in power all other apparatus of
the kind."
    * A paper on the same subject, by Dr. Werner Siemens, was rend on the 17th
of January. 1807, before the Academy of Sciences in Berlin.             In a letter to

marks a national trait that scaled communications,          theugh allowed in France,

of extraordinary power, and if an electric lamp be introduced into the
common circuit of magnet and armature, we can readily obtain a
most powerful light.*   By this discovery, then, we are enabled to
avoid the trouble and expense involved in the employment of per
manent magnets ; we are also enabled to drop the exciting magneto-
electric machine, and the duplication of the electro-magnets.       By         it,
in short, the electric generator        so far simplified, and reduced in

oust, as to enable electricity to enter the lists as the rival of our
present means of illumination.
     Soon after the announcement of their discovery by Siemens and
Wheatstone, Mr. Holmes, at the instance of the Elder Brethren of
the Trinity House, endeavoured to turn the discovery to account.
Already, in the spring of 1869, he had constructed         machino which,

though hampered with defects, exhibited extraordinary power.          The
light was developed in the focus of dioptric apparatus placed on the
                                            a
Trinity Wharf at Black wall, and witnessed by the Elder Brethren, their
engineer, and myself, from an observatory at Charlton, on the oppo
site side of the Thames.      Falling upon the suspended haze, the light
illuminated the atmosphere for miles all round.          Anything so sun
like in splendour had not, imagine, previously been witnessed. Tho
                               I
labour necessary to bring a machine of the kind to perfection was
then strikingly illustrated.     It required year of work after its first
                                                  a
successful performance to render the action of the machine secure.
There were ten electro-magnets and twenty helices in operation,
four of the latter being used to excite the electro-magnets, and the
remaining sixteen to develop the currents used for the light.       When
 thrown into action the strain produced by the mutual attraction of the
 poles was so great as to endanger the stability of the machine, and to
 lessen this defect  it was many times taken asunder and constructed
 anew.    The machine was subjected to very severe scrutiny at Black-
 wall, Mr. Ayres watching        constantly day and night during
                                 it                                   con a
 siderable number of trials.        Defects were revealed and removed,
 the final result being expressed in the following brief extract from           a
 long report which   I    had the honour of submitting to the Elder
 Brethren February 21, 1870:           "I
                                        think the experiments prove that

 With regard to the stability of the internal portions of the machine,
it    rather
     is       a question for your engineer (Mr. Douglass) than for mo.
 The strains and pressures within the machine may bo very great, and
 may require   a  corresponding strength of construction to cope with
 them.    Indeed this      tho reason why tho machine has been so often

 manifested itself during the late trials."

     As regards lighthouse illumination, the next step forward was
taken by the Elder Brethren of the Trinity House in 1876-77.
Having previously decided on the establishment of the electric light at
the Lizard in Cornwall, they instituted at the time referred to, an elabo
rate series of comparative experiments wherein the machines of Holmes,
of the Alliance Company, of Siemens, and of Gramme, were pitted
against each other. The Siemens and the Gramme machines delivered
direct currents, while those of Holmes and the Alliance Company
delivered alternating currents.            The light of the latter was of the
same intensity in all azimuths ; that of the former was different in
different azimuths, the discharge being so regulated as to yield a gush
of light of special intensity in one direction. The following table gives
in standard candles the performance of the respective machines : —

      These determinations woro made by Mr. Douglass the engiueer-in-
chief, and Mr. Ayres the assistant engineer of the Trinity House.
It is practically impossible to compare photometrically and diroctly
the flamo of a candle with these sun-like lights. A light of inter
mediate intensity — that of the six- wick Trinity oil lamp — was there
fore, in the first instance, compared with the electric light. Tho
candle power of tho oil lamp being afterwards determined, the intensity
of the electric light became known.                Tho numbers given in tho
 table prove the superiority of the Alliance machine over that of
 Holmes. They prove, for the resistances involved, the great superiority
both of the Gramme machine and of the small Siemens machine over
 tho Alliance, while the large Siemens machine is shown to yield a
 light far exceeding all the others. The coupling of two Grammes,
 or of two Siemens together, which was first successfully accom
 plished at tho South Foreland, was followed by a very great augmen
 tation of the light, rising in the ono caso from 6663 candles to 11,396,
 and in the other case from 6864 candles to 14,134. After this contest,
 which was conducted throughout in the most amicable manner,
 Siemens machines of the smaller type were chosen for the Lizard.*
      We have machines capable of sustaining             a single    light and also

 chesen for India.

   1879.]                    on the Electric Light.                      13
  machines capable of sustaining several lights. The Gramme machine,
  for example, which ignites the Jablochkeff candles on the Thames
  Embankment and at the Holborn Viaduct, delivers four currents, each
  flowing through its own circuit. In each circuit are five lamps through
  which the current belonging to the circuit passes in succession.     The
  lights correspond to so many resisting spaces, over which, as already
  explained, the current has to leap ; the force which accomplishes the
 leap being that which produces the light. Whether the current is to
 be competent to pass through five lamps in succession, or to sustain
 only a single lamp, depends entirely upon the will and skill of the
 maker of the machine. He has, to guide him, definite laws laid down
 half a century ago, by which he must abide.
      Ohm has taught us how to arrange the elements of our battery so
 as to augment indefinitely its electro-motive force.     We have only to
 link its cells together so that the current generated by each shall
 pass through all the others, and add its electro-motive force to
 that of all the others. We increase, it is true, at the same time the
 resistance of the battery, diminishing thereby the quantity of the
 current from each cell, but we augment the power of the integrated
 current to overcome external hindrances.           The battery resistance
 may, indeed, be rendered so great that the external resistance shall
 vanish in comparison.        What is here said regarding the voltaic
 battery is equally true of magneto-electric machines.      If we wish our
 current to leap over five intervals, and produce five lights in succes
 sion, we must invoke a sufficient electro-motive force. This is done
 simply by multiplying, by the use of thin wire, the convolutions of
 the rotating armature as, a moment ago, we augmented the cells of
our voltaic battery. Each additional convolution, like each additional
cell, adds its electro-motive force to that of all the others; and though
it also adds its resistance, thereby diminishing the quantity of current
contributed by each convolution, the integrated current becomes
endowed with the power of leaping across the successive spaces
necessary for the production of a series of lights in its course. Tho
machines, on the other hand, which produce only a single light have
a small internal resistance associated with a small electro-motive
force. In such machines the wire of the rotating armature is com
paratively short and thick, copper riband instead of wire being
sometimes employed.         Such machines deliver a large quantity of
electricity  of low   tension — in other words, of low leaping power.
Hence, though competent, when their power is converged upon a
single interval, to produce one splendid light, their currents are
unable to force a passage when the number of intervals is increased.
Thus, by augmenting the convolutions of our machines we sacrifice
quantity and gain electro-motive force ; while by lessening the number
of the convolutions, we sacrifice electro-motive force and gain quantity.
Whether we ought to cheose the one form of machine or the other
depends entirely upon the external work it has to perform.         If  tho
object be to obtain a singlo light of great splendour, machines of low

resistance and largo quantity must bo employed.                 If wo want to obtain
in the samo circuit several lights of moderate intensity, machines of
high internal resistance and of correspondingly high electro-motive
power, must be invoked.
     When a coil of covered wire surrounds a bar of iron, the two ends
of the coil being connected together, every alteration of the magnetism
of the bar is accompanied by the development of an induced current
in the coil. The current is only excited during the period of magnetic
change. No matter how strong or how weak the magnetism of the
bar may be, as long as its condition remains permanent no current is
developed.       Conceive the pole of a magnet placed near one end of the
bar to be moved along it to the other end.                 During the time of the
pole's motion there will be an incessant change in the magnetism of
the bar, and accompanying this change wo shall have an induced
current in the surrounding coil. If, instead of moving the magnet,
wo move the bar and its surrounding coil past the magnetic pole,
a similar alteration of the magnetism of the bar will occur, and a
similar current will bo induced in the coil.
      You have here the fundamental conception of M. Gramme which
led to the construction of his beautiful machine.* He aimed at giving
continuous motion to such a bar as we have here described, and for
this purpose he bent it into a continuous ring. By a suitable
mechanism he caused the various parts of the ring to pass in succes
sion close to the polos of a horse-shoe magnet.               The direction of the
 current varies with the motion,         and   with   tho character of the influ
 encing pole, tho    result  being   that   the  currents   in the two semicircles
 of  the  coil surrounding    the  ring   flow   in  opposite directions." But it
 is easy by    a suitable  mechanical      arrangement to conduct them away
from the places where they meet, and to cause them to flow in tho
 same direction.      The first machines of Gramme, therefore, furnished
direct currents, similar to those yielded by the voltaic pile.                     M.
 Gramme subsequently         so  modified     his  machine     as  to produce   alter
 nating currents. Such alternating machines are employed to produce
 the lights now exhibited on the Holborn Viaduct and the Thames
 Embankment.
      Another machine of great alleged merit is that of M. Lontin.
 It resembles in shape a toothed iron wheel, the teeth being used
 as cores round which are wound coils of copper wire.                   The wheel is
 caused to rotate between the poles of powerful electro-magnets.                   On
 passing each pole the core or tooth is strongly magnetized, and
 instantly evokes in the surrounding                coil an induced current of
 corresponding strength.         Tho currents excited in approaching and
 retreating, and in passing different poles flow in opposite direc
 tions, but by means of a commutator these conflicting                        electric

streams are gathered up and caused to flow in a common bed.
The bobbins in which tho currents are induced can be so augmented
in number as to augment indefinitely the power of the machine. A
series of toothed wheels, for example, may be fixed on the same
axle, each wheel and its bobbins rotating between their own pair of
electro-magnetic poles. In the larger machines of M. Lontin, the
ends of the iron teeth which constitute the cores face correspond
ing helices and cores fixed to an exterior iron ring. In this dispo
sition the bobbins of the rotating wheel are the electro-magnets,
while the bobbins attached to the ring are those from which the
induced currents are drawn.          By coupling the bobbins together in
various ways they      can  be  united  so as to furnish a single current, or
to furnish a number of distinct currents which may be regarded as
fractions of the whole current.          To excite his electro-magnets, M.
Lontin applies the principle of Mr. Wilde.                   A small machino
furnishes a direct current, which he carries round the electro-magnets
of a second and larger machine. Wilde's principle, it may be added,
is also applied on the Thames Embankment and the Holborn Viaduct ;
a small Grammo machine being used in each case to excite the
electro-magnets of the largo one.
      The Farmer-Wallace machine is also an apparatus of great power.
It consists of a combination of bobbins for induced currents, and of
inducing electro-magnets.          The latter are excited by the method
 discovered by Siemens and Wheatstono.            In tho machines intended
 for the production of the electric light, the electro-motive force is so
 great as to permit of the introduction of several lights in the samo
 circuit. A peculiarly novel feature of the Farmor- Wallace system is
 the shape of the carbons. Instead of rods large plates of carbon,
 with bevelled edges, are placed one above the other. The electric
 discharge passes from edge to edge, and shifts its position according
 as the carbon is dissipated.          Tho plates are kept at the proper
 distance apart by an automatic electro-magnetic arrangement.                  The
 duration of tho light in this case far exceeds that obtainable with
 rods.     I have myself seon four of these lights in the same circuit in
 Mr. Ladd's workshop in the City, and they are now,               I   believe, em
 ployed at the Liverpool Street Station of the Metropolitan Railway.

 The Farmer- Wallace " quantity machine                pours forth a flood of
 electricity of low tension. While unable to cross the interval neces
 sary for the production of a single electric light, it can fuse thick
 copper wires. When the current is sent through a short bar of iridium,
 this refractory metal emits a light of extraordinary splendour.*
       The machine of M. de Meritens, which he has generously brought
 over from Paris for our instruction, is the newest of all. In its con
 struction he falls back upon the principle of the magneto-electric
 machine, employing permanent magnets as the exciters of the induced

currents.     Using the magnets of the Alliance Company, by a skilful
disposition of his bobbins, M. do Meritens produces with eight
magnets a light equal to that produced by forty magnets in the
Alliance machines. While the space occupied is only one-fifth, the
cost is little more than one-fourth that of the latter.            In the do
Meritens machine the commutator is abolished. The internal heat is
hardly sensible, and the absorption of power, in relation to the effects
produced, is small.       With his larger machines M. de Meritens
maintains a considerable number of lights in the same circuit.*
     In relation to this subject inventors fall into two classes, tho
contrivers of regulators and the constructors of machines.             To the
mechanicians of the former class already mentioned may be added
Browning, Siemens, Carr6, Gramme, Lontin, Achereau, &c.                    M.
 Rapieff has hitherto belonged to the inventors of regulators, but           I
have reason to know that he is engaged on a machine which when
complete will place him in the other class also.             Instead of two
single carbon rods, M. Rapieff employs two pairs of rods, each pair
forming a V. The light is produced at the common junction of the
four carbons. The device for regulating the light is of the simplest
character.     At the bottom of the stand which supports the carbons
are two small electro-magnets. One of them, when the current passes,
draws the carbons together, and in so doing throws itself out of
circuit, leaving the control of the light to the other. The carbons
are caused to approach each other by a descending weight which acts
in conjunction with the electro-magnet.          Through the liberality of
the proprietors of the Times every facility has been given to M.
Rapieff to develop his invention at Printing House Square. The
                                          I
illumination of the press-room, which had the pleasure of witnessing,
under the guidance of M. Rapieff himself, is extremely effectual and
agreeable to the eye.      There are,   I believe, five lamps in the same
circuit, and the regulators are so devised that the extinction of any
lamp does not compromise the action of the others.
     Many other inventors might here bo named, and fresh ones are
daily crowding in. Mr. Werdermann has been long known in con
nection with this subject. Employing as negative carbon a disc, and
as positive carbon a rod, he has,   I am assured, obtained very satisfactory
results.    The small resistances brought into play by his minute arcs
enable Mr. Werdermann to introduce a number of lamps into a circuit
traversed by a current of only moderate electro-motive power.               M.
Reynier is also the inventor of a very beautiful little lamp, in which
the point of a thin carbon rod, properly adjusted, is caused to touch
the circumference of a carbon wheel which rotates underneath the
point.    The light is developed at the place of contact of rod and
    * The small machine transforms one-and-a-quarter herse-power into heat and
light, yielding about 1900 candles; the large machine transforms five herse

wheel.      Again the positive       carbon wastes more profusely than the
 negative,    and this is alleged to be due to the greater heat of the
 former.     It occurred to Mr. William Siemens to chill the negative
artificially,   with the view of diminishing or wholly preventing its
waste.      This  he accomplishes by making the negative a hollow cone
 of copper, and by ingeniously discharging cold water against the
 interior of the cone.        His negative copper is thus caused to remain
fixed in space, for it is not dissipated, the positive carbon only needing
control.      I have seen this lamp in action and can bear witness to its
success.
     There is something bewildering in the recent rush of constructive
 talent into this domain of applied electricity.           The question and its
 prospects are modified from day to day, a steady advance being made
 towards the improvement both of machines and regulators. With
regard to our squares, quays, esplanades, public halls, and other
similar places,     I  strongly lean to the opinion that the electric light
 will finally triumph over gas.          I am npt so sure that it will do so in
 our private homes.         As, however,    I  am anxious to avoid dropping a
 word here that could influence the share market in the slightest
degree,    I limit myself to this general statement of opinion.
     To one inventor, in particular, belongs the honour of the idea, and
 the realization of the idea, of causing the carbon rods to burn away
 like a candle.                                              I
                     It is needless for me to say that here refer to the
young Russian officer, M. Jablochkoff.                He sets two carbon rods
 upright at a small distance apart, and fills the space between them
 with an insulating substance like plaster of Paris.            The carbon rods
 are fixed in metallic holders, by one of which the current arrives, and
 by the other of which it passes away.                A momentary contact is
 established     between the two carbons by a little cross-piece of the
 same substance placed horizontally from top to top. This cross-piece
 is immediately dissipated or removed by the current, the passage of
 which once established is afterwards maintained.                  The carbons
 gradually waste, while the substance between them melts like the
 wax of a candle.        The comparison, however, only holds good for the
 act of melting ; for, as regards the current, the insulating plaster is
practically inert. Indeed, as proved by M. Rapieff and Mr. Wilde,
the plaster may be dispensed with altogether, the current passing
from point to point between the naked carbons.               M. de Meritens has
recently brought      out  a  new  candle,  in  which  the plaster is abandoned,
while between the two principal carbons is placed a third insulated
rod of the same material. With the small de Meritons machine two
of these candles can be lighted before you ; they produce a very
brilliant effect.*      In the Jablochkoff candle it is necessary that the
carbons should be consumed at the same rate. Hence the necessity

 It will be seen that M. Jablochkeff has abolished regulators altogether,
 introducing the candle principle in their stead. In my judgment the
 performance of the Jablochkeff candle on the Thames Embankment
 and the Holborn Viaduct is highly creditable, notwithstanding               a
 considerable waste of light towards the sky. The Jablochkeff lamps,
 it may be added, would be more effective in a street, where their
 light would be scattered abroad by the adjacent houses, than in tho
 positions which they now occupy in London.

      It was my custom some years ago, whenever needed a new and
 complicated instrument, to sit down beside its proposed constructor,
 and to talk the matter over with him.       The study of the inventor's
 mind which this habit opened out was always of the highest interest
 to me.    I particularly well remember the impression made upon me
 on such occasions by the late Mr. Darker, a philosophical instrument
maker in Lambeth. This man's life was a struggle, and the reason of
it was not far to seek. No matter how commercially lucrative tho
work upon which he was engaged might be, he would instantly turn
aside from it to seize and realize the ideas of a scientific man.         He
had an inventor's power, and an inventor's delight in its exercise.
The late Mr. Becker possessed the same power in a very considerable
degree.     On the Continent, Froment, Breguet, Sauerwald, and others
might be mentioned as eminent instances of ability of this kind.
Such minds resemble a liquid on the point of crystallization.        Stirred
by a hint, crystals of constructive thought immediately shoot through
them. That Mr. Edison possesses this intuitive power in no common
measuro is proved by what he has already accomplished.          He has the
penetration to seize the relationship of facts and principles, and the
art to reduce them to novel and concrete combinations.           Hence an
adverse opinion as to his ability to solve the complicated problem on
which he is now engaged would bo unwarranted.          It is purely a case,
not for the discovery of new facts and principles, but for the exerciso
of mechanical ingenuity in turning to a special account facts and
principles already familiar to the scientific man.
     I  will endeavour to illustrate in a simple manner Mr. Edison's
alleged mode of electric illumination, taking advantage of what Ohm
has taught us regarding the laws of the current, and what Joule has
taught us regarding the relation of resistance to the development
of light and heat. From one end of a voltaic battery runs a wire
dividing at a certain point into two branches which re-unite in a
single wire connected with the other end of tho battery.         From the
positive end of the battery the current passes first through the single
wire to the point of junction, where it divides itself between the
branches according to a well-known law.       If the branches be equally
resistant the current divides itself equally between them.           If one
branch be less resistant than the other, more than half of the current
will cheose the freer path. The strict law is that the quantity of

1879.J                       on the   Electric Light.                  19
current is inversely proportional to the resistance. A clear image of
the process is derived from the deportment of water.       When a river
meets an island it divides, passing right and left of the obstacle and
afterwards reuniting.    If the two branch beds be equal in depth,
width, and inclination, the water will divide itself equally between
them.     If they be unequal, the larger quantity of water will flow
through the more open course.      Detaching one of these branch wires,
I  send the whole current from our battery through the other, in which
a spiral of platinum wire is introduced.     The spiral glows brightly.
I  now connect the second branch, which also contains its spiral. The
current divides, and the consequence is that the first spiral falls while
the second rises in illumination.   Augmenting the resistance of either
branch, an additional portion of the current is thrown upon the other,
increasing the light of its spiral. Introducing, instead of either spiral,
a piece of thick copper wire, nearly the whole of the current passes
through      the glow of the spiral in the other branch falling to
             it,
darkness. And as in the case of the water we may have an indefinite
number of islands producing an indefinite subdivision of the trunk
stream, so in the case of electricity we may have instead of two
branches any number of branches, the current dividing itself among
them in accordance with the law which fixes the relation of current
to resistance.
     Let us apply this knowledge. Suppose an insulated copper rod,
which we may call an " electric main," to be laid down along one of
our streets, say along the Strand. Let this rod be connected with one
end of   a powerful Voltaic battery,     good metallic connection being
                                           a
established between the other end of the battery and the gas-pipes
under the street. As long as the electric main continues unconnected
with the gas-pipes the circuit     incomplete and no current will flow
                                  is                                    ;
but if  any part of the main, however distant from the battery, be
connected with the adjacent gas-pipes, the circuit will be completed
and the current will flow.      Supposing our battery to be at Charing
Cross, and our rod of copper to be tapped opposite Somerset House,
a  branch wire can be carried from the rod into the building, the
current passing through which may be subdivided into any number
of subordinate branches which reunite afterwards and return through
the gas-pipes to the battery. The branch currents may be employed
to raise to vivid incandescence     refractory metal like iridium or one
                                      a
of its alloys. Instead of being tapped at one point, our main may be
tapped at one hundred points.        The current will divide in strict
accordance with law, its power to produce light being solely limited
by its strength.     The process of division closely resembles the cir
culation of the blood the electric main carrying the outgoing current
                         ;
representing     great artery, the gas-pipes carrying the return current
                   a a
representing great vein, while the intermediate branches represent the
various vessels by which the blood       distributed through the system.

 attached to one of its ends, while the other end is connected with a
 gas-pipe of the Institution. From three different points of the copper
 wire branch wires pass into three little models of houses, where
 the branches are subdivided and furnished with spirals of platinum
 wire.     The branches reunite afterwards in the gas-pipe. When the
 branch currents pass through the houses, they kindle the platinum
 lamps, which glow with a soft, white light. This, if            I understand
 aright, is Mr. Edison's proposed mode of illumination. The electric
 force is at hand. Metals sufficiently refractory to bear being raised
 to vivid incandescence are also at hand.              The principles which
 regulate the division of the current and the development of its
 light and heat are perfectly well known. There is no room for a
' '
    discovery," in the scientific sense of the term, but there is ample
 room for the exercise of that mechanical ingenuity which has given
 us the sewing machine and so many other nseful inventions, and
 which engages a greater number of minds in the United States than
 in any other nation in the world.*
      It is sometimes stated as a recommendation to the electric light,
 that it is light without heat ; but to disprove this, it is only necessary
 to point to the experiments of Davy, which showed that the heat of
 the Voltaic arc transcends that of any other terrestrial source.          The
 emission from the carbon points is capable of accurate analysis.           To
 simplify the subject, we will take the case of a platinum wire at
 first slightly warmed by the current, and then, through the gradual
 augmentation of the latter, raised to a white heat. When first warmed,
 the wire sends forth rays which have no power on the optic nerve.
 They are what we call invisible rays ; and not until the temperature
of the wiro has reached nearly 1000° Fahr. does it begin to glow with
 a faint, red light. The rays which it emits prior to redness are all in
 visible rays, which can warm the hand but which cannot excite vision.
When the temperature of the wire is raised to whiteness these dark
rays not only persist, but they are enormously augmented in intensity.
 They constitute about 95 per cent. of the total radiation from the
dazzling platinum wire. They make up 90 per cent. of the emission
from a brilliant electric light. You can, by no means, have the light
of the carbons without this invisible emission as an accompaniment.
The visible radiation is, as it were, built upon the invisible as its
necessary foundation.
      It is easy to illustrate the growth in intensity of these invisible
rays as the visible ones enter the radiation and augment in power.
The transparency of the simple gases and metalloids — of oxygen,
hydrogen, nitrogen, chlorine, iodine, bromine, sulphur, phosphorus,
and even carbon, for the invisible heat-rays is extraordinary.            Dis-
     • Knowing
                  something of the intricacy of the problem, I sheuld certainly
prefer seeing it in Mr. Edison's hands than in mine. It may bo added that more
than thirty years ago the radiation from incandescent platinum was admirably
investigated by Dr. Draper of New York.

solved in a, proper vehicle iodine cuts the visible radiation sharply
off, but allows the invisible free transmission.            We have hitherto
used it dissolved in bisulphide of carbon.          By fusing together iodine
and sulphur, Professor Dewar has recently added to the number of
our effectual ray-filters.       It may be made as black as pitch for the
visible, while remaining transparent for the invisible rays.           By such
filters it is possible to detach the invisible rays from the total
radiation, and to watch their augmentation as the temperature rises.
Expressing the radiation from a platinum wire when it first feels
warm to the touch — when, therefore, all its rays are invisible — by
the number 1, the invisible radiation from the same wire raised to a
white heat might be 500 or more.             An actual table of measurements
will clearly show the gradual growth of the invisible radiation as a
spiral of platinum wire rises from darkness to an intense white heat.

      It is not then by the diminution or transformation of the non-
luminous emission that we obtain the luminous ; the heat rays maintain
 their ground as the necessary antecedents and companions of the light
rays.     When detached and concentrated these powerful heat rays can
produce all the effects ascribed to the mirrors of Archimedes at the
siege of Syracuse.        While incompetent to produce the faintest glimmer
 of light, or to affect the most delicate air-thermometer, they will inflame
paper, burn up wood, and even ignite combustible metals. When they
impinge upon a metal refractory enough to bear their shock without
fusion, they can raise it to a heat so. white and luminous as to yield, when
analyzed, all the colours of the spectrum.           In this way the dark rays
emitted by the incandescent carbons are converted into light rays of
all colours. Still, so powerless are these invisible rays to excite vision
that the eye has been placed at a focus competent to raise platinum
 foil to bright redness without experiencing any visual, or even thermal,
 impression. Light for light, no doubt, the amount of heat imparted by
 the incandescent carbons to the air is far less than that imparted by gas
 flames. It is less because of the smaller size of the carbons, and of the
 comparative smallness of the quantity of fuel consumed in a given
 time.   It is also less because the air cannot penetrate to the interior of

the carbons as it does to the interior of a flame.     The temperature
of the flame is lowered by the admixture of a gas which consti
tutes four-fifths of our atmosphere, and which, while it appropriates
and diffuses the heat, does not aid in the combustion.      This lower
ing of the temperature by the inert atmospheric nitrogen renders
necessary the combustion of a greater amount of gas to produce the
necessary light. In fact, though the statement may appear para
doxical, it is entirely because of its enormous actual temperature that
the electric light seems so cool. It is this temperature that renders
the proportion of luminous to non-luminous heat greater in the
electric light than in our brightest flames.   The electric light, more
over, requires no air to sustain it.     It glows in the most perfect
air vacuum. Its light and heat are therefore not purchased at the
expense of the vitalizing constituent of the atmosphere.
     Two orders of minds have been implicated in the development of
 this subject; first, the investigator and discoverer, whose object is
 purely scientific, and who cares little for practical ends ; secondly, the
 practical mechanician, whose object is mainly industrial. It would be
easy, and probably in many cases true, to say that the ouo wants to
gain knowledge, while the other wants to mako money ; but                  I

persuaded that the mechanician not unfrequently merges          the  hope of
profit  in the love  of  his work.  Members of each    of these   classes are
sometimes scornful towards those of the other. There          is,
                                                               for example,
something superb in the disdain with which Cuvier hands over the
discoveries of pure science to those who apply them " Your grand

practical achievements are only the easy application of truths not
sought with a practical intent — truths which their discoverers pursued
for their own sake, impelled solely by an ardour for knowledge.
Those who turned them into practice could not have discovered them,
while those who discovered them had neither the time nor the inclina
tion to pursue them to practical result. Your rising workshops, your
                        a

                       "                               "
were he now alive,     regarding   the electrio light — " all come from
discoverers in Science, though all remain strange to them.     The day
that  adiscovery enters the market they abandon       it,concerns them
                                                         it
no more."
    In writing thus, Cuvier probably did not sufficiently take into
account the reaction of the applications of science upon science itself.
The improvement of an old instrument or the invention of new one    a
is often tantamount to an enlargement and refinement of the senses of
the scientific investigator.    Beyond this, the amelioration of the
community   is  also an object worthy of the best efforts of the human
brain.    Still assuredly   it  well and wise for
                                 is                  nation to bear in

  intellectual stimulus.    " The ancients discovered the electricity of
  amber; and Gilbert, in the year 1600, extended the discovery to other
  bodies. Then followed Boyle, Von Guericke, Gray, Canton, Du Fay,
  Kleist, Cuiueus, and Franklin. But their form of electricity, though
 tried, did not come into practical use. Then appeared the great Italian
 Volta, who discovered the source of electricity which bears his name,
 and applied to its development the most profound insight, and the most
 delicate experimental skill.     Then arose the man who added to the
 powers of his intellect all the graces of the human heart, Michael
 Faraday, the discoverer of the great domain of magneto-electricity.
 CErsted discovered the deflection of the magnetic needle, and Arago
 and Sturgeon the magnetization of iron by the electric current. The
 voltaic circuit finally found its theoretic Newton in Ohm ; while
 Henry, of Princeton, who had the sagacity to recognize the merits of
 Ohm while they were still decried in his own country, was at that
 time in the van of experimental inquiry.
      " In the works of these men you have all the materials employed
 at this hour in all the forms of the electric telegraph.      Nay, more,
 Gauss the illustrious astronomer, and Weber the illustrious natural
philosopher, both professors in the University of Gottingen, wishing
to establish a rapid mode of communication between the observatory
and the physical cabinet of the University, did this by means of an
 electric telegraph. Thus, before those whom the world calls practical
 men appeared upon the scene, the force had been discovered, its laws
investigated and made sure, the most complete mastery of its phe
nomena had been attained — nay, its applicability to telegraphic
purposes demonstrated — by men whose sole reward for their labours
 was the noble excitement of research, and the joy attendant on the
discovery of natural truth."        I  ought to apologize for thus repro
ducing     words  uttered by myself   in the United States six years ago.
But they apply with particular emphasis to the recent developments
of the electric light.
      " Few," says Pasteur, " seem to comprehend the real origin
of the marvels of industry and the wealth of nations.              I need
no other proof of this than the frequent employment in lectures,
                                                                 '
speeches, and official language, of the erroneous expression, applied
science.'     A statesman of the greatest talent, stated some time ago,
that in our day the reign of theoretic science had rightly yielded place
to that of applied science.                I
                                Nothing, venture to say, could be more
dangerous, even to practical life, than the consequences which might
flow from these words. They show the imperious necessity of a
reform of our superior education.            There exists no category of
sciences to which the name of applied science could be given.         We
have science and the applications of science, which are united as the
fruit is to the tree."
      One word more upon what may be called the philosophic bearings
of this question.       We have amongst us a small cohort of social

 regenerators — men of high thoughts and aspirations — who would
 place the operations of the scientific mind under the control of a
 hierarchy which should dictate to the man of science the course that
 he ought to pursue. How this hierarchy is to get its wisdom they do
 not explain. They decry and denounce scientific theories ; they scorn
all reference to aether, and atoms, and molecules, as subjects lying far
apart from the world's needs ; and yet such ultra-sensible conceptions
are often the spur to the greatest discoveries.     The source, in fact,
from which the true natural philosopher derives inspiration and uni
fying power, is essentially ideal. Faraday lived in this ideal world.
Nearly half a century ago, when he first obtained a spark from a
magnet, an Oxford don expressed regret that such a discovery should
have been made, as it placed a new and facile implement in the hands
of the incendiary.    To regret, a Comtist hierarchy would have pro
bably added repression, sending Faraday back to his bookbinder's
bench as a more dignified and practical sphere of action than peddling
with a magnet.     And yet it is Faraday's spark which now shines
upon our coasts, and promises to illuminate our streets, halls, quays,
squares, warehouses, and, perhaps at no distant day, our homes.

The lecturer   commenced by referring to the vast differences between
the Chinese and Japanese nations, of which the English people as a
rule do not seem to be aware.       He instanced various points of con
trast ; one of the most important being the intensely oriental secluded
character of the private life of the Chinese on the one hand, and the
Japanese dwelling in houses unfurnished and left wide open to public
gaze on the other. But why, he asked, in this comparative absence
of nearly all that we should call furniture, does one article pertaining
to the ladies' toilette — the bronze mirror with its stand — hold so
prominent a position ?
    This mirror of the Far East is usually circular, from three to
twelve inches in diameter, made of bronze, and with a bronze handle
covered with bamboo.       The reflecting face is generally more or less
convex, polished with a mercury amalgam ; the back is gracefully
ornamented with a well-executed raised design, representing birds,
flowers, dragons, a geometrical pattern, or somo scene in Japanese
mythical history.     Occasionally there are also one or more Chinese
characters (signifying long life, happiness, or some similar idea) of
polished metal in bold relief.      The general appearance of the back
of the mirror, therefore, is something like that seen in the figure in
the next page.
    It might at first sight be surmised that the elaborate head-dresses
of the ladies in Japan, combined with the painting of their faces,
furnished an explanation of the prominence given to the metal mirror.
But that this is not the case is easily seen from the fact that it is in
the Imperial Palace, where the court ladies, still preserving the simple
fashion of ancient days, merely comb back their long black tresses,
and so have least need of a looking-glass, that the Japanese mirror
receives the highest respect. A foreigner meets the mirror in the
temples, in the hands of the street conjuror, in pictures of the infernal
regions, and in the regalia of the Japanese sovereigns, and for some
time after his arrival in Japan feels as an Oriental, ignorant of Biblical
history, might when unable to understand the constant repetition of
the cross in Roman Catholic countries.      But at length he hears that

the mirror is part of the Japanese religion, and is mixed up with the
" Divine Bight of Kings," that it is the most precious of the       posses
sions of a Japanese woman, and constitutes the most important part
of the trousseau of a bride, and that the "Two Great Divine Palaces "
at Ise in which was deposited the first made mirror, have in the eyes
of the Japanese the same importance as has the Holy Sepulchre for
the Greeks and Armenians, and Mecca for the Mahommedans.
    And to realizo the reason of this the stranger must learn that there
is a famous ancient myth in Japan, which was recounted by the lec
turer, detailing how the sun-goddess in a rage shut herself up in a
rocky cave, and how the other gods, to dispel the darkness thus caused,
used various artifices to entice her forth, the most successful ruse being
the manufacture of the first historical mirror, in which seeing her face
she was drawn forth by her curiosity and jealousy.          He will also
learn how in the supposed creation of the Japanese empire, the sun-
goddess is reputed to have handed this mirror (with the two other
" gods' treasures" which, together with a mirror, at    present constitute
the regalia of the emperor) to her grandson with these words : " Look
upon this mirror as my spirit, keep it in the same house and on the
same floor with yourself, and worship it as if you were worshipping
my actual presence."
    After describing many interesting points in connection with this
strange mirror worship of the Japanese as seen in the palace and in

present the investigation of the so-called magic properties of the
Japanese mirror would probably prove of yet more interest.
     This magic property, which is possessed by a few rare specimens
coming from the East, is as follows : —          If
                                             the polished surface is looked
at directly it acts like that of an ordinary mirror, reflecting the objects
in front of    it,but giving, of course, no indication whatever of the
raised patterns on the back        ;   if,

with cuts corresponding with the pattern on the back of the mirror,
 and illuminated from behind.
      This strange phenomenon was known to Sir David Brewster and
  to Sir Charles Wheatstone, both of whom were of opinion that                             it
  was produced    by trickery on the part of the maker.          Sir David
  Brewster, for example, says in the        Philosophical Magazine      for
                                                 '                                     '
  December, 1832: — "Like all other conjurors, the artist has contrived
  to make the observer deceive himself.        The stamped figures on the
  back (of the mirror) are used for this purpose. The spectrum in the

      Professor Ayrton then related how he had been quite unable to find
 for sale in any of the shops of Japan one of these magic mirrors which
 was supposed in Europe to be          standard Japanese trick, and he
                                         a
 explained how he had at length ascertained that with regard to this
 so-called magic mirror the Japanese were the people who know least
 about the subject.
     But these magic mirrors were known to the Chinese from the earliest
 times, and one of their writers spoke about them in the ninth century
of the Christian era. They call them Theou-kouang-kien, which means
literally " mirrors that let the light pass through them," the name, of
course, arising from       popular error on the subject.
                            a                                  The Roman
writer Aulus Gellius, who lived seventeen centuries ago, referred to
mirrors that sometimes reflected their backs and sometimes did not.
From the great antiquity of these Chinese magic mirrors the German
writer Herr Sterne has concluded that           probable that the mirrors
                                                 it   is
with secret signs and figures of imps on the back, which formed a
portion of the stock-in-trade of the witches of the middle ages, were
of Eastern manufacture.      The Italian historian Muratori gives an
account of the inagic mirror found under the pillow of the Bishop of

28                                    Professor Ayrton                             [Jan. 24,
Verona, who was afterwards condemned to death hy Martin della
Scala, as well as of the one discovered in the house of Colla da Rienzi,
and on the back of which was the word " Fiorone."                  But of these
magic   mirrors    which have   played  so  important      a part,  not only in
the priestcraft of China, but also in the oracles of the Greeks and
Etruscans, and in the witchcraft of the middle ages, inquiry has shewn
that Japanese literature makes absolutely no mention.
     Is     then, that such mirrors cannot be found in Japan? Un
             it,
doubtedly they cannot be bought by inquiry at the shops, but Pro
fessor Ayrton investigations have shown that

                                              a
cent., will be found showing the phenomenon clearly.
     The lecturer then referred to the extracts he had made from a
large portion of all that had been written in various languages regard
ing the explanation of the phenomenon.               He mentioned that the
earliest explanation was given by            Chinaman, Ou-tseu-hing, who
                                               a
lived between 1260 and 1341, and who also had the impression that
the magic property of the mirror was produced by an artifice              for he   ;
wrote " When we turn one of the mirrors with its face to the sun,
         :
and allow      to throw
                   it     reflection on

Now the cause of this phenomenon arises from the employment of two
kinds of copper of unequal density.                 If
                                                 on the back of the mirror                 a

    Ou-tseu-hing adds that he has seen     mirror of this kind broken
                                                       a

this explanation.

says  :

manufacture, the monopoly of which certain skilled workmen reserve
to themselves.     One can easily understand     this prudent reticence
when we remember that the rare mirrors which show this phenomenon
sell from ten to twenty times as dear as the rest."
     The prevalent idea has been that the phenomenon of the magic
mirror was caused by difference of density in various parts of the
                            a
surface, either produced intentionally or accidentally     and this the
                                                              ;
lecturer explained arose from two causes, first from the common belief
that the patterns on Japanese and Chinese mirrors were, like those on
ordinary coins, produced by stamping, the other because the distin
guished European philosophers who had examined into the question
had investigated with considerable success experimentally how such
mirrors might be made, but they had not, the lecturer thought,
directed their attention to the examination of the question — How was
the phenomenon in these rare Eastern mirrors actually produced? —
obviously a  very different question.
    Professor Ayrton mentioned that he and his colleague, Professor
Perry, were led to take up the investigation from       very remarkable
                                                          a
fact pointed out by Professor Atkinson of Japan, viz. that scratch     a
made with blunt iron nail on the bank of one of these magic mirrors,
          a
although it  produced no mark on the face of the mirror which could
be seen by direct vision, nevertheless became visible as a bright line
on the screen when     beam of sunlight was reflected from the polished
                        a
face of the mirror.    Tho lecturer mentioned that after trying various
experiments with polarised light, &c., Professor Perry and himself
availed themselves of very simple method of investigation, but one
                            a
which had apparently not suggested itself to previous observers.       On
one occasion, when some of their students were using lenses to
endeavour to make the exhibition of the phenomenon more striking,
it occurred to them that the employment of beams of light of different
degrees of convergence or divergence would furnish      test for deciding
                                                          a
the cause of the whole action. For while,         if
                                                   the phenomenon were
due to molecular differences in the surface — the commonly received
opinion — the effect would be practically independent of the amount of
convergence of the beam of light on the other hand,
                                         ;                        if   it,
                                                                   by any
chance, were due to portions of the reflecting surface being less convex
than the remainder, complete inversion of the phenomenon might bo
                        a
expected to occur,    the experiments, instead of being tried in ordinary
                       if

 30                                   Professor Ayrion                     [Jan. 24,
   sunlight, were made under certain conditions in a converging beam —
   that is, the thicker portions of the mirror might be expected to appear
   darker instead of brighter than the remainder.
       [Experiments were then shown of the image cast on the screen                 :
   1st, when      divergent beam of light fell on the mirror 2nd, when
                  a                                                    ;
  the beam was parallel         ; 3rd, when the beam was convergent and    :       it
   was seen that, 1st, the pattern appeared as bright on           a  dark ground
   2nd, the pattern was invisible 3rd, the pattern appeared as dark on
                                        ;

   bright ground.]
       Again, by allowing         parallel beam of light to fall on the Japanese
  mirror and interposing        a adoable convex lens between the mirror and
  the screen, we can make the image show the pattern either as bright
  ona    dark ground or as dark on          abright ground, or not at all, merely
  by causing the screen to be 1st, nearer the lens than the conjugate
                                       :
  focns of the mirror second, farther than the conjugate focus 3rd,
                           ;                                                   ;
  at the conjugate focus.         [This experiment was here shown.] Now            it
  can easily be proved by simple geometrical optics that each of these
  effects would be produced           if  the thicker parts of the mirror were
 a little less convex than the remainder.                [This was explained by
 various geometrical diagrams.]             And lastly,  if the phenomenon was,
 as the previous experiment would lead us to conclude, due not to
 unequal reflecting power of the different portions of the surface of the
 mirror, but to minute inequalities on the surface, in consequence of
 which there           more scattering of the rays of light falling on one
                      is
 portion than on another, then since rays of light making very small
 angles with one another do not separate perceptibly until they have
 gone some distance,       it  follows, that    ifthe screen be held very near to
 the mirror, the apparent reflection of the back, the magical property
 in fact, ought to become invisible.           And this, also,it  was shown, was
exactly what happened when the screen was made almost to touch the
polished surface.
      The lecturer then proceeded to explain why              a   divergent beam,
emitted by    a   bright luminous point at some fifteen feet distance from
the mirror, gave the best effects.
      We have, therefore, strong reasons for favouring the " inequality
                  "
of curvature          theory.    In order, however, to make the explanation
quite certain, the lecturer said he had made             a small concavity and     a
small convexity on the face of one of the mirrors, by hammering with
a   blunt tool, carefully protected with soft cushion to avoid scratching
                                                a
the polished surface, and he showed by experiment that the concavity
reflected     a bright image and the convexity           a  dark one when the
pattern     on  the    back   appeared bright,      but  when   the light was so
arranged     that   the pattern appeared      as dark  ona  bright  ground, itwas
the convexity which appeared as the bright spot, and the concavity as
the dark one.
      Guided by all that precedes, we are led to the undoubted con
clusion, that the whole action of the magic mirror arises from the
thicker portions being flatter than the remaining convex surface, and

1879.]       'on the Mirror of Japan and its Magic Quality.            31
even   being sometimes actually concave.     But, in spite of this irre
sistible conclusion forced on us by the experiments previously
mentioned, it must be admitted that it seems extraordinary how such
small inequalities in the surface of the mirror — so small, in fact, that
the eye quite fails to detect them — can, even with a proper arrange
ment of the light, produce on the screen an image of the pattern on
the back as sharp and clear as is seen with a good specimen of a
magic mirror.
     The next question arises, Why is there this difference in the curva
ture of the different portions of the surface?      The experience that
Professor Ayrton had gained from an examination of a large number of
Japanese mirrors supplied, in part at any rate, the answer to the ques
tion. No thick mirror reflects the pattern on the back, not one of the
many beautiful mirrors exhibited at the National Exhibition of Japan
in 1877, and which the lecturer was so fortunate as to be able to experi
ment with in a darkened room with a bright luminous point at some
twelve feet distance, showed the phenomenon in the slightest degree ;
some good old mirrors in the museum of the Imperial College of
Engineering, and which belonged to the family of the late Emperor,
the Shogun, of Japan, failed to reflect any trace of a design, and some
old round mirrors without handles, which he had also tried, were
(with the exception of one which was immensely prized and brought
to him wrapped in five distinct silk cases, and the heirloom of the
family of a nobleman) equally unsuccessful.
     Again, it is not that the pattern is less clearly executed on the
backs of these choice mirrors, since the better the mirror the finer
and bolder is the pattern, but what is especially noticeable is that
every one of these mirrors is as a whole far thicker than an ordinary
Japanese mirror, and its surface is much less convex. This naturally
led him to inquire, How are Japanese mirrors made convex ? Are they
cast so, or do they acquire this shape from some subsequent process ?
     His search through all the literature at his disposal, European,
Japanese, Chinese, on the subject of mirrors failed to elicit the
slightest hint, he was therefore compelled to perform the somewhat
difficult task of obtaining information from the Japanese workmen
themselves.      Eventually he ascertained that while practically all
Japanese mirrors were convex, the surface of each half of the mould
was quite flat, and that the curvature was given to the mirror after
casting in the following way.
     The rough mirror is first scraped approximately smooth with a
hand-scraping tool, and as this would remove any small amount of
convexity, had such been imparted to it in casting, it is useless to
make the mould slightly convex.       If, however, a convex or concavo
mirror of small radius is required, then the surface of the mould is
made concave or convex.       On the other hand, to produce the small
amount of convexity which is possessed by ordinary Japanese mirrors
the following method is employed, if the mirror is thin, and it is with
thin mirrors we have especially to deal, sinco it is only in these

32                           Professor Ayrton                   [Jan. 24,
mirrors that the apparent reflection of the back is observed. The
mirror is placed face uppermost flat on a wooden board, and then
scraped or rather scratched with a ronnded iron rod about half an
inch in diameter and a foot long, called a megebo, " distorting rod,"
so that a series of parallel scratches is produced, which causes the
face of the mirror to become convex in the direction at right angles to
the scratches, but to remain straight parallel to the scratches ; in fact
it becomes very slightly cylindrical, the axis of the cylinder being
parallel to the scratches.  This effect is very clearly seen by applying
a straight-edge in different ways to the face of an unpolished mirror
which has received a single set of scratches only.           A series of
scratches is next made with the megebo in a direction of right angles
to the former, a third set intermediate between the two former, and so
on, the mirror each time becoming slightly cylindrical, the axis of the
cylinder in each case being parallel to the line of scratches, so that
eventually the mirror becomes generally convex.           Some workmen
prefer to make the scratches with the megebo in the form of small
spirals, others in the form of large spirals ; but the general principle
of the method employed with their mirrors appears to bo always the
same, — the face of the mirror is scratched with a blunted piece of
iron, and becomes slightly convex, the back, therefore, becoming
concave.
     [Some mirrors were here exhibited : one with its surface
                                                                     flat,
although somewhat rough, just as it came from the mould after
casting ; a second that had received one set of parallel scratches with
the megebo, and which by means of a straight-edge was shown to be
 slightly cylindrical ; and a third, on the face of which the operation
of scratching had been completed, and which was, therefore, slightly
 convex.]                                           "
     After the operation with the " distorting rod the mirror is very
 slightly scraped with a hand scraping-tool to remove the scratches
and to cause the face to present a smooth surface for the subsequent
polishing.
     In the case of thick mirrors the convexity is first made by cutting
                                           "
 with a knife, and the " distorting rod applied afterwards. But in
 connection with this cutting process of thick mirrors there is one very
 interesting point.   If the maker finds on applying from time to time
 the face of the mirror to a hard clay concave pattern, and turning it
 round under a little pressure, that a portion of the surface has not
 been in contact with the pattern, in other words, that he has cut away
this portion too much, then he rubs this spot round and round with
the megebo until he has restored the required degree of convexity.
 Here again, then, scratching on the surface produces convexity.
                                                             "
     Now, why does the scraping of the " distorting rod across the
 face of the mirror leave it convex ? During the operation it is visibly
 concave.   The metal must receive then a kind of " buckle," and spring
 back again so as to become convex when the pressure of the rod is
 removed. It might in such a case reasonably bo expected that the

thicker parts of the mirror would yield less to the pressure of the
rod than the thinner, and so would be made less convex, or even they
might not spring back, on the removal of the rod, and so remain
actually concave.    Again, since we find that scraping the face of the
mirror is the way in which it is made convex, and the back therefore
concave, we might conclude that a deep scratch on the back would
make the back convex and the face slightly concave.         Such a con
cavity, as we have proved, would explain the phenomenon of the
bright line appearing in the reflection of sunlight on the screen which
was observed by Professor Atkinson to correspond with the scratch
on the back.
     After the scratches produced by the megebo are removed, the
mirror is polished with whetstones and then with charcoal. The
face now becomes fairly smooth, but it still generally contains some
few cavities ; these the maker fills up from a stock of copper balls of
various sizes which he has at hand. (It was probably the presence of
these bits of copper that led Ou-tseu-hing to believe that the explana
tion of the cause of the magic mirrors was the inlaying of different
metals.)   The face of the mirror is finally rubbed over with a mer
cury amalgam containing fifty per cent. of tin, by means of a small
straw brush, or with the hand.
    The lecturer then referred to the various metal mixtures employed
by the Japanese in making their mirrors, the best being composed of
75 per cent, of copper, 23 of tin, and 2 per cent. of a natural sulphide
of lead and antimony.
    Although the Japanese have paid no attention to the magic mirror
which has created such interest in Europe, they have in connection
with their priestcraft employed mirrors, on the surface of which, if
looked at very obliquely, could be seen the faces of saints, which
were not in any way connected with the pattern on the back of the
mirror. The accompanying figures represent the front and back of
one of these religious mirrors, about four and one-fifth inches high
and three and a half wide, and which exists at Kamakura, the old
capital of the former Emperor of Japan, the Shegun, in a temple to
which great reverence is paid on account of the supposed supernatural
character of this mirror.     In the polished surface, when looked at
very obliquely, is seen the face of a Buddhist priest, and the back is
ornamented with a moon rising from the sea, a rosary, and a plum
tree.
     The lecturer also exhibited two mirrors of this kind which he had
had made in consequence        of the belief expressed by one of the
Japanese mirror makers, that the phenomenon of the so-called magic
mirrors was produced by chemical action on the surface. But the
result of the experiment had been, that if the face of a mirror which
had been chemically acted on was polished until every trace of the
marks disappeared for direct or oblique vision, then they also dis
appeared in the image produced by reflecting a beam of light on to a
screen, and consequently that it did not seem possible, as far as his

experiments had gone, to produce by means of chemical action on the
surface, a mirror fulfilling all the conditions of a magic mirror.   He
concluded by saying — " It appears, then, contrary to what is generally
believed, that the magic of the Eastern mirror results from no subtle
trick on the part of the maker, from no inlaying of other metals, or
hardening of portions by stamping, but merely arises from the natural
property possessed by certain thin bronze of buckling under a bend
ing stress, so as to remain strained in the opposite direction after the
stress is removed.     And this stress is applied partly by the ' dis
torting rod,' and partly by the subsequent polishing, which, in an
exactly similar way, tends to make the thinner parts more convex than
the thicker."

                        The Story   of the  November    Meteors.
    1As some readers may wish to consult the original investigations referred to
in this lecture, a list of them is given in a postscript at the end.]
          METEOES AS THEY        APPEAR    IN THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE.
When observers band together to watch every quarter of the sky, and
to keep on the look-out through the whole night, the number of
meteors that present themselves is very great.                  In this way it has
been ascertained that upwards of thirty on the average, which are
conspicuous enough to be seen without instruments, come within the
view of the observers stationed at one locality. And it is computed
that telescopic meteors must be about forty or fifty times as numerous
as those visible to the naked eye.
     These results may be obtained from observations made at one
station ; but when concerted observations are carried on at different
stations, several other facts of interest come to light. By simultaneous
observations at distant stations, it has been discovered that the height
of meteors above the surface of the earth usually ranges from 120
down to twenty miles, the average height being about sixty miles ;
that the direction of their flight is towards the earth, either in a
vertical or in a sloping direction ; and that their speed in most cases
lies between thirty and fifty miles a second.
     We thus arrive at the conclusion that visible meteors are phenomena
of our own atmosphere ; and as the atmosphere reaches a height, at
most, of 150 miles, and is, therefore, but a thin film over so vast a
globe as the earth, it is obvious that the spectators at any one place
can see only a very small portion of the meteors which dart about
through all parts of this envelope. After making allowance for this,
we are forced to. conclude that no fewer than 300 millions of these
bodies pass daily into the earth's atmosphere, of whioh about seven
millions and a half are large enough to be seen with the naked eye on
a clear night, and in the absence of the moon.
     From the direction and swiftness of their flight, it is manifest that
meteors are visitors from without.             They plunge into our atmosphere,

and the resistance to which they become then suddenly exposed must
raise them to a temperature which exceeds that of the most intense
furnace. The heat is enough first to melt and then to dissipate in
vapour the most refractory substances, and it only now and then
happens that even a part of a meteor escapes this fate, and reaches
the ground.     They are for the most part lost in vapour ere they get
within several miles of us. The difficulty, indeed, is not to account
for their incandescence, but to see why they do not emit a greater
flood of light where the heat must bo so intense.       And, in fact, they
cannot bo other than very small bodies, or they would be much
brighter.    The average weight of those visible to the unassisted eye
appears to be under an ounce, and the telescopic ones, of course, are
much lighter.
               SPORADIC   METEORS,   AND  METEORIC SHOWERS.
     Meteors may be distributed into two very obvious classes — casual
meteors, which dart irregularly through the sky, and meteoric showers,
which stream into our atmosphere in one definite direction, and at
stated intervals of time. We are concerned at present with the meteoric
showers.    Many such are known to exist, of which the principal are
the August shower, through which the earth passes every year upon
the 9th, 10th, and llth of August; and the great November shower,
which is discharged upon the earth three times in a century. The
November meteors are those about which most is known, and it was
of these, therefore, that the lecture chiefly treated.
                THE REGIONS    FIIOM WHICH METEORS     COME.
     To make their history intelligible, it was necessary to explore, in
some degree, the regions from which they come.          For this purpose a
great diagram was exhibited on a scale rather more than thirty times
the scale of the accompanying woodcut.       Yet, though the diagram was
so large, every hundredth of an inch upon it represented a distance in
nature equal to the interval between the earth and the moon.          The
distance from the earth to the sun on this diagram was a decimeter,
that is, four inches; and, on the same scale, the nearest fixed star
would have to bo placed at a distance of twenty kilometers, or upwards
of  twelve miles.
                 OBBIT OF THE GREAT NOVEMBER SWARM.
     In these vast celestial spaces, there are no rails over the rough
nesses of which the train must be made to rattle, if it is to move at all ;
there are no wheels to bo worn out ; there is no air in which a wind
most be produced, or through which noise will be propagated.          The
music of the spheres is not a sound audible to the ear, and an impedi
ment to motion : it is harmless, it is altogether good, it is the pleasure

of the human mind when it understands the great works of nature.
There is no thundering along through the heavens. All is silence and
peace round the planets as they swiftly glide.       Bodies which sweep
in this way without obstruction through the depths of space, are ready-
to yield at once the due amount of obedience to tho attraction of the
sun. Accordingly each meteor which traverses the elliptic orbit
represented in the diagram, mends its pace so long as it is gliding
along that half of its course in which it is approaching the sun, because
here the sun is drawing it forwards as well as sideways ; and the
forward attraction increases its velocity, while the sideward attraction
bends its path into the oval form.        The meteor takes upwards of
sixteen years to traverse this part of its orbit, and all this time its
velocity is on the increase. It has attained its greatest speed wln 'it it
reaches the point of its orbit which is closest to the sun, near to which
is the place where it crosses the earth's path. As it passes this point
its velocity is twenty-seven miles a second.     The earth moves at the
rate of nineteen miles a second in very nearly the opposite direction,
so that if the meteor happen to strike the earth, the velocity of its
approach is the sum of these two numbers, or forty-six miles a second ;
and it is at this enormous speed that it plunges into our atmosphere.
But if it escape the earth, and continue its course along its orbit, it
loses speed for the next sixteen years, until it passes the farthest part
of its orbit at its slowest pace, which is about a mile and a third
per second.     In each revolution its velocity oscillates betweon these
extremes.    Its orbit is so vast that it takes thirty-three years and a
quarter to get round it.
     Such is a good picturo of the course pursued by each member of
the great November swarm. There are countless myriads of meteors
in this mighty group, each one moving independently of the rest, each
one fulfilling its own destiny.      They form, together, an enormous
stream of meteors, the dense part of which appears to be about 100,000
miles in width, and of immense length.        The orbit along which they
travel was represented on the diagram by an ellipse of 207 centimeters,
or close upon seven feet, long — i. e. by an oval about as long and broad
as the hall-door of a house; and the length, breadth, position, and
motion of the swarm in 1865, before it reached tha earth, would be
represented on the same scale by a thread of the finest sewing silk,
about a foot and a half or two feet long, creeping inwards along the
orbit, the rear of the column having been between the orbits of Jupiter
and Saturn, and the front of it nearly as far in as the earth's orbit.
The actual train which is thus represented was so amazingly long
that even moving at the rate of twenty-seven miles a second, it took
upwards of two years to pass the point where its path crosses the
earth's orbit. The earth passes this point on the morning of the 14th
of November in every year. The head of the dense part of the stream
seems to have reached the samo point early in the year 1866.           Tho
earth was then in a distant part of its orbit, but on the following 14th
of Novembor wo camo round to the place where tho groat stream of

 meteors was pouring across our path.      The earth then passed through
 the swarm, just as you might imagine a speck, too small to be seen by
 the eye, to be carried on the point of a fine needle in a sloping direc
 tion through the thread which represents the meteors.           The earth
 took about five hours to pass through the stream ; and it was Europe,
 Asia, and Africa, which happened at the time to be moving forwards.
 Accordingly it was upon this side of the earth on that occasion, that
 the meteors were poured, and they produced the gorgeous display in
 our atmosphere which many here must remember.          Iii 1867, when we
 came round again to the same place, the stream of meteors was still
 there.   America, this time, chanced to be the part of the globe which
 was turned in the right position to receive the shower.      In 1868, the
 mighty swarm had not passed, and in subsequent years, when wo camo
 round to the proper place, we still found ourselves among outlying
 stragglers of the great procession.
      [The lecturer next attempted to give an outline of the successive
 steps by which the path over which the meteors travel had been deter
 mined, and in doing so had an opportunity of adding other particulars
 to the marvellous history of these bodies.]
                                HtJMBOLDT.
     In 1799 Humboldt was travelling in South America, and on the
morning of the 12th of November in that year the November shower
was poured out over the New World.         Humboldt's description of this
shower seems first to have fixed the attention of scientific men upon
 the subject.   But ho contributed still more to the advance of our
knowledge by the success with which he insisted that nearly all such
phenomena are periodic, and that therefore there is reason to hope
that the causes of them are discoverable. Shortly after, the periodic
character of the August meteors was established ; and when the next
return of the November meteors to the earth took place, when there
was a magnificent display of them exhibited to Europe in 1832, and a
still more impressive spectacle seen in America in the following year,
the attention of scientific men was thoroughly aroused.
                        PROFESSOR    H. A. NEWTON.
     In England, meteors began to be systematically observed, and in
this way all that knowledge about them has been acquired which was
referred to in the beginning of the lecture. In France, the records of
antiquity and the annals of distant nations were ransacked ; and by
this most useful antiquarian search, no less than ten visits of the No
vember swarm, previous to the shower observed by Humboldt in 1799,
have been brought to light.     But the first great step towards gaining
a knowledge of their orbit was made by Professor H. Newton, of New
Haven in America, who published in 1864 two memoirs, in which ho
discussed all the accounts that had been collected, extending back to

44                                   Mr. G.   J.   SUmey                  [Feb. 14,
 the year a.d. 902.    He found by comparing the dates of the old ob
servations with the modern ones, that the phenomenon is one which
recurs three times in a century, or more exactly, that the middle of the
swarm crosses the earth's path at intervals of 33J years. He further
shewed that meteors which thus visit the earth three times in a cen
tury must be moving in one or other of five orbits which he described ;
and that therefore if means could be found for deciding between these
five orbits, the problem would be solved.   The five possible orbits are
— the great oval orbit which we now know the meteors actually do
traverse every 33 years and a quarter ; a nearly circular orbit, very
little larger than the earth's orbit, which they would move round in
a few days more than a year ; another similar orbit in which their
periodic time would be a few days short of a year ; and two other small
oval orbits lying within the earth's orbit.  But we owe even more to
Professor Newton.      He also pointed out how it was possible to ascer
tain which of these orbits is the true one, although the test he indi
cated was one so difficult of application that there was at the time
little hope that any astronomer would attempt it. Fortunately our
own Professor Adams, of Cambridge, was found able to grapple with
the difficulties of the problem, and willing to encounter its immense
labour, and to him we owe the completion of this great discovery.
                                     PROFESSOK ADAMS.
    A comparison of the dates of the successive showers which have
been recorded shows that the point where the path of tho meteors
crosses the earth's orbit is not fixed, but that every time the meteors
come round they strike the earth's orbit at a point which is twenty-
nine minutes       (i.       half
                         e. nearly degree) farther on in the direction
                                         a
in which the earth     travelling. In other words, the meteors do not
                           is
describe exactly the same orbit over and over again their path in one
                                                           :
revolution    not exactly the same as their path in the next revolution,
              is
altheugh very close to it. Thus, their path in a.d. 126 was that which
is represented by the strong oval line in the diagram, but in the seven
teen centuries which had since elapsed,     has gradually shifted round
                                                    it
into the position represented by the dotted ellipse.      This kind of
motion   iswell known to astronomers, and its cause        well known.
                                                                is
It would not happen        the sun were the only body attracting the
                                if
meteors, but arises because the planets also draw them in other direc
tions;  and although the attraction of the planets      very weak com
                                                           is
pared with the immense power of the sun, still they are able to drag
the meteors little out of their course round the sun, and in this way
               a
occasion that shifting round of the orbit of which wo are speaking.
Now, in the case of meteors which are really travelling in the large
orbit, this shifting of the orbit must be due to the attraction of the
planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and the Earth, whilo,         they had
                                                                     if
travelled in any of tho four smaller orbits, the planets that would be
near enough and largo enough to act sensibly upon them would be the

Earth, Venus, and Jupiter.       Accordingly, if anyone could be found
able to calculate how much effect would be produced in each of the
five cases, the calculated amount of shifting of the orbit could be
compared with the observed amount, which is 29' in 33i years, and
this would at once tell which of the five possible orbits is the true
one.
     These papers of Professor Newton's were published in 1864.
Before the computations which he had indicated could bo attempted,
it was necessary that the direction in which the meteors enter the
earth's atmosphere should be known much more accurately than it
then was, in order to enable astronomers to compute the exact forms
and positions of the five possible orbits. This observation then was of
the greatest importance in 1866, and it was on this account that all
the astronomers on that occasion devoted nearly all their efforts to
determining with the utmost precision the exact point of the constel
lation Leo from which the meteors seemed to radiate. This important
direction was ascertained during the great meteoric shower on the
morning of the 14th of November, 1866, and immediately after
Professor Adams and his two assistants in the Cambridge Observatory
set to work at their arduous task.        This great calculation required
the solution of a problem in mechanics which had never before been
attempted,    and involved an immense         amount of tedious labour.
Amidst all these difficulties Professor Adams triumphed; and after
months of toil he was able to announce in the following March that if
the meteors are moving in the large orbit, Jupiter would produce a
shifting of the orbit in each revolution amounting to 20', the attrac
tion of Saturn would add to this 7', Uranus would add 1' ; the effect
of the earth and the other planets would be insensible. Adding these
numbers together, the whole effect, according to Mr. Adams's compu
tation, is 28', almost exactly the same as the observed amount which
had been determined by Professor Newton, which was 29'.         But if the
meteors were in any of the other four possible orbits, the total amount
would never exceed 12'. Here, then, we have reached the final result :
the long orbit is the orbit of the meteors.     This great discovery was
published in March, 1867.
                         PROFESSOR    SOHIAPPAEELLI.
     Meanwhile Signer Schiapparelli, of Milan, was labouring in
another direction.     It was evident from the observations that the
meteors   were  drawn   out into a long stream.    What was the cause of
this ? Signer Schiapparelli pointed out that if a cloud of meteors
were started under conditions which were not quite the same, each
meteor would pursue its own orbit, which would differ from the
others.   If they were treated almost exactly, although not quite, alike
at starting, their various orbits would lie excessively close to one
another, and would be undistinguishable in most respects.         But if
there be any effect which goes on accumulating from revolution to

46                            Mr. 0.   J. Stmey                     [Feb. 14,
revolution, such an effect would in the end become very sensible.
And such an effect there is. The periodic times differ a little in these
different orbits.     At the end of the first revolution those meteors
which have the longest periodic times are the last to get back to tho
starting point, and have therefore already fallen a little into the rear
of the group, while those with the shortest periodic time have gone a
little ahead.    At the end of the second revolution the separation is
doubled, and in each successive revolution the column is still more
lengthened out. After a sufficient number of revolutions it will be
spread out over the whole length of the orbit, and form a complete
oval ring.     This has not yet happened to the November meteors, and
we are thus assured that it cannot be any enormous period, speaking
cosmically, since the time when they first started on their present
path. On the other hand tho August meteors, which have returned
punctually every year since they were first observed, are probably a
complete ring, and are at all events of far greater antiquity than the
November meteors.        But they are also, as might be expected, more
scattered, so that the sprinkling of meteors they discharge upon the
earth as it passes through them has nothing like the splendour of the
great November shower. Signor Schiapparelli also pointed out that
there is a comet moving in the track of the August meteors, and
another in the track of the November meteors.           We shall presently
see the significance of this observation.
                              M.  LE  VEUR1EU.
      The next great step was made by M. Le Vorrier, the late Director
of   the  Paris Observatory.     Acting on the suggestion made by Sig.
Schiapparelli, M. Le Verrier pointed out that the orbit of the meteors
intersects the orbit of Uranus, as represented in the diagram.         From
its inclined position it does not intersect the path of any of the inter
mediate planets Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars.             M. Le Verrier also
calculated back the epochs at which the planet and the meteors were
at the point of intersection, and found that early in the year a.d. 126
they were both at that spot, but that this has not happened since.
Taking this in conjunction with what Sig. Schiapparelli pointed out,
 we seem to have a clue to a truly wonderful post history.        All would
be explained    if we may suppose   that  before the  year 126, the  meteors
had been moving beyond the solar system ; and that in that year they
chanced to cross the path of the planet Uranus, travelling along some
such path as that represented in the diagram.          Had it not been for
the planet they would have kept on tho course marked out with a
dotted line, and after having passed the sun, would have withdrawn
on the other side into the depths of space, to the same measureless
distance from which they had originally come.          But their stumbling
on the planet changed their whole destiny.           Even so great a planet
would not sensibly affect them until they got within a distance, which
would look very short indeed upon our diagram.           But they seem to

have almost grazed his surface, and while they were very close to such
a planet, he would be able to drag them quite out of their former
course.    This the planet Uranus seems to have done, and when, pur
suing his own course, he again got too far off to influence them
sensibly, they found themselves moving slowly backwards, and slowly
inwards ; and accordingly began the new orbit round the sun, which
corresponds   to the situation into which they had been brought, and
the direction and moderate speed of their new motion.
    They seem to have passed Uranus while they were still a small
compact cluster.    Nevertheless those members of the group which
happened to be next the planet as they swept past, would be attracted
with somewhat more force than the rest, the farthest members of the
group with the least.    The result of this must inevitably have been
that when the group were soon after abandoned to themselves, they
did not find themselves so closely compacted as before, nor moving
with an absolutely identical motion, but with motions which differed,
although perhaps very little, from one another.     These are conditions
which would have started them in those slightly differing orbits
round the sun, which, as we have seen, would cause them, as time wore
on, to be drawn out into the long stream in which we now, after
seventeen centuries, find them.
    What is hero certain         is,
                               that there was     definite time when the

meteors entered upon the path they are now pursuing — that this time
was the end of February or beginning of March in the year 126         still  is
a matter of probability only. It is, however, highly probable, because
it explains all the phenomena at present known but astronomers are

   Another episode in the eventful history of these meteors   also known
                                                                       is
with considerable probability.     It has been already mentioned that             a
comet     travelling along the same path as the meteors. It
         is                                                     moving ais
very little slower than they, and      at present just at the head of the

procession which they make through space. Another comet         similarly
                                                                        is
moving in the track of the great elliptic ring of August meteors.      In
1867, the lecturer ventured to suggest an important function which
these comets seem to have discharged.       Picture to yourselves    mass    a
of gas before      became connected with the solar system, travelling
                  it
through space at      distance from the sun or any other star.

would now and then pass in various directions, and with various velo
cities through its substance.   For the most part they would go entirely'
through and pass out again ; but in every such case the meteor would
leave the comet with less velocity than it had when approaching it.
And in some cases this reduced velocity would be such that the future
path of the meteor would be an ellipse round the comet.          Whenever
this was once brought to pass, the meteor would inevitably return
again and again to the comet, each time passing through some part of
its substance, and at every passage losing speed.         After each loss of
speed the ellipse it would next proceed to describe would be smaller
than the one before, until at last the meteor would sink entirely into
the gas and be engulfed by it. In this way meteor after meteor would
settle down through the comet, and, in the end, just such a cluster
would be formed as came across the planet Uranus in the year 126,
or, if sucb a cluster existed originally within the mass of gas, it would
in this way be augmented. As the comet swept past the planet, its
outlying parts would seem to have grazed his surface, and in this way
the gas was probably somewhat more retarded than the meteors ; and
in the centuries which have since elapsed the meteors have gone so
much ahead of the comet that they are now treading on his heels and
on the point of overtaking him, while probably the gas has again
brought together a smaller cluster of the meteors.
                           PROFESSOR GRAHAM.
     The question now arises, How the deserts of space which extend
from star to star come to be tenanted here and there by a patch of
gas or an occasional meteorite ?     Light has been thrown on this in
quiry by discoveries made with the spectroscope in modern times and
by observations during eclipses. These have revealed to us the fact
that violent outbursts occur upon the sun, and doubtless on other
stars, so swift that the up-rush must sometimes carry matter clear
away into outer space.      Imagine such a mass consisting in part of
fixed gas and in part of condensable vapours ejected from some star.
As it travels forward the vapours cool into meteorites, while the fixed
gas spreads abroad like a great not, to entangle other meteors.          In
some cases both might travel together ; in others the gaseous portion
would be retarded before it passed beyond the neighbourhood of the
star, and tho denser meteors would get ahead.           But even so in the
lapse  of ages  other meteors   would    be  caught, so that in any event a
cluster would at length be formed. Now, the reasonable suspicion
that this is the real origin of meteors has received striking confirma
tion from the discovery of the late Professor Graham, that meteoric
iron contains so much hydrogen occluded within it as indicates that
the iron had cooled from a high temperature in a dense atmosphere of
hydrogen — precisely the conditions under which the vapour of iron
would cool down while escaping from a large class of stars, including
our sun.

                              RECAPITULATION.
    We have now traced an outline of the marvellous history of these
Arabs of the sky. We have met with outbursts upon stars sometimes
of sufficient violence to shoot off part of their substance. We have
found the gaseous portion sweeping through space like a net, and the
vapours that accompanied it condensed into spatters that have consoli
dated into meteorites. We have seen this system travelling through
boundless space, with nothing near it except an occasional solitary
meteor, and we have seen it in the long lapse of ages slowly augment
ing its cluster of these little strangers. As it wandered on it passed
within the far-spreading reach of the sun's attraction, and perhaps has
since been millions of years in descending towards him.      Its natural
course would have been to have glided round him in a curve, and to
have then withdrawn to the same vast abyss from which it had come ;
but in attempting this, it became entangled with one of the planets,
which dragged it out of its course and then flung it aside. Immedi
ately, it entered upon the new course assigned to          it,
                                                       which     has been

pursuing ever since. After passing the planet the different members
of the group found themselves in paths very close to one another, but
not absolutely the same. These orbits differed from one another very
slightly in all respects, and amongst others in the time which       body
                                                                       a
takes to travel round them.     Those meteors which got round soonest
found themselves, after the first revolution, at the head of the group     ;
those which moved slowest fell into the rear, and the comet was the
last of all. Each succeeding revolution lengthened out the column,
and the comet soon separated from the rest. Fifty-two revolutions
have now taken place, and the little cloud has crept out into an
extended stream, stretching       long way round the orbit, while the
                                   a
comet has fallen the greater part of        revolution behind.

will have doubled its length, and that ultimately       will form com

be then so scattered that the display will be far less imposing than       it
now is.

cross the path of the earth. There are several of these streams, and
no doubt the story of every one of them        quite as strange. And
                                                  is                       if
there are several streams of meteors, which come across that little line
in space which constitutes the earth's orbit, what untold multitudes
of them must be within the whole length and breadth of the solar
system   !  Perhaps  it may even turn out that the mysterious zodiacal
light which attends the sun,       due to countless hordes of these little
                                   is
bodies flying in all directions through the space that lies within the
earth's orbit.

" AFTER had made the discovery of            the marine acid air, which the
vapour of spirit of salt may properly        enough be called, it occurred to
me that, by a process similar to that by which this acid air is expelled
from the spirit of salt, an alkaline air might be expelled from sub
stances containing the volatile alkali.   Accordingly          I
                                                         procured some
volatile spirit of sal-ammoniac, and having put it into a thin phial
and heated it with the flame of a candle,          I
                                                presently found that a
great quantity of vapour was discharged from             it,
                                                    and being received
intoa   basin of quicksilver    continued in the form of
                               it                           transparent
                                                                    a
and permanent air, not at all condensed by cold."  These words, written
by Joseph Priestley rather more than one hundred years ago, describe
the experiment by which ammonia was first obtained in the gaseous
state.
     Unacquainted with the composition of this alkaline air, Priestley
showed that      increased in volume when electric sparks are passed
                 it
through   it,or when the alkaline air (ammonia)      heated the residue

    Berthollet, in 1785, proved that this increase in bulk    due to theis
decomposition of ammonia into nitrogen and hydrogen, whilst Henry
and Davy ascertained that two volumes of ammonia are resolved into
one volume of nitrogen and three volumes of hydrogen.
     The early history of sal-ammoniac and of ammonia      very obscure.
                                                                   is
The salt appears to have been brought into Europe from Asia in the
seventh century, probably from volcanic sources.     An artificial mode
of producing the ammoniacal salts from decomposing animal matter
was soon discovered, and the early alchemists were well acquainted
with the carbonate under the name of spiritus salts urinte.     In later
times sal-ammoniac was obtained from Egypt, where          was prepared
                                                               it
by collecting the sublimate obtained by burning camels' dung.
    Although we are constantly surrounded by an atmosphere of
nitrogen, chemists have not yet succeeded in inducing this inert sub
stance to combine readily, so that wo are still dependant for our
supply of combined nitrogen, whether as nitric acid or ammonia, upon
the decomposition of the nitrogenous constituents of the bodies of
plants and animals. This may bo effected either by natural decay,

     To these bodies the names of methylamine, di-methylamine, and
 tri-methylamine were given.         They resemble ammonia in being
volatile alkaline liquids or gasea, which combine with acids to form
crystalline and well-defined salts.
     Hitherto these compound ammonias have been chemical curiosities ;
they have, however, recently become, as has so often been the case in
 other instances, of great commercial importance, and are now manu
factured on a large scale.
     We are all well aware that the French beet-root sugar industry is
one of great magnitude, and that it has been largely extended in late
years.     In this industry, as in the manufacture of cane sugar, large
quantities of molasses or treacle remain behind after the whole of the
 crystallizable sugar has been withdrawn.        These molasses aro in
variably employed to yield alcohol by fermentation. The juice of
the beet, as well as that of cane sugar, contains, in addition to the
sugar, a large quantity of extractive and nitrogenous matters, together
with considerable quantities of alkaline salts.       In some sugar-pro
ducing districts the waste-liquors or spent-wash from the stills —
called vinasses in French — are wastefully and ignorantly thrown away,
instead of being returned to the land as a fertilizer, and thus the soil
becomes impoverished.       In France it has long been the custom of the
distiller to evaporate these liquors (vinasses) to dryness, and to calcine
 the mass in a reverberatory furnace, thus destroying the whole of the
organic matter, but recovering the alkaline salts of the beet-root. In
this way 2000 tons of carbonate of potash are annually produced in
the French distilleries.      For more than thirty years the idea has
been entertained of collecting the ammonia-water, tar, and oils which
are given off when this organic matter is calcined, but the practical
realization of the project has only quite recently been accomplished,
and a most unexpected new field of chemical industry thus opened
out, through the persevering and sagacious labours of M. Camille
Vincent, of Paris.
     The following is an outline of the process as carried out at the
large distillery of Messrs. Tilloy, Delaune, and Co., at Courrieres.
The spent-wash having been evaporated until it has attained a specific
gravity of 1-31, is allowed to run into cast-iron retorts, in which it is
submitted to dry distillation.      This process lasts four hours; the
volatile products pass over, whilst a residue of porous charcoal and
alkaline salts remains behind in the retort. The gaseous products
given off during the distillation are passed through coolers, in order
to condense all the portions which are liquid or solid at the ordinary
temperature,     and the combustible gases pass on uncondensed        and
serve as fuel for heating the retorts.
     The liquid portion of the distillate is a very complex mixture of
chemical compounds, resembling in this respect the corresponding
product in the manufacture of coal gas. Like this latter, the liquid
distillate from the spent-wash may be divided into
              1. The ammonia- water.
              2.  The tar.

54                            Professor Boscoe                  [Feb. 21,
     The ammonia-water of the vinasso resembles that of the coal-gas
manufacture in so far as it contains carbonate, sulphydrate, and
hydrocyanide of ammonia ; but it differs from this (and approximates
to the products of the dry distillation of wood) by containing in
addition methyl alcohol, methyl sulphide, methyl cyanide, many of
the members of the fatty acid series, and, most remarkable of all,
large quantities of the salts of trimethylamine.
     The tar, on re-distillation, yields more ammonia-water, a large
number of oils, the alkaloids of the pyridene series, solid hydro
carbons, carbolic acid, and lastly, a pitch of fine quality.
     The crude alkaline aqueous distillate is first neutralized by
 sulphuric acid, and the saline solution evaporated, when crystals of
sulphate of ammonia are deposited ; and these, after separating and
draining off, leave a mother liquor, which contains the more soluble
sulphate of trimethylamine.         During the process of concentration,
vapours of methyl alcohol, methyl cyanide, and other nitrils are given
off, these being condensed, and the cyanide used for the preparation
of ammonia and acetic acid by decomposing it with an alkali.
     Trimethylamine itself is at present of no commercial value, though
 perhaps the time is not far distant when an important uso for this
 substance will be found.     The question arises as to how this material
 can be made to yield substances capable of ready employment in the
arts. This problem has been solvod by M. Vincent in a most inge
nious way. He finds that the hydrochlorate of trimethylamine, when
heated to a temperature of 260°, decomposes into (1) ammonia, (2)
free trimethylamine, and (3) chloride of methyl.
                   3 NM03HCl =    2 NMe,   + NH, + 3 MeCl.
     By bubbling the vapours through hydrochloric acid the alkaline
 gases are retained, and the gaseous chloride of methyl passes on to be
 purified by washing with dilute caustic soda and drying with strong
 sulphuric acid. This is then collected in a gas-helder, whence it is
 pumped into strong receivers and condensed.
      The construction of these receivers is shown in Fig. 1. They
 consist of strong wrought-iron cylinders, tested to resist a pressure of
 20 kilos, per square centimetre, and containing 50, 110, 220 kilos,
 chloride of methyl.     The liquid is drawn from these receivers by
 opening the screw tap D, which is covered by a cap C, to prevent
 injury during transit.
      Both ammonia and chloride of methyl are, however, substances
 possessing a considerable commercial value. The latter compound
 has up to this time, indeed, not been obtained in large quantities, but
 it can be employed for two distinct purposes : (1) it serves as a means
 of producing artificial cold; (2) it is most valuable for preparing
 methylated dyes, which are at present costly, inasmuch as they have
 hitherto been obtained by the use of methyl iodide, an expensive
 substance.

 much more in acetic acid (40 volumes), and in alcohol (35 volumes).

     without danger.

           From those numbers we must of course subtract 1 to obtain the
     pressure    which tho vapour exerts on tho containing vessel.
           As a means of producing low temperatures chloride of methyl will
     prove of great service both in tho laboratory and on a larger in
     dustrial scale. When the liquid is allowed to escape from the receiver
     into an open vessel, it begins to boil, and in a few moments the tem
     perature of the liquid is lowered by the ebullition below —23°, the
     boiling point of the chloride.        The liquid then remains for a length
     of time in a quiescent state, and may be used as a freezing agent.
     By increasing the rapidity of tho evaporation by means of a current
     of air blown through tho liquid, or better by placing the liquid in
     connection with a good air-pump, the temperature of the liquid can in
     a few moments bo reduced to — 55°, and large masses of mercury
     easily solidified. The construction of a small freezing machine em
     ployed by M. Camille Vincent is shown in Fig. 2. It consists of a
     double-cased    copper vessel, between the two casings of which the
     methyl chloride (A) is introduced.          The central space (M) is filled
     with some liquid such as alcohol, incapable of solidification.           The
     chloride of methyl is allowed to enter from the cylindrical reservoir
     by the screw tap (B) and the screw (S) left open to permit of the
     escape of the gas.        As soon as the whole mass of liquid has been
     reduced to a temperature of — 23°, ebullition ceases, the screw
                                                                               (S)
     may be replaced, and if a temperature lower than — 23° be required,
     the tube (B) placed in connection with a good air-pump.              By this
     simple means a litre of alcohol can be kept for several hours at tem
     peratures either of — 23° or — 65°, and thus a large number of ex
     periments can be performed for which hitherto the expensive liquid
     nitrous oxide or solid carbonic acid was required.
           M. Vincent has recently constructed a much larger and more
     perfect and continuous form of freezing machine, in which by means
     f if an air-pump and a forcing pump the chloride of methyl is evaporated
     in the freezing machine and again condensed in the cylinders.            This
     rmlargod form of apparatus will probably compete favourably with the

be simply constructed, and as the vapour and liquid do not attack
metal and are non-poisonous, and as the frigorific effects which it
is capable of producing are most energetic.
    The second and perhaps more important application of methyl
chloride is to the manufacture of methylated colours.
    It is well known that rosaniline or aniline-red, C20H19N3, yields
compounds    possessing a fine blue, violet, or green colour, when a
                                  FIG. 2.
portion of the hydrogen has been replaced by the radicals methyl or
ethyl, and the larger the proportion of hydrogen replaced the deeper
is the shade of violet which is produced.            Thus we have triethyl
rosaniline or Hofmann's* violet, C20H16(C2H5)3N3.
    By replacing one or two atoms of the hydrogen of aniline by
methyl and by oxidizing the methyl anilines thus obtained, Charles
Lauth obtained fine violet colours, whilst about the same time
Hofmann observed the production of a bright green colouring matter,

now known as iodine green, formed daring the manufacture of the
violet, and produced from tho latter colour by the action of mothyl
iodide.
     In order to prepare aniline green from the pure chloride of
methyl, a solution of methyl-aniline violet in methyl alcohol is
placed in an iron digester and the liquid rendered alkaline by caustic
soda.    Having closed the digester, a given quantity of liquid chloride
of methyl is introduced by opening a tap, and the digester thus charged
is placed in a water bath and heated by a jet of steam, until the
temperature reaches 95°, and the indicated pressure amounts to from
4 to 5 atmospheres.      As soon as the reaction is complete, the hot
water is replaced by cold, and the internal pressure reduced by
opening the screw tap of the digester. The product of this reaction
heated and filtered, yields the soluble and colourless base, whose salts
are green.    To the acidulated solution a zinc salt is added to form a
double salt, and the green compound is then precipitated by the
addition of common salt. By adding ammonia to a solution of the
 green salt, a colourless liquid is obtained, in which cloth mordanted
with tannic acid and tartar emetic becomes dyed of a splendid green.
      If rosaniline be substituted for methyl aniline in the preceding
reaction Hofmann's violet is obtained.       The application of methyl
chloride to the preparation of violets and greens     is,
                                                       however,  itmust
 be remembered, not due to M. Vincent;       it  has been practised for
 some years by aniline-colour makers.        M. Vincent's merit    is  in
 establishing   a  cheap method by which perfectly pure chloride of
methyl can be obtained, and thus rendering the processes of the
manufacture of colours much more certain than they have been
hitherto.
     The production of methyl violet from di-methyl aniline, may bo
 easily shown by heating this body with     a  small quantity of chloral
 hydrate, and then introducing some copper turnings into tho hot
 liquid. On pouring the mixture into alcohol, the violet colour is
well   seen.
      In
      reviewing this new chemical industry of the beet-root vinasses,
one cannot help being struck by the knowledge and ability which
have been so successfully expended by M. Camillo Vincent on the
working out of the processes.
   Here again we have another instance of the utilization of waste
chemical products and of the preparation on      large scale of com
                                                  a
pounds hitherto known only as chemical rarities.
   All those interested in scientific research must congratulate
M. Camillo Vincent on this most successful issue of his labours.

        Recent   Contributions to the History   of Detonating   Agents.
Among the many explosive preparations which have during the last
thirty years been proposed as substitutes for gunpowder, on account
of greater violenco and other special merits claimed for them, not one
has yet competed with it successfully as a propelling agent, nor even
as a safe and sufficiently reliable explosive agent for use in shells ;
for industrial applications and for very important military or naval
uses, dependent upon the destructive effects of explosives, it has had,
however, to give place, to a very important extent, and in some instances
altogether, to preparations of gun'cotton and nitro-glycerine.
     But there appeared little prospect that either gun-cotton or nitro
glycerine, whether used in their most simple condition or in the forms
of various preparations, would assume positions of practical impor
tance as explosive agents of reliable, and therefore uniformly efficient,
character, until the system of developing their explosive force through
the agency of a detonation, instead of through the simple agency of
heat, was elaborated.
    Before the first step in this important advance in the application
of explosivo  agents was made by Alfred Nobel, about twelve years ago,
the very variable behaviour of such substances as gun-cotton and
nitro-glycerine, when exposed to the heat necessary for their ignition
under comparatively slight modifications of attendant conditions          (e.   g.
as regards the completeness and strength of confinement or the
position of the source of heat with reference to the main mass of the
material to be exploded) rendered them uncertain in their action, and
at any rate, only applicable under circumstances which confined their
usefulness within narrow limits. The employment by Nobel of an
initiative detonation, produced by the ignition of small quantities of
mercuric fulminate or other powerful detonating substances, strongly
confined, for developing the violent explosion, or detonation, of nitro
 glycerine, opened    new field for tho study of explosive substances,
                       a
 and the first practical fruit was the successful application of plastic
 preparations of nitro-glycerine and of compact forms of compressed
 gun-cotton, with simplicity and certainty, to the production of destruc

tive effects much more considerable than could be accomplished
through the agency of much larger amounts of gunpowder, applied
under the most favourable conditions.      Whereas very strong confine
ment has been essential for the complete explosion of these substances,
so long as the only known means of bringing about thefr explosion
consisted simply of the application of fire or sufficient heat, no
confinement whatever is needed for the development, with certainty, of
a decidedly more violent explosive action than they are capable of
exerting when thus applied, if they are detonated by submitting some
small portion of the mass to the blow or concussion developed by a
sharp detonation, such as is produced by the ignition of a small
quantity of strongly confined mercuric fulminate.
     The conditions essential to the development of detonation in
masses of nitro-glycerine and gun-cotton, or preparations of them, and
the relations to and behaviour towards each other of these and other
explosive bodies, in their character or functions as detonating agents,
have been made the subject of study by the lecturer during the last
ten years, and some of the earlier results published by him in con
nection with this subject also led to the pursuit of experimental
inquiries of analogous character by Champion and Pellet and others.
     Some of the chief results attained by Mr. Abel's experiments may
be briefly summarized.
     It was found that the susceptibility to detonation, as distinguished
from explosion, through the agency of an initiative detonation, is not
confined to gun-cotton, nitro-glycerine, and preparations containing
those substances, but that it is shared, though in very different
degrees, by all explosive compounds and mixtures.
      It was demonstrated that the detonation of nitro-glycerine and
 other bodies, through the agency of an initiative detonation, is not
 ascribable simply to the direct operation of the heat developed by the
chemical changes of the charge of detonating material, and that the
remarkable property possessed by the sudden explosion of small
quantities of certain bodies (the mercuric and silver fulminates) to
accomplish the detonation of nitro-glycerine          and gun-cotton, is
accounted for satisfactorily by the mechanical force thus suddenly
brought to bear upon some part of the mass operated upon. Most
 generally, therefore, the degree of facility with which the detonation
 of a substance will develop similar change in a neighbouring explosive
 substance, may bo regarded as proportionate to the amount of force
 developed idthin the shortest period of time by that detonation, the
 latter being in fact analogous in its operation to that of a blow from a
 hammer or of the impact of a projectile.
      Thus, explosive substances      which are inferior to mercuric
 fulminate in the suddenness, and the consequent momentary violence
 of their detonation, cannot be relied upon to effect the detonation of
 gun-cotton, even when used in comparatively considerable quantities.
 Percussion cap composition, for example, which is a mixture of
 fulminate with potassium chlorate, and is therefore much less rapid

64                             Professor Abel                  [March 21,
in its action than the pure fulminate, must      be used in comparatively
large quantities to accomplish the detonation of gun-cotton.
     The essential difference between an explosion and what we now
distinguish as a detonation lies in the comparative suddenness of the
transformation of the solid or liquid explosive substance into gas and
vapour.
     The gradual nature of the explosion of gunpowder is illustrated,
in its extreme, by burning a train of powder in open air ; the rapidity
and consequent violence of the explosion is increased in proportion to
the degree of confinement of the exploding charge, or to the resistance
opposed to the escape or expansion of the gases generated upon the
first ignition of the confined substance.  In proportion as the pressure
is increased under which the progressive transformation of the ex
plosive takes place, the rapidity with which its particles are succes
sively subjected to the action of heat is increased.
     In the case of a very much more sensitive and rapidly explosive
substance than gunpowder, such as mercuric fulminate, the increase
in the rapidity of its transformation, by strong confinement, is so
great that the explosion assumes the character of a detonation in
regard to suddenness and consequent destructive effect.      A still more
sensitive and rapidly explosive material (such as the silver fulminate
and iodide of nitrogen) produces when exploded in open air effects
akin to those of detonation ; yet even with these bodies, confinement
operates in increasing the rapidity of the explosive to suddenness,
and consequently in developing a more purely detonative action.
Thus, the violence of explosion of silver fulminate is decidedly in
creased by confining the substance in a stout metal case, and the
enclosure of iodide of nitrogen in a shell of plaster of paris has a
similar effect. With chloride of nitrogen, the suddenness of detona
tion, and consequently the violence of action, was found to be very
greatly increased even by confining the liquid beneath a thin layer
of water.
     Detonation, developed in some portion of a mass, is transmitted
with a velocity approaching instantaneousness througheut any quan
tity, and even if the material is laid out in the open air in long trains
composed of small musses.         The velocity with which detonation
travels along trains thirty or forty feet in length, composed of distinct
masses of gun-cotton and of dynamite, has been determined by means
of Noble's chronoscope, and was found to range from 17,000 to 24,000
feet per second. Even when trains of these explosive agents were laid
out with intervening spaces of half an inch between the individual
masses composing the trains, detonation was still transmitted along
the separated masses with great though diminished velocity.
     The suddenness with which detonation takes place has been
applied as a very simple means of breaking up shells into small
fragments and scattering these with considerable violence, with em
ployment of very small charges of explosive agent.        Thus by filling
a 16-pr. common     shell completely  with water  and  inserting a charge

1879.]                 on Recent Detonating Agents.                     65
of   \   oz. of gun-cotton fitted to a detonating fuze, the shell being
thoroughly closed by means of a screw plug, the force developed
by the detonation of the small charge of gun-cotton is transmitted
instantaneously     in all directions by the water, and the shell
is thus broken up into a number of fragments averaging fourteen
times the number produced by bursting a shell of the same size by
means of the full amount of powder which it will contain (13 oz.).
Employing 1 oz. of powder, in place of     \    oz. of gun-cotton, in the
shell filled with water, the comparatively very gradual explosion
of the powder charge is rendered evident by the result; the shell
being broken up into less than twenty fragments by the shock
produced by the first ignition of the charge, transmitted by the
water. In this case the shell is broken up by the minimum amount
of force necessary for the purpose, before the explosive force of the
powder charge is properly developed. Extensive comparative experi
ments carried on not long since by the Royal Artillery, at Oke-
hampton, demonstrated that this simple expedient of filling common
shells with water and attaching a small charge of gun-cotton with
 its detonator to the fuze usually employed, allowed of their appli
cation as efficient substitutes for the comparatively complicated and
costly shrapnel and segment shells.
      Another illustration of the sharpness of action developed by
detonation as compared with explosion, consequent upon the almost
 instantaneous character of the metamorphosis which the explosive
 agent undergoes in the case of detonation, is afforded by a method
 which the lecturer applied some years since for comparing the violence
 of action of charges of gun-cotton and of dynamite arranged in
 different ways.     The charges (5 Ib.) to be detonated were freely
 suspended over the centres of plates of very soft steel of the best
 quality, which rested upon the flat face of a massive block, or anvil,
 of iron, having a large central circular cavity. The distance between
 the upper surface of the plate and the charge suspended over     it, was
4    feet.   The sharp blow delivered upon the plate by the air
 suddenly projected against it   by the force of the detonation when the
 charge was fired, forced the metal down into the cavity of the anvil,
 producing cup-shaped indentations, the dimensions of which afforded
 means of comparing the violence of the detonation.      A    much larger
 charge of powder exploded in actual contact with the plate, would
 produce no alteration of form in the metal, and the same negative
 result would be furnished by the explosion over the plate of heap of
                                                              a
 loose gun-cotton of the same or greater weight than the charges
 detonated.     The above method of experiment was devised, in the first
 instance by Mr. Abel, in July 1875, for comparing the quality of some
  specimens of Llandore steel proposed to be used by the Admiralty
 for ship-building purposes, with samples of malleable iron, and   it has
  since been employed by Mr. Adamson in carrying out      a   very useful
  series of experiments, recently communicated to the Iron and Steel
 Institute.

    66                           Professor Abel                  [March 21,
        It  has been stated  that detonation can be transmitted from one
    mass   of gun-cotton or dynamite to another through intervening air
    spaces. The extent to which such spaces can be introduced without
    checking detonation is obviously regulated by the size of the masses
    of explosive detonated ; but the distances of air-space through which
    the detonation of a moderate quantity of the explosive agent will
    communicate to similar masses, are very limited, a space of 2 inches
    being sufficient to prevent the detonation produced by a mass of
    8 oz.   of gun-cotton, freely exposed, from communicating to con
    tiguous ones.   If the dispersion of the force is prevented in part, and
   direction is given to the gases violently projected from the centre of
   detonation, the power of transmitting detonation to separated masses
   of explosive is increased to a remarkable degree.        This is readily
   accomplished through the agency of tubes, the charge first detonated
   being just inserted into one extremity, while that to which the
   detonation is to be transmitted is inserted into the other ; or separate
   charges may be placed at different distances inside a long tube, with
   long intervening spaces, tho initiative charge being inserted at one
   end.    A few illustrations of the results thus obtained may be given.
   The detonation of a 1-oz. disk of gun-cotton in open air will not
   transmit detonation with certainty to other disks placed at a greater
   distance than half an inch from it ; but if it be just inserted into one
  end of an iron tube 2 feet long and 1•25 inch in diameter, a
   similar disk, or even a plng of loose gun-cotton inserted into
  the other extremity of the tube, will invariably be detonnted.
  With employment of 2 oz. of gun-cotton, in a tube of the same
  material, thickness, and diameter, detonation was transmitted to a
  distance of 5 feet.     In tubes of the same kind, of very considerable
  length, 2-oz. disks of gun-cotton placed at intervals of 2 feet,
  were detonated through the initiative detonation of one such disk
  inserted into one extremity of the tube.     In other experiments a long
  tube of this kind was fitted with branch pipes, 2 feet long, at these
  parts where the intermediate disks were placed, and charges of
 gun-cotton were placed at the extremities of these pipes. By the
 initiative detonation of 1 oz. of gun - cotton all the charges were
 detonated, the effect on the air being that of one single explosion.
 The results obtained with equal quantities of gun-cotton varied with
 the diameter, strength, and nature of the material of the tubes used.
 Dynamite and mercuric fulminate, applied to their own detonation,
 furnished results quite analogous to these obtained with gun-cotton ;
 but in applying fulminate to the detonation of gun-cotton through
 the agency of tubes, some singular and instructive results were
 obtained, for an account of which the lecturer referred to his Memoir
on this subject.
       Silver fulminate was employed for the purpose of instituting
more precise experiments than could be made in operating on a
larger scale, with gun-cotton, on the influence of the material com
 posing' the tubes, of the condition of their inner surfaces, and of

1879.]                    on Becent Detonating Agentt.                 67
other variable circumstances, upon the transmission of detonation.
Half a grain of silver fulminate freely exposed and ignited by a
heated body, will transmit detonation to some of the compound placed
at a distance of 3 inches from it, but does not do so with certainty
through a distance of 4 inches.          But when the quantity of the
fulminate is just inserted into one end of a stout glass tube 0'5 inch
in diameter, and 3 feet long, its detonation is invariably induced
by that of a similar quantity of the fulminate placed just inside the
other extremity of the tube ; this result is uncertain when the
length of the tubes of the same thickness and diameter exceeds
3 feet 3 inches.    Glass tubes were found to transmit the detonation
of silver fulminate much more rapidly than tubes of several other
materials of the same diameter and thickness of substance.         Thus,
with the employment of double the quantity of fulminate required to
transmit the detonation with certainty through a glass tube of the
kind described, 3 feet in length, it was only possible to obtain a
similar result through a pewter tube 31*5 inches long, a brass tube
23-7 inches long, an indiarnbber tube 15-8 inches long, and a paper
tube 1 1 • 8 inches long.    The difference in the results obtained was
not ascribable to a difference in the escape of force on the instant of
detonation, in consequence of the fracture of the tube, nor to the
expenditure of force in work done upon the tube at the seat of deto
nation, since the glass tubes were always destroyed by the first explo
sion to a much greater distance along their length than any of the
others, and the brass tubes, which were in no way injured at the seat
of the explosion, did not transmit detonation to so great a distance as
the pewter tubes, which were always deeply indented. The trans
mission of detonation appeared also not to be favoured by the
sonorosity or the pitch of the tube employed, as the sonorous brass
tube was not found to favour the transmission to the same extent as
the pewter tube.      Moreover the transmission of detonation by the
glass  tubes  was not found to be at all affected by coating these tubes
with several layers of paper, or by encasing them in tightly fitting
indiarubber tubes.     These differences appeared on further investiga
tion not to be ascribable, to any important extent, if at all, to the
difference in the nature of the material composing the tubes, but to be
simply, or at any rate almost entirely, due to differences in the
condition of the inner surfaces of the tubes.      Thus, brass tubes, the
inner surfaces of which were highly polished, and paper tubes, when
coated inside with highly glazed paper, transmitted the detonation of
the silver fulminate to about the same distance as the glass tubes ; on
the other hand, when the inner surfaces of the latter were slightly
roughened by coating them with a film of fine powder, such as French
chalk, they no longer transmitted detonation to anything like the
distance which they did when the inner surfaces were in the normally
smooth condition.      Other very slight obstacles to the unimpeded
passage of the gas wave through the tubes were found greatly to
reduce the facility with which detonation could be transmitted by
                                                              F 2

 68                            Professor Abel                 [March 21,
 means   of tubes ; thus, when a diaphragm of thin bibulous paper was
 inserted into the glass tube about half-way between the two extremities,
 detonation was not transmitted, even with the employment of about
 six times the quantity of fulminate that gave the result with certainty
 under ordinary conditions ; and similarly the transmission of deto
 nation by increased charges of mercuric fulminate and of gun-cotton
 was prevented by the introduction into the tubes of light tufts of
 carded cotton wool just sufficient in quantity to shut out the light in
 looking through the tubes.
     Among several other interesting results furnished by an examina
 tion into the conditions governing and results attending the trans
 mission of detonation by tubes, a remarkable want of reciprocity was
 found to exist between mercuric fulminate and gun-cotton. The latter
 substance is more susceptible to the detonative power of mercuric
 fulminate than of any other substance, as will presently be further
 shown. The quality of fulminate required to detonate gun-cotton is
regulated by the degree to which the sharpness of its own detonation
 is increased by the amount of resistance to rupture offered by the
envelope in which the fulminate is confined.      From 20 to 30 grains
are required if the detonative agent is confined in a thin case of
 wood, or in several wrappings of paper ; but as small a quantity as
 2 grains of the fulminate suffices to effect the detonation of com
pressed gun-cotton, provided the fulminate be confined in a case of
stout metal (sheet tin) and be closely surrounded by being tightly
imbedded in the mass of gun-cotton.        If there be no close contact
between the two, the quantity of fulminate must be very considerably
increased to ensure the detonation of the gun-cotton, and, in attempt
ing to transmit detonation from mercuric fulminate to gun-cotton by
means of tubes, it was found necessary to employ comparatively very
large quantities of fulminate in order to accomplish this, even through
short lengths of tubes.      But when the quantity of fulminate used
reaches certain limits, the detonation may be transmitted from it to
gun-cotton through very long lengths of tube.          In applying gun-
cotton, on the other hand, to accomplish the detonation of mercuric
fulminate, it was found that this result could be attained, and through
considerable lengths of tube (7 feet and upwards) by means of very
much smaller quantities of gun-cotton than is needed of fulminate
to induce tho detonation of gun-cotton through the corresponding
distances.
     This want of reciprocity between two detonating agents corre
sponds to one even more remarkable, which was observed by the
lecturer in his earlier investigations on this subject. In the first
placo it was found that the detonation of       J oz. of gun-cotton (the
smallest quantity that can be thus applied) induced the simultaneous
detonation of nitro-glycerine, enclosed in a vessel of sheet tin and
placed at a distance of 1 inch from the gun-cotton ; while with \ oz.
of the latter, the same effect was produced with an intervening space

1879.]                   on Recent Detonating  Agents.                 69
of 3 inches between the two substances.     But on attempting to apply
nitro-glycerine   to the detonation  of gun-cotton, the quantity of the
former, which was detonated in close contact with compressed gun-
cotton, was gradually increased in the first instance to £ oz. and sub
sequently even to 2 oz. without accomplishing the detonation of the
latter, which was simply dispersed in a fine state of division, in all
instances but one in a large number of experiments.
     The force doveloped by the dotonation of nitro-glycerine was
found, by careful comparison of the relative destructive effects of
corresponding quantities, to be decidedly greater than that of the
fulminate, of which from 2 to 5 grains suffice for developing the
detonation of gun-cotton, when it is in close contact with them.     The
non-susceptibility   of gun-cotton to detonation by nitro-glycerine is
therefore, it need scarcely be said, not ascribable to any deficiency in
mechanical force suddenly applied when the nitro-glycerine is deto
nated.
     That the power possessed by different very highly explosivo sub
stances,  of inducing the detonation of such bodies as gun-cotton and
nitro-glycerine, is not solely ascribable to the operation of mechanical
force very suddenly developed, is indicated not only by the singular
inertness of gun-cotton to the influence of nitro-glycerine as a deto
nating agent, but also by a comparison of the behaviour of other
 detonating substances with that of the mercuric fulminate, when applied
 to the detonation of gun-cotton.     Thus the detonation of silver ful
 minate is very decidedly sharper than that of the mercury compound,
yet it is in no way superior to the latter in its power as an initiative
detonating agent ; indeed, a somewhat larger amount of it appeared to
 be required than of the mercury salt to induce detonation of gun-
 cotton with certainty.    Again, the iodide and chloride of nitrogen
 are far more susceptible of sudden detonation than the silver fulminate ;
 yet while 5 grains of the latter, confined in a stout metal envelope,
 suffice to detonate   gun-cotton, 50 grains of chloride of nitrogen
 confined by water, appeared to be the minimum amount with which
 the detonation of gun-cotton could be accomplished with certainty,
 while no success attended the employment of confined iodide of nitro
 gen in quantities ranging up to 100 grains.
      The incompatibility of these results with the general conclusion,
 based upon numerous and greatly varied experiments, that the facility
 with which the detonation of gun-cotton and nitro-glycerine, and
 bodies of a similar character as explosives, is induced by an initiative
 detonation, is proportionate to the mechanical force aided by the heat
 developed by the latter, led the lecturer to the conclusion that a
 synchronism or similarity in character or quality of the vibrations
 developed by the detonation of particular substances, operates in
 favouring the detonation of one such substance by the initiative deto
 nation of a small quantity of another, while in the absence of such
 svnchronism, a much more powerful detonation, or the application of

70                              Professor Abel                 [March 21,
much greater force, would be needed to effect the detonation of the
material operated upon. This view has received considerable support
from results since obtained by other experimenters, especially by
MM. Champion and Pellet ; but the subject is one which still needs
further experimental elucidation.
      The physical character of explosive substances, as also the
mechanical condition of a mass of the particular explosive substance
operated on, are of great influence in determining its behaviour
 when submitted to the action of an initiative detonation.      The liquid
 nitro-glycerine is far more sensitive to detonation than gun-cotton ;
 one grain of mercuric fulminate, confined in a metal case, suffices to
detonate nitro-glycerine when surrounded by it : but, in order to attain
 this result with any degree of certainty, it is necessary so to confine
 the nitro-glycerine as to prevent its yielding to the blow developed by
 the initiative detonation, and thus to some extent escaping from the
 operation of the sudden concussion to which the particles contiguous
 to the fulminate charge are submitted.
      If nitro-glycerine be mixed with solid substances in a fine state of
 division, plastic mixtures may be obtained, and the liquid may thus
 be presented in something like a solid form to the detonating agent ;
 if the particles of absorbent material be moreover of porous nature, as
 is the case with the infusorial earth called Kicsclguhr used in the
 production of dynamite, a solid nitroglycerine preparation may be
 obtained which contains a very large proportion of the liquid (75 per
 cent, by weight).      In this condition nitro-glycerine may be detonated
 without any difficulty when freely exposed to air ; and although it is
 diluted with a considerable proportion of absolutely inert material,
 its sensitiveness to detonation is not in the least diminished.      Each
  particle of the diluent is enveloped in the liquid, so that no por
  tion of the latter becomes isolated from the remainder by the admix
  ture of inert solid matter ; hence, when the initiative detonator is
  surrounded by such a mass, it is in contact at all points with some
  portion of the nitro-glycerine, and the latter is in continuous con
  nection throughout, though no longer in a mobile condition ;
  detonation is consequently as readily established and transmitted
  through the mass as though it consisted entirely of nitro-glycerine.
  Indeed, while the liquid in its undiluted state, if freely exposed to air
  in a long layer, transmits detonation with difficulty, and very slowly
  as compared with compressed gun-cotton (the observed rate of pro
   gression being, in several experiments, below 6000 feet per second),
  detonation is transmitted with ease and certainty through very long
  trains of a solid preparation of nitro-glycerine, such as dynamite,
  and the rate of transmission is decidedly more rapid than it is with
  compressed gun-cotton, a result which is in harmony with the greater
  sensitiveness to detonation and the greater violence of action of nitro
  glycerine.
       It has already been stated that gun-cotton may be detonated if a
  confined charge of not less than 2 grains of mercuric fulminate be

 detonated   when closely surrounded by the substance.        But in order
 to attain this result,   the cellulose-product must be presented to the
  detonating agent in a mechanical condition favourable to its action.
       Gun-cotton in a loose flocculent condition, or even if in the more
  compact form of a spun yarn or thread, cannot be detonated through
  the agency of a large charge of fulminate buried in the material.
  The light and loose gun-cotton is simply scattered with violence ;
  portions are sometimes inflamed by the heat developed where the
  fulminate is detonated, a result which is obtained with greater cer
  tainty the less violent the detonation produced by the fulminate-
  charge. If, however, the gun-cotton be converted into a compact
  form, either by ramming the wool or thread very tightly into a case,
  or better still, by reducing the gun-cotton fibre to a very fine state of
  division, and compressing     it, when in that condition, into compact
  masses, it becomes susceptible of detonation by the initiative action
  of mercuric fulminate, and the quantity of the latter required to bring
  about detonation    issmall (down to the limit which has been named
  above) in proportion as the compactness or density of the compressed
  material    increased.
             is
      Detonation, when established in compressed gun-cotton,        istrans
  mitted with great velocity throughout the mass, as already stated, or
 from one to another of contiguous masses, laid out in long rows, and
 even, though at a reduced rate,       small spaces exist between the indi
                                      if
 vidual masses. But, if small mass of compressed gun-cotton freely
                            a
 exposed to air be detonated when in immediate contact with gun-cotton
 wool or loosely twisted yarn, the detonation will not be transmitted to
 these, but they will merely be scattered and perhaps inflamed.
      The difference in the behaviour of nitre-glycerine and of gun-
 cotton when presented to the action of so-called initiative detonation
                                                a
 under the different conditions spoken of above, admits of ready
 explanation.
      It was established, in the first instance, that the action of an
 initiative detonation is not ascribable to the heat developed within the
 denoting material itself, in undergoing chemical metamorphosis.         If
it   were so, the detonating mixture known as percussion cap com
 position and other explosive mixtures, the detonation of which          is
attended by much greater development of heat than          is  obtained by
the action of pure mercuric fulminate, should detonate gun-cutton
more readily than the latter does, whereas very much larger quan
tities of such materials are required to attain that result moreover,
                                                                ;
the readiness with which gun-cotton        detonated should be solely pro
                                           is
portionate to the amount of fulminate used, which has been shown not
to be the case    ;  and gun-cotton should be more readily detonated
when in the loose and open condition than in the highly compressed
or compact form, because the latter presents        in the condition least
                                                    it
favourable, and the former in that most favourable, to ready and rapid
transformation by heat.      Again, the actual temperature required for
the explosion of nitro-glycerino            very considerably above the
                                           is

72                           Professor Abel                    [March 21,
exploding temperature of gun-cotton, yet a very much smaller charge
is required for the detonation of nitro-glyoerine than is needed for the
detonation of gun-cotton.     On the other hand, a quantity of confined
percussion cap composition which, if it were pure mercuric fulminate,
would be altogether inadequate for the detonation of gun-cotton,
suffices for the detonation of nitro-glycerine.
     The action of an initiative detonation has already been compared
to that of a blow from a hammer or falling weight.          The readiness
and certainty with which gunpowder, gun-cotton, and other explosive
agents are detonated by the latter agency are regulated by several
circumstances ; they are in direct proportion to the weight of the
falling body, to the height of its fall, and to the force with which it
is impelled downwards ; to the velocity of its motion ; to the mass
and rigidity or hardness of the support upon which the substance to
be detonated rests ; lastly, to the quantity and mechanical condition
of the explosive agent struck, and to its sensitiveness.
     Gunpowder is much more readily detonated by a sharp blow from
a small hammer, than by the simple fall of a heavy hammer, or by
a comparatively weak blow from the latter.         It is very difficult by
repeated   blows, applied at very brief intervals, to detonate gun-
cotton if placed upon a support of wood or lead, both of which
materials yield to a blow, the force applied by that blow being
transferred through the explosive agent and absorbed in work done
upon the material composing the support.          But if the latter bo of
iron, which does not yield permanently to the blow of the hammer,
the dotonation of those substances is easily accomplished.           If the
quantity of the explosive agent employed bo so considerable as to
form a thick layer between tho hammer and support, the force
applied is to so great an extent expended in imparting motion to the
particles of the compressible mass, that there remains little or none
by which its detonation can be accomplished, and if tho material be
in a loose or porous condition (as in tho case of a powder or of loose
wool), much work has to be accomplished in moving particles of the
mass through a comparatively considerable space, in the operation of
compressing them, so that a second or even a third blow is required
for their detonation ; whereas      if,by blows or pressure previously
applied, the explosive material will be presented in the form of a
compact mass, the particles of which have little tendency to motion
when force  is  applied to them, detonation will be much more readily
developed. It appears therefore that the detonation of an explosive
substance by means of blow
                       a       is  the result of the development of heat
sufficient to bring about most energetic chemical action, or change, by
expenditure of force in the compression of the material, or by esta
blishing violent friction between its particles, consequent upon the
motion momentarily imparted to them, and that               brought about
                                                     it
                                                     is
with readiness proportionate to the resistance which they oppose to
     a
their motion by the degree of their contiguity to each other.
     The exceedingly violent motion of particles resulting from the

  1879.]                 on Recent Detonating Agents.                   73
 sudden   or extremely rapid transformation of a solid or liquid
 explosive body into highly heated gas or vapour (which is the
 effect of a detonation), must obviously exort force which operates
 upon a body opposed to it in a manner precisely similar to the force
 applied by opposing a body in the path of a solid mass which is set
 into very rapid motion. In other words, a detonation exerts a
 mechanical effect upon resisting bodies precisely similar to that of a
 blow from a hammer or from a projectile propelled from a gun.
 Just as the force of a sufficiently sudden or powerful blow from a
 hammer is transformed into heat by the resistance to the motion of
 the hammer which the particles of an opposing body offer, and by the
consequent friction established between them, so the force or con-
cussive action exerted by the matter set in motion when a solid or
liquid is converted into gas or vapour, will also be transformed into
heat, the development of which in an opposing body will be propor
tionate to the resistance to motion which its particles offer, and to the
suddenness and violence of the concussion to which it is subjected.
The power of accomplishing the detonation of nitro-glycerine, gun-
cotton, or other highly explosive substances, freely exposed to the
air, through the agency of detonation produced in their vicinity or in
close contact with them, appears therefore correctly ascribable to
the heat suddenly developed in some portion of the mass by the
mechanical effect, or blow exerted by that detonation, and is regulated
by the violence and suddenness (either singly or combined) of the
detonation, by the extent to which the particles composing the mass
of the explosive material are in a condition to oppose resistance to
the force, and by the degree of sensitiveness of the substance to
detonation, or to sudden metamorphosis, under the influence of heat
thus developed.
     It will now be evident why the readily yielding nature of the
particles of liquid nitro-glycerine tends to counteract its great sensi
tiveness to detonation, and why, when the motion of the liquid parti
cles is impeded by their admixture with solid matter, and when they
are consequently placed in a position to resist mechanical motion by
the force applied through the agency of detonation, its natural sensi
tiveness to detonation, and the rapidity with which it can be trans
mitted from particle to particle became fully developed.
     Again, the reduction of gun-cotton fibre to a fine state of division,
which renders the material readily convertible into very compact and
dense masses, places the particles in the condition most favourable to
resist mechanical motion upon the application of a blow, or of the
concussion resulting from a detonation : hence, compressed gun-cotton
is readily susceptible of detonation in proportion to the extent of
compression, or to its density and compactness, while loose gun-cotton
wool, or the lightly twisted or compressed material cannot be readily
detonated, because the force applied is expended in imparting motion to
the readily yielding particles of the mass. If the force applied through
the agency of a detonator to a mass of explosive material just borders

74                              Professor Abel                  [March 21,
upon that required for the development of tho detonation, or if the
condition of the mass is such as hardly to present the requisite resist
ance to mechanical motion essential for its detonation, then, results
intermediate between the mechanical dispersion of the mass and its
violent chemical dispersion or disintegration, i. e. detonation, are
obtained. Thus, frequent instances have been observed, especially in
the experiments in the transmission of detonation through tubes, in
which the initiative detonation has brought about an explosion attended
 with little, if any, destructive effect, portions of the mass being at the
same time dispersed and occasionally inflamed.         Not only have such
 results often been obtained with gun-cotton and dynamite, but even
 mercuric fulminate, exposed to the concussion of a distant detonation
 transmitted through a tube, has frequently been exploded in a manner
 quite distinct from the violent detonation developed in otlier instances.
 Silver fulminate, which under ordinary conditions detonates violently,
 even when only a particle of the mass is subjected to a sufficient
 disturbing influence, has been exploded without the usual demonstra
tions of force, by the transmitted effect of a detonation of mercuric
 fulminate.     In these instances the violence of the concussion pro
 duced by the initiative detonation was only just bordering on that
 required for the development of detonation, and it appears probable
 that only some small portion of tho mass operated upon was in a
 condition or position favourable to the action of the initiative blow.
 Tho remainder of the mass would then be dispersed by the gases
 developed from the detonated portion ; in some instances the particles
 would be inflamed at the moment of their dispersion, in others, they
 would even escape ignition.      The latter appears to be always the case
 when gun-cotton is exploded by a blow from a hammer or falling
 weight.    However carefully the arrangements are adjusted with a
 view to distribute such a blow uniformly over the entire mass struck,
 the concentration of a preponderance of the force applied upon some
 portion or portions of the entire mass, appears almost inevitable ;
 hence only a small portion is actually detonated, the remainder
 being instantaneously dispersed by the gases suddenly generated while
 the weight is still resting upon the support.
     Some experiments made in firing at masses of compressed           gun-
 cotton, differently arranged and of different thicknesses, with a
 Martini-Henry rifle, at short ranges, afforded interesting confirmation
 of the correctness of the explanation given of the operation of a blow
 upon masses of oxplosive material under different conditions.       Disks
 of gun-cotton of the same density and diameter, but differing in thick
 ness, were fired at ; they were freely suspended, and their distance
 from the marksman was in all instances 100 yards.            The thinnest
 disks were simply perforated by the bullets, not a particle of the
 gun-cotton being ignited.      Somewhat thicker disks were inflamed by
 the impact of the bullet, while still thicker disks, fired at under the
 same conditions, were exploded, portions being in some instances dis
 persed in a burning state.      No instance of detonation was, however,

   1879.]                  on Recent Detonating Agents.                    75
  obtained. These differences in effect, obtained with masses of different
  thickness and weight, are duo to the difference in their power to resist
  mechanical motion when struck by the bullet, and in the different
  amount of resistance to penetration presented by the thin and the
  thicker disks.
       It has been explained that nitroglycerine may be largely diluted
  with inert solid matters without its sensitiveness to detonation being
  reduced, while its detonation in open air becomes very much facili
  tated, because the mobility of the particles, and their consequent ten
  dency to yield to the force of a blow or detonation, is very greatly
  diminished.    But if a solid explosive agent is diluted with inert solid
  matter the case is different ; for in such a mixture of the finely divided
  solid with non-explosive solid particles, there must bo a partial and
 sometimes a complete separation of the particles of the explosive by
  the interposed inert particles with which it is diluted ; hence the sensi
 tiveness to detonation is reduced, and its transmission by the particles
 is retarded or altogether impeded, by a diminution of the extent of
 contact between the substance to be detonated and the initiative deto
 nation, and by the barrier which the interposed non-explosive particles
 oppose to the transmission of detonation.     Thus a mixture of mercuric
 fulminate with more than one-fifth its weight of French chalk could
 not be detonated by means of one grain of pure fulminate enclosed
 in a copper capsule, which was inserted into the mixture; that
 quantity, similarly confined, sufficed to detonate undiluted fulminate
 through a tube 8 inches long and 0-5 inch in diameter. In experi
 ments made in this direction with finely divided gun-cotton, it was
 found that altheugh dilution with an inert solid, applied in the solid
form, reduced the sensitiveness of the material to detonation, this was
 not the case when it was incorporated with a salt soluble in water,
 the mixture being then compressed while in the wet state.              The
 compressed masses thus obtained were, when dried, in a condition of
 greater rigidity than could be attained by submitting undiluted gun-
 cotton to considerably more powerful pressure, because the crystal
 lisation of the soluble salt used as the diluent upon evaporation of
 the water, cemented the particles composing the mass more rigidly
 together. The gun-cotton was therefore presented in a form more
capable of resisting the mechanical action of a small charge of fulmi
nate, than a more highly compressed undiluted gun-cotton, and hence
the reduction in sensitiveness due to the detonation of the explosive
compound is nearly counterbalanced by the greater rigidity imparted
to the mass.     If a soluble oxidising agent (a nitrate or chlorate) be
employed as the diluting material, the predisposition to chemical
reaction between it and the gun-cotton (which is susceptible of some
additional oxidation), appears to operate in conjunction with the effect
of the salt in imparting rigidity to the mixture, thus rendering the
latter quite as sensitive to the detonating action of the minimum
fulminate charge as undiluted gun-cotton.       Moreover, the interesting
fact has been conclusively established, that these compressed mixtures

76                              Professor Abel                  [March 21,
of gun-cotton with a nitrate or a chlorate are much less indifferent
to the influence of detonating nitro-glycerine than gun-cotton in its
puro stato.     Chlorated and nitrated gun-cotton are detonated with
certainty by moans of £ oz. of nitro-glycerine, whereas the detonation
of 2 oz. of the latter accomplished the detonation of ordinary com
pressed gun-cotton only once in a large number of experiments.
    If compressed gun-cotton is diluted by impregnating the mass
with a liquid, or with a solid which is introduced into the mass in a
fused state, its susceptibility of detonation is reduced to a very much
greater extent, than by a corresponding quantity of a solid inert body,
incorporated as such with the'gun-cotton, the cause being the converse
of that which operates in preventing a reduction of the sensitiveness
to detonation of nitro-glycerine      by its dilution with an inert solid.
In this case, the explosive liquid envelopes the solid diluent, and
remains continuous throughout, occupying the spaces which exist
botween tho solid particles; hence detonation is readily established
and transmitted.     But in the case of the solid explosive, the diluent,
which is liquid, or at any rato is introduced into the mass in the
liquid state, envelopes each particle of the solid, so that a film of inert
material surrounds each, isolating it from its neighbours, and thus
opposing resistance to the transmission of detonation, which is pro
portionate to the original porosity or absorbent power of the mass.
    While compressed gun-cotton, in the air-dry state, is detonated by
2 grains of mercuric fulminate imbedded in the material, its detonation
by 15 grains, applied in the same manner, becomes doubtful when it
contains 3 per cent, of water, over and above the 2 per cent, which
exists normally in the air-dry substance.       Specimens which had been
impregnated     with oil or   soaked   in melted  fat and allowed to cool,
could not bo detonated by means of 15 grains of fulminate.          These
diluted samples of gun-cotton could only bo detonated by adding very
considerably to the power of the initiative detonation ; 100 grains of
confined fulminate generally failed to detonate gun-cotton containing
from 10 to 12 per cent, of water, and if the amount reached 17 per
cent., 200 grains of fulminate were needed to ensure its detonation.
    But moist or wet compressed gun-cotton is decidedly more
susceptible of detonation by (dry) compressed gun-cotton itself than
by morcuric fulminate.
    Thus 100 grains of dry gun-cotton, detonated through the agency
of the ordinary fulminate fuze, suffice to detonate wet gun-cotton
containing 17 per cent, of water, though this result is somewhat un
certain.   If the diluting agent amounts to 20 per cent., detonation is
not certain with less than 1 oz. of dry gun-cotton, and if the com
pressed material be completely saturated with water (i.e. containing
30 to 35 per cent.), 4 oz. of the air-dry substance, applied in close
contact, are needed to ensure its detonation.
    Detonation is transmitted through tubes from dry compressed gun-
cotton to a moist disk of tho material with the same facility as to
the dry substance ; and this is also the case with regard to tho

1879.]                    on Recent Detonating Agents.                 77
propagation of detonation from one mass of moist gun-cotton to
another, in open air, all the pieces being ranged in a row, in contact
with each other, provided that the piece first detonated does not
contain less water than the others to which detonation is transmitted.
Some curious results, obtained in experiments on the transmission of
detonation, with gun-cotton containing different proportions of water,
appeared to indicate that the character or quality of detonation
developed by gun-cotton is subject to modification by the proportion
of water which the latter contains.
     Gun-cotton containing 12 to 14 per cent, of water is ignited with
much difficulty on applying a highly heated body. As it leaves
the hydraulic press upon being converted from the pulped state to
masses having about the density of water, it contains about 15 per
cent, of water ; in this condition it may be thrown on to a fire or
held in a flame without exhibiting any tendency to burn ; the masses
may be perforated by means of a red-hot iron or with a drilling tool,
and they may with perfect safety be cut into slices by means of saws
revolving with great rapidity.      If placed upon a fire and allowed to
remain there, a feeble and transparent flame flickers over the surface
of the wet gun-cotton from time to time as the exterior becomes
sufficiently dry to inflame ; and in this way a piece of compressed
gun-cotton will burn away very gradually indeed. A pile of boxes
containing in all 6 cwt. of gun-cotton, impregnated with about
20 per cent, of water, when surrounded            by burning wood and
shavings    in a  wooden   building,  was  very gradually consumed, the
gun-cotton     burning   as  already   described  when the surfaces of
the masses became        partially dried.    In two other experiments
quantities of wet gun-cotton of 20 cwt. each, packed in one instance
in a large, strong wooden case, and, in the other, in a number
of strong packing cases, were placed in small magazines, very sub
stantially constructed of concrete and brickwork. Large fires were
kindled around the packages in each building, the doors being just
left ajar. The entire contents of both buildings had burned away,
without anything approaching explosive action, in less than two
hours. This comparatively great safety of wet gun-cotton, coupled
with the fact that its detonation in that condition may bo readily
accomplished through the agency of a small quantity of dry gun-
cotton, which, through the medium of a fulminate fuze or detonator,
is made to act as the initiative detonating agent, gives to gun-cotton
important advantages over other violent explosive agents for purposes
which involve the employment of more or less considerable quan
tities at one time, on account of the comparative safety attending its
storage and the necessary manipulation of it.       Moreover, it has been
well established by experiments of many kinds carried out on a
considerable scale, as well as by accurate scientific observations, that
the detonation of wet gun-cotton is decidedly sharper or more violent
than that of the dry material ; a circumstance which affords an
interesting illustration of the influence exerted by the physical

78                            Professor Abel                    [March 21,
condition of the mass upon the facility with which detonation is
 transmitted from particle to particlo.         In the determinations made
 by   means   of  the  Noble   chronoscope,    of  the velocity with which
 detonation is transmitted along layers or trains of gun-cotton and
 nitro-glycerine,    the lecturer has included experiments with gun-
 cotton containing different proportions of water.       When the material
 contained 15 per cent. of the liquid, some indications were obtained
 that the rate of transmission of detonation was a little higher than
 with dry gun-cotton ; the difference was very decidedly in favour
 of wet gun-cotton, when the latter was thoroughly saturated with
 water. (With air-dry gun-cotton the mean rate of transmission
 ranged in several experiments between 17,000 and 18,900 feet per
 second ; with gun-cotton containing about 30 per cent. of water, the
 mean rate of transmission ranged between 19,300 and 19,950 feet per
 second.) The air in the masses of compressed              gun-cotton being
 replaced entirely by the comparatively incompressible body, water,
 the particles of explosive are in a much more favourable condition
 to resist displacement by the force of the detonation, and hence
 they are more readily susceptible of sudden chemical disintegration.
Moreover, the variations in the rate of travel of detonation in dry
 gun-cotton, resulting from differences in the compactness or rigidity
of different masses of the material, are very greatly reduced, if not
entirely eliminated, by saturating the disks with water and thus
equalising their power of resisting motion by a sudden blow.
     Another striking illustration of the influence which the physical
character of an explosive substance exercises over its susceptibility to
detonation and the degree of facility with which its full explosive
force is developed, is furnished by one of the most recently devised,
and ono of the most interesting of existing, explosive agents.
     Twelve years ago, soon after the process of producing compressed
and granulated gun-cotton had been elaborated by the lecturer, it
occurred to him to employ these forms of gun-cotton as vehicles for
the application of nitro-glycerine.        A considerable proportion of the
liquid was absorbed by the porous masses of gun-cotton, and a nitro
glycerine preparation analogous in character to dynamite was thus
obtained. The absorbent was in this case a violently explosive body
instead of an inert solid as in dynamite, but the quantity of nitro
glycerine in a given weight of the preparation (to which the name of
Glyoxilin was given), was considerably less than in the Kieselguhr-
preparation ; henco the latter was nearly on a point of equality with
it, in regard to power, as an explosive agent.
     Nobel has observed that    if,   instead of making use of the most
explosive form of gun-cotton, or trinitroccllulose,    a    lower product of
nitration of cellulose (the so-called soluble or collodion gun-cotton) is
added to nitro-glycerine, the liquid exerts    a     peculiar solvent action
upon  it,  the  fibrous  material   becoming gelatinised while the nitro
glycerine   becomes   at tho same  time fixed, the two substances furnishing
a  product   having  almost  the  characters  of compound. By macerat

ing only from 7 to 10 per cent, of soluble gun-cotton with 90 to
93 per cent, of nitro-glycerine,    the whole becomes converted into
an adhesive plastic material, more gummy than gelatinous in cha
racter, from which, if it bo prepared with sufficient care, no nitro
glycerine will separate even by its exposure to heat in contact with
bibulous paper, or by its prolonged immersion in water, the com
ponents being not easily susceptible of separation even through the
agency of a solvent of both. As the nitre-glycerine is only diluted
with a small proportion of a solidfying agent which is itself an
explosive (though a somewhat feeble one), this blasting gelatine, as
                       it,
Nobel has called       ismore powerful not only than dynamite but
also than the mixture of      smaller quantity of uitro-glycerine with
                                  a
the most explosive gun-cotton, as the liquid substance        decidedlyis
the most violent explosive of the two.    Moreover, as nitro-glycerine
contains a  small amount of oxygen in excess of that required for the
perfect oxidation of its carbon and hydrogen constituents, while the
soluble gun-cotton     deficient in the requisite oxygen for its com
                        is
plete transformation into thoroughly oxidised products, the result
of an incorporation of the latter in small proportion with nitro
glycerine,    the production of an explosive agent which contains the
             is
proportion of oxygen requisite for the development of the maximum
of chemical energy by the complete burning of the carbon and
hydrogen, and hence this blasting gelatine should, theoretically, be
even slightly more powerful as an explosive agent than pure nitro
glycerine.
    That such      the case has been well established by numerous
                  is
experiments,   but although this blasting gelatine may be detonated
like dynamite by means of small quantities of confined detonating
composition, when       itemployed in strongly tamped blast-holes, or
                             is
under conditions very favourable to the development of great initial
pressure, it  behaves very differently from that material, or other
solid though plastic preparations of nitro-glycerine,      the attempt
                                                              if                    is
made to detonate     when freely exposed to the air or only partially
                       it

                                      a
strongly confined detonating composition than dynamite and similar
preparations do, to bring about       detonation with
                                          a                  under those
                                                                  it
conditions; but when as much as 15 or 20 grains of confined
fulminate are detonated in direct contact with              it,
                                                        although    sharp   a
explosion occurs, little or no destructive action results, and        con       a
siderable portion of the charge operated upon       dispersed in
                                                       is          finely-  a
divided condition.    This dispersion appears to take place to some
slight extent with dynamite also, when a small charge        detonated in
                                                                  is
open air, in consequence of its  want  of  rigidity, though the amount
of explosive which thus escapes detonation        very small as compared
                                                  is
with the gelatine.
    In comparing the effects of these nitro-glycerine preparations with
each other and with compressed gun-cotton and preparations of                       it,
 by detonating equal quantities quite imconfiued upon iron plates, tho

80                           Professor Abel                    [March 21,
results appear to establish great superiority, in point of violence of
action, or destructive effect, of the more rigid explosive agents (the
gun-cotton preparations).        Thus, employing iron plates 1 inch
thick (supported upon an anvil with a central cavity), and 4 oz.
of each material unconfined, the charges being all about the same
diameter, exploded by detonators of equal strength, and simply resting
upon the upper surface of the plate, compressed gun-cotton produced
a considerable indentation of the upper surface of the plate, and long
cracks in the lower surface ; a species of nitrated gun-cotton, called
tonite, produced a much shallower indentation, theugh still a very
marked one, but did not crack the lower surface. Dynamite produced
only a very slight impression upon the plate, and none could be
detected by the eye on the plato upon which the blasting gelatine
was exploded.        The difficulties, brought out by past experience,
 which attend the contrivance of really comparative tests of the explo
 sive power of such substances as those under discussion, is well exem
plified by the foregoing results, which were influenced to the maximum
extent by the physical characters of the several substances when applied,
 as they were upon these iron plates, in a perfectly unconfined con
 dition, so that the particles were free to yield to the force of the
 initiative detonation in proportion to their mobility.       But, for this
 very reason, these experiments afford excellent illustration of the
 extent to which the development of detonation and the sharpness of
 its transmission through the mass is influenced not only by tho
 inherent sensitiveness of the substance to detonation (or by its
 chemical instability) but also by the degree of proneness of their
 particles to yield mechanically to the force of a blow as applied by
 an initiative detonation. Thus, although in comparing two substances
 of similar physical characters, compressed gun-cotton and compressed
 nitrated gun-cotton or tonite, the superiority of the pure compound
 over the mixture, in point of sharpness and violence of action, is well
 illustrated, a comparison of the result furnished by the weakest of the
 four explosive agents tried, viz. tonite, with that of the substance
 which should be superior to all the others in explosive force (i.e. the
 blasting gelatine) demonstrates the important influence which tho com
 paratively groat rigidity of the mass in the one case exerts in favouring
 the completeness and sharpness of its detonation in open air, and the
 great disadvantage under which the other explosive is applied, arising
 out of the plastic and therefore readily yielding nature of the material.
  But if,   by exposure to
                         a     moderate degree of cold, this plastic nitro
 glycerine preparation  is   made  to freeze (for
                                               it  partakes of the property
 of   the  liquid itself of freezing at
                                      a     temperature above the freezing
 point of water, and becomes thereby converted into at least as rigid
a   substance as the two descriptions of gun-cotton) its detonation upon
 an iron plato produces an indentation, as well as    a   destructive effect
 upon the lowor surface of the plato, vory decidedly greater than those
 furnished by the corresponding amount of pure compressed gun-cotton.
 Similarly, the effect produced by the detonation of dynamite upon a

1879.]                    on Recent Detonating Agents.                  81
plate of the kind used, is but little inferior to that of gun-cotton, and
decidedly greater than that of tonite, if it is employed in the frozen
condition.
     A series of experiments has been made with cylinders of lead
having a central perforation 1'3 inch in diameter extending to a
depth of 7 inches and leaving solid metal beneath of a thickness
ranging from 3•5 to 5-5 inches, according to the size of the cylinders
used.    These furnished results of considerable interest as illustrating
the action of these several detonating agents.       Charges of 1-25 oz.
of each explosive substanco were used throughout the experiments,
and were placed at the bottoms of the holes. By the detonation of
the charges the cylindrical holes in the lead were enlarged into
cavities of a pear shape (and sometimes approaching the spherical
form), of various diameters ; in some instances the metal was besides
partially torn open in a line from the bottom of the charge-hole to
the circumference of the lower face of the cylinder ; and in the case
of some of the gun-cotton charges, the fissure in the metal in this
direction was complete, the base of the block being separated from
the remainder, in the form of a cone.      In the first place the portions
of the holes above the charges were simply left open ; in the subsequent
experiments they were filled up to a level with the upper surface, with
 dry, fine, loose sand, or with water. The dimensions of the cylinders
were increased in successive experiments until, in the case of every
one of the explosives used, the mass of metal was sufficiently great to
resist actual fracture at the base of the cylinder.       Under the con
ditions of these experiments, more or less considerable resistance
being opposed to the mechanical dispersion of the plastic explosive
substances, their detonation was greatly facilitated, though even then,
the holes in the lead blocks being left open to the air, some amount
of the blasting gelatine evidently escaped detonation ; the widening
of the upper part of the charge-hole, in experiments of this nature
 made with the gelatine, indicated that detonation was transmitted to
 small portions dispersed in the first instance and in the act of escaping
from the block.      In all the experiments, whother the holes were left
 open or filled with sand or water, the effect produced upon the base
of the block by the detonation of compressed gun-cotton was con
siderably more violent than with the other explosive agents, indicating
a sharpness of action which was only shared by the blasting gelatine
when used in a frozen state in one of these experiments. The dimen
 sions of the cavities produced by tho gelatine were, at the largest part,
considerably greater than those produced by the dynamite and nitrated
gun-cotton (tonite), and slightly greater than those of the gun-cotton
charges ; but in the latter, the fracture of the base of the cylinder gave
 rise in most of the experiments to an escape of force, so that in these
 cases the effects of the detonation could not be well compared by
 measurements of the cavities.     When the gelatine was converted by
 freezing into a rigid mass its superiority in explosive force even ovor
 compressed gun-cotton was well illustrated ; the base of the lead block

was all but blown out, the cavity produced was considerably the largest,
and the suddenness and violence with which motion was imparted to
the water tamping caused the top of the block also to be blown off
in the form of a cone. An excellent illustration was obtained, by
comparing this result with those furnished by the gelatine in its
normal plastic state, of the influence exercised by the physical con
dition of an explosive substance upon the rapidity and completeness
with which detonation is transmitted through its mass.
      The difficulties attending the application of blasting gelatine, in
some directions in which explosive agents are applied, on account of
the uncertainty attending the development of its explosive force, even
with the use of a comparatively powerful detonator, unless it be very
strongly confined, has led to attempts to reduce its non-sensitiveness
to detonation by mixing it with materials intended to operate either
by virtue of their comparatively great sensitiveness, or of their pro
perty, as solids, of reducing the very yielding character of the sub
stance, or in both ways.
      Some of these attempts have been attended with considerable
success.    Thus the incorporation of about 10 per cent. of the most
explosive form of gun-cotton or trinitrocellulose,       in a very finely
divided state, with the gelatine, renders it so much more sensitive that
it can be detonated with certainty in the open air by means of the
 strongest detonating cap now used for exploding dynamite.            This
 effect appears to be less due to the comparative sensitiveness of gun-
 cotton to detonation than to the modification effected in the consistency
 of the material, which, though still plastic, offers decidedly greater
 resistance to a blow than the original gummy substance.         The par
 ticles of hollow fibre of the gun-cotton appear also to have the effect of
 absorbing small quantities of nitro-glycerine which are less perfectly
 united with the soluble gun-cotton than the remainder, and which,
 existing as they do in somewhat variable proportions in the gelatine,
 have occasionally an objectionable tendency to exudation, if the in
 corporation of the ingredients has been less perfect than usual. The
 substance, when modified as described, has no longer that great adhe
 siveness which is exhibited by it in the original state, and which
 renders it less easy to manipulate.
      Lastly, its explosive force appears to be in no way diminished by
 this modification of its composition, on the contrary, its superiority in
 this respect to compressed gun-cotton becomes more manifest, as
 demonstrated by some of the experiments with lead blocks, while its
 action partakes of that sharpness peculiar to the detonation of the
 rigid gun-cotton, as indicated by the fissure of that part of the metal
 situated beneath the charge. Finely divided cotton fibre has a similar
  effect to trinitrocellulose in modifying the physical character and
  increasing the sensitiveness to detonation of the blasting gelatine, but
  its explosive force is, of course, proportionately reduced with its
  dilution with an inert substance.
      Nobel has made the interesting observation, that an addition to the

1879.]                   on Recent Detonating Agents.                     83
blasting gelatine of small proportions of certain substances rich in
carbon and hydrogen, which are soluble in nitro-glycerine,          such as
benzol and nitro-benzol, increases to a remarkable extent the non-
sensitiveness to detonation of the original material ; and this obser
vation has led to experiments being conducted by engineer officers in
Austria, with a view of endeavouring to convert the blasting gelatine
into a material which should compete, as regards some special advan
tages in point of safety, with wet gun-cotton in its application to
military and naval purposes, and especially as regards non-liability
to detonation or explosion by the impact of rifle bullets.         If  boxes
containing   drj compressed gun-cotton     are  fired into from  small  arms
even at a short range, the gun-cotton is generally inflamed, but has
never been known to explode ; the sharpness of the blow essential to
the latter result, which the bullet might otherwise give, being
diminished by its penetration through the side of the box before
reaching the explosive. It is scarcely necessary to state that wet gun-
cotton, containing even as little as 15 per cent, of water, is never
inflamed under these conditions.        On the other hand, dynamite is
invariably detonated when struck by a bullet on passing through the
side of the box, and blasting gelatine, though so much less sensitive
than dynamite, behaves in the same way in its ordinary as well as in
the frozen condition.     The Austrian experiments indicated that the
gelatine when intimately mixed with only 1 per cent, of camphor,
generally, though not invariably, escaped explosion by the impact of
a bullet, but that when the proportion of camphor amounted to 4 per
cent, the material was neither exploded nor inflamed, though, in the
frozen state, it was still liable to occasional explosion.             These
results were considered indicative of a degree of safety in regard
to service exigencies, approaching that of wet compressed gun-cotton.
The camphoretted gelatine still labours, however, under the disad
vantage of being readily inflammable, and of burning fiercely, and
consequently, of giving rise, like dynamite and dry gun-cotton, to
violent explosion, or detonation, if burned in considerable bulk ; a
result which was explained by the lecturer in his discourse delivered
at the Royal Institution in 1872.          Moreover, the camphoretted
blasting  gelatine is so difficult of detonation   by the means ordinarily
applied, that a large initiative charge of a very violent detonating
mixture consisting of pure specially prepared trinitrocellulose          and
nitre-glycerine is prescribed, by the Austrian experimenters, as being
indispen-able to its proper detonation.
     The action of camphor and of other substances rich in carbon and
hydrogen in reducing greatly the sensitiveness to detonation of the
preparation of soluble gun-cotton and nitro-glycerine,         is not to be
traced to any physical modification of that material produced by the
addition of such substances, and no satisfactory theory can at present
be advanced to account for it on chemical grounds.
     The camphoretted gelatine, like Nobel's original gelatine itself,
may be kept immersed in water for a considerable time without any
                                                                 a 2

important change ; the surface of the mass thus immersed becomes
white and opaque, apparently in consequence of some small absorption
of water, but no nitro-glycerine is separated, and on re-exposurc to
the air the material gradually assumes once moro its original aspect.
It has consequently been proposed to render the storage of blasting
gelatine comparatively safo by keeping it immersed in water till
required for use, but the test of time is still needed to establish the
unalterableness of the material under this condition.
     There can be little question that this interesting nitro-glycerine
preparation, either in its most simple form, or modified in various
ways, by the addition of other ingredients, promises, by virtue of its
great peculiarities as a detonating agent, to present means for im
portantly extending the application of nitro-glycerine to industrial
purposes ; and it is not improbable that, through its agency, this most
violent of all explosive agents at present producible upon a large scale
may also come to acquire special value for important war-purposes.
     It has been pointed out that the complete solidification, by
freezing, of plastic preparations containing nitro-glycerine, such as
dynamite and the blasting gelatine, has the effect of facilitating the
transmission of detonation througheut the mass, and of thus developing
or increasing the violence of their action, under certain conditions of
their applications, i. e. when they are either freely exposed to air or
not very closely or rigidly confined. But while, under circumstances
favourable to the detonation of these substances, when in the frozen
state, their full explosive force is thus much more readily applied
than when they are in their normal (thawed) condition, the frozen
substances are less sensitive to detonation by a blow or an initiative
detonation.     On the other hand, if subjected to the rapid application
of great heat (as for example by the burning of portions of a mass of
the explosive substance itself), a detonation is much more readily
brought about with the frozen material than if it be in its normal
 condition.    Thus a package containing 50 lb. of cartridges of plastic
 dynamite, when surrounded by fire, burned away without any indica
 tion of explosive action ; on submitting 10 lb. of frozen dynamite to
 the same treatment, that quantity also burned without explosion,
 theugh at one time the combustion was so fierce as to indicate an
 approach to explosive action ; but when the experiment was repeated
 on the same occasion with 15 lb. of frozen dynamite a very violent
detonation took place after the material had been burning for a shert
time, a deep crater being produced in the ground beneath.
     The following is offered as the most probable explanation of this
 result.    When a mass of dynamite, as in these cartridges, is exposed
 to sufficient cold to cause tho nitro-glycerine to freeze, it does not
 become uniformly hardened throughout, partly because of slight
variations in the proportion of nitro-glycerine in different portions of
 the mixture composing the cartridge, and partly because unless tho
exposure     to cold be very prolonged the external portions of the

  1879.J                  on Recent Detonating Agents.                    85
 cartridges will be frozen harder or more thoroughly than the interior.
 It may thus arise that portions of only partially frozen or still
 unfrozen dynamite may be more or less completely enclosed in hard
 crusts, or strong envelopes, of perfectly frozen and comparatively
 very cold dyamite.      On exposure of such cartridges to a fierce heat
 very rapidly applied, as would result from the burning of a con
 siderable quantity of the material, some portion of one or other of
 the cartridges would be likely to be much more readily raised to the
 igniting or exploding point than the remaining more perfectly frozen
 part in which it is partly or completely imbedded.         If the ignition
 of this portion be brought about (which it will be with a rapidity
proportionate to the intensity of heat to which the cartridge is
 exposed), the envelope of hard frozen dynamite by which it is still
 more or less completely surrounded and strongly confined, will
 operate like the metal envelope of a detonator, in developing the
 initial pressure essential for the sudden raising of the more readily
inflammable portion of the dynamite to the temperature necessary for
 the sudden transformation of the nitro-glycerino into gas, and will
 thus bring about the detonation of a portion of the cartridge, which
 will act as the initiative detonator to the remainder of the dynamite.
 On igniting separately, at one of their extremities, some dynamite
 cartridges which had been buried in snow for a considerable period,
the lecturer has observed that, as the frozen material gradually
burned away, very slight but sharp explosions (like the snapping of a
small percussion cap on a gun nipple) occurred from time to time,
portions of the frozen dynamite being scattered with some violence.
 He did not succeed in obtaining actual detonation by thus burning
frozen cartridges surrounded by others in a similar condition, but he
has been informed by Mr. McRoberts, of the Ardeer Dynamite Works,
that he has more than once detonated a small heap of hard-frozen
cartridges weighing altogether one pound, by igniting one cartridge
which was surrounded by the remainder. These facts appear to
substantiate the correctness of the foregoing explanation.           They
point to the danger of assuming that, because dynamite in the frozen
state is less sensitive to the effects of a blow or initiative detonation,
than the thawed material, it may therefore be submitted without
special care to the action of heat, for the purpose of thawing it.
Instances of the detonation, with disastrous results, of even single
cartridges of frozen dynamite, through the incautious application of
considerable heat (as for example by placing them in an oven, or
close to a fire), have been, and are still, of not unfrequent occurrence,
even though Mr. Nobel has insisted upon the application of heat
through the agency only of warm water, as the sole reliable method
of safely thawing dynamite cartridges.
     While the sensitiveness to detonation of air-dry gun-cotton
remains unaffected by great reduction in temperature of the mass, and
while in this respect it presents advantages over nitro-glycerine

86                            Profeeior Abel                    [March 21,
preparations, wet gun-cotton becomes very decidedly more susceptible
to detonation when frozen. Thus the detonation of gun-cotton con
taining an addition of from 10 to 12 per cent, of water is somewhat
uncertain with the employment of 100 grains of strongly confined
fulminate, and 200 grains are required for the detonation of the
substance when containing 15 to 17 per cent. of water ; but the latter
in a frozen state can be detonated by means of 30 grains of fulminate,
and 15 grains are just upon the margin of the amount requisite for
detonating, with certainty, frozen gun-cotton containing 10 to 12
per cent, of water.      The deadening effect of solid water upon the
sensitiveness of gun-cotton to detonation is, in fact, intermediate
between those of a liquid and of inert solid substances.
     The effects produced and products formed by the explosion of
gun-cotton in perfectly closed spaces, both in the loose, and the com
pressed form, and by its detonation in the dry and the wet state, have
been made the subject of study by Captain Noble and Mr. Abel, the
method of research pursued being the same as that followed in their
published researches on fired gunpowder; results of considerable
interest in regard to the heat of explosion, the pressures developed,
and the products of explosion of dry and wet gun-cotton have been
obtained, which are about to be communicated to the Royal Society.
     It may briefly be stated that the temperature of explosion of gun-
cotton is more than double that of gunpowder (being about 4400° C.) ;
that the tension of the products of explosion, assuming the material
to fill entirely the space in which it is fired, is considerably more than
double that of the powder-products under the same conditions ; that
the products obtained by the explosion of dry gun-cotton are com
paratively simple and very uniform under different conditions as
regards pressure ; that the products of detonation of dry gun-cotton
do not differ materially from those of its explosion in a confined space,
but that those furnished by the detonation of wet gun-cotton present
some interesting points of difference        Messrs. Noble and Abel are
extending their investigations to the nitro-glycerine preparations.
     The great advance which has been made within the last twelve
years in our knowledge of the conditions which determine the cha
racter of the metamorphosis that explosive substances undergo, and
which develop or control the violence of their action, finds its parallel
in the progress which has been made in the production, perfection,
and application of the two most prominent of modern explosive agents,
nitro-glycorino and gun-cotton.      Discovered at nearly the same time,
less than forty years ago, the one speedily attained great prominence,
on account of the apparent ease with which it could be prepared and
put to practical use ; a prominence short-lived, however, because the
first, and somewhat rash, attempts to utilise it preceded the acquisition
of sound and sufficient knowledge of its nature and properties. Even
many years afterwards, when the difficulties attending its employ

ment appeared to have been surmounted, the confidence of its most
indefatigable partisans and staunchest friends received a rude shock,
from which it needed the support of much faith and some fortitude
to recover.
     Meanwhile, the other substance, which now shares with it the
honours of important victories won over gunpowder, continued to
be generally regarded as a dangerous chemical curiosity, even for
some time after its present position as one of the most important
industrial products and useful explosive agents was being gradually
but firmly secured for    it,  step by step, by the talent and untiring
energy of single individual.
          a
     Almost from the day of its discovery, the fortunes of gun-cotton
continued to fluctuate, and much adversity marked its career, until at
last its properties became well understood, and its position as a most
formidable explosive agent, applicable on     a    large scale, with ease,
great simplicity, and with      a  degree of safety far greater than that
as yet possessed by any other substance of this class, has now become
thoroughly established.       Since the lecturer last discoursed on the
properties of gun-cotton, seven years ago, this material has attained a
firm footing as one of the most formidable agents of defence and
offence.    For all military engineering operations, and for employment
in submarine mines and torpedoes, compressed gun-cotton, stored and
used in the wet condition, has become the accepted explosivo agent
in Great Britain within the last five years upwards of 550 tons have
                 ;
been manufactured for this purpose, and are distributed over our

provided itself with a   large supply for the same purposes, and Austria,
where the acquisition of bitter experience of the uncertainty of gun-
cotton in the earlier stages of history, naturally gave rise to a
 persistent scepticism regarding its present trustworthiness, appears
now also about to adopt wet gun-cotton for military and naval uses.
     But while the usefulness and great value of compressed gun-cotton
 in these important directions has been established, its technical appli
cation has made but slow progress as compared with that of the simple
 nitro- glycerine preparation known as dynamite, which, in point of
 cost of production and convenience for general blasting purposes,
 can claim superiority over compressed gun-cotton.       Already in 1867
a   number of dynamite factories, working under Nobel's supervision,
 existed in different countries  ;  in that year the total quantity manu
 factured amounted to 11 tons        ; in another year the produce had
 risen to 78 tons
                ;    in 1872it    had attained to 1350 tons. Two years
 afterwards the total production of dynamite was nearly trebled, and
 in 1878 it  amounted to 6140 tons.
      There are as many as fifteen factories in different parts of the
 world (including    a  very extensive one in Scotland) working under
 the supervision of Mr. Nobel, the originator of the nitro-glycerine

industry, and some six or seven other establishments exist where
dynamite or preparations of very similar character are also manu
factured.
    How far the rate of production of dynamite will be affected by the
further development of the value of Nobel's new preparation, the
blasting gelatine, it is difficult to foresee, but there appears great
prospect of an important future for this very peculiar and interesting
detonating agent.
    It is hoped that the subjects dealt with in this discourse afford
interesting illustration of the intimate connection of scientific research
with important practical achievements.

                     The Logic  of Architectural Design.
ARCHITECTURE may be most comprehensively defined as " the art of
                              "
building with expression ; but in order to estimate rightly the capa
bilities and the limits of the art as thus defined, it is necessary to
bear in mind that it differs from other arts which appeal to the sense
of sight, in two essential particulars. In the first place, it is an art
arising out of practical requirements and governed by practical con
ditions.   If  we did not want buildings to shelter us, there would bo
no architecture;     if we do not build them in accordance with true
statical conditions, they fall down. Secondly, architecture as an art
has no direct reference to nature, and does not copy natural forms :
which is probably one reason why there is so much more uncertainty
and divergence of opinion in regard to this art than in regard to
sculpture or painting.       The latter arts express themselves through
forms directly imitated from nature ; so that if (to put an extreme
case) a painter represented a man with two heads, we need listen to
no reason on the subject, we simply condemn him on our knowledge
of the facts of nature. It may, however, be just as wrong for an
architect to put two towers where there should be only one, or a
pillar where there should be a buttress ; but the right or wrong of tho
matter is in this case based not on reference to the concrete facts of
nature in her physical aspect, but on a process of abstract reasoning
which few people take the trouble to go through.          The main prin
ciples which should form the basis of such reasoning may be briefly
summarized in the following axioms, which embody the fundamental
principles of what may be called
                                     " architectural morality."
     1. Architecture, being based on practical requirements, can only be
true and logical so far as it is in accordance with and expresses these.
     2. The plan of the building is the basis of the whole design.    A
good plan is one in which the various departments are arranged and
combined in such a manner as to insure the greatest convenience and
the best possible effect.
     3. The exterior grouping and design of a building should arise
out of and indicate the interior plan and arrangement.

    4. The architectural design, both internal and external, should arise
                                                                "
out of and express the scientific construction or the " statics of the
building.
    5. Ornament must bo so introduced as either to emphasize the con
struction or to be manifestly independent thereof, and must be de
signed with reference to the material in which it is to be executed,
and the climate nndor which it is to be seen.
    6. No feature, not arising out of the plan or construction, can be
added to the architectural design of a building, under the pretext
that it is " ornamental." Such a feature is an architectural falsehood.
     It would not be to the purpose, however, to endeavour here to
illustrate these maxims by an attempt to evolve, in accordance with
them, a perfectly logical architecture out of the depths of our inner
consciousness. That        is,  in fact, what never has been done in the
whole history of the art, as far as wo know            for the very reason that
                                                         ;
all true architecture, as remarked above, arises out of practical require
ments, and      is   acontinual attempt to improve upon the method of
meeting    these  requirements and of giving aesthetic expression to them,
so that every change in the form and style of architectural design is
linked with and developed from that which preceded it.
     Whenever this has not been so,      it   isbecause some particular form
of the architecture of the past has been seized upon for reproduction
and imitation, consciously and on sentimental rather than logical
grounds;    a   proceeding which has always resulted in producing a
sense of pretence and unreality, dissatisfying in the end even to those
who have initiated the movement.
     We may, however, usefully study the illustration of the principles
of logical design in architecture as exhibited in the two greatest and
most complete of existing styles — the Greek and the Gothic.
     The Greek Doric temple was structurally              very simple erection,
                                                             a
                                                              "
consisting of central cell with
                 a                   a   kind of " verandah round  it,  formed
of upright pillars which carried horizontal beams, which again carried
short vertical blocks supporting the cornice, which on the flanks of
the building formed the termination of the slope of the roof, while at
the ends there was also      a    raking cornice defining the angle of the
roof-slope,    and   forming    the  finish of the roof in the longitudinal
direction.
     Now,   if we denude the Doric temple of every feature which         is not
necessary     to  its  stability,  and   reduce     to
                                                    it   its more  constructive
elements, we have such      a   building as    isrepresented in the left-hand
 side of Fig.    1
                 ;   an erection merely of square stone supports, carry
 ing stone lintels laid from one to the other, these in turn carrying
 the shorter vertical blocks which support the cornice, and between
 which are left square openings — "metopes" (/lerowra), intermediate
 spaces — which, probably, in the simpler and earlier form of structure
 that preceded the complete temple, were loft morely as openings for
 light or air.       If we regard such   a    structure as representing the

1879.]              on the Logic  of Architectural Design.               91
primary elements of the Doric temple, and consider what are the
motives for the architectural treatment given to the various features,
we can without much difficulty trace in imagination the stages of trans
formation through which the square column might have gone in attain
ing its complete form as a Doric column. It would soon appear, for
example, that the square column had a heavy and ponderous effect,
and that it would fulfil its practical ends just as well if the angles
were cut off, so as to lighten it in appearance and render it more elegant
in effect, and from this it would be an obvious step to remove the
angles again, and reduce it to a figure of sixteen sides (A, B, C, Fig. 1).
But it would be found that on doing this the planes of the contiguous
faces of the shaft lay at too small an angle to one another for effect,
that in certain lights the angle of incidence of the two planes would
be nearly lost to the eye, and hence the practice of slightly hollowing
each face so as to emphasize the meeting angle by a line of light and
shadow.     The reducing of the area of the column by thus cutting
away the angles would, however, leave a less satisfactory bearing on
the top of the column for the ends of the cross lintels ; the column
would carry their weight just as well, but it would not appear to do it
so well— the lintel, for the appearance of security (which in architec
ture is only second in importance to actual security), would require a
broader seat of a square form, and this would be supplied by the
interposition of a broad stone or tile (abacus) between the lintel and
the top of the column.        This is the actual form which is found in
what have been called the " Proto-Doric" columns at Beni-Hassan,
many centuries before the Greek Doric took its complete form. The
intermediate steps between the two, which doubtless onco existed, are
lost ; we have indeed forms of early Doric at Pestum and elsewhere
in Sicily, as well as at Corinth, but these, though ruder than the
Athenian Doric, have already gone through many stages of advance
since the first Egyptian type. Passing over these (for we are not now
dealing with architecture historically) and turning to the complete
Doric, it is very significant to observe what were the additions and
refinements which were arrived at in this completed form of the style.
One of these is the more full and marked hollowing of the faces of the
column, so as to give more decided shadow and strengthen the vertical
lines. These channels or " flutes" are increased to twenty-four, and
the logical suitability of this division is seen on considering the
plan of the column in connection with that of the abacus (Fig. 5),
where it will be observed that with twenty-four flutes the sinking of a
channel is brought under the centre of the flat of the abacus (D), and
the edge of a channel is brought under the angle of the abacus (£), so
that a more complete relation between these two parts of the design
is established. The diminution of the column upward is a very im
portant change, and one the necessity of which, msthctically speaking,
appeals perhaps more to our instinct than our reasoning faculty.        It
may be reasoned, however, that greater stability, both in reality and
appearance, is imparted to the column by slightly widening it at
                                                               h 2

the base; but the demand for upward diminution which the eye
instinctively makes* in regarding such a feature is, perhaps, partly
traceable to an unconscious generalization from the observation of the
almost universal tendency to upward diminution in vertical objects in
nature, in the trunks of treos and stems of plants, &c. But the line
of the diminishing column makes an awkward angle with the hori
zontal face of the abacus, and to join this feature more harmoniously
with the neck of the column, we find a rounded member introduced
botween them (F, Fig. 3, 4), spreading under the abacus and appearing
to collect the weight of the superstructure and concentrate it on the
neck, or we will rather say the wrist, of the column. This juncture of
the rounded moulding (echinus) with the shaft is therefore an important
point in the architectural design : it is the transference of the weight
of the superstructure to its support ; it is the point where, following
upwards from the ground, the vertical tendency of the design ends
and its horizontal tendency begins. And we find it duly marked by a
series of striations (annulets) cutting across the shaft (G), emphasizing
this point in the design, stopping the vertical flutings of the shaft by
lines in an opposing direction (just as in a piece of music we stop the
progress of the composition at its close by a repetition several times
of the chord of the key), and serving to bind together and strengthen
 the appearance of the whole feature at this point, very much as (to
compare the physical with the aesthetic) the annular ligature in the
human wrist binds together the muscles of the arm. We have here,
 then, a feature entirely specialized to represent the capability of
carrying vertical weight ; a foature in which all the decorative treat
ment is directly designed in furtherance of that idea, and not the
 slightest ornament is introduced which does not assist constructive
 expression.
       The principal lintel (architrave), which rests on the columns and
 carries the whole of the superstructure, is subjected to the most
 trying stress to which building material can bo subjected, that of
 " cross-strain " at right angles to the direction of its bearing, a strain
 which acts with special disadvantage upon a granular material with
 little tensile strength, such as stone or marble. All its substance is
 therefore required for stability ; nothing of it is cut away, and no
 decoration is introduced in a feature which is doing too much hard
 work to afford a suitable field for ornament, f Above tho architrave
 wo again find vertical supports in tho shape of the triglyphs or three-
 channelled members which carry the cornice, and here again the vertical
 channelling of these features (H, Fig. 3) has the same function as the
 flutings of the column, that of assisting the expression of verticality ;
 while the cornice, which essentially is only the overhanging of the roof
      * That the eye
                      instinctively and unconsciously demands this is obvious, from
 the unquestionable fact that a column or pilaster with absolutely parallel sides
 appears larger at the top than at the bottom.

to keep the rain off the walls, is on the same principle strongly marked
with horizontal lines and mouldings (for, as it has no weight to carry,
we can play with it as we please), in order to emphasize horizontality,
and also to form a decisive stop and finish to the vertical lines of the
structure, just as the annulets of the column form a stop to the vertical
lines of the fluting.       The small flat blocks under the cornice (mutules)
have probably a very distant reference to the wooden roof of a timber
building and the ends of its rafters, almost the only point which gives
any ground for the idea of the wooden origin of the style, which is in
general very doubtful, or more than doubtful : the part which these
features play in the complete Doric is to break the long line of the
cornice and its shadow, and connect it with the repetition of parts
which forms an essential element in the substructure.                The slope of
the pediment expresses, of         course,   the  slope   of the  roof, and would
 have no meaning otherwise.           The triangular space beneath the pedi
 ment is structurally unimportant ; in a small building (or in a timber
 one) it might be open ; in a larger one its masonry is required to
 carry the blocks of tho cornice, but it is structurally a secondary
portion, and therefore is not unfittingly made a receptacle for sculp
 ture, which is also suitably applied in the spaces formed by the
 metopes ; spaces which are intorstructural, and might be left empty,
and in which the sculpture is, in fact, executed on the face of com
paratively thin slabs of stone not calculated to carry any great weight,
 and having only empty space behind them.*
      So far we have been dealing with a method of building in which
 all the pressures exerted by the materials are vertical, and, as we have
 seen, the design precisely expresses this constructive system.             Greek
 architecture is, constructively, the placing of a horizontal beam on
 vertical supports ; and no construction is so simple in its problems
 and so enduring in its stability as this : it is however a construction
 wasteful in material, necessitating also the use of large blocks, and
 limited in the size of its openings by the incapability of the material
 to carry over more than a small distance without breaking even under
 its own weight alone. The principle of the arch, first employed on a
 large scale and in a systematic manner by the Romans, relieves the
 architect from these restrictions ; it enables him to bridge over large
 spaces with comparatively small stones, and it employs the material
 in the way in which it is strongest, in a state of simple compression,
 and without the disadvantageous effect of cross-strain.             But the pres
 sures which an arched building exercises differ entirely from those of
 a lintel building.      An arch is exercising upon its points of support
 an outward or expanding pressure, the angle of which varies with the
 shape of the arch and the weight and position upon it of the supcr-
     * In Mr.  Tadema's picture, " The Love Missile," a sculptured metope slab is
 shown as movable on a pivot, and turned round on its centre at right angles to
 the wall, so as to leave the space open at either side : an arrangement which very
 likely was at times made in Roman imitations of Greek building.

 structure   : and the aesthetic expression which is true for a lintel
  building   cannot  be true for an arched building.         This was exactly
  what the Romans, who wero great engineers but bad artists, did not
  perceive. They could not invent an architectural expression of their
  own ; they faced their arched constructions with a mask borrowed
  from the columnar architecture of the Greeks (Fig.                    6),
                                                                 but having no
  reference to the real construction of the building, which in fact it
  contradicted   :or they interposed       slice of the Greek lintel super
                                             a
   structure uselessly between the capital and the arch which should
  have sprung from     it  (Fig.      being accustomed to see
                                     7)  ;                              column    a
  carry an architrave and cornice, they could not conceive its existence
  witheut these members even when their use and meaning were gone.
  Their design was therefore aesthetically false and illogical.
       Let us consider the problem of the arched building little more         a
  in detail. Its simplest form is what            called
                                                     is      " barrel-vaulted "
                                                                    a
  building, roofed by continuous arch from end to end (Fig. 10). To
                       a
  resist the expansive thrust of this arch we must have very thick walls,
  so as to keep the line of pressure within the thickness of the wall, the
  equilibrium of which         otherwise endangered but this again is a
                                is                              :
  method very wasteful of material. If, however, we can introduce cross-
  arches intersecting the main arch (11), we find the result          to collect
                                                                              is
  the pressure of the arches at certain equidistant points along the wall,
  and if  we can secure these points, we can afford to build the intervening
  portions almost as thin as we like, or even (theoretically) to omit the
  wall altogether between the points of support, as does nothing towards
                                                            it
 carrying the arches.     Leaving for moment the question of the treat
                                             a
 ment of these supporting points or piers, we have one or two more
 difficulties to contend with in our arched construction.            A circular
 arch on   a large scale has practically      tendency to sink at the crown,
                                                 a
  the joints on either side of the keystone becoming so nearly vertical
  as to allow of the stone slipping under the influence of very slight
 settlement in the abutments; and this danger is increased in the
 cross- vaulting, where the oblique arch formed by the intersecting
 vaulting surfaces    isan ellipse, and therefore still flatter at the crown.
 But new difficulty meets us again as soon we have to cross-vault a
      a
 space which     isnot a  square (12), but       larger on one side than the
                                                     is
 other. For as the two intersecting arches must rise to the same height,
 and as the relation of height to width            rigidly fixed in the semi
                                                      is
 circular arch, wo must either employ segment of circle only for the
                                                 a                  a
 wider arch (12a), or else spring the smaller one from            higher point
                                                                         a
 than the other (126), so that the crowns of the two may coincide in
                                                      "
 height. The latter expedient (called " stilting the arch) was the one
 usually adopted by the Roman and Romanesque builders; but the
 effect in either case     that the oblique arch formed by the intersection
                           is
 of these two curves of different elements gives crippled and sinuous
                                                            a
 line very unsightly and weak in appearance.
      Theso three difficulties with the round arch are what made Gothic
.architecture, the architecture of pointed arches and buttresses, which

bas been often supposed to bave arisen from a mere sentimental pre
ference for the form of the pointed arch. But architectural styles
have in their growth and origin little to do with sentiment ; the
sentimental interest is projected back upon them from our own feelings.
So completely is this idea of the sentimental origin of the pointed arch
contradicted by fact, that in buildings of the Transition period, such
as Eirkstall and Fountains Abbeys, we actually find the larger arches
which carry the main structure pointed, and the smaller ornamental
arches in higher parts of the building circular ; the necessary conclusion
being that the round arch was preferred and the pointed form only
used in the larger arches for constructional       reasons.   But the main
value of the pointed arch to the mediaeval builders lay in the fact that
by its use the difficulty of intersecting vaults of different spans was
got over, practically at least if not quite theoretically.       As will be
seen (at 12c), the use of the pointed arch enables us to build arches
of varying widths and of the same height, and having a curvature so
nearly similar as to render it practically easy to treat them as inter
secting arches without an unsightly twist of the intersecting lines ;
and what little difficulty there would have been in securing the neat
adjustment of the two curves was obviated by the introduction of the
" vaulting rib " at the angles of intersection of the curves (13), on either
side of which the curves of the vaulting surfaces, divided from each
other by the deep and strongly-marked mouldings of the rib, could be
adjusted as far as necessary to harmonize with the curve of the rib ;
and this introduction of the vaulting rib, and the aesthetic prominence
given to it in the design, constituted a perfectly logical treatment, for
it represented the real construction of the Gothio vault, which, instead
of being, like the Roman vault, an intersection of two arched surfaces,
became in reality a framework of arched ribs, between which the
vaulting surfaces were carried, the ribs assuming the real constructive
function (Fig. 14).
     Only one practical difficulty remained in designing a vault, a very
slight one, but which had important results in determining the latest
and in some respects most beautiful form of Gothio vaulting.            This
difficulty arose from the fact that the vaulting ribs near the springing,
where they come down on the top of the capital, had to be run into
each other (" mitred ") in order to collect them on the small space of
the capital from which they were to appear to spring.           And as the
ribs were still of varying lengths and curvatures and left the capital
at different angles, their adjustment so as to break off from each other
symmetrically and at the same height was a matter of some difficulty
and necessitated a good deal of humouring of the vaulting lines at
this point. The invention of the fan vault, the effect of which is so well
known in King's College Chapel and Henry VII.'s Chapel, got over
this defect, and rendered the whole perfectly logical.      By intercepting
all the vaulting ribs by an arc of a circle (plan, Fig. 15) at their highest
points, instead of letting them all run up to the ridge of the roof, they
were all reduced to precisely the same length, could all have the same

curvature and all leave the point of springing (the capital) with the
same curve and at the same angle, and thus the design of the vault became
theoretically as well as practically logical, and no adjustment or humour
ing was necessary to make it look exactly as it was intended to look.
The fan vault thus forms a peculiarly significant illustration of the
predominance of logic in architectural design, since it is perhaps of
all architectural features that which to an inconsiderate observer might
seem most entirely the spontaneous result of fancy and artistic taste
playing easily with the materials before           it,
                                                  whereas         in reality, as

we see, the final solution of        struggle with
                                     a                    practical difficulty,

carried on through many generations. What is, however,                  curious       a
fact in regard to the fan vault,        that just as the harmonious treat
                                         is
ment of the vaulting ribs in regard to design was secured, their
constructive function ceased.       The fan vault was really an inverted
conoid generated by the revolution of the transverse arch upon its
point of springing.     The vault had been gradually tending towards
this form with the multiplication of the vaulting ribs, as seen in Fig.
14, representing      late form of vault previous to the fan vault and
                       a                                                                   ;
when this latter form was actually assumed            was found that the ribs
                                                         it
were structurally superfluous — that        was more convenient to build
                                              it
the whole as      solid arched conoid than to build ribs and fill in the
                   a
spaces between them.       Thus the ribs in the fan vault became only
a  " survival," and are really       feature of architectural expression,
                                     a
fulfilling the same kind of function as the flutes of         classic column

wall against which the thrust of the vaulted roof           collected
                                                                  is       Both        ?
the Romans and the early Gothic builders felt the necessity of added
strength in the wall at these points but the Romans merely applied
                                              ;
columns to the wall at these points (Fig. 16), and the Romanesque
builders projected the wall in       a flat pilaster.    But the pressure of
the vault upon the walls       an oblique one, tending to thrust the wall
                                is
outward   ;    must therefore logically be met by feature which should
              it                                              a
obviously be intended to resist oblique pressure and to express that
resistance. It was reserved for the builders of the complete Gothic
period, in their desire to find ample abutment for the security of their
increasingly daring and adventurous vaulting, to develop the true
esthetic form for meeting this oblique thrust, the buttress (Fig. 17),
with its lines sloping upward to meet the line of the vaulting-thrust,
and the flying buttress, carrying this thrust of the centre vault clear
over the roof of the aisle and resolving             into the opposing mass

the building to hold       up. Thus the expression of the construction

in the design became once more complete and logical, as                had not        it
been since the decease of Greek architecture.            And        instructive

vaulted roof has altered the whole method of building.       If we compare
the type of Roman plan with that of Gothic plan, we find that while
in the Roman building the main line of wall is parallel with the
line of the building (Fig. 18), in the Gothic structure the wall may
actually be said to have been cut up into sections and placed edge
ways to the building (Fig. 19) — for that is what the buttress in its
full development really is.
     We might trace this course of logical development through other
details in Gothic architecture ; we might notice for instance, how the
elaborately grouped mouldings of the arches in a fourteenth century
Gothic building arose simply from the convenience, when building with
the small stones which the medisBval architects used, of dropping one
thickness in the courses of arch-stones below the others (Fig. 20), so
as to gain strength witheut heaviness and to avoid the bad appearance
of a number of joints on the under face of the arch ; how by degrees
the edges of the arches thus left were more and more elaborately
relieved by mouldings, and how even in the most elaborate and com
pletely moulded arch the order and arrangement of the mouldings
retains the impression of their original growth from the rectangular
section, formed by the two or more orders of arch-stones one within
another. But there is an even broader and more important branch
of architectural logic yet to be mentioned : that which involves the
relation between the plan and the design of the whole building.
For architecture, as the aesthetic expression of building, cannot be
rightly estimated unless it is remembered that it is based upon the
plan and arrangement of the building, and must in its external
features express these. As an example of correct architectural expres
sion in this respect we may take the Houses of Parliament.           In this
building one great feature of the plan is the central octagon in which
the main corridors of the Upper and Lower Houses meet, and which
forms the rallying point of the internal traffic of the building ; and the
 position and importance of this point in the plan are indicated externally
by the central spire or lantern which rises above it. The royal entrance,
again, is marked by tho Victoria tower ; and the clock-tower, which is
 a utilitarian feature with quite a different object, is designed quite
 differently from the Victoria tower, and in accordance with its practical
 object as a means of carrying a great clock high in the air ; the shaft
 of the tower, as it may be called, being merely a support on which to
 carry the clock stage.     If  Barry had designed (as some critics have
 said he should   have   done)  two  similar Victoria towers symmetrically
balancing    each other,  and made   one of them the clock-tower, he would
 have committed an architectural        falsity in designing in a similar
manner two features the objects of which were entirely different. The
 want of logical relation between plan and design is unfortunately only
too constantly illustrated by modern buildings in which the exterior
 is treated as a perfectly symmetrical whole, while the interior is
 divided into numerous small rooms for various practical purposes, in
 a manner of which not tho least hint is conveyed in the exterior aspect

 of the building, which thus becomes merely an architectural mask or
 screen, having no meaning whatever.
     The influence of the material used and the atmosphere under
 which it is to be seen, will also be manifest in any architecture
 designed in logical accordance with practical conditions.      If  wo com
 pare  Greek and  Gothic  details, such as mouldings  and carved ornaments
for instance, we find in the former (Figs. 8, 9) delicate contours and
minute refinements of modelling, which could only be satisfactorily
executed in a hard and enduring material like marble, and only satis
factorily seen under a bright sky and in a clear air : in Gothic detail,
 on the other hand, we find deep hollows and powerful rounded
mouldings, and broad, bold, and deeply-cut foliage ornament (Figs.
 21, 22), of much coarser type than the Greek, but precisely suited
for execution in a comparatively coarse granulated material, to be
seen under a sky frequently obscured with cloud and mist, the re
sult of a damp atmosphere. It is in respect to these conditions that
attempts to reproduce Greek architecture in this country have been
and always must be failures, even apart from all considerations as
to the value of a reproduced architecture.        We cannot have Greek
architecture here unless we can have the Greek climate and the
Pentelic marble.
     The almost entire deficiency of proper logical relation between
practical facts and their aesthetic expression is the characteristic of
modern architecture, which thus has lost its meaning as an art, and
its strongest hold over our interest.       The art has been reduced by
the architects to a series of reproductions of the forms of past
historical styles, and by the engineers (who are now doing over again
exactly what the Romans in their day did) to the arbitrary application
of features supposed to be architectural, in order to cover and mask
construction with what they call ornament.         This is carried to such
an extent that often constructions are absolutely vulgarized and made
absurd by this false architectural clothing, which if left in their
practical simplicity would be comparatively pleasing, perhaps even
positively so ; for structures which, like engineering works, are
designed to maintain their stability amid the action of the forces
of nature, must almost necessarily, if simply treated, assume forms
which are to a certain extent in harmony with nature.              But tho
arbitrary bedizening   of  such  structures with borrowed  architectural (?)
features which have no relation to their structure or purpose, neces
sarily produces a result which is at variance alike with nature and
with art. It is only by the more rigorous exorcise of theught in
regard to the purpose and meaning of architecture that we can hope
to extricate ourselves from these vain repetitions of features of archi
tecture of the past into which we have drifted (and of which the last
fashion, called the " Queen Anne style," is the very worst and most
unmeaning that has ever been started), and to produce architecture
which shall have a meaning and purpose and expression directly
relatod to the conditions of life in this country and in the present day ;

Strasburg Cathedral, which still warns the traveller of the tempest
seen from afar, sweeping over the Vosges ; the small bell Horrida, the
tocsin of 1316, covered with mildew, which hangs high up in Notre-

bells, that my utmost efforts to obtain the loan of a Hemony or Van

the bells leave the country.
     Bells rule and mark each impressive occasion of life. We can
perhaps hardly realize the extent to which the montonous life of the
old monks was bound up with the ringing of various bells.           At the
sound of the signum, or tower-bell, the whele monastery was roused
from slumber at an early hour; the squilla summoned them to their
frugal meal in the refectory ; but if any of the monks were pacing the
cloisters at the time and heard not the squilla, then the campanetta or
cloister-bell was rung.      The cymbalum was also used in the cloister.
The abbot had his codon, or small handbell, shaped like the orifice
of a Greek trumpet ; with this he summoned to his oratory or study
the servile brother whose duty it was to attend to his call, whilst the
petasius, or larger hamibell, would be used occasionally to call the
monks in from cultivating the fields.        The tiniolium, or dormitory-
bell, called the monks to bed.     In the night-time the noctida or dupla,
or clock-bell, struck to remind the brethren when they should rise .and
pray ; whilst the dreaded corrigiuncula, or scourging-bell, summoned
the ascetics to their flagellatory devotions.    But the bell of all others
which awoke, and ever awakes, in the breast of Catholics the pro-
foundest emotion is the silver-toned nola or choir-bell, rung at the
consecration of the elements : when that shrill and irregular ring is
heard through the church the monks fall prostrate and cross them
selves; the dread miracle is being at that moment consummated.
    The bells say, " Le roi est mort," and they say, " Vive le
      "
roi ! they ring for the decapitation of one king, and the coronation
of another ; for the marriage of one royal wife, and the execution of

musical note when struck.        There should be no doubt about the
note — you should be able $o hum it.        This may not have been, nay,
is not, always the case with bells; still that is what the bell has
grown to, what it arrives at and realizes at its best.

      The bell has a long past, and it will have a long future ; it did
not attain its present shape, or quality ,-or size all at once, it took
thousands of years
      About a.d. 180, Lucian mentions the clepsydra, or water-bell— a
bell rung periodically as the water fell from one level to another,
marking the time. The Bomans used bells to call to the bath,
and the Christian Church adopted them about as>. 400. France had
them in 550, England in 680, and Switzerland in the tenth and
eleventh centuries possessed a great many. There is St. Grall's bell,
still preserved at the monastery of St. Gall, in Switzerland, and
St. Patrick's bell, still to be seen in Belfast; but these are more
interesting as curiosities than as bells.     They are small quadrilateral
handbells, made of metal plates, and can never have had a good
sound.     In 1400, we get bells of larger calibre : in Paris, the bell
Jacqueline, and another of eleven tons, as they say, but      I doubt tho
figures.    The great bell Amboise, 1501, of Rouen, is said to havo
weighed about fifteen tons ; but whatever the exact weight, it supplies
good evidence of the comparatively heavy calibre of bells in France
at that time. But with the dawn of the sixteenth century we are on
the threshold of the musical age of bells, and it is a most important
epoch because it marks the dawn of modern music also. The elements
of music had been in the world for centuries, as you know ; the
Greeks, even the Jews and Egyptians, had elaborated an art of music ;
but modern music is an affair of the last four hundred years, and
it could not exist before the discovery of the modern octave, or the
uniform arrangement of tones and semitones in each key, and the
" perfect cadence." This discovery is marked by tho name of Monte
verdi.   ....
      The rise of music was naturally marked by the rise of singing-
schools and the improvement of musical instruments.          For centuries
the violin had been coming together — every conceivable shape, size,
 and quality had been tried before it began to assume, in the hands of
 Magini and the Amatis, something like its classic form ; and for
 centuries bells had been vibrating through every conceivable shape
 and proportion before the great bellsmiths Van den Gheyn and
 Hemony fixed the shape, which has never since been seriously
departed from with impunity, and to which we shall Have to return if
 we want to make good bells.
                             I
      It is interesting and, think, significant to notice how the bell
 and the violin both settled into their truo shapes about tho time that
 the modern octave was prepared for them, and the modern musical
 art created, and not before.    I  think   I  may claim to have been the
 first to call attention to this in the pages of 'Music and Morals,'
 and   I  will once more ask you to note tho dates. In 1562, Peter
 Van den Gheyn, thB real father of the modern bell, set up his modest
 carillon at Louvain.     In 1540, Andrew Amati, the father of the
 violin, set up his school at Cremona. From 1658 to 1750 we have
 the great bell period, perfected from Hemony to Matthias Van den

Gheyn; and from 1660 to 1730 we have the great violin period,
perfected from Nicolas Amati to Stradiuarius.
     Some of my friends are up in arms when            I say the English bell-
founders are probably indebted to the Low Countries for their
successes in the art of bell-casting.            I only wish they were still
more indebted to them.          I  do not mean to say that English bell-

I   said they could not make them in tune — that is a very different
matter. You may have an excellent bell, and it may be quite out of
tune with its fellows, and that is the case with most English bells.
One of the Westminster Abbey bells has this inscription —
                   " Themas   Lester made me
                     And with the   rest  I will agree
                     Seventeen hundred and forty-three."
But the bell's resolution, like other good resolutions, has never been
fulfilled. Many fine bells there aro in England, and well enough in
tune for the mechanical, arithmetical, and muscular exercise called
bell-ringing, but they are not fit for musical purposes. A rough
octave of bells is one thing ; a suite of forty, tuned accurately in
semitones, is quite another.      The English have never aspired to this,
and they cannot do it. It has been done in the Low Countries for
centuries.
     I  have no wish to detract from the merits of English bell-
founders : the Braziers and Brends of Norwich, the Churches of Bury
St. Edmunds, Myles Gray of Colchester, and later on Buddle of
Gloucester, Phelps, the testers, the Eayres, Hears, Warner, and
Taylor of Loughborough.           I  rejoice to note that Mr. Baven has
issued a valuable notice of the Cambridge and Suffolk bells.               Mr.
Lukis has dealt with Wiltshire, Mr. Tyssen with Sussex, Mr.
Ellacombe with Somerset and Devon, and Mr. North with Leicester ;
and, doubtless, all the other counties will be in due time canvassed,
and the merits of their bells done ample justice to. But still, it
is odd that when there is an English bell which gives particular
satisfaction, it bears a striking resemblance to the Belgian model.          If
you will cast your eye first upon the section of the much-praised
Lavenham tenor, and then upon the section of Severin Van Aerschedt's
bell (the Hemony pattern), you will see some striking resemblances
between them, in the thickness of the sound-bow, the length of the
 side, and the width of the crown.
     These features can of course only be compared by accurate
 measurement ; but the difference between the shorter bells of Buddall
 or Buddle and the eighteenth century school, and the longer bells of
 Myles Gray appeals at once to the eye, and the longer bell is far
 nearer the Hemony model than the later Buddle.               This is certainly
 unfortunate for those who think that we owe nothing to the Dutch
 masters.   But, indeed, it would have been strange had bells remained
 the only things unaffected by the constant intercourse between

England and the Low Countries, all through the rise and progress
of the great bell-founding period. The Dutch drained our marshes,
painted our best pictures — witness Van Dyke and Rubens — taught us
criticism with Grotius, inspired our fashions in dress, gave us the
loom, and    I believe it was from the Hague that William of Orange
set sail to become king of England; nor do                  I think it would be
difficult to show that when Dutch influence was fresh, there was a
remarkable rapprochement          between      the English and Belgian boll
models : but when trade prejudices arose and Dutch popularity waned,
the bells also deteriorated ; at any rate, note the undoubted fact that
the English and Belgian founders flourished side by side.               Peter Van
den Gheyn of Louvain, 1560, with the Braziers and Brends of
Norwich ; Hemony of Amsterdam, 1658, with Myles Gray, 1625-59,
 of Colchester. Between 1679 and 1755 flourished Richard Chandler
 of Buckingham, Keene of Werksop, Pleasant and Gardner of Sudbury,
 Buddle of Gloucester, and Penn of Peterborough.                The same period
 was marked across the water by the Van den Gheyns, Hemony,
 Dumery, Deklerk, and De Haze.              But it is still more unfortunate for
 those  who   deny  the  influence    of   Dutch   models in England, to find
 a bell of Peter Van den Gheyn hanging at this hour in St. Peter's
 College, Cambridge ; and to note that Wagheven, a Dutchman, had a
 foundry as far west as Nicolaston in Glamorganshire.           You may say per
 haps that we taught the Belgians the art and not they us : but if you
 wish to learn, you go to the people who are experts, and you will find
 that at the time we were casting those rough bell octaves of which
 organists are now beginning to be a little ashamed, the Belgians were
casting complicated series of thirty, forty, and even sixty bells,
 which hang to this day in the towers of Mechlin, Antwerp, and
 Louvain. Of all the Belgian masters, Hemony was the most prolific.
 As Bernardino Luini has flooded Lombardy with his pictures, so has
 Hemony flooded Holland and Belgium with his bells.                  We get quite
 tired of reading his name.         He excelled in little bells, as did Peter
 Van den Gheyn in big ones ; and Severin Van Aerschodt's small bells
 have all his exquisite qualities.        I  noted especially four in semitones
 that hang in the Duke of Westminster's tower at Eaton Hall, as true
 as any pianoforte.      I   tried to get over for the Royal Institution
 an octave of Severin Van Aerschodt's Belgian bells, to show what                I
 mean by a bell octave in tune.         I  did not succeed, but Messrs. Gillett
and Bland lent me four large ones fairly in tune, which served my
purpose. Were the St. Paul's peal as well in tune throughout as
 were those four bells,       I  should be content. But          I   obtained two
 exquisite bells belonging to the carillon then being cast by Severin
 Van Aerschodt for Cattistock Rectory, Dorchester ; they are in tone
 like a fine violoncello, and are tuned to a minor third. No pianoforte
 could be better in tune.
     We know that the pianoforte is never accurately in tune, and
 in bells we must expect a lower standard, and all                 I  seek for in
 any belfry is an ordinary octave good enough to satisfy an ordinary

musical ear; but     I   do not know one single English belfry where
there is even one true octavo, much less one and a half. In a Belgian
suite of forty bells there will probably be bells out of tune ; but we
pass in forty what we may fairly condemn in twelve.                 Now note
where the difficulty seems to be. It usually begins about the seventh
note, sometimes earlier.      The difficulty of casting the upper notes
right with the lower is considerable ; and the St. Paul's peal, like
most others, goes wrong at the critical point.       Now what find fault   I
with in the St. Paul's peal is this: the first seven notes are very fairly
in tune, but the eighth note is sharp for the octave.         That is where
they all begin to go wrong, and then commences an altogether new
tonal series. That is the incurable plague from which all English
bells suffer, a mixed tonal series. You get on very well at first, till
you arrive suddenly at a note which is no portion of the series you
began with.     I   have here a bell of Van Aerschodt's, and one which
Mr. Lewis, the organ builder, kindly lent me ; they are both good
bells, but by no possibility can they ever go together, for they belong
to two different tonal series ; they are trying to be a third, but
nothing will ever make them a third or any interval of the same
octave.   I  also produce a specimen of an incurably bad bell, which
for quite other reasons could never belong to any tonal series at all.
The much-praised bells of St. Saviour's, Sonthwark, by Knight and
Mears, begin well, with the first seven notes fairly true, but the
eighth note is sharp, and after that all is wrong.       Then there are tho
bolls at Fulham, by Huddle, 1729, which are very much admired, and
they possess a very fair octave ; but with tho ninth note they too go
wrong, and never get right again.
     It is just the same with the large suite of twenty bells put up at
Manchester Town Hall by Messrs. Taylor of Loughborough.                  From
A to A you get a fair octave ; from c to o the upper o is sharp, and the
series never recovers itself.       Messrs. Gillett and Bland, perceiving
this, have wisely, in arranging the tunes, made most use of the lower
and medium-sized bells, which are best in tune. Taylor succeeds
best in his medium-sized bells.     I  remember saying to Van Aerschodt,
" It is a very odd thing that the English bells all go wrong at tho

faction.    When the pulses succeed each other with a certain degree
of rapidity, a musical Bound is generated. The scientific instrument
known as the " syren
                          " illustrates this. A musical sound varies in
three ways — in loudness, pitch, and quality.          The loudness depends
on the extent of the vibrations, the pitch on the rapidity of the
vibrations, and the quality on the mode of vibration.           The tuning-
fork demonstrates to the eye the extent and rapidity of these aerial
vibrations ; the pianoforte and violin will enable us to analyze the
quality, which depends on the mode of vibration.
     It is obvious that the same note struck on violin, pianoforte,
flute, &c., differs in timbre, or quality.     What causes that difference ?
Helmholtz has shown us that most musical notes are not simple, but
composite, sounds. He calls these clangs ; they contain within them
certain buried notes, belonging to a fixed series, and these he calls
overtones ; and the quality of every clang * depends upon the number,
order, and intensity of these overtones.        The presence of overtones in
a clang can be easily demonstrated by striking a note on the piano
forte, just releasing the damper of its octave, and by the law of
resonance the overtones, often up to the eighth, will be heard re
sounding sympathetically, which would not be the case were they not
really buried in the clang of the one struck.
                                    Overtones.
     The law obeyed by the overtone series can be seen at a glance,
 and it is to the presence, number, order, and relative intensity of
these overtones that we owe all that variety of musical timbre which
 makes the charm of an orchestra and furnishes with inexhaustible
 tonal resources the empire of musical sound.
      An approximately pure tone like that of a tuning-fork, or the
 upper notes of a piano, is insipid and characterless. Richness and
 character come in with the presence of these latent overtones, the
 order of which the diagram will show you at a glance. All are not
 always present, nor are those present always in the same place of the
series, nor are they always of equal intensity ; therefore it is said that
quality depends on the number, order, and relative intensity of the
overtones present in a clang or composite note. Now as long as we
have but one clang, yielding to the ear but one definite musical note,
the construction of a scale on violin or piano with such clangs is
simple.     But when you come to bells,        I believe you have to deal in
                                * Composite note.

1879.]                           on Bells.                             107
one and the same    bell with a number of different clangs, each with its
series of overtones, the overtones of the different clangs sometimes
overpowering each other, at others tones are found in the bell repre
senting intervals less than a minor third, and producing beats, and at
the same time we get certain deep hums, which      I believe must be due
to what in acoustics are called combination tones.         Now obviously
what a bell aims at musically is one fundamental note, and the
problem is how to subordinate all other clangs, extinguishing those
tones that are discordant, and subduing the overtones of the fun
damental clang, so that none of them drown the desired note of the
bell.    Thus when you strike the bell on the sound-bow you get one
definite note, varying in quality according to the number and propor
tion of the overtones, varying also according to the character and
pitch of any other unextinguished clangs that may be present.
   I   must content myself with pointing here to the elements of the
problems which can only be solved by experiment.        The bell-founder
has, in a word, to contend first with different clangs, secondly with
loud overtones, thirdly with beats, and fourthly with combination
hums ; and the problem is how to obtain the presence in right pro
portion of those tones he requires in order to produce the timbre of
his fundamental note, and how to extinguish those tones which
interfere with the supremacy or quality of his fundamental note.
     Now the Belgians have a summary way of settling all this. They
fix the note, and have a clear perception of the quality they require,
and they find that what they look for goes along with certain
properties easily tested ; they seek by rule of thumb for the presence
of a third, fifth, and octave in each bell, and they tap the bell in
certain places, as I  have elsewhere described, in order to develop this
third, fifth, and octavo ; and any ear trained in bell sounds will be
able to detect the presence of at least the third or fifth, and generally
the octave, in a good Belgian bell.     The presence of these preponde
rating and selected notes is important, as constituting the bell in tune
with itself, a quality of the last importance in musical suites of bells
tuned for the carillon.
            I
     If, now, am further asked upon what depends the manufacture of
                                    I
bells possessing these properties, must again reply generally, in the
first place, quantity and character of the metals ; secondly, shape, pro
portion, and various thicknesses of the bell. Only two metals are now
used in large bells, tin and copper. The Belgians use 23 to 30 per cent,
of tin ; the English lean to more tin, 25 to 31 per cent. Tin makes
the bell sound bright, but it also makes the bell brittle ; and the reason
why the English can afford to put in more of this brittle element is
because they make their bells thicker as a rule ; and the reason why
they are made thicker      is,
                             that instead of being merely chimed, they
are swung round on     a   wheel, which brings the hammer with great
force upon the bell.    If we treated the delicate Belgian bells in this
rough    fashion we   should  probably crack them, though    if   it  were
known that they would be swung, the Belgian makers could doubtless
                                                             i   2

 thicken them to order ; they are not meant in Belgium to be whacked
 like big drums, but to be struck with hammers from pp to ff, like a
 pianoforte.    They resonate more easily than English bells, requiring
 a gentler stroke to elicit their full tone.        In a word, the Belgian bell
 is a musical note, not a gong or a drum. Then again, the thickness
 and general proportions of the bell are of the greatest moment.            Bells
 vary from one-fifteenth to one-twelfth of the diameter at the thickest
 part of the sound-bow, and the height is commonly about twelve times
 the thickness.    English bells are, roughly, as broad as they are long,
 if you measure diameter from outside rim to rim, and length from rim
 to top of canon. But in truth the thickness of the bell at different
 levels is all-important.      The thickness near the top is as important
 as that of the sound-bow, and the diameter of the crown as critical a
 dimension as that of the rim.        The deep, rich tone (in proportion to
 size)  of the smaller  Belgian   bells   is probably largely due to the wide
 top diameter, combined with the thinness in certain proportions of
 the sides half-way down. The way in which altering the thickness
 affects the tone, and even the pitch of a bell, is shown by tho fact that
 a sharp bell can be flattened by shaving off the metal inside above the
 sound-bow ; and Mr. Lewis tells me that he has destroyed beats by
 scooping the bell elsewhere until they disappeared at a certain point,
 but that on continuing to scoop they reappeared.               All this shows
how purely tentative and experimental is at present the art of bell-
founding in England.        In Belgium it is not scientific, but empirical,
 the accumulated experience of ages.          A certain tact or rule of thumb
takes the place of science ; rules there must be, founded on principles,
but the masters cannot explain their secrets.           They produce the work
of art, others are left to discover the laws they have obeyed.             When
we have analyzed their methods we may be able to make their bells.
So thought the Germans when they measured and analyzed Raffaello
and Tintoret, and produced the correct but lifeless banalites of Ary
Scheffer ; so thought Vuillaume when he imitated the Amati fiddles
even to the very worm-holes, but for all that the French fiddles are not
Amatis.     It may turn out that in the making of rich musical bells
like those of Van Aerschodt, there is something which cannot be
taught — the instinct, the incommunicable touch.
      When Severin Van Aerschodt, the lineal descendant of the Van
den Gheyns, the depository of the Hemony traditions, draws his bell,
he will vary his model here, giving amplitude to this line and
depression to that; he has no fixed or proportionately graduated
scale for a suite of bells, but every bell is drawn separately ; he has
no fixed proportion of tin and copper, but for every four bells or so
the quantity of tin is varied.         I   was present lately at the casting
of six large bells     for   the  Courtrai    carillon, Belgium.     When the
glowing pool    of metal   boiled  like  a  sea of  dazzling jasper, and  on tho
surface certain strange lines of sinuous motion began to curl and
circle like live things born in the heat of that unearthly atmosphere,
the master had a ladleful of the crystal fluid taken out and plunged

science, but would     not be wiser to make as good bells before we

Before Elizabeth's time only the half wheel was used, so bells could
never be swung fairly up but the art of bell-ringing made
                                          ;                                  giant                      a

     Bell music comes in with the bell struck by a hammer and treated
as a musical note.
     We hear a good deal about the clapper bringing out the full tone
of the bell  each time — but who wants that in music ? Do you require
a Sims Reeves to bawl out each note at the top of his voice, or
Joachim to play fortissimo throughout ? But in fact the Briton exacts
the wheel of torture and the purgatorial clapper because, unlike the
Belgian, he has never considered his belfry in the light of a musical
instrument.
     Bell music comes in with the barrel, the carillon, clavecin, or
keyboard, and the suite of bells turned in semitones.
     The barrel is similar to the revolving barrel of a musical box ; it
is fitted all over with spikes which lift tongues at whose extremity is
the wire attached to the hammers up aloft, each acting on its own
bell.   Our clock-chimes are thus played ; and in Belgium immense
revolving barrels fitted with thousands of spikes liberate a little flood
of music every ten minutes, and at the hour some melody with full
accompaniment, as from a pianoforte, floats over city towers and
ramparts — and why is not this oppressive?        Ono bell is often too
much for us, how should we endure sixty ? Better far than one ; it is
the one or two, ding, dong, that wear out the tympanum and ruin
house property. Substitute for this little flights of music, and the ear
is charmed and recreated.
     We have to learn the use of small bells mixed with the large
We deal only with heavy peals of ten or twelve.         But substitute a
suite of thirty, ranging from two or ten tons to a few pounds or
hundredweights, and divide the music between them, using no moro of
your big bells than you would of your bass notes on the piano or organ
and how different the result ! Again, it is noise, not music, which the
Briton insists upon in his bells, and when he has got it he abuses it.
     But the triumph of bell music is only reached with the applica
tion of the clavecin or keyboard.     In Belgium the keyboard consists
of jutting pegs, tones and semitones, ranged like white and black
keys, one abovo the other, with a row of pedals for the feet acting on
the big bells.    A smart blow is needful to bring out the full tone, as
the carilloneur sits stripped to his shirt, and proceeds with hands in
gauntlets to manipulate his mighty scales.     The English and Belgian
keyboards have distinct qualities.     The English machinery of Gillett
and Bland substitutes for pegs, keys ; and the lightness of touch rests
with the player.    A lady can play the heaviest suite with ease, for the
instant the hammer drops it is lifted again by independent machinery,
and all that the pressed key does is to let off the hammer as by a hair
trigger.    In the Belgian clavecin the peg has to lift with appropriate
leverage as well as to liberate the hammer — hence the heaviness of the
Belgian touch; but musically the Belgian clavecin, rude as it is,
bears the palm, for the Belgian carilloneur can impart by his stroke
the most delicate pp or emphatic ff ; he can produce at will wonderful
crescondos and decrcscendos, whilo of course he who only liberates a

hammer,     as in the English patent method, cannot control its stroke.
The beautiful English mechanism has been applied by Messrs. Gillett
and Bland to the Manchester carillon and elsewhere.
     At Mechlin the barrel weighs 1J ton, containing 16,200 holes,
and the present tunes for the hour are produced by 2900 nuts or
spikes.      The tunes are changed twice a year by the carilloneur,
M. Denyn. M. Adolphe Denyn is acknowledged to be the first caril-
loneur living ; he is fifty-two years old, strong, thickset, muscular ;
he is most genial and obliging, and a musician of the finest quality.
He has been carilloneur of Mechlin for twenty-nine years, and, as
I failed   to hear him six years ago,     I communicated with him last year
in time, and     was fortunate enough to be present at an exceptionally
fine performance, which was most courteously protracted for an hour
for my benefit.       To hear M. Denyn, go to Mechlin and take your
 stand in the market-place at eleven o'clock on Sunday, or at eleven to
 twelve on Saturday morning.
      It was market-day, and crowds were assembled, and stood in
 groups, after business, about twelve o'clock, to listen to their favourite
 player.     I  stood first at a remote corner of the market-place, and
 after a short running prelude from the top bells, weighing only a few
 pounds and hundredweights, to the bottom ones of several tons,
 M. Denyn broke into a brisk gallop, admirably accented, and sustained
 at a good tearing pace witheut flagging for a single bar.            Such an
 exercise could not last long, as       I quickly perceived when   I ascended
 the belfry and watched him at work.          Whilst he was playing    I made
 my way up        the winding   stairs   of that immense   and  incomparable
 tower, which for majesty and beauty combined has always seemed to
 me to stand absolutely alone.         The room of the carillon keyboard is
  not large, but just suffices to isolate the player from the resonance of
  the bells above and below him. M. Denyn then played me some
  admirably selected flowing melodies with full legato accompaniments,
                                 "
  in the style of " Adelaide        and " Casta Diva." Then he gave me
  a specimen of bravura passages, using the great nine-ton and six-ton
  bells for the melody with his feet, and carrying on a rattling accom
  paniment of demi-semiquavers on the treble bells.            Next, after a
  rapid passage of sweeping arpeggios, he broke into a solemn and
  stately movement, which reminded me of Chopin's " Funeral March."
  This was followed by an elaborate fantasia on airs from the Dame
  Blanche — interrupted by the mechanical clock tune, " Comme on aime
  a vingt ans." M. Denyn waited patiently until the barrel had finished,
  and then plunged rapidly into an extempore continuation, which was
  finely joined on to the mechanical tune, and must have sounded below
  as if the barrel had become suddenly inspired or gone mad.               He
  called my attention especially to the complete control he had over the
 pianos and fortes, now lightly touching the bells, now giving them
  thundering strokes. He wound up with " God save the Queen,"
  beautifully harmonized, and        I   must say that  I never, on piano or
  violin, heard more admirable phrasing and expressive rendering of

and muscle until the whole man became one with the vast machinery
he set in motion — reminded me of some of Bubinstein's finest efforts.
    How indispensable, how historic, and how dignified are the uses of
bells ! And, above all, let us remember that if bells are not music,
they are noise, and that noise is prejudicial to health and exhausting
to the nervous system.     Firstly, then, let us cast our bells in tune ;
secondly, let us cultivate that excellent quality which was so much
admired in the Belgian bells exhibited on the table before you; thirdly,
let us encourage the casting of large suites, for it is the admixture of
the smaller bells which recreates the ear, throws up by contrast the
grandeur of the largo ones, and makes possible the performance of full
pianoforte scores ; and fourthly, let us cultivate the noble art of
carillon clavecin playing, so that our organists shall look to the
belfry for their second keyboard, and the citizens learn to assemble
on Saturday or Sunday afternoon to listen to the compositions of
Handel or Mendelssohn rolled forth on a prodigious scale, from the
most colossal instrument it has ever entered into the heart of man to
conceive or to realize

                           Friday, Feb.   28, 1879.
C. William Siemens, Esq. D.C.L. F.K.S. Vice-President, in the Chair.
                  Sir William Thomson, LL.D. F.R.S.
                       The Sorting Demon      of Maxwell.
                                  [Abstract.]
The word " demon," which originally in Greek meant           a supernatural
being, has never been properly used to signify a real or ideal personi
fication of malignity.
     Clerk Maxwell's "demon" is a creature of imagination having
certain perfectly well defined powers of action, purely mechanical in
their character, invented to help us to understand the " Dissipation of
          "
Energy in nature.
     He is a being with no preternatural qualities, and differs from
real living animals only in extreme smallness and agility. He can at
pleasure stop, or strike, or push, or pull any single atom of matter,
and so moderate its natural course of motion.         Endowed ideally with
arms and hands and fingers — two hands and ten fingers suffice — he
can do as much for atoms as a pianoforte player can do for the keys of
the piano — just a little more, he can push or pull each atom in any
direction.
     He cannot create or annul energy ; but just as a living animal
does, he can store up limited quantities of energy, and reproduce them
at will.    By operating selectively on individual atoms he can reverse
the natural dissipation of energy, can cause one-half of a closed jar of
air, or of a bar of iron, to become glowingly hot and the other ice cold ;
can direct the energy of the moving molecules of a basin of water to
throw the water up to a height and leave it there proportionately
cooled (1 deg. Fahrenheit for 772 ft. of ascent); can "sort" the
molecules in a solution of salt or in a mixture of two gases, so as to
reverse the natural process of diffusion, and produce concentration of
the solution in one portion of the water, leaving pure water in the
remainder of the spaco occupied ; or, in the other case, separate the
gases into different parts of the containing vessel.
     " Dissipation of Energy " follows in nature from the fortuitous
concourse of atoms.      The lost motivity is essentially not restorable
otherwise than by an agency dealing with individual atoms ; and the
mode of dealing with the atoms to restore motivity is essentially a
process of assortment, sending this way all of one kind or class, that
way all of another kind or class.
     The classification, according to which the ideal demon is to sort

114       Sir W.  Thornton on the Sorting Demon   of Maxwell.    [Feb. 28,
them, may be according to the essential character of the atom ; for
instance, all atoms of hydrogen to be let go to the left, or stopped
from crossing to the right, across an ideal boundary; or it may be
according to the velocity each atom chances to have when it ap
proaches the boundary : if greater than a certain stated amount, it is
to go to the right ; if less, to the left.    This latter rule of assort
ment, carried into execution by the demon, disequalises temperature,
and undoes the natural diffusion of heat ; the former undoes the
natural diffusion of matter.
     By a combination of the two processes, the demon can decompose
water or carbonic acid, first raising a portion of the compound to
dissociational temperature (that is, temperature so high that collisions
shatter the compound molecules to atoms), and then sending the
oxygen atoms this way, and the hydrogen or carbon atoms that way ;
or he may effect decomposition against chemical affinity otherwise,
thus: — Let him take in a small store of energy by resisting the mutual
approach of two compound molecules, letting them press as it were on
his two hands, and store up energy as in a bent spring, then let him
apply the two hands between the oxygen and the double hydrogen
constituents of a compound molecule of vapour of water, and tear
them asunder. He may repeat this process until a considerable pro
 portion of the whole number of compound molecules in a given
 quantity of vapour of water, given in a fixed closed vessel, are sepa
rated into oxygen and hydrogen at the expense of energy taken from
translational motions.    The motivity (or energy for motive power) in
 the explosive mixture of oxygen and hydrogen of the one case, and the
 separated mutual combustibles, carbon and oxygen, of the other case,
 thus obtained, is a transformation of the energy found in the sub
 stance in the form of kinetic energy of the thermal motions of the
 compound molecules.       Essentially different is the decomposition of
 carbonic acid and water in the natural growth of plants, the result
 ing motivity of which is taken from the undulations of light or
 radiant heat, emanating from the intensely hot matter of the sun.
      The conception of the " sorting demon," is purely mechanical, and
 is of great value in purely physical science.     It was not invented to
 help us to deal with questions regarding the influence of life and of
 mind on the motions of matter, questions essentially beyond the range
  of mere dynamics.

essential elements of the true theory of sensation. In later times, it

first edition of which was printed in 1747, offers a striking contrast
to the prolixity and confusion of thought which pervade Reid's
'
  Inquiry," of seventeen years later date.f Even Sir William Hamilton,
learned historian and acute critic as he was, not only failed to appre
hend the philosophical      bearing of long-established      physiological
truths ; but, when he affirmed that there is no reason to deny that
the mind feels at the finger points, and none to assert that the brain
is the sole organ of thought, he showed that he had not apprehended
the significance of the revolution commenced, two hundred years before
his time, by Descartes, and effectively followed up by Haller, Hartley,
and Bonnet in the middle of the last century.

laid before the world. The whole matter is put in a nutshell in the
following passages of this notable book :—
    " External objects impressed upon the senses occasion, first, on
the nerves on which they are impressed, and then on the brain,
vibrations of the small and, as we may say, infinitesimal medullary
particles.
    " These vibrations are motions backwards and forwards of the
small particles ; of the same kind with the oscillations of pendulums
and the tremblings of the particles of sounding bodies. They must
be conceived to be exceedingly short and small, so as not to have
the least efficacy to disturb or move the whole bodies of the nerves
or brain.*
     " The white medullary substance of the brain is also the immediate
instrument by which ideas arc presented to the mind ; or, in other
words, whatever changes are made in this substance, corresponding
changes are made in our ideas ; and vice versd."
     Hartley, like Haller, had no conception of the nature and func
tions of the grey matter of the brain.        But, if for " white medullary
substance," in the latter paragraph, we substitute " grey cellular sub
stance," Hartley's propositions embody the most probable conclusions
which are to be drawn from the latest investigations of physiologists.
In order to judge how completely this is the case, it will be well to
study some simple case of sensation, and, following the example of
Reid and of James Mill, we may begin with the sense of smell.
Suppose that    I become aware of a musky scent, to which the namo of
" muskiness " may be given.          I  call this an odour, and   I class it
along with the feelings of light, colours, sounds, tastes, and the like,
among those phenomena which are known as sensations.
     The pure sensation of muskiness is almost sure to be followed
by a mental state which is not a sensation, but a belief, that there is
somewhere close at hand a something on which the existence of the
sensation depends. It may be a musk-deer, or a musk-rat, or a musk-
plant, or a grain of dry musk, or simply a scented handkerchief ; but
former experience leads us to believe that the sensation is due to the
presence of one or other of these objects, and that it will vanish if the
object is removed. In other words, there arises a belief in an external
cause of the muskiness, which, in common language, is termed an
odorous body.
    It is unnecessary for the present purpose to inquire into the
origin of our belief in external bodies, or into that of the notion of
                     * ' Observations on Man,' vol. L p. 11.

1879.]                        on Sensation.                           117
causation.    Assuming the existence of an external world, there is no
difficulty in obtaining     experimental proof that, as a general rule,
olfactory sensations are caused by odorous bodies ; and we may pass
on to the next step of the inquiry — namely, how the odorous body
produces the effect attributed to it.
     The first point to be noted here is another fact revealed by ex
perience ; that the appearance of the sensation is governed, not only by
the presence of the odorous substance, but by the condition of a certain
part of our corporeal structure, the nose.            If
                                                   the nostrils are closed
the presence of the odorous substance does not give rise to the sensa
tion ; while, when they are open, the sensation is intensified by the ap
proximation of the odorous substance to them, and by snuffing up the
adjacent air in such a manner as to draw it into the nose.         On the
other hand, looking at an odorous substance, or rubbing it on the
skin, or holding it to the ear, does not awaken the sensation. Thus,
it can be readily established by experiment that the perviousness of
the nasal passages    is,in some way, essential to the sensory function ;
in fact, that the organ of that function       lodged somewhere in the
                                                 is
nasal passages.    And, since odorous bodies give rise to their effects at
considerable distances, the suggestion       obvious that something must
                                            is
pass from them into the sense organ.        What    this something which
                                                       is
plays the part of an intermediary between the odorous body and the
sensory organ     ?
     The oldest speculation about the matter dates back to Democritas
and the Epicurean School, and     it   isto be found fully stated in the
fourth book of Lucretius.        It comes to this: that the surfaces of
bodies are constantly throwing off excessively attenuated films of
their own substance and that these films, reaching the mind, excite
                      ;
the appropriate sensations in it.
    Aristotle did not admit the existence of any such material films,
but conceived that     it  was the form of the substance, and not its
matter,   which   affected   sense, as  a  seal impresses wax, without
losing anything    in   the process.   While  many,     not the majority,
                                                            if
of the Schoolmen took up an intermediate position, and supposed
that a    something which was not exactly either material or im
material, and which they called an " intentional species," effected the
needful communication between the bodily cause of sensation and the
mind.
    But all these notions, whatever may be said for, or against, them
in general, are fundamentally defective, by reason of an oversight
which was inevitable, in the state of knowledge at the time in which
they were promulgated.       What the older philosophers did not know,
and could not know, before the anatomist and physiologist had done
his work,    is that, between the external object and that mind in
which they supposed the sensation to inhere, there lies          aphysical
obstacle.   The sense organ    is    not    mere passage by which the
                                            a

objects, or the " forms of sensible things, pass straight to the mind ;
on the contrary, it stands as a firm and impervious barrier, through
which no material particle of the world without can make its way to
the world within.
     Let us consider the olfactory sense organ more nearly. Each of
the nostrils leads into a passage completely separated from the other
by a partition, and these two passages place the nostrils in free com
munication with the back of the throat, so that they freely transmit
the air passing to the lungs when the mouth is shut, as in ordinary
breathing.    The floor of each passage is flat, but its roof is a high
arch, the crown of which is seated between the orbital cavities of the
skull, which serve for the lodgment and protection of the oyes, and
therefore lies behind the apparent limits of that feature which in ordi
nary language is called the nose.       From the side walls of the upper
and back part of these arched chambers, certain delicate plates of
bone project, and these, as well as a considerable part of the partition
between the two chambers, are covered by a fine, soft, moist membrane.
It is to this Schneider ian, or olfactory, membrane that odorous bodies
must obtain direct access if they are to give rise to their appropriate
sensations ; and it is upon the relatively large surface which the
olfactory membrane offers that we must seek for the seat of the organ
of the olfactory sense. The only essential part of that organ consists
of a multitude of minute rod-like bodies, set perpendicularly to the
surface of the membrane, and forming a part of the cellular coat, or
epithelium, which covers the olfactory membrane, as the epidermis
covers the skin.    In the case of the olfactory sense, there can bo no
 doubt that the Democritic hypothesis, at any rate for such odorous
 substances as musk, has a good foundation.        Infinitesimal particles
 of musk fly off from the surface of the odorous body, and becoming
 diffused through the air, are carried into the nasal passages, and thence
 into the olfactory chambers, where they come into contact with the
 filamentous extremities of the delicate olfactory epithelium.
                                          "
      But this is not all. The " mind is not, so to speak, upon the
 other side of the epithelium.    On the contrary, the inner ends of the
 olfactory cells are connected with nerve fibres, and these nerve fibres,
 passing into the cavity of the skull, at length end in a part of the
  Drain, the olfactory sensorium.     It is certain that the integrity of
 each, and the physical inter-connection of all these three structures,
 the epithelium of the sensory organ, the nerve fibres and the senso
 rium, are essential conditions of ordinary sensation. That is to say,
 the air in the olfactory chambers may be charged with particles of
 musk ; but, if either the epithelium, or the nerve fibres, or the senso
  rium are injured, or physically disconnected from one another, sensa
  tion will not arise. Moreover, the epithelium may be said to be
  receptive, the nerve fibres transmissive, and the sensorium sensifa-
  cient. For, in the act of smelling, the particles of the odorous sub
  stance produce a molecular change (which Hartley was in all proba

                               on Sensation.                            119

being transmitted to the nerve fibres, passes along them with a

     None the less, however, does it remain true that no similarity
exists, nor indeed is conceivable, between the cause of the sensation
and the sensation. Attend as closely to the sensations of muskiness
or any other odour, as we will, no trace of extension, resistance, or
motion is discernible in them.        They have no attribute in common
with those which we ascribe to matter ; they are, in the strictest sense
of the words, immaterial entities.
     Thus, the most elementary study of sensation justifies Descartes'
position, that we know more of mind than we do of body ; that the
immaterial world is a firmer reality than the material.      For the sen
                     " is known
sation " muskiness                immediately.    So long as it persists, it
is a part of what we call our thinking selves, and its existence lies
beyond the possibility of doubt. The knowledge of an objective or
material cause of the sensation, on the other hand, is mediate ; it is a
belief as contradistinguished from an intuition, and it is a belief
which, in any given instance of sensation, may, by possibility, be
devoid of foundation.      For odours, like other sensations, may arise
from the occurrence of the appropriate molecular changes in the
nerve or in the sensorium, by the operation of a cause distinct from
 the affection of the sense organ by an odorous body. Such " subjec
      "
tive sensations are as real existences as any others and as distinctly
 suggest an external odorous object as their cause ; but the belief thus
 generated is a delusion.    And, if beliefs are properly termed " testi
 monies of consciousness," then undoubtedly the testimony of con
 sciousness may be, and often is, untrustworthy.
     Another very important consideration arises out of the facts as
 they are now known.      That which, in the absence of a knowledge of
 the physiology of sensation, we call the cause of the smell, and term
 the odorous object, is only such, mediately, by reason of its emitting
 particles which give rise to a mode of motion in the sense organ.
 The sense organ, again, is only a mediate cause by reason of its pro
 ducing a molecular change in the nerve fibre ; while this last change
 is also only a mediate cause of sensation, depending, as it does, upon
 the change which it excites in the sensorium.
      The sense organ, the nerve, and the sensorium, taken together,
 constitute the sensiferous apparatus. They make up the thickness
 of the wall between the mind, as represented by the sensation " muski-
 ness," and the object, as represented by the particle of musk in contact
 with the olfactory epithelium.
      It will be observed that the sensiferous wall and the external
 world are of the same nature ; whatever it is that constitutes them
 both is expressible in terms of matter and motion.      Whatever changes

take place in the sensiferous apparatus are continuous with, and
similar to, those which take place in the external world.* But with
the sensorium, matter and motion come to an end ; while phenomena
of another order, or immaterial states of consciousness, make their
appearance.    How is the relation between the material and the imma
terial phenomena to be conceived 1 This is the metaphysical problem
of problems, and the solutions which have been suggested have been
made the corner-stones of systems of philosophy.
    Sensations of taste, however, are generated in almost as simple a
fashion as those of smell.   In this case, the sense organ is the epithe
lium which covers the tongue and the palate ; and which sometimes,
becoming modified, gives rise to peculiar organs termed
                                                              " gustatory
bulbs," in which the epithelial cells elongate and assume a somewhat
rod-like form. Nerve fibres connect the sensory organ with the
sensorium, and tastes or flavours are states of consciousness caused by
the change of molecular state of the latter.     In the case of the sense
of touch there is often no sense organ distinct from the general epider
mis. But many fishes and amphibia exhibit local modifications of the
epidermic cells which are sometimes extraordinarily like the gustatory
bulbs ; more commonly, both in lower and higher animals, the effect
of the contact of external bodies is intensified by the development of
hair-like filaments, or of true hairs, the bases of which are in imme
diate relation with the ends of the sensory nerves. Everyone must

contact of bodies with the ends of the hairs of the head ; and the

If  they are sense organs, they are exceptional in character, in so far
as they do not appear to be modifications of the epidermis.      Nothing
is known respecting the sense organs of those sensations of resistance
which are grouped under the head of the muscular sense ; nor of the
sensations of warmth and cold ; nor of that very singular sensation
which we call tickling.
     In the case of heat and cold, the organism not only becomes affected
by external bodies, far more remote than those which affect the sense
of smell ; but the Dcmocritic hypothesis is obviously no longer per
missible.    When the direct rays of the sun fall upon the skin, the
                                                                "
sensation of heat is certainly not caused by " attenuated films thrown
off from that luminary, but to a mode of motion which is transmitted
to us.   In Aristotelian phrase, it is the form without the matter of the
sun which stamps the sense organ ; and this, translated into modern
language, means nearly the same thing as Hartley's vibrations.      Thus
we are prepared for what happens in the case of the auditory and the
visual senses.   For neither the ear nor the eye receives anything but
the impulses or vibrations originated by sonorous or luminous bodies.
Nevertheless, the receptive apparatus still consists of nothing but
specially modified epithelial cells. In the labyrinth of the ear of the
higher animals the free ends of these cells terminate in excessively
delicate hair-like filaments ; while, in the lower forms of auditory
organ, its free surface is beset with delicate hairs like those of the
surface of the body, and the transmissive nerves are connected with
the bases of these hairs.     Thus there is an insensible gradation in
the forms of the receptive apparatus, from the organ of touch, on the
one hand, to those of taste and smell ; and, on the other hand, to
that of hearing.     Even in the case of the most refined of all the
sense organs, that of vision, the receptive apparatus departs but little
from the general type. The only essential constituent of the visual
sense organ is the retina, which forms so small a part of the eyes of
the higher animals ; and the simplest eyes are nothing but portions of
the integument, in which the cells of the epidermis have become
converted into glassy rod-like retinal corpuscles.     The outer ends of
these are turned towards the light ; their sides are more or less exten
sively coated with a dark pigment, and their inner ends are connected
with the transmiesive nerve fibres. The light impinging on these visual
rods produces a change in them which is communicated to the nerve
fibres, and, being transmitted to the sensorium, gives rise to the sensa
tion — if indeed all animals which possess eyes are endowed with what
we understand as sensation.

     In the higher animals, a complicated apparatus of lenses arranged
on the principle of a camera obecura, serves at once to concentrate
and to individualize the pencils of light proceeding from external
bodies.    But the essential part of the organ of vision is still a layer of
cells which have the form of rods with truncated or conical ends.        By
what seems a strange anomaly, however, the glassy ends of these are
turned, not towards, but away from, the light ; and the latter has to
traverse the layer of nervous tissues with which their outer ends are
connected, before it can affect them.    Moreover, the rods and cones of
the vertebrate retina are so deeply seated, and in many respects so
peculiar in character, that it appears impossible, at firstsight, that they
can have anything to do with that epidermis of which gustatory and
tactile, and at any rate the lower forms of auditory and visual, organs
are obvious modifications.

of a receptive, a transmissive, and a sensificatory portion. The essential
part of the first is an epithelium, of the second, nerve fibres, of the
third, a part of the brain ; the sensation is always the consequence of
the mode of motion excited in the receptive, and sent along the trans-
missive, to the sensorial part of the sensiferous apparatus. And, in
all the senses, there is no likeness whatever between the object of
sense, which is matter in motion, and the sensation, which is an
immaterial phenomenon.
     On the hypothesis which appears to me to be the most convenient,
sensation is a product of the sensiferous apparatus caused by certain
modes of motion which are set up in it by impulses from without.
 The sensiferous apparatuses are, as it were, factories, all of which at
 the one end receive raw materials of a similar kind — namely, modes
 of motion — while, at the other, each turns out a special product, the
 feeling which constitutes the kind of sensation characteristic of it.
     Or, to make use of a closer comparison, each sensiferous apparatus
 is comparable to a musical-box wound up; with as many tunes as
 there are separate sensations. The object of a simple sensation is the
 agent which presses down the stop of one of these tunes, and the more
 feeble the agent, the more delicate must be the mobility of the stop.
      But, if this be the case, if the recipient part of the sensiferous
 apparatus is, in all cases, merely a mechanism affected by coarser or
 finer kinds of material motion, we might expect to find that all sense
 organs are fundamentally alike, and result from the modification of
 the same morphological elements.        And this is exactly what does
 result from all recent histological and embryological investigations.
      It has been seen that the receptive part of the olfactory apparatus
 is a slightly modified epithelium, which lines an olfactory chamber
 deeply seated between the orbits in adult human beings. But, if we
 trace back the nasal chambers to their origin in the embryo, we find
  that, to begin with, they are mere depressions of the skin of the fore

                                                                           123

part of the head, lined by a continuation of the general epidermis.
These depressions become pits, and the pits, by the growth of the
adjacent parts, gradually acquire the position which they finally
occupy. The olfactory organ, therefore, is a specially modified part
of the general integument.
     The human ear would seem to present greater difficulties.        For
the essential part of the sense organ, in this case, is the membranous
labyrinth, a bag of complicated form, which lies buried in the depths
of the floor of the skull, and is surrounded by dense and solid bone.
Here, however, recourse to the study of development readily unravels
the mystery. Shortly after the time when the olfactory organ appears
as a depression of the skin on the side of the fore part of the head,
the auditory organ appears as a similar depression on the side of its
back part. The depression, rapidly deepening, becomes a small pouch,
and then, the communication with the exterior becoming shut off, the
pouch is converted into a closed bag, the epithelial lining of which is
a part of the general epidermis segregated from the rest. The adjacent
tissues, changing first into cartilage and then into bone, enclose the
auditory sac in a strong case, in which it undergoes its further meta
morphoses ; while the drum, the ear bones, and the external ear are
superadded by no less extraordinary modifications of the adjacent
parts. Still more marvellous is the history of the development of the
organ of vision.     In the place of the eye, as in that of the nose and
that of the ear, the young embryo presents a depression of the general
integument ; but, in man and the higher animals, this does not give
 rise to the proper sensory organ, but only to part of the accessory
 structures concerned in vision.    In fact, this depression, deepening
 and becoming converted into a shut sac, produces only the cornea, the
 aqueous humour, and the crystalline lens of the perfect eye.
      The retina is added to this by the outgrowth of the wall of a
 portion of the brain into a sort of bag or sac with a narrow neck, the
 convex bottom of which is turned outwards or towards the crystalline
 lens.    As the development of the eye proceeds, the convex bottom
 of the bag becomes pushed in, so that it gradually obliterates the
 cavity of the sac, the previously convex wall of which becomes deeply
concave.     The sac of the brain is now like a double nightcap ready
for the head, but the place which the head would occupy is taken by
the vitreous humour, while the layer of nightcap next it becomes the
retina.    The cells of this layer which lie furthest from the vitreous
humour, or, in other words, bound the original cavity of the sac, are
metamorphosed into the rods and cones.          Suppose now that the sac
of the brain could be brought back to its original form ; then the rods
and cones would form part of the lining of a side pouch of the brain.
 But one of the most wonderful revelations of embryology is the proof
of the fact that the brain itself    is,at its first beginning, merely an
infolding of the epidermic layer of the general integument. Hence
it  follows that the rods and cones of the vertebrate eye are modified
                                                                   k   2

epidermic cells, as much as the crystalline cones of the insect or crus
tacean eye are ; and that the inversion of the position of the former
in relation to light arises simply from the roundabout way in which
the vertebrate retina is developed.
    Thus all the higher sense organs start from one foundation, and
the receptive epithelium of the eye, or of the ear, is as much modified
epidermis as is that of the nose.       The structural unity of the sense
organs is the morphological parallel to their identity of physiological
function, which, as we have seen, is to be impressed by certain modes
of motion ; and they are fine or coarse in proportion to the delicacy or
the strength of the impulses by which they are to be affected.
    In ultimate analysis, then, it appears that a sensation is the
equivalent in terms of consciousness for a mode of motion of the
matter of the sensorium.       But, if inquiry is pushed a stage further,
and the question is asked, What then do we know about matter and
motion ? there is but one reply possible.        All that we know about
motion is that    it is name for certain changes in the relations of our
                       a
visual, tactile,  and  muscular sensations; and all that we know about
matter is that it is the hypothetical substance of physical phe
nomena — the assumption of the existence of which is as pure a piece
of metaphysical speculation as that of the substance of mind.
    Our sensations, our pleasures, our pains, and the relations of these
make up the sum total of the elements of positive, unquestionable
knowledge.       We call a large section of these sensations and their
relations matter and motion ; the rest we term mind and thinking ;
and experience shows that there is a certain constant order of suc
cession between some of the former and some of the latter.

                           The History   of  Games.*
Before examining      some groups of the higher orders of games, with
the view of tracing their course in the world, it will be well to test
by a few examples the principles on which we may reason as to their
origin and migrations. An intelligent traveller among the Ealmuks,
noticing that they play a kind of chess resembling ours, would not
for a moment entertain the idea of such an invention having been
made more than once, but would feel satisfied that we and they and
all chess-playors must have had tho game from one original source.
In this example lies the gist of the ethnological argument from arti
ficial games, that when any such appears in two districts it must
have travelled from one to the other, or to both from a common
 centre. Of course this argument does not apply to all games.           Some
 are so simple and natural that, for all we can tell, they may often
have sprung up of themselves, such as tossing a ball or wrestling ;
 while children everywhere imitate in play the serious work of grown-
 np life, from spearing an enemy down to moulding an earthen pot.
The distinctly artificial sports we are concerned with here are marked
by some peculiar trick or combination not so likely to have been hit
 upon twice. Not only complex games like chess and tennis, but even
many childish sports, seem well-defined formations, of which the
spread may be traced on the map much as the botanist traces his
plants from their geographical centres.          It may give us confidence
in this way of looking at the subject if wo put the opposite view to
the test of history and geography to see where it fails.           Travellers,
observing the likeness of children's games in Europe and Asia, have
sometimes explained it on this wise : that the human mind being alike
everywhere, the same games aro naturally found in different lands,
children taking to hockey, tops, stilts, kites, and so on, each at its
proper season.      But if so, why is it that in outlying barbarous
countries one hardly finds a game without finding also that there is

 a  civilized nation within reach from whom it may have been learnt ?
 And what is more, how is it that European children knew nothing
 till a few centuries ago of some of their now most popular sports ?
 For instance, they had no battledore-and-shuttlecock and never flew
 kites till these games came across from Asia, when they took root at
 once and became naturalized over Europe.      The origin of kite-flying
 seems to lie somewhere in South-east Asia, where it is a sport even
 of grown-up men, who fight their kites by making them cut one
 another's strings, and fly birds and monsters of the most fantastic
 shapes and colours, especially in China, where old gentlemen may be
 seen taking their evening stroll, kite-string in hand, as though they
 were leading pet dogs.        The English boy's kite appears thus an
 instance, not of spontaneous play-instinct, but of the migration of an
 artificial game from a distant centre. Nor is this all it proves in
 the history of civilization.    Within a century, Europeans becoming
 acquainted with the South Sea Islanders found them down to New
Zealand adopts at flying kites, which they made of leaves or bark
cloth, and called mdnu, or " bird," flying them in solemn form with
 accompaniment of traditional chants. It looks as though the toy
 reached Polynesia through the Malay region, thus belonging to that
drift of Asiatic culture which is evident in many other points of South
 Sea Island life.     The geography of another of our childish diver
sions may be noticed as matching with this. Mr. Wallace relates
that being one wet day in a Dayak house in Borneo, he thought to
amuse the lads by taking a piece of string to show them cafe-cradle,
but to his surprise he found that they knew more about it than he
did, going off into figures that quite puzzled him.         Other Poly
nesians are skilled in this nursery art, especially the Maoris of New
Zealand, who call it maui from the name of their national hero, by
whom, according to their tradition, it was invented ; its various
patterns represent canoes, houses, people, and even episodes in Maui's
life, such as his fishing up New Zealand from the bottom of the sea.
In fact, they have their pictorial history in cat's-cradle, and what
ever their traditions may be worth, they stand good to show that the
game was of the time of their forefathers, not lately picked up from
the Europeans.       In the Sandwich Islands and New Zealand it is on
record that the natives were found playing a kind of draughts which
was not the European game, and which can hardly be accounted for
but as another result of the drift of Asiatic civilization down into the
Pacific.
     Once started, a game may last on almost indefinitely.   Among the
children's sports of the present day are some which may be traced
back toward the limits of historical antiquity, and, for all we know,
may have been old then. Among the pictures of ancient Egyptian
          in the tombs of Beni Hassan, one shows a player with his head
   own so that he cannot see what the others are doing with their
fames
clenched fists above his back. Here is obviously the game called in
English hot-cockles, in French main-chaude, and better described by

having to guess by whom he was hit, or with which hand. It was
the Greek kollabisvios, or buffet-game, and carries with it a tragical
association in those passages in the Gospels which show it turned
to mockery by the Roman soldiers :
                                           " And when they had blindfolded
him . . . they buffeted him . . . saying, Prophesy unto us, thou

Mark xiv. 65.)
     Another of the Egyptian pictures plainly represents the game we
know by its Italian name of morra, the Latin micatio, or flashing of
the fingers, which has thus lasted on in the Mediterranean districts
over three thousand years, handed down through a hundred successive
generations who did not improve         it, for from the first     was perfect
                                                                    it

in the same moment shouting their guesses at the total. Morra            isthe
pastime of the drinking-shop in China as in Italy, and may, perhaps,
be reckened among the items of culture which the Chinese have
borrowed from the Western barbarians.              Though so ancient, morra
 has in  it no touch of prehistoric rudeness, but must owe its origin to
a period when arithmetic had risen quite above the savage level. The
 same    istrue of the other old arithmetical game, odd-and-even, which
 the poet couples with riding on    a    stick as the most childish of diver
 sions, " Ludere par impar, equitare in arundine longfl." But the child
 playing      must be of
              it         a    civilized nation, not of     low barbaric tribe,
                                                            a
 where no one would think of classing numbers into the odd-and-even
 series, so that Europeans have even had to furnish their languages
 with words for these ideas.  I      asked myself the question whether the
 ancient Aryans distinguished odd from even, and curiously enough
 found that an answer had been preserved by the unbroken tradition
 not of Greek arithmeticians, but of boys at play.              A
                                                               scholiast on the
  Ploutos of Aristophanes, where the game              mentioned, happens to
                                                       is

                   it                            afvya, yokes or not-yokes."
                                                  r/
  Now this matches so closely in form and sense with the Sanskrit terms
  for even and odd numbers, yuj and ayuj, as to be fair evidence that
  both Hindus and Greeks inherited arithmetical ideas and words familiar
 to their Aryan ancestors.
      Following up the clues that join the play-life of the ancient and
  modern worlds, let us now look at the ball-play, which has always
  held its place among sports. Beyond mere tossing and catching, the
  simplest kind of ball-play   is    where    aring of players send the ball
  from  hand    to hand.    This  gentle pastime has its well-marked place
  in history.    Thus   the  ancient  Greeks, whose secret of life was to do
  even trivial things with artistic perfection, delighted in the game of
  Nausikaa, and on their vases      is    painted many      ascene where ball-
  play,  dance,   and  song  unite  in one   graceful sport.    The ball-dance
is   now scarcely to be found but as an out-of-the-way relic of old
  custom  ;  yet   ithas left curious traces in European languages, where

the ball (Low Latin lalla) has given its name to the danco it went with
(Italian ballare, ballo, French bal, English ball), and even to the song
that accompanied the dance (Italian ballata, French ballade, English
ballad). The passion of hall-play begins not with this friendly grace
ful delivery of the ball into the next hand, but when two hostile
players or parties are striving each to take or send it away from the
other. Thus, on the one hand, there comes into existence the group
of games represented by the Greek harpaston, or seizing-game, where
the two sides struggled to carry off the ball.            In Brittany this has
been played till modern times with the hay-stuffed souJe or sun-ball,
as big as a football, fought for by two communes,                each striving to
carry it home over their own border.                Emile      Souvestre,    in his
                                                                       game in the
'                                                    of  this  fierce
  Derniers Bretons,' has told the        last story
Ponthivy      district —how    the man   who  had   had   his   father  killed and
his own eye knocked out by Frangois, surnamed le Souleur, lay in
wait for that redoubted champion, and got him down, soule and all,
half-way across the boundary stream.              The murderous soule-play
had to be put down by authority, as it had been years before in
Scotland, where it had given rise to the suggestive proverb, " All is
fair at the ball of Scone." The other class of hostile ball-games
differs from this in the ball having not to be brought to one's own
homo, but sent to the goal of the other side.           In the Greek epikoinos,
or common-ball, the ball was put on the middle line, and each party
tried to seize it and throw it over the adversary's goal-line.                 This
game also lasted on into modern Europe, and our proper English
name for it is hurling, while football also is a variety of          it, the great
Roman blown leather ball (follis) being used instead of the small
hand-ball, and kicked instead of thrown.             Now as hurling was an
ordinary classical game, the ancients need only have taken                 astick to
drive the ball instead of using hands or feet, and would thus have
arrived at hockey. But Oorydon never seems to have thought of
borrowing Phillis's crook for the purpose           it  would have so exactly
suited. No mention of games like hockey appears in the ancient
world, and the course of invention which brought them into the modern
world     is at once unexpected and instructive.
       The game known to us as polo has been traced by Sir W.
Ouseley, in Persia, far back in the Sassanian dynasty, and was at any
rate in vogue there before the eighth century.              It was played with
the long-handled mallet called chugdn, which Persian word came to
signify also the game played with it. This           is the instrument referred
to in the      '
                 Thousand and One Nights,' and among various earlier
passages where     it   occursis   the legend told by the Persian historian
of Darius insulting Alexander by sending him                 a    ball and mallet
((jfui  ve chttgdn) as
                     a    hint  that he was a  boy  more   fit  to play polo than
 to go to war.         When this tale finds its way to Scotland, in the
 romance of King Alisaunde, these unknown instruments are replaced
 by   a   'whipping-top, and Shakspero has the story in the English
 guise of      anewer period in the scene in Henry V. " What treasure,

 uncle   ?      Tennis-balls, my liege."   By the ninth century the game
  of  chugan had established itself in the Eastern Empire, where its
 name appears in the barbarous Greek form T^uKavi^eiv.      In the Byzan
 tine descriptions, however, we find not the original mallet, but a long
 staff ending in a broad bend, filled in with a network of gut-strings.
 Thus there appear in the East, as belonging to the great sport of
 ball-play on horseback, the first shapes of two implements which
 remodelled the whole play-life of medifeval and modern Europe, the
 chugan being the ancestor of the mallets used in pall-mall and
 croquet, and of an endless variety of other playing clubs and bats,
 while the bent staff with its network was the primitive racket.     The
 fine old Persian drawing of a match at chugan, which is copied by
 Ouseley in his ' Travels in the East,' justifies his opinion that the
horseback game is the original. We should not talk of polo as being
"
   hockey on horseback," but rather regard hockey as dismounted polo,
and class with it pall-mall, golf, and many another bat-and-ball games.
 Indeed, when one comes to think of it, one sees that no stick being
necessary for the old foot game of hurling, none was used, but as soon
as the Persian horsemen wanted to play ball on horseback, a proper
instrument had to be invented.         This came to be used in the foot
game also, so that the Orientals are familiar both with the mounted
and dismounted kinds.        The horseback game seems hardly to have
taken hold in Europe till our own day, when the English brought it
down from Munniepoor, and it has now under the name of polo be
come a world-wide sport again.          But the foot-game made its way
early into Europe, as appears from a curious passage in Joinville's
 '
   Life of St. Louis," written at the end of the thirteenth century.
 Having seen the game on his crusade, and read about it in the Byzan
 tine historians, he argues that the Greeks must have borrowed their
tzycanisterium from the French, for it is, he says, a game played in
Languedoc by driving a boxwood ball with a long mallet, and called
there chicane.    The modern reader has to turn this neat and patriotic
argument upside down, the French chicane being only a corruption of
the Persian chugan ; so that what Joinville actually proves is, that
before his time the Eastern game had travelled into France, bringing
with it its Eastern name. Already, in his day, from the ball-game
with its shifts and dodges, the term chicane had come to be applied by
metaphor to the shuffles of lawyers to embarrass the other side, and
thence to intrigue and trickery in general.         English has borrowed
chicane in the sense of trickery, without knowing it as the name of a
game.      Metaphors taken from sports may thus outlast their first
sense, as when again people say,
                                     " Don't bandy words with me," with
out an idea that they are using another metaphor taken from the game
of hockey, which was called bandy from the curved stick or club it was
played with.
     In France, the name of crosse, meaning a crutch, or bishop's

long been known as chueca. The Spaniards taught it to the natives of
South America, who took kindly to        it,  not as mere boys' play, but as        a
manly sport.      It is  curious to read accounts by modern European
travellers, who seem not to recognize their own playground game
when transplanted among the Araucanians of Chili, even though                   it
shows its Spanish origin by the name of chueca. Seeing this, one asks
whence did the North American Indians get their famous ball-play,
known from California right across the Indian country            ?   It to all
                                                                          is
intents the European chueca, crosse, or hockey, the deerskin ball being
thrown up in the middle, each of the two contending parties striving
to throw or drive    itthrough the adversaries' goal. The Iroquois say
that in old times their forefathers played with curved clubs and
a wooden ball, before the racket was introduced, with which to strike,
carry, or throw the leather ball.        Of all the describers of this fine
game, Catlin has best depicted its scenes with pen and pencil, from its
beginning with the night ball-play dance, where the players crowded
round their goals, held up and clashed their rackets, and the women
danced in lines between, and the old men smoked to the Great Spirit,
and led the chant for his favour in the contest.            The painter would
never miss      ball-play, but sit from morning till sundown on his
                a
pony studying the forms of the young athletes in their
                                                                       " almost
superhuman" struggles for the ball, till at last one side made the
agreed number of goals, and divided with yells of triumph the fur
robes and tin-kettles and miscellaneous property staked on the match.
Now, as to the introduction of the game into North America, the
Jesuit missionaries in New France as early as 1636 mention                 it by
their own French name oijeu de crosse, at which Indian villages con
tended " qui crossera le mieux."

The games now developed need not be here spoken of at length pro
portioned to their great place in modern life, as the changes which
gave rise to them are so comparatively modern and well known.               The
Persian apparatus kept close to its original form in the game of pall-
mall, that     " ball-mallct," into which game was introduced the arch
               is,
or ring  to drive  the ball through, whereby enough incident was given
to knocking     itabout to make the sport fit for    a    few players, or even
a  single pair.    An   account  of  pall-mall    and  its  modern revival in
croquet  will be  found  in Dr. Prior's   little book.   Playing   the ball into
holes serves much tho same purpose as sending          it   through rings, and
thus came in the particular kind of bandy called golf, from the clubs
used to drive the ball.      The stool-ball, so popular in mediaeval merry
makings, was played with       a  stool, which one protected by striking
away with his hands the ball which another bowled at        it;   the in-player
was out   ifthe stool was hit, or he might be caught out, so that here          is

evidently part of the origin of cricket, in which the present stumps
seem to represent the stool.        In club-ball a ball was bowled and hit
with a club ; and a game called cat and-dog was played in Scotland
two centuries ago, where players protected not wickets but holes from
the wooden cat pitched at them, getting runs when they hit it.         We
have here the simple elements from which the complex modern cricket
was developed.      Lastly, among the obscure accounts of ancient ball-
play, it is not easy to make out that the ball was ever sent against an
opposite wall for the other players to take it at the bound and return
it. Such a game, particularly suited to soldiers shut up in castle-
yards, became popular about the fourteenth century, under the name of
pila palmaria, or jeu de paulme, which name indicates its original mode
of striking with the palm of the hand, as in fives. It was an improve
ment to protect the hand with a glove, as such may still be seen in the
ball-play of Basque cities, as at Bayonne. Sometimes a battledore
faced with parchment was used, as witness the story of the man who
declared he had played with a battledore that had on it fragments of
the lost decades of Livy.       But it was the racket that made possible
the " cutting
                "                   "
                  and " boasting of the mediasval tennis-court, with its
elaborate scoring by      "  chases."   No doubt it was the real courtyard
of the chateau, with its penthouses, galleries, and grated windows,
that furnished the tennis-court with the models for its quaintly arti
ficial grilles, and lunes so eruditely discussed in Mr. Julian Mar
shall's ' Annals of Tennis.' A few enthusiastic amateurs still delight
in the noble and costly game, but the many have reason to be grateful
for lawn-tennis out of doors, though it be but a mild version of the
great game, to which it stands as hockey to polo, or as draughts to
chess.
     Turning now to the principal groups of sedentary games,         I may
refer to the evidence   I   have brought forward elsewhere,* that the use
of lots or dice for gambling arose out of an earlier serious use of such
instruments for magical divination.           The two conceptions, indeed,
pass into one another.        The magician draws lots to learn the future
and the gambler to decide the future, so that the difference between
                                  "
them is that between " will and " shall." But the two-faced lot that
can only fall head or tail can only give a simple yes or no, which is
often too simple for either the diviner or the gambler.          So we find
African negroes divining with a number of cowries thrown together to
see how many fall up and how many down ; and this, too, is the Chinese
method of solemn lot-casting in the temple, when the falling of the
spoon-like wooden lots, so many up and so many down, furnishes an
intricate result which is to be interpreted by means of the book of
mystic diagrams. When this combination of a number of two-faced
lots is used by gamblers, this, perhaps, represents the earlier stage of
gaming, which may have led up to the invention of dice, in which the
purpose of variety is so much more neatly and easily attained. The

 first appearance of dice lies beyond the range of history, for though
 they have not been traced in the early periods in Egypt, there is in
 the Rig- Veda the hymn which portrays the ancient Aryan gambler
 stirred to frenzy by the fall of the dice.       It is not clear even which
 came first of the various objects that have served as dice.
      In the classic world, girls used the astragali or hucklebones as play
 things, tossing them up and catching them on the back of the hand ;
 and to this day we may see groups of girls iu England at this ancient
 game, reminding us of the picture by Alexander of Athens, in the
 Naples Museum, of the five goddesses at play.           It was also noticed
 that these bones fall in four ways, with the flat, concave, convex, or
 sinuous side up, so that they form natural dice, and as such they
 have been from ancient times gambled with accordingly.             In India
 nature provides certain five-sided nuts that answer the purpose of
 dice. Of course, when the sides are alike, they must be marked or
 numbered, as with the four-sided stick-dice of India, and that which
 tends to supersede all others, the six-sided kubos, which gave tho
 Greek geometers the name for the cube.         Since the old Aryan period
 many a broken gamester has cursed the hazard of the die. We
moderns are apt to look down with mere contempt at his folly.            But
 we judge tho ancient gamester too harshly if we forget that his
passion is mixed with those thoughts of luck or fortune or super
human intervention, which form the very mental atmosphere of the
 soothsayer and the oracle-prophet.       With devout prayer and sacrifice
he would propitiate the deity      who  should give him winning throws ;
nor,   indeed,  in  our  own   day   have  such hopes and such appeals
ceased among the uneducated.           To the educated it is the mathe
matical theory of probabilities that has shown the folly of tho
gamester's staking his fortune on his powers of divination.           But it
must be borne in mind that this theory itself was, so to speak, shaken
out of the dice-box.      When tho gambling Chevalier de Mere put the
question   to Pascal  in how   many throws he ought to get double-sixes,
and Pascal solving the problem, started the mathematical calcula
tion of chances, this laid tho foundation of the scientific system of
statistics which more and more regulates the arrangements of society.
Thus accurate method was applied to the insurance table, which
enables a man to hedge against his ugliest risks, to eliminate his
chances of fire and death by betting that he shall have a new roof over
his head and a provision for his widow. Of all the wonderful turns
of the human mind in the course of culture, scarce any is more striking
than this history of lots aud dice.       Who, in the Middle Ages, could
have guessed what would be its next outcome — that magic sunk into
sport should rise again as science, and man's failure to divine the
future should lead him to success in controlling it ?
     Already in the ancient world there appear mentions of games
where the throws of lots or dice, perhaps at first merely scored with
counters on a board, give the excitement of chance to a game which
is partly a draught-game, the player being allowed to judge with

which pieces he will move his allotted number. In England this
group of games is represented by backgammon.            When Greek writers
mention dice-playing, they no doubt often mean some game of this
class, for at mere hazard the Persian queen-mother could not have
played her game carefully, as Plutarch says she did, nor would there
have been any sense in his remark that in life, as in dicing, one must
not only get good throws, but know how to use them. The Roman
game of the twelve lines (duodecim scripta) so nearly corresponded
with our trictrac or backgammon, that M. Becq de Fouquieres, in his
' Jeux des Anciens,' works out on the
                                            ordinary backgammon board the
problem of the Emperor Zeno that has vexed the soul of many a
critic. All these games, however, are played with dice, and as there
exist other games of like principle where lots are thrown instead of
dice, it may, perhaps, be inferred that such ruder and clumsier lot-
backgammon was the earlier, and dice-backgammon a later improve
ment upon it. Of course things may have happened the opposite
way. Lot-backgammon is still played in the East in more than one
form. The Arabic-speaking peoples call it tab, or game, and play it
with an oblong board or rows of holes in the ground, with bits of
brick and stone for draughts of the two colours, and for lots four palm-
stick slips with a black and white side. In this low variety of lot-
backgammon, the object is not to get one's own men home, but to take all
the adversary's. The best representative of this group of games is the
Hindu pachisi, which belongs to a series ancient in India. It is
played on a cross-shaped board or embroidered cloth, up and down
the arms of which the pieces move and take, in somewhat the manner
of backgammon, till they get back to the central home. The men
move by the tbrows of a number of cowries, of which the better
throws not only score high, but entitle the player to a new throw,
which corresponds to our rule of doubles giving a double move at
backgammon. The game of pachisi has great vogue in Asia, extend
ing into the far East, where it is played with flat tamarind-seeds as
lots.    It even appears to have found its way still farther eastward into
America, forming a link in the chain of evidence of an Asiatic
element in the civilization of the Aztecs.*          For the early Spanish-
American writers describe, as played at tho Court of Montezuma, a
game called patolli, played after the manner of their European tables
or backgammon, but on a mat with a diagram like a -(- or Greek
cross, full of squares on which the different coloured stones or pieces
of the players were moved according to the throws of a number of
marked beans.       Without the board and pieces, the mere throwing
hazards with tho beans or lots, to bet on the winning throws,
furnishes the North American tribes with their favourite means of
gambling, the game of plumstones, game of the bowl, &c.

idea of finding sport in placing stones or pieces on a diagram and
moving them by rule.       One hint as to how this may have come about
is found in the men at backgammon acting as though they were
" counters " counting up the throws. The word abax, or abacus, is
used both for the reckening-board with its counters and the play-
board with its pieces, whence a plausible guess has been made that
playing on the ruled board came from a sportive use of the serious
counting instrument.      The other hint is that board-games, from the
rudest up to chess, are so generally of the nature of kriegspiel, or war-
game, the men marching on the field to unito their forces or capture
their enemies, that this notion of mimic war may have been the very
key to their invention.     Still these guesses are far from sufficient,
and the origin of board-games is still among the anthropologist's
unanswered riddles.      The simpler board-games of skill, that           is,
without lots or dice, and played by successive moves or draws of the
pieces, may be classed accordingly as games of draughts, this term
including number of different games, ancient and modern.

purpose to point out that games worth keeping up hardly die out, so
that among existing sports are probably represented, with more or
less variation, the best games of tho ancients. On looking into the
mentions of the famous Greek draught-game of plinthion, or polis,       it
 appears that the numerous pieces, or " dogs," half of them of one
 colour and half of the other, were moved on the squares of the board,
 the game being for two of the same colour to get one of the other
 colour between them, and so take him. The attempt to reason out from
 this the exact rules of the classic game has not answered. But on
 looking, instead of arguing,
                            I    find that
                                         a  game just fitting the descrip

 to the same group as the simpler classic draughts, where the man                   is
taken between two adversaries.          In modern Europe the older games
 of this class have been superseded by one on different principle. The

 as being, in fact,     alow variety of chess, in which the pieces are all
 pawns, turned into queens in chess-fashion when they gain the adver
 sary's line.     The earliest plain accounts of the game are in Spanish
 books of the Middle Ages, and the theory of its development through
 the medieval chess problems will be found worked out by the best
 authority on chess, Dr. A. van der Linde, in his Geschichte des
                                                                         '

      The group of games represented by the Hindu tiger-and-cows, our
fox-and-geese, shows in         simple way the new situations that arise in
                                   a
 board-games when the men are no longer all alike, but have different
 powers, or moves.        Isidore of Seville (about A.D. 600) mentions, under
 the name of latrunculi,       game played with pieces of which some were

 war-game, and of pieces with different powers moving on the chequer-
 board, were familiar in the civilized world at the time when, in the
 eighth century or earlier, some inventive Hindu may have given them
a   more perfect organization by setting on the board two whole opposing
  armies, each complete in the four forces, foot, horse, elephants, and
 chariots, from which an Indian army            called in Sanskrit chaturanga,

 derived from backgammon. It is argued that the original game was
 the Indian fourfold-chess, played with four half-sets of men, black, red,
 green, and yellow, ranged on the four sides of the board, the moves of
 the pieces being regulated by the throws of dice ; that in course of
 time the dice wero given up, and each two allied half-sets of men
 coalesced into one whole set, one of the two kings sinking to the
 position of minister, or queen.     Now this fourfold Indian dice-chess
 is undoubtedly a real game, but the mentions of it are modern, whereas
 history records the spread of chess proper over the East as early as
 the tenth century.       In the most advanced Indian form of pachiei,
 called chupur, there are not only the four sets of different-coloured
 men, but the very same stick-dice that are used in the dice-chess,
 which looks as though this latter game, far from being the original
 form of chess, were an absurd modern hybrid resulting from the
attempt to play backgammon with chess-men. This is Dr. van der
Linde's opinion, readers of whose book will find it supported by more
technical points, while they will be amused with the author's zeal in
belabouring his adversary Forbes, which reminds one of the legends
of mediaeval chess-players, where the match naturally concludes by
one banging the other about the head with the board.        It is needless
to describe hero the well-known points of difference between the Indo-
Persian and the modern European chess.         On the whole, the Indian
game    has  substantially  held its own, while  numberless attempts to
develop it into philosophers' chess, military tactics, &c., have been
tried and failed, bringing, as they always do, too much instructive
detail into the plan which in ancient India was shaped so judiciously
between sport and science.
                              I
     In this survey of games have confined myself to such as offered
subjects for definite remark, the many not touched on including cards,
of which the precise history is still obscure. Of the conclusions
brought forward, most are no doubt imperfect, and some may be
wrong, but it seemed best t~ oring them forward for the purpose of
giving the subject publicity, with a view to inducing travellers and
others to draw up minutely accurate accounts of all undescribed
games they notice.     In Cook's ' Third Voyage' it is mentioned that the
Sandwich Islanders played a game like draughts with black and white
pebbles on a board of 14 by 17 squares.      Had the explorers spent an
hour in learning  it, we should perhaps have known whether     it  was the
Chinese or the Malay game, or what     it was ; and this might have been
the very clue, lost to native memory, to the connection of the Poly
nesians with a   higher Asiatic culture in ages before a  European ship
had come within their coral reefs.
     It remains to call attention to point which this research into the
                                   a
development of games brings strongly into view.          In the study of
civilization, as of so many other branches of natural history,  a   theory
of gradual evolution proves itself a trustworthy guide. But         it will
not do to assume that culture must always come on by regular un

varying progress.      That, on the contrary, the lines of change may be
extremely   circuitous,  the history of games affords instructive proofs.
Looking over a playground wall at a game of hockey, one might easily
fancy the simple line of improvement to have been that the modern
schoolboy took to using a curved stick to drive the ball with, instead
of hurling it with his hands as he would have done if he had been
a young Athenian of r.o. 600.        But now it appears that the line of
progress was by no means so simple and straight, if we have to go
round by Persia, and bring in the game of poio as an intermediate
stage.   If, comparing Greek draughts and English draughts, we were
to jump to the conclusion that the one was simply a further develop
ment of the other, this would be wrong, for the real course appears to
have been that some old draught-game rose into chess, and then again
a lowered form of chess came down to become a new game of draughts.
We may depend upon it that the great world-game of evolution is not
played only by pawns moving straight on, one square before another,
but that long-stretching moves of pieces in all directions bring on
new situations, not readily foreseen by minds that find it hard to see
six moves ahead upon a chess-board.

                       Molecular Physics in High Vacua.
 When     I  was asked, a month or two ago, to illustrate in this theatre
 some    of my recent researches on Molecular Physics in High Vacua,            I
 exclaimed " How is it possible to bring such a subject worthily before
 a Royal Institution audience when none of the experiments can be
 seen more than three feet off ?
                                      "
                                          If  to-night  I am fortunate enough
 to show all the experiments to those whe are not far distant, and if
 I  succeed in making most of them visible at the far end of the theatre,
 such a success will be entirely due to the great kindness of your late
 Secretary, Mr. Spottiswoode, who has placed at my disposal his
 magnificent induction-coil, — not only for this lecture, but for some
 weeks past in my own Laboratory, — thus enabling me to prepare
 apparatus and vacuum tubes on a scale so large as to relieve me of
 all anxiety so far as the experimental illustrations are concerned.
      Before describing the special researches in molecular physics
 which    I  propose to illustrate this evening, it is necessary to give a
 brief outline of one small department of the modern theory of the
 constitution of gases. It is not easy to make clear the kinetic theory,
 but   I  will try to simplify it in this way : — Imagine that     I have in a
 large box a swarm of bees, each bee independent of its fellow, flying
 about in all manner of directions and with very different velocities.
 The beos are so crowded that they can only fly a very short distance
 without coming into contact with one another or with the sides of
 the box.     As they are constantly in collision, so they rebound from
 each other with altered velocities and in different directions, and
when these collisions take place against the sides of the box pressure
is produced.       If I take some of the bees out of the box, the distance
which each individual bee will be able to fly before it comes into
contact with its neighbour will be greater than when the box was
                        I                                       I
full of bees, and if remove a great many of the bees increase to a
considerable extent the average distance that each can fly without a
collision.                     I
               This distance will call the bee's mean free path.        When

1879.]           on Molecular Physics in   High Vacua.                 139
the bees are numerous the mean free path is very short; when the
bees are few the mean free path will be longer, the length being
inversely proportional to the number of bees present. Let us now
imagine a loose diaphragm to be introduced in the centre of the box,
so as to divide the number of bees equally.       The same number of
bees being on each side, the impacts on the diaphragm will be equal ;
and the mean speed of the bees being the same, the pressure will be
identical on each side of the diaphragm, and it will not move.
    Let me now warm one side of this division so as to let it com
municate extra energy to a bee when it touches it. As before, a
bee will strike the diaphragm with its normal mean velocity, but will
be driven back with extra velocity, the reaction producing an increase
of pressure on the diaphragm.         It will be found, however, that
although the diaphragm is free to move, the extra strength of the
recoil on the warm side does not produce any motion.        This at first
sight seems contrary to the law of action and reaction being equal.
The explanation is not difficult to understand. The bees which fly
away from the diaphragm have drawn energy from           it,
                                                           and therefore
move quicker than those which are coming towards it; they beat
back the crowd to    a   greater distance, and keep  a  greater number
from striking the diaphragm.       Near to the heated side of the dia
phragm the density      isless than the average, while beyond the free
path the density   is  above the average, and this greater crowding
extends to all other parts of the box. Thus   it  happens that the extra
energy of the impacts against the warm side of the diaphragm            is
exactly compensated by the increased number of impacts on the cool
side.   In spite therefore of the increased activity communicated to    a
portion of the bees, the pressure on the two sides of the diaphragm
will remain the same. This represents what occurs when the extent
of the box containing the bees   is   so great, compared with the mean
free path, that the abrupt change in the velocities of those bees which
rebound from the walls of the box produces only an insensible
influence on the motions of bees at so great        a  distance as the
diaphragm.
 I    will next ask you to imagine that am gradually removing bees
                                       I
from our box, still keeping the diaphragm warm on one side. The
bees getting fewer the collisions will become less frequent, and the
distance each bee can fly before striking its neighbour will get longer
and longer, and the crowding in front of them will grow less and
less. The compensation will also diminish, and the warmed side of
the diaphragm will have      atendency to be beaten back. A point will
at last bo reached on the warm side, when the mean free path of the
bees will be long enough to admit of their dashing right across from
the diaphragm to the side of the box, without meeting more than         a
certain number of in-coming bees in their flight.      In this case the
bees will no longer fly quite in the same direction as before.     They
will now fly less sideways, and more forwards and backwards between
the heated face of the diaphragm and the opposed wall of the box.
                                                               L   2

Because of this preponderating motion, and also because they will
thereby less effectually keep back bees crowding in from the sides,
there will now be a greater proportionate pressure both on the hot
face of the diaphragm and on that part of the box which is in front
of it. Hence the pressure on the hot side will now exceed that on the
cool side of the diaphragm, which will consequently have a backward
movement communicated to it.
      Imay diminish the size of the bees as much as         like, and by I
correspondingly increasing their number the mean free path will
remain the same.     Instead of bees let me call them molecules, and
instead of having a few hundreds or thousands in the box let me have
millions and billions and trillions ; and if we also diminish the mean
free path to a considerable extent, we get a rough outline of the
kinetic theory of gases. (I may just mention that the mean free path
of the molecules in air, at the ordinary pressure, is the ten-thousandth
of   a millimetre.)
    Three years ago            I
                           had the honour of bringing before you the
results of some researches on the Radiometer.           Let me now take up
the subject where         I
                       then loft off.            I
                                          have here two radiometers which
have been rotating before you under the influence of a strong light
shining upon them.
    The explanation of the movement of the radiometer is this, — the
light, or the total bundle of rays included in the term " light," falling
upon the blackened side of the vanes, becomes absorbed, and thereby
raises the temperature of the black side : this causes extra excitement
of the air molecules which come in contact with                    it,
                                                              and pressure                is
produced, causing the fly of the radiometer to turn round.
  I    have long believed that        well-known appearance observed in
                                            a

to increase and diminish as the vacuum              varied, in the same way
                                                          is
that the ideal layer of molecular pressure in the radiometer increases
and diminishes.     As the one        perceived by the mind's eye to get
                                            is
greater, so the other      seen by the bodily eye to increase in size.
                              is                                                          If
the vacuum        insufficient to permit the radiometer to turn, the

construction.
    It similar to an ordinary radiometer with aluminium disks for
          is
vanes, each disk coated on one side with           film of mica. The fly
                                                          a                               is
supported   by   hard
                    a   steel instead  of  glass  cup,  and the needle point
on which      works
               it        connected by means of
                          is                           wire with
                                                               a    platinum a
terminal sealed into the glass. At the top of the radiometer bulb

1879.]             on Molecular Physics in High Vacua.                141
a second    terminal is sealed in.    The radiometer can therefore be
connected with an induction-coil, the movable fly being made the
negative pole.
     As soon as the pressure is reduced to a few millims. of mercury,
a halo of velvety violet light forms on the metallic side of the vanes,
the mica side remaining dark.       As the pressure diminishes, a dark
space is seen to separate the violet halo from the metal.           At a
pressure of half a millim. this dark space ex
tends to the glass, and positive rotation com               FIG. 1.
mences.      On continuing the exhaustion the
dark space further widens out and appears to
flatten itself against the glass, when the rota
tion becomes very rapid.
     You perceive a dark space behind each vane
and moving round with it. In the first experi
ment, radiation from the lime-light falling on
the metallic sides of the vanes, produced a
layer of molecular pressure which drove the
fly round ; so here the induction-current      has
produced molecular excitement at the surface
of the vanes forming the negative pole, extend
ing up to the side of the glass.
     When the negative pole is in rapid rotation
                                           I
it is not easy to see this dark space, so have
arranged a tube in which the dark space will
be visible to all present.      Tho tube, as you
 will see by the diagram (Fig. 2), has a pole in
 the centre in the form of a metal disk, and
other poles at each end.       The centre pole is
made negative, and the two end poles connected
together are made the positive terminal.      The
dark space will be in the centre. When the
exhaustion is not very great the dark space ex
 tends only a little distance on each side of the negative pole in the
centre. When the exhaustion is very good, as it is in the tube before
you, and   I turn on the coil, the dark space is seen to extend for about
 2 inches on each side of the pole.
     Here, then, we see the induction spark actually illuminating the
lines of molecular pressure caused by the excitement of the negative
 pole. The thickness of this dark space — nearly 2 inches — is the
measure of the mean free path between successive collisions of the
 molecules of the residual gas.      The extra velocity with which the
 negatively electrified molecules rebound from the excited pole keeps
 back the more slowly moving molecules which are advancing towards
 that pole. The conflict occurs at the boundary of the dark space,
 where the luminous margin bears witness to the energy of the dis
 charge.
     I will endeavour to throw on the screen an illustration of this

142                            Mr. William    Crookes             [April 4,
dark space.       A stream of water falls from a small jet on to a hori
zontal plate of glass.      The water spreads over the plate and forms a
thin film. The jet of water in the centre, from the velocity of its
fall, drives the film of water before it on all sides, raising it into a
ring-shaped heap.        As  I  diminish the force of the jet the ring con
tracts: this is equivalent to the exhaustion getting less.         When I
increase the force of water the ring expands in size, the effect being
analogous to an increase of exhaustion in my tubes.              The extra
velocity of the falling particles of water drives the in-coming particles
of water before them, and raises a ridge round the side which exactly
                                      Fra. 2.
represents the luminous halo to the dark space to be seen in this
tube.
     If, instead of a flat disk, a metal cup is used for the negative pole,
the successive appearances on exhausting the tube are somewhat
different.     The velvety violet halo forms over each side of the cup.
On increasing the exhaustion the dark space widens out, retaining
almost exactly the shape of the cup. The bright margin of the dark
space becomes concentrated at the concave side of the cup to a
luminous focus, and widens out at the convex side. When the dark
space is very much larger than the cup, its outline forms an irregular
ellipsoid drawn in towards the focal point. Inside the luminous
boundary a dark violet light can be seen converging to a focus, and,
as the rays diverge on the other side of the focus, spreading beyond
 the margin of the dark space ; the whole appearance being strikingly
similar to the rays of the sun reflected from a concave mirror through
a foggy atmosphere.         This proves a somewhat important point ; it
shows that the molecules thrown off the excited negative pole leave it
in a direction almost normal to the surface.
     I  can illustrate this property of the molecular rays by an experi
ment. This diagram (Fig. 8) is a representation of the tubo which is
before you.        It contains, as a negative pole, a hemi-cylinder (a) of

 polished aluminium.          This is connected with a fine copper wire, 6,
ending at the platinum terminal, c. At the upper end of the tube
is another terminal, d. The induction-coil is connected so that the
hemi-cylinder is negative and the upper pole positive, and when
exhausted to a sufficient extent, as is the case with this tube, the pro
jection of the molecular rays to a focus is very beautifully shown.
 The rays are driven from the hemi-cylinder in a direction normal to
its surface ; they come to a focus and
then diverge, tracing their path in bril                      Fio. 3.
liant green phosphorescence on the sur
face of the glass.
     You will notice that the rays which
 project from the negative pole and cross
 in the centre have a bright green appear
 ance ; that colour is entirely duo to the
 phosphorescence of the glass. At a
 very high exhaustion the phenomena
 noticed in ordinary vacuum tubes when
 the induction       spark passes through
 them — an appearance of cloudy lumin
 osity and of stratifications — disappears
 entirely.    No cloud or fog whatever is
 seen in the body of the tube, and with
 such a vacuum as       I am working with in
 these experiments — about a millionth
 part of an atmosphere — the inner sur
 face of the glass glows with a rich green
 phosphorescence, the intensity of colour
 varying with the perfection of the vacuum.
 It scarcely begins to show much before
 the 800,000th of an atmosphere. At
 about a millionth of an atmosphere the
 phosphorescence is very strong, and after
 that it begins to diminish until there
 are not enough molecules left to allow
 the spark to pass. *
      I have here a tube which will serve to illustrate the dependence
 of the green phosphorescence of the glass on the degree of perfection
 of the vacuum (Fig. 4). The two poles are at a and b, and at the end
 (c) is a small supplementary tube connected with the other by a
 narrow aperture, and containing solid caustic potash.              The tube has
 been exhausted to a very high point, and the potash heated so as to
 drive off moisture and deteriorate the vacuum.            Exhaustion has then

been re-commenced, and the alternate heating and exhaustion have
been repeated until the tube has been brought to the state in which it
now appears before you. When the induction spark is first turned on
nothing is visible — the vacuum is so high that the tube is non-con
ducting.      I now warm the potash slightly, and liberate a trace of
aqueous vapour.        Instantly conduction commences, and the green
phosphorescence      flashes  out along the length of the tube.       I con
tinue the heat, so as to drive off more gas from the potash. The
green gets fainter, and now a wave of cloudy luminosity sweeps over
the tube, and stratifications appear. These rapidly got narrower,
until the spark passes along the tube in the form of a narrow purple
line.    I   take the lamp away, and allow the potash to cool ; as it
cools, the aqueous vapour, which the heat had driven off, is re-
 absorbed. The purple line broadens out, and breaks up into fine
 stratifications ; these get wider, and travel towards the potash tube.
 Now a wave of green light appears on the glass at the other end,
 sweeping on and driving the last pale stratification into the potash ;
 and now the tube glows over its whole length with the green phos
 phorescence.     Would time allow       I might keep it before you, and
 show the green growing fainter and the vacuum becoming non-con
 ducting ; but time is required for the absorption of the last traces of
 vapour by the potash, and       I must pass on to the next subject.
      This green phosphorescence is a subject that has much occupied
 my thoughts, and      I  have striven to ascertain some of the laws govern
 ing its occurrence.       I soon perceived that the phosphorescence was
 not in the body of the tube itself, but was entirely on the surface of
  the glass. Another peculiarity of the rays producing this green
  phosphorescence is that they will not turn a corner in the slightest
  degree.     Here is a V-shaped tube (Fig. 5), a pole being at each ex
  tremity.     The pole at the right side (a) being negative, you see that
  the whole of the right arm is flooded with green light, but at the
  bottom it stops sharply, and will not turn the corner to get into the
  left side. When     I  reverse the current, and make the left pole negative,
  the green changes to the left side, always following the negative pole,
  leaving the positive side with scarcely any luminosity.
       In the ordinary phenomena exhibited by vacuum tubes— phe
  nomena with which we are all familiar — it is customary, for the
  more striking illustration of their contrasts of colour, to have the
  tubes bent into very elaborate designs. The positive luminosity

caused    by the phosphorescence of the residual gas follows all the
convolutions and designs into which skilful glass-blowers can manage
to twist the glass. The negative pole being at one end and the
positive pole at the other, the luminous phenomena seem to depend
more on the positive than on the negative at an ordinary exhaustion
such as has hitherto been used to get the best phenomena of vacuum
tubes.    I have here two bulbs (Fig. 6), alike in shape and position of
poles, the only difference being that one is at an exhaustion equal to
a few millimetres of mercury — such a moderate exhaustion as will
give stratifications or the ordinary luminous phenomena — whilst the
other is exhausted to about the millionth of an atmosphere.           I will
                                   FIG. 5.
first connect the moderately exhausted bulb with the induction-coil,
and, retaining the pole at one side (a) always negative,     I  will put the
 positive  wire  successively  to the   other  three poles with   which the
 bulb is furnished.    You will see that as   I  change the position of the
 positive pole, the line of violet light joining the two poles changes.
 In this moderately exhausted bulb, therefore, the electric current
 always chooses the shortest path between the two poles, and moves
about the bulb as    I alter the position of the wires.
     This, then, is the kind of phenomenon we get in ordinary exhaus
 tions.   I will now try the same experiment with a tube that is highly

146                        Mr. William    Crookes               [April 4,
exhausted, and, as before, will make the side pole (a') the negative,
the top polo (6) being positive.      Notice how widely different is the
appearance from that shown by the last bulb.        The negative pole is
in the form of a shallow cup. The bundle of rays from the cup
crosses in the centre of the bulb, and thence diverging falls on the
opposite side as a circular patch of green light. As    I  turn the bulb
                                  Fio. 6.
round you will all be able to seo the faint blue focus and the green
patch on the glass. Now observe,       I   remove the positive wire from
the top, and connect it with the side pole (c). The green patch from
the divergent negative focus is still there.      I now make the lowest
polo (</) positive, and the green patch still remains where it was at
first, unchanged in position or intensity.
     This, then, gives us another fact which brings us a little nearer to
the cause of this green phosphorescence. It is this — that in the low
vacuum the position of the positive pole is of every importance,
whilst in a high vacuum it scarcely matters at all where the positive
polo is ; the phenomena seem to depend entirely on the negative polo.
In very high vacua, such as we have been using, the phenomena

1879.]                   on Molecular Physic* in   High Faeua.             147
follow altogether the negative pole. If the negative pole points in
the direction of the positive all very well, but if the negative pole is
entirely in the opposite direction it does not matter : the line of rays
is projected all the same in a straight line from the negative.
    I  have hitherto spoken of and illustrated these phenomena in
connection with green phosphorescence.      It does not follow, however,
that the phosphorescence is always of that colour.      This colouration
is a property of the particular kind of glass in use in my laboratory.
I have here (Fig. 7) three bulbs composed of different glass : one is
uranium glass (a), which phosphoresces of a dark green colour;
another is English glass (6), which phosphoresces of a blue colour ;
and the third (c) is soft German glass — of which most of the appa
ratus before you is made — which phosphoresces of a bright apple-green

colour.    It  is therefore plain that this particular green phospho
rescence   is solely due to the glass which        I
                                               am using.     Were      I

English glass       I
                    should have to speak of blue phosphorescence, but
I  know of no glass which is equal to the German in brilliancy.
     My earlier experiments were almost entirely carried on by the aid
of the phosphorescence which glass takes up when it is under the
influence of the electric discharge in vacua; but many other sub
stances possess this phosphorescent power, and some have it in a
much higher degree than glass. For instance, here is some of the
luminous sulphide of calcium prepared according to M. Ed. Becquerel's
description.     When it is exposed to light — even candlelight —it
phosphoresces for hours with a rich blue colour.            I
                                                          have prepared a
diagram with large letters written in this luminous sulphide ; before
it is exposed to the light the letters are invisible, but Mr. Gimingham
has just exposed it in another room to burning magnesium, and now
it is brought into the darkened theatre you will see the word " <£<js," —
light, a very suitable word for so beautiful a phosphorescence — shining
brightly in luminous characters. The first letter,              <f>,

 diagram at the back, and we shall see how it lasts during the re
 mainder of the lecture.        This substance, then, is phosphorescent to
 light, but it is also much more strongly phosphorescent to the mole
 cular discharge in a good vacuum, as you will see when              pass the     I
 discharge through this tube (Fig. 8). The white plate (a, 6) in the

appreciably warm, and at the same time they have been producing

comparable     to the  dimensions     of the  vessel, and  we have  no longer to
deal with      continuous portion of matter, as we should were the tubes

individually.     At first this was only convenient working hypothesis.

Long-continued       experiment then raised this provisional hypothesis
almost to the dignity of theory, and now the general opinion
                             a                                                 that

this theory gives   a   fairly correct explanation of the facts. In these
highly exhausted vessels the mean free path of the residual molecules
of gas    is so long that they are able to drive across from the pole
to the other side of the tube with comparatively few collisions.               The
negatively electrified molecules of the gaseous residue in the tube
therefore dash against anything that               in front, and cast shadows
                                                  is
of obstacles just as   if  they were rays of light.      Where they strike the
glass they are stopped, and the production of light accompanies this
sudden arrest of velocity.
    Other substances besides English, German, and uranium glass, and
Becquerel's luminous sulphides, are also phosphorescent.                 I  think,

diamond shines with as much light as              acandle, phosphorescing of             a
bright    green.

 Mr. Blogg,   of the   firm  of Blogg    and  Martin, who placed a small

to ascertain whether the artificial ruby made by M. Feil, of Paris,
would glow in the same manner.                         I
                                             had simply to make my wants
known to M. Feil, and he immediately sent me a box containing
artificial rubies and crystals of alumina of all sizes, and from these                                        I
have selected the mass in this tube which               now place under tho I
discharge: they phosphoresce of the same rich red colour as the
natural ruby.     It scarcely matters what colour the ruby is, to begin
with.    In this tube of natural rubies there are stones of all colours —
the deep red ruby and the pale pink ruby.                 There are some so
pale as to be almost colourless, and some of the highly-prized tint of
pigeon's blood ; but in the vacuum under the negative discharge they
all phosphoresce with about the same colour.

    As have just mentioned, the ruby is crystallised alumina. In a
paper published twenty years ago by Ed. Becquerel*               find that he               I
describes the appearance of alumina as glowing with a rich red colour
in the phosphoroscope (an instrument by which the duration of phos
phorescence in the sunlight can be examined).            Here is some chemi
cally pure precipitated alumina which                        I
                                                 have prepared in the most
careful manner. It has been heated to whiteness, and you see it
glows with the rich red colour which is supposed to be characteristic
of alumina. The mineral known as corundum is a colourless variety
of crystallised alumina.       Under the negative discharge in a vacuum,
corundum phosphoresces of a rose-pink colour.               There is another
curious fact in which             I
                               think chemists will feel interested. The
sapphire is also crystallised alumina, just the same as the ruby.

as has been found to hold good at a lower vacuum.                  The former

vacuum (Fig. 15).       On passing the induction spark it passes as a

a powerful electro-magnet.       I  make contact with the magnet, and
 the line of light dips in the centre towards the magnet.             I reverse
 tho poles, and the line is driven up to the top of the tube. Notice
 the difference between the two phenomena.               Here the action is
 temporary.      The dip takes place under the magnetic influence; the
 line of discharge then rises, and pursues its path to the positive pole.
 In the high exhaustion, however, after the ray of light had dipped to
 the magnet it did not recover itself, but continued its path in tho
 altered direction.
      During    these experiments another property of this molecular
 discharge   has made itself very evident, although           I  have not yet
 drawn attention to it. The glass gets very warm where the green
 phosphorescence is strongest. The molecular focus on the tube
 which we have just seen (Fig. 12) would be intensely hot, and           I have
 prepared    an   apparatus by which    this   heat  at the  focus  can  be  in

                                          it      melts. A hole (e)                                is
perforated in the middle, the air rushes in, and the experiment       at                      is

      Instead      of drawing       the   focus to the side of the glass with                      a
magnet,  I      will take another         tube (Fig. 18), and allow the focus from

not only gets white hot, but you can see sparks coming from       on all                 it
sides, showing that      it    is
                         actually melting.
    Here     another tube, but instead of platinum

focus that beautiful alloy of platinum and iridium which Mr. Matthey

1879.]              on Molecular Physics in      High Vacua.                   157
has brought to such perfection, and          I   think that   I  shall succeed in
even melting that.       I  first turn on the induction-coil slightly, so as
not to bring out its full power.           The focus is now playing on the
iridio-platinum, raising it to a white heat.           I  bring a small magnet
near, and you see      I can deflect the focus of heat just as         I  did the
luminous focus in the other tube.              By shifting the magnet       I  can
drive the focus up or down, or draw it completely away from the
metal, and render it non-luminous.           I  withdraw the magnet, and let
the molecules have full play again ; the metal is now white-hot.                  I
increase the intensity of the spark.            The metal glows with almost
insupportable brilliancy, and at last melts.
     There is still another property of this molecular discharge, and it
is this : — You have seen that the molecules are driven violently from
the negative pole. If      I   place something in front of these molecules,
they show the force of impact by the heat which is produced.                Can   I
make this mechanical action evident in a more direct way? Nothing is
simpler.    I have only to put some easily moving object in the line of dis
charge in order to get a powerful mechanical action. Mr. Gimingham,
                                      Fig. 19.
with great skill, has constructed a piece of apparatus which                I  will
presently    put in  the electric  lantern, so   that all will  be able  to see its
action.    But first   I will explain the construction by means of this
diagram (Fig. 19). The negative pole (a, 6) is in the form of a very
shallow cup. In front of the cup is a mica screen (c, d), wide enough
to intercept nearly all the molecular rays coming from the negative
pole. Behind this screen is a mica wheel (e,f) with a series of vanes,
making a sort of paddle-wheel of it. So arranged, the molecular
stream from the pole a b will nearly all be cut off from the wheel, and
what escapes over and under the screen will hit the vanes equally, and

158           Mr. William   Crookes on Molecular Physics,   ic.   [April   4,
will not produce any movement.     I  now put a magnet, g, over the tube,
so as to deflect the stream over or under the obstacle c d, and the result
will be rapid motion in one or the other direction, according to the
way the magnet is turned.    I  now throw the image of the apparatus on
the screen.    The spiral lines painted on the wheel show which way it
turns.    I arrange the magnet to draw the molecular stream so as to
beat against the upper vanes, and the wheel revolves rapidly, as if it
were an over-shot water-wheel.     I
                                  now turn the magnet so as to drive
the molecular stream underneath ; the wheel slackens speed, stops, and
then begins to rotate the other way, as if it were an under-shot water-
wheel.                                      I
         This can be repeated as often as like to reverse the position
of the magnet, the change of rotation of the wheel showing imme
diately the way the molecular stream is deflected.
    This experiment illustrates the last of the phenomena which time
allows me to bring before you, attending the passage of the induc
tion spark through a highly exhausted atmosphere. It will now be
naturally asked, What have we learned from the phenomena described
and exhibited, and from the explanations that have been proposed ?
We find in these phenomena confirmation of the modern views of
matter and energy. The facts elicited are in harmony with the theory
that matter is not continuous but composed of a prodigious number of
minute particles, not in mutual contact. The facts also are in full
accordance with the kinetic theory of gases — to which      Ihave already
referred — and with the conception of heat as a particular kind of energy,
expressing itself as a rapid vibratory motion of the particles of matter.
This alone would be a lesson of no small value. In Science, every
law, every generalisation, however well established, must constantly
be submitted to the ordeal of a comparison with newly-discovered
phenomena ; and a theory may be pronounced triumphant when it is
found to harmonise with and to account for facts which when it was
propounded were still unrecognised or unexplained.
    But the experiments have shown us more than this : we have been
enabled to contemplate matter in a condition hitherto unknown, — in a
fourth state, — as far removed from that of gas as gas is from liquid,
where the well-known properties of gases and clastic fluids almost
disappear, whilst in their stead are revealed attributes previously
masked and unsuspected.        In this ultra-gaseous state of matter
phenomena are perceived which in the mere gaseous condition are as
impossible as in liquids or solids.
      Iadmit that between the gaseous and the ultra-gaseous state there
can be traced no sharp boundary ; the one merges imperceptibly into
the other. It is true also that we cannot see or handle matter in this
novel phase.    Nor can human or any other kind of organic life con
ceivable to us penetrate into regions where such ultra-gaseous matter
may be supposed to exist. Nevertheless, we are able to observe it and
experiment on   it,legitimately arguing from the seen to the unseen.
    Of the practical applications that may arise out of these researches,
it would now bo premature to speak.       It rarely given to the dis
                                                is

 IN the pro-scientific stage of every branch of knowledge, the pre
 valent notions of phenomena are founded upon general impressions ;
 but when that stage is passed and the phenomena are measured and
 numbered, many of those notions are found to be wrong, even absurdly
 so.    This is the case not only in professional matters, but in those
 with which everyone has some opportunity of becoming acquainted.
 Think of the nonsense spoken every day about the signs of coining
 weather, in connection, for example, with the phases of the moon.
 Think of the ideas about chance, held by those who are unacquainted
 with the theory of probabilities ; think of the notions on heredity,
 before the days of Darwin. It is unnecessary to multiply instances ;
 the frequent incorrectness of notions derived from general impressions
 may be assumed, and the object of the following discourse is to point
 out a principal cause of it.
      Attention will be called to a source of error that is inherent in our
minds, that vitiates the truth of all our general impressions, and which
we can never wholly eliminate except by separating the confused facts
upon which our general impressions are founded, and treating them
numerically by the regular methods of statistics.             It is not sufficient
to learn that an opinion has been long established or held by many,
but wo must collect a large number of instances to test that opinion,
and numerically compare the successes and the failures.
     Our general impressions are founded upon blended memories,
and these latter will be the chief topic of the present discourse. An
analogy will bo pointed out between these and the blended portraits
    * This memoir is in part an abstract, and in small part an extension of the
discourse that was actually delivered. The greater part of the subject matter has
                                                    '
been treated more fully in the July number of the Nineteenth Century,' but the
autotype illustrations which are given here are not inserted there.

162                           Mr. Francis Gallon                      [April   25,
first described by myself a year ago under the name of ' Composite
Portraits,' * and specimens of the latter will be exhibited.           Then the
cause will be explained that renders the mind incompetent to blend
memories together in their just proportions.
     The physiological basis of memory is simple enough in its broad
outlines.     Whenever any group of brain elements has been excited by
a sense impression, it becomes, so to speak, tender, and liable to be
easily thrown again into a similar state of excitement.              If the new
cause of excitement differs from the original one, a memory is the
result.     Whenever a single cause throws different groups of brain
elements simultaneously into excitement, the result must be a blended
memory.
     We are familiar with the fact that faint memories are very apt to
become confused.         Thus some picture of mountain and lake in a
country     which  we  have  never visited, often recalls a vague sense of
identity    with  much  we  have   seen elsewhere. Our recollections cannot
be disentangled, though general resemblances are recognized.                 It is
also a fact that the memories of persons who have great powers of
visualising, that is, of seeing well-defined images in the mind's eye,
are no less capable of being blended together. Artists are, as a class,
possessed of the visualising power in a high degree, and they are at
the same time pre-eminently distinguished by their gifts of generali
zation.      They are of all men the most capable of producing forms
that are not copies of any individual, but represent the characteristic
features of classes.
     There is then, no doubt, from whatever side the subject of memory
is approached, whether from the material or from the mental, and, in
the latter case, whether we examine the experiences of those in whom
the visualising faculty is faint or in whom it is strong, that the brain
has the capacity of blending memories together. Neither can there
be any doubt that general impressions are faint and perhaps faulty
editions of blended memories. They are subject to errors of their
own, and they inherit all those to which the memories are themselves
liable.
      Specimens of blended portraits will now be exhibited ; these might,
with more propriety, be named, according to the happy phrase of
Professor Huxley, " generic portraits.
                                 "
                                                 The word generic presupposes
a genus, that is to say, a collection of individuals who have much
in common, and among whom medium characteristics are very much
 more frequent than extreme ones.               The same idea is sometimes
 expressed by the word typical, which was much used by Quetolet,
 who was the first to give it a rigorous interpretation, and whose idea
 of a type lies at the basis of his statistical views. No statistician
 dreams of combining objects into the same generic group that do not
 cluster towards a common centre, no more can wo compose generic

 1878).

1879.]                      on Generic Images.                          163
portraits out of heterogeneous elements, for if the attempt be made to
do so the result is monstrous and meaningless.
     It might be expected that when many different portraits are fused
into a single one, the result would be a mere smudge.       Such, however,
is by no means the case, under the conditions just laid down, of a
great prevalence of the mediocre characteristics over the extreme ones.
There are then so many traits in common, to combine and to rein
force one another, that they prevail to the exclusion of the rest.      All
that is common remains, all that is individual tends to disappear.
     The first of the composites exhibited on this occasion is made by
conveying the images of three separate portraits by means of three
separate magic lanterns upon the same screen.        The stands on which
the lanterns are mounted have been arranged to allow of nice adjust
ment. The composite about to be shown is one that strains the powers
of the process somewhat too severely, the portraits combined being
those of two brothers and their sister, who have not even been photo
graphed in precisely the same attitudes.       Nevertheless, the result is
seen to be the production of a face, neither male nor female, but more
regular and handsome than any of the component portraits, and in
which the common family traits are clearly marked.               Ghosts of
portions of male and female attire, due to the peculiarities of the
separate portraits, are seen about and around the composite, but they
are not sufficiently vivid to distract the attention.   [This effect is well
seen in the composite of Napoleon in the autotype photographic plate
here annexed.]     If the number of combined portraits had been largo,
these ghostly accessories would have become too faint to be visible.
 [See the very faint indication of the various ears in the co-composite
of the criminals.]
     The next step is to compare this portrait of two brothers and
their sister which has been composed by optical means before the eyes
of the audience, and concerning the truthfulness of which there can
bo no doubt, with a photographic composite of the same group.          This
latter has been made by the process described in the memoir already
referred to, and which is analogous to that by which memories are
blended.    The portraits to be combined are adjusted very carefully
one in front of the other, so that the features shall be as exactly
superimposed as is possible from the nature of the case. [This is
done by making two pin-holes in the bottom of one of them, then
placing it on each of the others in succession when held before a strong
light, so that the two are seen in transparency, and pricking each
through the same pin-holes.      These pricks servo as fiducial marks for
their subsequent arrangement.]       The packet of adjusted portraits is
next placed in front of the object-glass of a photographic camera, and
the portraits are then removed one by one.       Thus the impression left
on the sensitised plate is that of a succession of different portraits
thrown one on the top of another on the same part of it. The result
is a composite portrait.     A photographic composite prepared in this
way from the portraits of the two brothers and sister is now placed in

a   fourth magic lantern with a brighter light behind         it,and its image
is   thrown on the screen by the side of the composite produced by
direct optical superposition.       It will be observed that the two pro
cesses lead to almost exactly the same result, and therefore the fair
ness of the photographic process may be taken for granted.                How
ever, two other comparisons will be made for the sake of verification,
namely, between the optical and photographic composites of two
children, and again between those of two Roman contadini.
      The composite portraits that will next bo exhibited are made by
the photographic process, and       it   will now be understood that they
are truly composite, notwithstanding          their definition and apparent
individuality. Attention      is,  however, first directed to       aconvenient
instrument not more than 18 inches in length, which                 is,
                                                                      in fact,      a
photographic camera with six converging lenses and an attached
screen, on which six pictures can be adjusted and brilliantly illumi
nated by artificial light.     The effect of their optical combination can
thus be easily studied any errors of adjustment can be rectified and
                        ;
the composite may be photographed at once.
      It must not be supposed that any one of the components fails to
leave its due trace in the photographic composite, much less in the
optical one. In order to allay misgivings on the subject, a small
apparatus    is  laid on the table together with some of the results
obtained by it. It    isa    cardboard frame, with spring shutter closing
                                                   a
an aperture of the size of wafer, that springs open on the pressure
                             a
of   a  finger, and shuts again as suddenly when the pressure              with
                                                                            is
drawn.      A  chronograph  is  held  in the other   hand, whose  index  begins
to travel the moment the finger presses       a   spring, and stops instantly
on lifting the finger.        The two instruments are worked simulta
neously  ;   the chronograph checking the time allowed for each expo
sure and summing all the times. It appears from several trials that
the effect of 1000 brief exposures       ispractically identical with that of
a   single exposure of 1000 times the duration of any one of them.
Therefore each of      a    thousand components leaves its due photo
graphic trace on the composite, though              far too faint to be visible
                                              it
                                              is
unless reinforced by many similar traces.
      The composites now to be exhibited are made from coins or
 medals, and in most instances the aim has been to obtain the best
 likeness attainable of historical personages, by combining various
 portraits of them taken at different periods of their lives and so to-
 elicit the traits that are common to each series.              A few of the
 individual portraits are placed in the same slide with each composite
 to give a   better idea of the character of these blended representatives.
 Those that are shown are (1) Alexander the Great, from six com
 ponents ;    (2) Antiochus, King of Syria, from six      ;

 as usual better looking than any of the components, none of which
 however give any indication of hor reputed beauty             ;   in fact, her

      My cordial acknowledgment is due to Mr. E. Stuart Poole, the
learned curator of the coins and gems in the British Museum, for his
kind selection of the most suitable medals and for procuring casts of
them for me for the present purpose. These casts were, with one ex
ception, all photographed to a uniform size of four-tenths of an inch
between the pupils of the eyes and the division between the lips,
which experience shows to be the most convenient size on the whole
to work with, regard being paid to many considerations not worth
 while to specify in detail.         When it was necessary the photograph
 was reversed.       These photographs were made by Mr. H. Eeynolds ;               I
 then adjusted and prepared them for taking the photographic com
 posite.
       The next series to be exhibited consists of composites taken from
 the portraits of criminals convicted of murder, manslaughter, or
 crimes accompanied by violence.             There is much interest in the fact
 that two types of features are found much more frequently among
 these than among the population at large.               In one, the features arc
 broad and massive, like those of Henry VIII., but with a much
 smaller brain.       The other, of which five composites arc exhibited,
 each deduced from a number of different individuals, varying four to
 nine, is a face that is weak and certainly not a common English
 face.     Three of these composites, though taken from entirely different
 sets   of  individuals, are as alike as brothers, and it is found on opti
cally combining any three out of the five composites, that is on com
 bining almost any considerable number of the individuals, the result
 is closely the same.        The combination of the throe composites just
alluded to will now bo effected by means of the three converging magic
 lanterns, and the result may be accepted as generic in respect of
 this particular type of criminals.
       The process of composite portraiture is one of pictorial statistics.
 It is a familiar fact that the average height of even a dozen men of
the same race, taken at hazard, varies so little, that for ordinary
statistical purposes it may be considered constant. The same may be
said of the measurement of every separate feature and limb, and of
every tint, whether of skin, hair, or eyes.            Consequently a pictorial
combination of any one of these separate traits would lead to results
no less constant than the statistical averages.              In a portrait, there
 is another factor to be considered besides the measurement of the
separate traits, namely, their relative position ; but this, too, in a suffi
ciently large group, would necessarily have a statistical constancy. As

        The accompanying illustrations have been photographically transferred (on a
reduced scale) to stone, and lithographed by the Autotype Company, 36, Rath-
bone Street.      They are very successfully done, and are nearly equal in clearness
to the originals.    The composite of the Roman ladies comes out unfortunately a
little too dark, and some of the beauty of the original is thereby lost.

a matter  of observation, the resemblance between persons of the same
" genus "                     " generic," as already
           (in the sense of                          explained) is suffi
ciently great to admit of making good pictorial composites out of
even small groups, as has been abundantly shown.
    Composite pictures are, however, much more than averages ; they               •
are rather the equivalents of those large statistical tables whose totals,
divided by the number of cases, and entered in the bottom line, are
the averages.   They are real generalizations, because they include
the whole of the material under consideration.           The blur of their
outlines, which is never great in truly generic composites, except
in unimportant details, measures the tendency of individuals to
deviate from the central type. My argument                is,
                                                           that the generic
images that arise before the mind's eye, and      the   general impressions
which are faint and faulty editions of them, are the analogues of
these composite pictures which we have the advantage of examining
at leisure, and whose peculiarities and character we can investigate,
and from which we may draw conclusions that shall throw much light
on the nature of certain mental processes which are too mobile and
evanescent to be directly dealt with.
     A generic mental image may be considered to be nothing more
than generic portrait stamped on the brain by the successive impres
      a
sions made by its component images.        Professor Huxley, from whom,
                                                      "

view which I   also entertained, and had hinted at in my first description
of composite portraiture, though there was not occasion at that time
to write more explicitly about it.
     In my original memoir on composite portraits           phrase was used
                                                            a

              it
words were " A composite portrait represents the picture that would
           :
rise before the mind's eye of an individual who had the gift of pictorial
imagination in an exalted degree." The question to bo considered            is
whether this   is  strictly correct statement.

the composite      (Here again wo are supposed to ignore such small

differences as may exist between the photographic and optical compo
site.) The answer       distinctly, No. Suppose that one of the portraits
                        is

fifty coats of transparent pigment, but in the mental composite
it  would have nothing like that importance; and therein lies the
source of error in our mental impressions that             it  the object of
                                                                is

this discourse to point out.          Exceptional    occurrences leave an
impression on the brain of far greater strength, and conversely
habitual occurrences leave one of far less strength, than their numbers
warrant.     The physiological effect of prolonged action, or of reitera
 tion, is by no means in direct proportion to the length of the one or
                                                         "           "
 to the frequency of the other. The magnitude of the subjective        effect
never bears a simple, direct proportion to the magnitude of the " ob
         "
jective    cause.   The relation between them, in a very wide circle of
physiological phenomena, is expressed by the law of Weber or Fechner,
 which it is sufficient for our present purposes to state in its original
form, because it is exceedingly simple, and is at the same time suffi
 ciently correct for all except extreme cases, in which certain alien
 considerations begin to exert a sensible influence.      According to this
 law (sensation = log. stimulus) the more the senses are stimulated,
 the more is their discriminative power blunted.       If a room is lighted
 by only single
           a        candle,  and a second  one  is brought in, the eye feels
 a certain increase of light.    Now, if 1000 candles had originally been
 in the room, it would require the addition, not of one candle, but of
 another 1000 candles, to produce the sense of a similar increase. In
 order that the magnitude of any sensation should increase by a series of
 equal steps, the magnitude of the stimulus that causes it must increase
 by successive multiples.     The one follows an arithmetic progression,
 the other a geometric one.
      A few simple experiments will illustrate this. Five perfectly
 black cards are taken, each of the size of half a sheet of note paper ;
 also a sheet of perfectly white note-paper.      The latter is torn in two,
 and one half is laid upon card No. 5, which it exactly covers.          The
 remaining half is carefully folded down its middle, and torn in two,
 and one portion is laid on card No. 4, of which it exactly covers one
 half.    The same process is continued, so that card 3 is covered to the
 extent of one quarter of its surface, 4 to one-eighth, and 5 to one-
 sixteenth, and there is a remnant of one-sixteenth, which may be thrown
 away. To avoid fractions, let us count the quantity of white on the black
 card No. 1 as one, then that on Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 will be as two, four,
 eight, and sixteen respectively, the latter standing for pure white.
 The next step is to cut the portions of paper into shreds, and to
 scatter them uniformly over their respective cards. In the specimens
 now upon the table this has been already done, and the shreds are
 pasted down.      The effect, when they are looked at from a little
 distance with the eye not focussed too sharply upon them, is that
 of a series of greys, which appear to be separated by equal intervals
 of tint from one another, although we know that the differences
 in the amount of white material is by no means uniform. The eye
 judges card No. 3, which contains four portions of white, to be of
 a medium tint between Nos. 1 and 5 ; but, as No. 1 contains one
  portion, and No. 5 contains sixteen portions, the medium quantity
 of white is really eight and    a half (because

 is somewhat lighter even than card No. 4, which contains eight
 portions.
      The same relation is true as regards sound. The difference of
 noise made by the fall of one shilling or of two shillings is not
 readily perceived, unless we are specially attending to it. Neither is
 the difference readily perceived between firing a 38-ton gun or two
 such guns from the turret of an ironclad, as was proved by the
 evidence in the late terrible accident on board the ' Thunderer.'
 Here is an apparatus of eight arms that may be lifted in succession
 and then let drop by turning a cylinder like that of a musical snuff
 box. Each arm as it falls makes the same amount of noise. The
 catches are so arranged on the cylinder that the effect of turning it is
 to lift and let drop first one arm, then two arms simultaneously, then
four, then all the eight. It will be observed that the apparent loud-
ness of sound increases by equal intervals, and not at all as the
numbers 1, 2, 4, 8.
     Finally, two large revolving discs are exhibited under illumina
tion.     They are painted black and white in five concentric rings, with
a perfectly black centre.     In the first of the two discs, counting pure
white as 6, the proportions of white to black in the successive rings
are as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, thus forming an arithmetical scries.         On turning
the wheel, the eye utterly repudiates the effect as being that of a
scries of equally gradated tints, and yet the actual quantities of white
form such a scries. In the second of the two discs, the proportions of
white to black in the successive rings follow Weber's law, or rather,
Delboeuf s modification of it ; the disc           is,

show this properly, the illumination has to be very carefully adjusted.
     These illustrations of Weber's law are submitted in order to make
manifest the great difference between the progressive increase of
objective causes and that of their corresponding subjective effects,
and to afford a primd facie evidence of the small influence likely to
be exercised upon    a   generic mental image by        repetition of similar
                                                         a
impressions.  I    do not venture as yet to assert that the law of Weber
applies to this case, but the probability of its doing so         pointed out,
                                                                        is

in some sense analogous to that of Weber. According to that law, if
it  required a   tenfold experience or       tenfold period of exposure to

 equivalent to fifty layers of transparent colour.     It was not intended
 to imply by this that the tint as estimated by the eye would be fifty
 times increased in dopth. The law of Weber tells us that it would not
 be anything like so deep as that in appearance.      Objectively speaking
 the tints of a phetographic composite are correct, but subjectively speak
 ing they are not. Hence there are three degrees of accuracy, respec
 tively corresponding to the three processes of (1) numerical averages,
 (2) of optical or photographic composites, and (3) of mental images.
 Numerical averages are absolutely correct in every sense. Optical
 and photographic composites are objectively correct, but subjectively
 incorrect.    Mental images are objectively incorrect, and they are
 subjectively incorrect in a double degree.       Supposing Weber's law
 to be applicable throughout, a white mark in any one of the portraits
 would leave a mark on the optical or photographic composite whose
 apparent intensity would vary as the logarithm of the time of photo
 graphic exposure, but the intensity of the white mark that it would
 leave on the mental composite would be only as the logarithm of that
 logarithm.
     Even this result is much too leniently calculated. It is based on the
 supposition that the visualising power is perfect, the memory absolutely
-retentive, and the attention perfectly free from bias. This is very far
 from being the case. Again, some of the images in every presumed
 generic group are sure to be aliens to the genus and to have become
 associated to the rest by superficial and fallacious resemblances, such
 as common minds are especially attentive to.         Seeing, as we easily
 may, what monstrous composites result from ill-sorted combina
 tions of portraits, and how much nicety of adjustment is required to
 produce the truest possible generic image, we cannot wonder at the
 absurd and frequent fallacies in our mental conceptions and general
 impressions.
     Our mental generic composites are rarely defined ; they have that
 blur in excess which photographic composites have in a small degree,
 and their background is crowded with faint and incongruous imagery.
 The exceptional effects are not overmastered, as they are in the photo
 graphic composites, by the large bulk of ordinary effects.       Hence, in
 our general impressions far too great weight is attached to what is
 strange and marvellous, and experience shows that the minds of
 children, savages, and uneducated persons have always had that
 tendency.      Experience warns us against   it,  and the scientific man
 takes care to base his conclusions upon actual numbers.
     The human mind     is  thereforea  most imperfect apparatus for the
 elaboration of general ideas.      Compared with those of brutes its
 powers are marvellous, but for all that they fall vastly short of per
 fection.   The criterion of    perfect mind would lie in its capacity of
 always creating images of   a a truly generic kind, deduced from the
 whole range of its past experiences.
     General impressions are never to be trusted. Unfortunately when
 they are of long standing they become fixed rules of life, and assume

  are not accustomed to original inquiry entertain a hatred and a horror
  of statistics. They cannot endure the idea of submitting their sacred
  impressions to cold-blooded verification.      But it is the triumph of
  scientific men to rise superior to such superstitions, to devise tests by
  which the value of beliefs may be ascertained, and to feel sufficiently
  masters of themselves to discard contemptuously whatever may be

 1878,   testifying to the continued prosperity and efficient management
 of the Institution, was read and adopted.        The Real and Funded
 Property now amounts to nearly 85,000Z., entirely derived from the
 Contributions and Donations of the Members.
      Sixty new Members paid their Admission Fees in 1878.
      Sixty-four Lectures and Nineteen Friday Evening Discourses wore
 delivered in 1878.
      The Books and Pamphlets presented in 1878 amounted to about
 344 volumes, making, with 281 volumes purchased by the Managers,
 a total of 562 volumes added to the Library in the year, exclusive of
periodicals.
     Thanks were voted to the President, Treasurer, and Secretary, to
the Committees of Managers and Visitors, and to the Professors, for
their services to the Institution during the past year.
     The most cordial thanks of the Members were given to His
Grace the President for his munificent gift of an Otto's Silent Gas-
engine and a De Meritens Magnet-Electric Machine, the principles
of which were explained and illustrated by Professor Tyndall.

                               The Habits  of Ants.
                         '
Mr. Grote, in his          Fragments on Ethical Subjects,' regards it as
an evident necessity that no society can exist without the sentiment
of morality.       " Everyone," he says, " who has either spoken or
written on the subject, has agreed in considering this sentiment as
absolutely indispensable to the very existence of society.           Without
 the diffusion of a certain measure of this feeling througheut all the
members of the social union, the caprices, the desires, and the
 passions of each separate individual would render the maintenance of
any     established   communion      impossible.   Positive morality, under
 some form or other, has existed       in every society of which the world
 has ever had experience."
      If  this be so, the question naturally arises whether ants also are
 moral and accountable beings. They bave their desires, their passions,
 even their caprices.      The young are absolutely helpless. Their com
 munities are sometimes so numerous, that perhaps London and Pekin
 are almost the only human cities which can compare with them.
 Moreover       their nests are no mere collections of independent
 individuals,     nor even temporary associations like the flocks of
 migratory birds ; but organized communities labouring with the
 utmost harmony for the common good.              The "remarkable analogies
  which they present in so many ways to our human societies render
  them peculiarly interesting to us, and one cannot but long to know
 more of their character, how the world appears to them, and to what
  extent they are conscious and reasonable beings.
                             I
      For my own part cannot make use of Mr. Grote's argument,
  because    I have elsewhere attempted to show that, even as regards
  man, the case is not by any means clear. But, however, this may be,
 various observers have recorded in the case of ants instances of
  attachment and affection.
      In various memoirs, published by the Linnean Society,           I  have
  discussed these instances, having reluctantly come to the conclusion
  that some of them at any rato rest on a very doubtful foundation.

   1879.]                       on the Habits  of Ants.                         175
        Yet  I am far from denying     that such cases do exist.     For instance,
   in  one  of my   nests   of Formica fusca was a poor ant, which        had come
   into the world without antennte.           Not having previously       met with
   such an individual,     I watched her with great interest, but        she never
   appeared to leave      the nest.                         I
                                       At length one day found her wander
   ing about outside    in an aimless sort of manner, and apparently not
   knowing her way at all. After a while she fell in with some
   specimens of Lasiusflavus, who directly attacked her.             I at once set
   myself to separate them, but whether owing to the wounds she had
   received from her enemies, or my rough, though well-meant, handling,
   or both, she was evidently sorely wounded, and lay helplessly on the
   ground.     After some time, another F. fusca from her nest came by.
   She examined the poor sufferer carefully, then picked her up tenderly
   and carried her away into the nest.            It would have been difficult
   for anyone who witnessed this scene to have denied to this ant the
  possession of humane feelings.
                I
       Indeed, have often been surprised that in certain emergencies, ants
  render one another so little assistance.         The tenacity with which they
  retain their hold on an enemy they have once seized, is well known.
  M. Mocquerys even assures us that the Indians of Brazil made use of
  this quality in the case of wounds, causing an ant to bite the two lips
  of the cut, and this bring them close, after which the ant's head is
  cut off, and thus holds the lips of the wound together. He asserts
  that he has often seen natives, with wounds in course of healing, by
  the assistance of a row of seven or eight ants' heads ! Now               I have
 often observed that some of my ants had the heads of others hanging
 on to their legs for a considerable time, and as this must certainly be
 very inconvenient, it seems remarkable that their friends should
 not relieve them of such an awkward encumbrance.
      As mentioned in the previous lecture, one of my queen ants
 (Formica fusca) had a large mite on the under side of her head.
 She could not remove it, and not one of her companions, for more
 than three months, performed this kind office for her. Being a queen,
she never left the nest, and       I therefore had no opportunity of helping
her.      Since then  I  have met with several similar cases.          Moreover,
I    have often put ants, which had become smeared with a sticky
 substance, on the boards close to my nests, and it was the exception
when their companions took any notice of or sought to disentangle
them ; though sooner or later this was generally done.
      I  have on a previous occasion endeavoured to give you a general
account of the habits of ants, and        I  will therefore now confine myself
to certain points.
      Before going further,      I think it will perhaps interest you to see
two or three species of ants, and with the kind help of Professor
                                                      I
Tyndall, Mr. Cottrell, and the electric lamp, shall hope to be able to
show you some on the screen.             At the same time      I  must ask your
indulgence, if they do      not  behave as  could  be wished, for it is a nervous
matter to appear before a Royal Institution audience.

176                             Sir John        Lubbock                [May   9,
     The first to which   I
                          will call your attention are the common little
meadow ants — Lasiue flams.             I
                                   shall hope to show you the young or
larvse, and the queen ; at this time of year there are no ptipre or males.
This queen was killed by an accident, but the ants appear to have
not yet realized their loss. When               I
                                          prepared this nest for them, and
they took possession of        it, was touching to see them carry in the
                                   it
poor dead queen.       The queens and males have wings, but after one
flight they themselves strip them off.
      The next speciesis  one which     shall have occasion to mention very
                                            I
often — Formica fusca.       Here also you will see that the queen has
stripped off her wings.
      In these species, though the workers differ more or less in size,
they are all alike in other respects      but in the next, which belongs to
                                                ;
the genus Pheidole,     there  are, as you will see, two distinct kinds of
workers.      These two  sorts, different  as they are, are of the same age
and sex, all being females, and moreover sisters, daughters of the same
 mother.     The large-headed individuals are generally called soldiers        ;

  I       now come to the slave-making ants. The mistresses in this
 species are entirely dependent on their slaves, and have even lost the
 instinct of feeding.     If placed by themselves, they starve even in the
 midst of plenty ;   but, as  I mentioned in my previous lecture,  I     kept  a
 couple alive and well for months by giving them             slave for an hour
                                                               a
  every morning to clean and feed them.
       None of our northern ants store up grain, and hence there has been
  much discussion as to the well-known passage of Solomon.                It is,
  however, now  a   well-established fact that more than one species of
  South European ants do collect seeds of various kinds.           I have kept
  several, and have now    a nest of one of these species under observation.
  The quantity of grain thus stored up               is
                                                   sometimes so considerable
  that in the Mischna rules are laid down with reference to it; and
  various commentators, including the celebrated Maimonides, have
  discussed at length the question whether such grain belonged to the
  owner of the land, or might be taken by gleaners — giving the latter
  the benefit of the doubt they do not appear to have considered the
                               :

       A Texan ant, Pogonomymex barbatns,            also isharvesting species,

   storing up especially   the  grains  of   Arislida  oligantha, the so-called
   " ant rice," and of grass, BuMce dactyloides. These ants clear disks,

   10 or 12 feet in diameter, round the entrance to their nest,        awork of
   no small labour in the rich soil, and under the hot sun, of Texas.         I
        "
   say clear disks," but some, though not all, of these disks are occupied,
   especially round the edge, by        growth of ant rice. Dr. Lincecum,
                                            a
   who first gave an account of these insects, maintained not only that
   the ground was carefully cleared of all other species of plants, but
   that this grass was intentionally cultivated by the ants. Mr. McCook,
   by whom tho subject has been recently studied, fully confirms Dr.

1879.]                      on the Habits of Ants.                      177
Lincecum that the disks are kept carefully clean, that the ant rice
alone is permitted to grow on them, and that the produce of this crop
is carefully harvested ; but he thinks that the ant rice sows itself, and
is not actually cultivated by the ants.        I have myself observed in
Algeria,    that some  species  of plants are allowed by the ants to grow
on their nests.
      But though our English ants do not actually store up provisions,
they show a considerable amount of prudence and foresight in other
ways.      If you examine almost any ants' nest, you will find, besides the
ants, a larger or smaller number of other insects ; the quantity varying
according to the season, the species of ant, and other circumstances.
Of course association in some cases is purely accidental and without
 significance.    In a large number of instances, however, this is by no
means the case, and Mr. Andre gives a list of no less than 584 species
of insects which are habitually found in association with ants.
      In some of them no doubt the bond of union is merely the selec
 tion of similar places of abode ; in some few others the ants are vic
 timized by parasites of which they cannot rid themselves. There is for
 instance a small black fly, belonging to the genus Phora, which lays
 her eggs on ants.             I
                        Again have already mentioned the mites which
live parasitically on ants. Then there are some insects, such as the
 caterpillar of that beautiful beetle, the rosechafer, which find a con
 genial place of residence among the collection of bits of stick, &c.,
 of which certain species of ants make their nests.
      Another class of ant guests are those which reside actually in the
 galleries and chambers of, and with, the ants, but which the latter
 never touch. Of these the commonest in England are a species
  allied to Podura, for which    I have proposed the name BecMa.        It is
  an active bustling little being, and     I  have kept hundreds,     I may
 say thousands, in my nests.       They run about in and out among the
 ants, keeping their antennae in a perpetual state of vibration. Another
 very common species is a sort of white woodlouse, which enjoys the
 rather long name of Platyarthrus Hojjfmanseggii.      It also runs about,
 and is evidently at home, among the ants. Both of these species from
 living constantly in the dark have become blind ;            I  say
                                                                      " have
  become," because their ancestors no doubt had eyes.       Now in neither
  of these cases have    I  ever seen an ant take the slightest notice of
 either of these insects. One might almost imagine they had the cap
 of invisibility.
                                                                  I
       It is, however, certain that the ants intentionally (if may so
  say) sanction the residence of these insects in their nests.     An unau
  thorized interloper would be at once killed.          I   have   therefore
  ventured to suggest that these insects may perhaps act as scavengers.
       A still more interesting case is afforded by the relations existing
  between the ants and aphides, which have been justly called the cows
  of the ants. The latter secrete a sweet juice of which the ants are
  very fond, and the ants may constantly be seen running up trees and
  plants, on which the aphides live, in search of this nutritious food.

 178                               Sir John Lullock                        [May   9,
 The ant may be seen to tap the aphis gently with its antenna, when
 the latter squeezes out a drop of sweet syrup, which the ant greedily
 sucks up.      Sometimes the ants carry earth up low plants, and build a
 sort of shed over the aphides, which they also defend from the attacks of
 other insects. The Baltic amber contains among the remains of many
 other insects a species of ant intermediate between our small brown
 garden ants, and the little yellow meadow ants, and which is possibly
 the stock from which these and other allied species are descended.
 One is even tempted to suggest that the brown species which live so
 much in the open air, and climb up trees and bushes, have retained
 and even deepened their dark colour ; while others, such as Lasius
flaws, the yellow meadow ant, which lives almost entirely below
 ground, has become much paler. But though this Logins flavus has
 thus ceased to visit the aphides above ground, it has perhaps acquired
 its subterranean habit from having discovered certain species of under
 ground aphides, which live on the roots of grass, and which the ants
 collect into their nests, where these aphides abound, while they are
 comparatively rare in the surrounding soil.                 These subterranean
 aphides, like those which live above ground, secrete a sweet juice
 which forms no small part of the sustenance of the ants.               There are
 several species of them in my neighbourhood ; five are very common.
 The ants take great care of them, and if the nest is disturbed hasten
 to carry them away to a place of safety.
     Various other species of insects are utilized by ants very much in
the same manner as aphides, namely, some species of coccus allied to
                                            "
 the cochineal insect, and the " scale         of our greenhouses, and a number
of beetles, some of which, like the Beckia, are perfectly blind.
     Perhaps the most remarkable case of all still remains to be men
 tioned.     Insects of this group are known to be utilized by ants in
tropical countries ; but no such relation was known to exist between
our English species.          I  found, however, in nests of L. flavus some
black eggs which were watched over by the ants with great care, and
 which eventually turned out to be those of an aphis.                 Now these
 eggs are laid in the autumn ; they do not hatch till the end of
 February, or even till May, and yet during the whole of that time
they are tended by the ants.            This is perhaps, taking all in all, the
most striking case of prudence recorded in the animal kingdom.
     I  would by no means intend to imply that the relations between
ants and the other insects which live with them are exhausted by the
 above suggestions.         On the contrary, various other reasons may bo
 imagined which may render the presence of these insects useful, or
 agreeable, to the ants.        For instance, they may emit an odour which
is pleasant      to  the  ants.     Again, Mr. Francis Gallon has,        I  think,
 rendered    it very probable     that  most of our domestic animals were kept
 as pets before they were made of any use.                 Unlikely as this may
 appear    in  some   cases, for   instance   in the  pig, we know as a fact that
 pigs  are  often   kept by savages     as pets.   I would  not put it forward as
 a suggestion which can be supported by any solid reasoning, but it

1879.]                     on the Habits  of Ants.                        179
seems not altogether impossible that some of these tame insects may bo
kept as pets.
      I have already mentioned that while Lasius niger, the brown garden
ant, habitually makes use of the out-of-doors aphides, the yellow
meadow ant keeps the underground kind ; but within the limits of the
same species there appear to be considerable differences.           M. Lespes
even considered that some communities of L. niger were more advanced
in civilization than others of the same species.       Ho assures us that if
he took specimens of their domestic beetles from one nest and placed
them in another, always be it understood of the same species, the
beetles were attacked and eaten.       I  have not had the opportunity of
repeating these experiments, but     I have moved specimens of the blind
woodlonse, Platyarthrus, from one nest to another, and even from
nests of one species to those of another, and they were always amicably
received.      But whether there are differences in advancement within
the limits of the same species or not, there are certainly considerable
differences between the different species, and one may almost fancy
that we can trace stages corresponding to the principal steps in the
history of human development.
      I  do not now refer to slave-making ants, which represent an
abnormal, or perhaps only a temporary state of things, for slavery
seems to tend in ants as in men to the degradation of those by whom
it is adopted, and it is not impossible that the slave-making species will
eventually find themselves unable to compete with those which are more
self-dependent, and have reached a higher phase of civilization. But
putting these slave-making ants on one side, we find in the different
species of ants different conditions of life, curiously answering to the
earlier stages of human progress. For instance, some species, such as
Formica fusca, live principally on the produce of the chase ; for though
they feed partly on the honey-dew of aphides, they have not domesticated
their insects.    These ants probably retain the habits once common to all
ants.      They resemble the lower races of men, who subsist mainly by
hunting. Like them they frequent woods and wilds, live in compara
tively small communities, and the instincts of collective action are but
 little developed among them. They hunt singly, and their battles are
 single combats, like those of Homeric heroes.        Such species as Lasius
flavus   represent a distinctly higher  type of social  life ; they show more
 skill in architecture, may literally be said to have domesticated certain
 species of aphides, and may be compared to the pastoral stage of
 human progress —to the races which live on the produce of their
 flocks and herds. Their communities are more numerous ; they act
 much more in concert ; their battles are not mere single combats, but
 they know how to act in combination.         I am disposed to hazard the
 conjecture that they will gradually exterminate the mere hunting
 species, just as savages disappear before more advanced races. Lastly,
 the agricultural    nations may be compared with the harvesting
 ants.
      Thus there seem to be throe principal types, offering a curious

analogy to the three great phases — the hunting, pastoral, and agricul
tural stages — in the history of human development.
            I                             I
    When first hegan keeping ants, surrounded the nests by moats
of water. This acted well, but the water required continually renew
ing, especially, of course, in summer, just when the ants were most
active. At length, however, in considering the habits of ants and
their relation to flowers, another plan suggested itself to me. The
hairs by which plants are clothed are of various forms, and fulfil
                             I
various functions ; one is, believe, to prevent ants and other creeping
insects from climbing up the plants so as to obtain access to the
flowers, and thus rob them of their honey ; for though ants are in
some respects very useful to plants, they are not wanted in the
flowers. The great object of the beauty, scent, and honey of flowers,
is to secure cross fertilization ; but for this purpose winged insects
are almost necessary, because they fly readily from one plant to
another, and generally confine themselves for a certain time to the
same species.      Creeping insects, on the other hand, naturally would
pass from one flower to another on the same plant ; and as Mr.
Darwin has shown, it is desirable that the pollen should be brought
from a different plant altogether.      Moreover, when ants quit a plant,
they naturally creep up another close by, without any regard to
species.   Hence, even to small flowers, such as many crucifene, com
posite, saxifrages, &c., which, as far as size is concerned, might well
be fertilized by ants, the visits of flying insects are much more advan
tageous.    Moreover, if larger flowers were visited by ants, not only
would they deprive the flowers of their honey without fulfilling any
useful function in return, but they would probably prevent the really
useful visits of bees.    If you touch an ant with a needle or a bristle,
 she is almost sure to seize it in her jaws ; and if bees, when visiting
any particular plant, were liable to have the delicate tip of their pro
boscis seized on by the honey jaws of an ant, we may be sure that
such a species of plant would soon cease to be visited.        On the other
 hand, we know how fond ants are of honey, and how zealously and
 unremittingly they search for food. How is it then that they do not
anticipate the bees, and secure the honey for themselves ? This is
 guarded against in several ways.          Some plants are covered with
 glandular hairs, which make them so sticky that ants do not attempt
 to walk up them. Some are said to be so slippery that ants cannot
do so. Some flowers are closed so that ants cannot get into them.
 But the commonest protection, perhaps, of all is provided, as havo    I
mentioned, by a clothing of downward-pointing hairs, making a sort
 of cheveux de frise which effectually stops the ants. It occurred to
 me, therefore, that instead of water    I  might use fur, arranged so that
 the hairs pointed downwards.         This   I have found to answer per
 fectly, and   I mention it specially because the same arrangement may
 perhaps be found practically useful in hot climates.
     When     I  last had the honour of addressing you,        I mentioned
 various experiments which proved that ants remembered         their  friends

1879.]                       on the Habits   of Ants.               181
for more than   a year.   Having separated a nest of JF". fusca into two
halves,  I put from time to time one of the ants from one half into the
other, and in every case she was amicably received ; while strangers
from another nest, although of the same species, were invariably
attacked.
     It is clear, then, that the ants recognize all their fellows in the
same nest, but it is very difficult to understand how this can be
effected.  The nests vary very much in size, but in many species 100,000
individuals is by no means an unusual number, and in some instances,
even this is largely exceeded.      Now, it seems almost incredible that
in such cases every ant should know every other one by sight.
     It has been suggested, in the case of bees, that each nest might
have some sign or password.
     The whole subject is full of difficulty.   It occurred to me, how
ever, that experiments with pupae might throw some light upon it.
Although the ants of every nest, say of Formica fusca, are deadly
enemies, still, if larvre or pups from one nest are transferred to
another, they are kindly received, and tended with, apparently, as
much care as if they really belonged to the nest.         In ant warfare,
though sex is no protection, the young are spared— at least, when they
belong to the same species.       Moreover, though the habits and dispo
sition of ants are greatly changed if they are taken away from their
nest and kept in solitary confinement, or only with a few friends, still,
under such circumstances, they will carefully tend any young which
may be confided to them.        Now, if the recognition were effected by
means of some signal or password, then, as it can hardly be supposed
that the larvae or pupas would bo sufficiently intelligent to appreciate,
still less to remember       it,
                               the pupae which were entrusted to ants
from another nest, would have the password,            any, of that nest,
                                                        if
and not of the one from which they had been taken.          Hence, if the
recognition were effected by some password or sign with the antennas,
they would be amicably received in the nest from which their nurses
had been taken, not in their own.
 I     took, therefore,  anumber of pupa) out of some of the nests of
Formica fusca and Lasius niger, and put them in small glasses, some
with ants from their own nest, some with ants from another nest of
the same species.
    The result of my observations was that thirty-two ants belonging
to Formica fiisca and Lasius niger, removed from their nest as pupae,
attended by friends, and restored to their own nest, were all amicably
received. What      isstill more remarkable, of twenty-two ants belong
ing to Formica fusca, removed as pupte, attended by strangers, and
returned to their own nest, twenty were amicably received, though, in
several cases, after some hesitation.
    Of the same number of Lasius niger, developed in the same
manner, from pupae tended by strangers belonging to the same species,
and then returned into their own nest, seventeen          were amicably
received, three were attacked, and about two      felt doubtful.

into the nest of these nurses, were all attacked. The results may be

                        * About three of these 1 did not feel sure.
     I  hepe to make further experiments in this direction, but the
above   results seem very interesting.              They appear to indicate that
ants of the same nest do not recognize one another by any password.
On the other hand, if ants are removed from a nest in the pupa) state,
tended by strangers, and then restored, some at least of their relatives
are certainly puzzled, and in many cases doubt their claim to con
sanguinity.     Strangers, under the same circumstances, would be imme
diately attacked: these ants, on the contrary, were in every case, —
sometimes, however, only after examination, — amicably received by
the majority of the colony, though it even then seemed as if there were
still a few ants who did not recognize them.
     I had hoped to have been able to keep various species of ants
together, trusting that if they were well supplied with food and
water they would not attack one another.                         In this expectation      I
have been disappointed.          My ants quite appreciate the importance
of rectifying their frontier, and in their case, as in others nearer
home, it is especially the strong communities which feel the need of
a scientific frontier to enable them to defend themselves from the
attacks of the weak.
     In the construction of their nests ants manifest much ingenuity.
Thus, in one case        I established some ants between two plates of
glass, £ inch apart, and with three sides closed, but the fourth
open.     This suited them very well, but they did not like being so
much exposed ; accordingly they had recourse to a heap of earth, which
was about three feet from the nest, and brought enough of it to
close up the open side, leaving only a small door.                        In winter they
generally   fasten  up their  doors.       The     majority       of our   species live in
the ground, some construct mounds, some burrow in wood. In parts
of South America liable to floods, the ants have learnt to construct
their nests in trees above the reach of the water.
     Until recently we had no knowledge as to how long ants lived,
but the general impression was that the workers lived one year, the
queens somewhat longer. The results of my observations have proved
that this was a mistake, and             I   have been much surprised at the
longevity of my ants.       I  have still two queens which                   I   have kept

 1879.]                   on the Habits of Ants.                      183
 under observation since the year 1874, and they were at that time
 probably at least a year old. They must, however, at any rate be
 now at least five years old, and may be more.     As regards workers,  I
 have also many belonging to several species which     I  have kept since
 1875, and which must be at least four years old.
     But though they are thus long lived, and proved very healthy in
 my nests, still sometimes, and especially with new nests, there was
 a good deal of mortality among them.        They generally come out of
 the nest to die; but if they are from any reason unable to do so,
 their companions bring tho corpses out of the nest and carry them
 off to some little distance.    Nay, I have even found that they are
 generally placed more or less together, so as to constitute a sort of
burial-ground.
     It is remarkable that notwithstanding the labours of so many
excellent observers, and though ants swarm in every field and every
wood, we did not till lately know how their nests commence.
     Three principal modes have been suggested : after the marriage
flight, the young queen may either —
     1. Join her own, or some other old nest ;
     2. Associate herself with a certain number of workers, and with
their assistance commence a new nest ; or
     3. Found a new nest by herself.
     As some nests continue to flourish for many years, the first case
must be frequent, though     I am not aware that any observations with
reference to it are on record. Whether the other two occur, can, of
course, only be settled by observation, and the experiments made to
determine it have hitherto been indecisive.     Blanchard, indeed, in his
                                           '
work on the ' Metamorphoses of Insects (I quote from Dr. Duncan's
translation, p. 205), says, " Huber observed a solitary female go down
into a small underground hole, take off her own wings, and become,
 as it were, a worker : then she constructed a small nest, laid a few
 eggs, and brought up the larvae by acting as mother and nurse at the
same time."
     This, however, is not quite a correct version of what Huber says.
                    I
His words are : " enclosed several females in a nest of light humid
earth, with which they constructed lodges, where they resided : some
singly, others in common.        They laid their eggs and took great
care of them : and notwithstanding the inconvenience of not being
able to vary the temperature of their habitation, they reared some,
which became larvae of a tolerable size, but which soon perished
from the effects of my own negligence."
     It will be observed that it was the eggs — not the larveo — which,
according to Huber, these isolated females reared.     It is true that he
attributes the early and uniform death of the larvae to his own negli
gence ; but the fact remains, that in none of his observations did an
isolated female bring her offspring to maturity.     Forel even thought
himself justified in concluding, from his own observations and those
of Ebrard, that such a fact could not occur. Lepeletier de St. Fargeau

  184                            Sir John Lubbock                           [May  9,
  was of opinion that ants' nests originate in the second mode indicated
  above, and it is indeed far from improbable that this may occur.               No
  clear case has, however, yet been observed.
      Under these circumstances,        I  made various experiments, in order,
  if possiblo, to solve the question. For instance,           I took an old fertile
 queen from a nest of Lasius flams, and put her to another nest of the
 same species.     The workers became very excited, and killed her.                I
 repeated the experiment, with the same result, more than once.
      I concluded then that, at any rate in the case of Lasius flavus, the
 workers would not adopt an old queen from another nest.
      The following instanco, however, shows that whether or not ants'
 nests sometimes originate in the two former modes or not, at any rate
 in some cases isolated queen ants are capable of giving origin to a
 new community.        On the 14th August, 1876,          I isolated two pairs of
 Myrmica ruginodis, which         I  found flying in my garden.           I  placed
 them with damp earth, food and water, and they continued perfectly
 healthy through the winter.           The first eggs were laid between the
 12th and 23rd of April.
      They began to hatch the first week in June ; the first turned to a
 chrysalis on the 27th, and emerged as a perfect insect on the 22nd
 July. Others followed shortly afterwards, and this experiment proves
 therefore that the queens of this species, at any rate, have the instinct
 of bringing up larvae, and consequently the power of founding new
 communities.
      Amongst other experiments to test the affection of ants for one
 another,  I tried the following.      I  took six ants from a nest of Formica
fusca, imprisoned    them  in  a small   bottle, one end of which was left open,
 but covered by    a layer  of   muslin.     I then   put the bottle close to the
 door of the nest. The muslin was of open texture, the meshes, however,
being sufficiently fine to prevent the ants from escaping. They could
 not only see one another, but communicate freely with their antennie.
 We now watched to see whether the prisoners would be tended or fed
 by their friends.     We could not, however, observe that the least
notice was taken of them.           The experiment, nevertheless, was less
conclusive than could be wished, because they might have been fed at
night, or at some time when we were not looking.                     It struck me,
therefore, that it would be interesting to treat some strangers also in
the same manner.
     Now some critics have objected to my experiments (always, must          I
admit, in the fairest and most friendly spirit) that my ants may have
been stupid ants, and that the experiments being in many cases
(though by no means in all) made on captive nests, were on that
account also scarcely fair to the ants.            Indeed,  I   have myself anti
cipated   and  pointed  out  this   objection.    I  am  disposed   to believe that
in warmer countries the ants are more highly developed, as everyone
knows is the case with reference to numbers, than in our comparatively
cold regions.     Again, much allowance must certainly be made for the
fact of the ants being in captivity.             However,     I  have always en

1879.]                       on the Habits     of Ants.                   185
deavoured so to devise my experiments that they might be tested and
repeated under other conditions and with other species.              Now as
                                                         "
regards the one just mentioned, it may be said, Oh, but these ants
were under very unnatural conditions.            In their native haunts they
would never find their friends imprisoned in a glass bottle fastened
up with muslin." That is of course true ; but then it occurred to me
to try the experiment with strangers.
    I    put, therefore, two ants from one of my nests of F. fusca into a
bottle, the end of which was tied up with muslin as described, and
                                                              I
laid it down close to the nest. In a second bottle put two other ants
from another nest of the same species.              The ants which were at
 liberty took no notice of the bottle containing their imprisoned
 friends.     The strangers in the other bottle, on the contrary, excited
 them considerably.        The whole day one, two, or more ants stood
 sentry,    as  it were,  over   the bottle.   In the evening no less than
 twelve were collected round           it, larger number than usually came
                                           a
 out of the nest at any one time.         The whole of the next two days, in
  the same way, there were more or less ants round the bottle containing
  the strangers, while, as far as we could see, no notice whatever was
 taken of the friends.         On the 9th the ants had eaten through the
 muslin and effected an entrance, when the strangers were at onco
  attacked, while, on the other hand, the friends throughout were quite
 neglected.
       It would appear, therefore, that in these curious little creatures
  hatred is   stronger than love.
       These observations seemed to me sufficient to test the behaviour
  of the ants belonging to this nest under these circumstances.               I
  thought it    desirable, however, to try other communities.     I  selected,
  therefore, two other nests.        One behaved just like the preceding.
   The other was  a      community of Polyergus rufescens, with numerous
   slaves. Close to where the ants of this nest came to feed      I placed as
   before two small bottles, closed in the same way, one containing two
   slave ants from the nest, the other two strangers. These ants, however,
   behaved quite unlike the preceding, for they took no notice of either
   bottle, and showed no sign either of affection or hatred. Is not ono
   tempted to surmise that the warlike spirit of these ants was broken
  by slavery  ?
        In the previous lecture   I   mentioned that       was never ablo to
   satisfy myself    that ants  heard any   sounds which  I I
                                                            could produce.    I
   would not, however, by any means infer from this that they aro
   incapable of hearing.
        Micromegas, indeed, the gigantic inhabitant of Sirius, concluded
   that as he heard no sound, men did not speak moreover, Voltaire makes
                                                      ;
   him ask, " How  is   it   possible that such infinitesimal atoms as men
   should have organs of voice        and what could they have to say
                                       ?                                  ? To

similar series of errors.         It is far from improbable that ants may
produce sounds entirely beyond our range of hearing.            Indeed, it is
not impossible that insects may possess a sense, or rather, perhaps,
sensations, of which we can no more form an idea than we should
have been able to conceive red or green had the human race been
blind. Hclmholtz and Depretz have shown that the human ear is
sensitive to vibrations reaching to 38,000 in a second.        The sensation
of red is produced when 470 millions of millions of vibrations of
ether enter the eye in a similar time ; but between 38,000 and 470
millions of millions, vibrations produce on us the sensation of heat
only. We have no special organs of sense adapted to them, but there
is no reason in the nature of things why this should be the case with
other animals, and the problematical organs possessed by many of the
lower forms favour the suggestion.              If   any apparatus could be
devised by which the number of vibrations produced by any given
cause could be lowered so as to be brought within the range of our
ears, it is probable that the result would bo most interesting.
     I  have tried unsuccessfully various experiments in order to ascer
tain whether the ants themselves produced any sounds for the purpose
of conveying signs or ideas.
     Professor Tyndall was good enough to arrange for me one of his
sensitive flames, but      I   could not perceive that it responded in any
way to my ants.       The experiment was not, however, very satisfactory,
as  I  was not able to try the flame with a very active nest.      Professor
Bell was also good enough to set up for me an extremely sensitive
microphone ; it was attached to the under side of one of my nests, but
though we could distinctly hear the ants walking about, we could not
perceive any other sound.
                                                   I
     It is, however, of course possible, as have already suggested,
that ants may be sensitive to, and also themselves produce, sounds
which, from the rapidity of their vibrations, or from some other cause,
are beyond our range of hearing.
     Having failed, however, in hearing them or making them hear me,
I  endeavoured to ascertain whether they could hear one another. To
determine, if possible whether they have the power of summoning one
another by sound,      I   tried the following experiments.     I put out on
the board where one of my nests of Lasins flavus was usually fed, six
small pillars of wood about an inch and a half high, and on one of
        I
them put some honey.              A number of ants were wandering about on
the board in search of food, and the nest itself was about 12 inches
from the board.      I  then put three ants to the honey, and when each
had sufficiently   fed    I   imprisoned her and put another ; thus always
keeping    three ants  at   the  honey, but not allowing them to go home.
If, then, they could summon their friends by sound, there ought soon
to have been many ants at the honey. The results were as follows : —
     We began to watch at 11, and up to 3 in the afternoon only seven
ants had found their way to the honey, which was about as many as
ran up the other pillars. The arrival of theso seven, therefore, was

not more than would naturally have resulted from the number of ants
running about. We then, at 3, allowed the ants which were feeding
to return to the nest.           In less than half an hour after this eleven
came, and in the following half hour no less than forty-three.                So
that in the first four hours only seven came, while in less than an hour
after the first was allowed to return to the nest, no less than fifty-four
came.
     Again,    on September 30th,       I tried the same arrangement, beginning
at 11   ; up   to  3 .30,  seven   ants  came.    We then let them go.     From
3.30 to 4.30, twenty-eight came.               From 4.30 to 5, fifty-one came.
Thus, in four hours and a half only soven came ; while when they
were allowed to return, no less than seventy-nine came in an hour and
a half.
     I   tried    this experiment several times more, and always with
similar results.       It seems obvious, therefore, that, in three cases at
least, no communication was transmitted by sound.
     I  will now endeavour to show you one or two microscopical pre
parations, merely to give you a very slight idea how beautiful and
complex the anatomical structure of an ant is. Here is a longitudinal
section of a queen ant.
     Sir John then       proceeded    to describe the principal points : —
     The organs of vision of ants are generally well developed and
conspicuous.         There are usually three simple eyes, or ocelli, arranged
in a triangle on top of the head, and on each side a large compound
eye.      These compound eyes are very complex organs, but the mode in
which they act is by no means understood. They consist of a number
of facets, varying from 1-5 in Ponera contractu, to more than 1000
in each eye — as, for instance, in the males of F. pratensis. In fact,
these, so far fortunate, insects realize the wish of the poet—
                          " Theu lookest on the stars, my love,
                              Ab, would that I could be
                            Yon starry skies, with theusand eyes
                              That I might look on thee."
     But if the male of F. pratensis sees 1000 queens at once, even when
only one is really present, this would seem to be a bewildering privi
lege, and the prevailing opinion among entomologists is that each
facet only takes in a portion of the object.
     From the observations of Sprengel, there could, of course, be
little, if any, doubt, that bees are capable of distinguishing colours :
      I
but have, in my previous lecture, recorded some experiments which
put the matter beyond a doubt.                Under these circumstances,   I was
naturally anxious to ascertain if possible, whether the same is the
case with ants.        I  have, however, experienced more difficulty in doing
so, because ants find their food so much more by smell than by sight.
     I    tried, for instance, placing food at the bottom of a pillar of
coloured paper, and then moving both the pillar and the food. The
pillar, however, did not seem to help the ant at all to find her way to
                                                                     o 2

188                             Sir John Lubbock                        [May  9,
the food.     I  then placed the food on top of a rod of wood 8 inches
high, in fact a pencil, and when the ant knew her way perfectly well
to the food, so that she went quite straight backwards and forwards
to the nest,    I found that if    I  moved tho pillar of wood only 6 inches,
the ant was quite bewildered, and wandered about backwards and
forwards, round and round, and at last only found the pillar accident
ally   as it were.
     Under these circumstances,          I  could not apply to ants those tests
which had been used in the case of bees. At length, however, it
occurred to me that        I  might utilize the dislike which ants, when in
their nests, have to light. Of course, they have no such feeling when
they are out in search of food : but if light be let in upon their
nests, they at once hurry about in search of the darkest corners, and
there they     all congregate.       If, for instance,    I uncovered one of my
nests, and then placed an opaque substance            over one portion, the ants
invariably collected in the shaded part.
     I  procured, therefore, four strips of glass, similar, but coloured
respectively green, yellow, red, and blue, or, rather, violet.               Tho
yellow    was   somewhat     paler   in    shade, and   that  glass consequently
more transparent than the green, which, again, was rather more trans
parent than the red or violet.           I  then laid the strips of glass on one
of my nests of Formica fusca, containing about 170 ants. These ants,
as   I  knew by previous observations, seek darkness, and would cer
tainly collect under any opaque substance.             I then, after counting the
 ants under each strip, moved the colours gradually at intervals of
about half an hour, so that each sheuld by turns cover the same portion
 of the nest.      The results were as follows — the numbers indicating
 the approximate numbers of ants under each glass (there were some
 times a few not under any of the strips of glass) : —

     Adding these numbers together, there were, in the twelve observa
 tions, under the red 890, under the green 544, under the yellow 495,
 and under the violet only 5. The case of the violet glass is most
 marked.    To our eyes the violet was as opaque as the red, more so
 than the green, and much more so than the yellow, yet, as the
 numbers show, the ants had scarcely any tendency to congregate
 under it. There were nearly as many under the same area of the
 uncovered portion of the nest as under that shaded by the violet
glass.
     I also experimented     in the same way with a nest of Formica fusca,
 in which    there were some chrysalises.             These chrysalises were
 generally collected into a single heap.        I used glasses coloured dark
yellow, dark green, light yellow, light green, red, violet, and dark
 purple.   The colours wero always in the same order, but the places
 were shifted after each observation.          To my eye tho purple was
 almost black, the violet and dark green very dark and almost opaque;
 the purple could be dimly seen through the red, rather more clearly
 through the dark yellow, while the light yellow and light green were
 almost transparent.      The purple were in fifteen observations six times
 placed   under   the dark   green, threo under dark yellow, four under
 dark red, once each under light yellow and light green, but not once
 under the violet or purple.       In another experiment the purple were
 placed seven times under the red, six under the dark yellow, never
 under any of the other colours.          The same experiment tried with
another species — Lasius niger — gave very similar results ; the purple
being placed in forty experiments, nineteen times under the dark
yellow, sixteen under the red, five under the green. In some sub
sequent experiments the green and yellow seemed to be decidedly
preferred to the red.
     It is curious that the coloured glasses appear to act on the ants
(speaking roughly) as they would, or,        I  should rather say, inversely
as they would on a photographic plate.             It might even be alleged
that the avoidance of the violet glass by the ants was due to the
chemical rays which are transmitted.             From the habits of these
insects such an explanation was very improbable.             If, however, the
preference for the other coloured glasses to the violet was due to the
transmission, and not to the absorption of rays, that is to say, if
tho ants went under the green and red rather than the violet, because

 the green and red transmitted rays which were agreeable to the ants,
 and which the violet glass, on the contrary, stopped, then, if the violet
 was placed over the other colours, they would become as distasteful to
 the ants as the violet itself.    On the contrary, however, whether the
 violet glass was placed over the others or not, the ants equally readily
 took shelter under them. Obviously, therefore, the ants avoid the
 violet glass because they dislike the rays which it transmits.
      Mr. Busk suggested that as the red glass stops the chemical rays
 more effectually than the yellow or green, while the violet is most
 transparent to them, and as the ants appear to prefer the red glass to
 the yellow or green, and these, again, to the violet, possibly the
 explanation might be that the chemical rays were peculiarly dis
 tasteful to them. To test this, therefore,      I  made some experiments
 with fluorescent liquids, which Mr. Hanbury was kind enough to
 procure for me.      I poured them into shallow glass cells, about half
 an inch deep, which    I put, as before, over the ants.    If now they were
 affected mainly by the chemical rays, it must appear to them to be
 dark under these solutions.      This, however, was not the case. Tho
 solutions seemed to make no difference to them.         I also tried quinine
 and uranium glass with the same effect.          I conclude therefore that
 the ants are affected by the true light rays.
      It is obvious that these facts suggest a number of interesting
 inferences.    I  must, however, repeat the observations and make
 others ; but we may at least,     I  think, conclude from the preceding
 that : (1) ants have the power of distinguishing colour ; (2) that
 they are very sensitive to violet light ; and it would also seem (3)
 that their sensations of colour must be very different from these
 produced upon us.
      But though it is thus,   I  think, sufficiently evident that ants are
 differently affected by different colours, it by no means follows that
 they should see them as we do.        It is, indeed, most remarkable how
 little we yet know with reference to their real nature, or how nature
herself appears to them. What actual impressions do colours give
 them ?    What are the limits of their vision, how far, and how dis
tinctly can they see ; can they hear any sounds, or do they live in
everlasting silence ? Have they senses with reference to which we
have as yet no knowledge ? Last, but not least, how far are they mere
exquisite automatons ; how far are they conscious beings ? When
we see an ant-hill, tenanted by thousands of industrious inhabitants,
excavating chambers, forming tunnels, making roads, guarding their
home, gathering food, feeding the young, tending their domestic
animals, each one fulfilling its duties industriously, and without con
fusion, it is difficult altogether to deny to them the gift of reason ;
and yet it is perhaps wiser to admit that the whole question is still a
mystery.

             The Optical Study      of the Elasticity cf Solid Bodies.
                              Preliminary      Remarks.
All   solid bodies utilized in scientific and industrial applications are
more or less elastic : and it is very important, in a practical as well
as a theoretical point of view, to be able to predict the deformations
due to given forces, or, conversely, to know the forces which corre
spond to given deformations.
    Mathematical Calculation enables us to solve both problems for
every description of form and of force in all their details, provided
that it borrows from experience certain results obtained in very
simple cases.
                        Homogeneous     and Isotropic Bodies.
    An elastic bar urged by external traction forces extends itself
along its largest dimensions (longitudinal extension) : at the same
time, by the natural play of internal forces, its transversal dimensions
diminish (transversal contraction).
        [Illustration of this general fact with an indiarubber bar.]
    In order to calculate all the circumstances of deformation of an
elastic isotropic body, whatever may be its shape and acting forces,
it is sufficient to know the rate of longitudinal extension (modulus of
elasticity), and its ratio to the transversal contraction.
  Various opinions amongst        the  Physicists upon    the value  of this Ratio.
    A   considerable number of physicists (Cagniard-Latour, Wertheim,
Prof. Kirchhoff, Dr. Everett, &c.) have            made a series of experiments
on various supposed isotropic bodies.
    The question, a very important one in a theoretical point of view,
is to know if this, ratio is a variable one according to the nature of

                    2.  Use of the Newton's  Coloured  Rings.
      Newton's rings are produced by illuminating with white or with
 monochromatic light the thin film of air comprised between a fixed
 surface and the exterior surface of the elastic body.
      Extreme sensitiveness of this methed, according to the small
 difference of thickness, corresponding to the successive rings.
      The lines of equal intensity of the rings correspond to the lines of
equal thickness of the film of air. The successive rings correspond to
a difference of thickness of about £ of a thousandth of a millimeter (a
hundred thousandth of an inch).
      If the fixed surface is a plane ono, the appearance of the rings is
exactly the topographic map of the deformed surface, of which the
scale of elevation is the small length above defined.
     In a small part of the field, the rings coincide, in form, with conic
sections, conoentrio with the indicatrix curve of Ch. Dupin.

     The trigonometrical      tangent of the semi angle of the common
asymptote converges towards the value £ ; thereforo, the ratio of the
curvatures, and consequently the ratio in question, is      J with the best
isotropic body.

rod.
              Fixing of   the Newton's Bings by Photography.
     In order to study    at leisure, and with accuracy, the topographic
surfaces of elastic  deformation, it is very convenient to keep an exact
and fixed imago of the field.
     The induction spark between two poles of magnesium supplies a
source of light which fulfils the three necessary conditions — to be
intense, photographic, and monochromatic.
     Amongst the bright lines of the magnesium spectrum none is
useful for that purpose ; the radiation utilized as a source of photo
graphic light is invisible, but becomes visible when projected on
 Prof. Stokes's fluorescent screen.
     Though the photography of the Newton's rings be a delicate
operation, the experiment will bo tried before the audience.
     Newton's rings were photographed for the first time by the
illustrious Dr. Young at the Royal Institution in the year 1803.

                                Multiple Telegraphy.
Many of you, in your rural rambles, may, during              a moment of reflec
tion   or   thoughtlessness,    while   standing   on   the parapet of a rustic
bridge,    have   dropped   a stone  into  the river  flowing gently below, and
have noticed the rings of waves projecting outwards in ever increasing
circles.        If
                 at the same moment a hungry fish, in his desire to satisfy
a natural craving, should dart or snatch at a fly on the surface of the
water, a second series of rings of waves would be produced, and in
such a case a careful observer would notice that where crest of wave
meets crest of wave there is a higher crest formed, and where hollow
meets hollow a deeper hollow is formed.            This super-position of wave
on wave is called interference, and the interference of undulations
plays a most important part in the phenomena of sound, of light, and
of electricity.
     In electricity, wave upon wave can be super-imposed, either in
waves flowing in the same direction or in waves flowing in opposite
directions.       The usual indication of the presence of electric waves is
either by the attraction of a magnet or by the deflection of a needle.
     Here is a needle that is subjected to deflection by the passage of
such waves of electricity.          I  send a current of positive electricity
through the wire surrounding the magnet to which this needle is
attached, and you see           I get a certain deflection;    I   increase the
strength of that wave by super-imposing another wave, and you
see     I increase the amount of the deflection. In the same way,
    I
if reverse the direction of the current and send a negative current,
I                                                     I
   get a wave of a certain strength, and if double the strength of the
current     I get a stronger deflection.      But     instead of super-imposing
                                                     if,
one wave on the other in the same direction,               send one wave in one

direction and the other wave in the opposite direction, we get
neutrality.       This neutrality       is   phenomenon corresponding very

much     to  silence  in sound or to darkness in light.
     Advantage          taken of this neutrality in duplex and quadruplex

telegraphy, in a way which          I will now show to you. It is usually
imagined by those who think of duplex telegraphy that something
crosses or passes in the same way that railway trains pass or cross
each other.      It is not at all necessary to conceive that anything
whatever passes.                             I
                       For instance, here have some glass balls placed
                                                           I
in a row between two parallel wooden rods. If take the ball at one
end, say No. 1, a short distance from its normal position, and drive it
along the rods back again, you will notice that a something, a form of
force, passes through the other balls, and the one at the far end is by
this developed motion forced a distance away from its neighbours.
The same thing occurs if I take No. 12, as No. 1 is then displaced by
the concussion.      This resultant motion represents, and may be called a
telegraphic signal.       If I am skilful enough to take No. 1 and No. 12,
and let them return together, we shall seo that they are both driven
back simultaneously, the intervening balls remain undisturbed, and
two such signals will be made.           It is this latter phenomenon that
I   wish you to bear in mind as being analogous to the principle used
in duplex telegraphy.
                            I
     The next fact that wish to impress upon you is that if a current
of electricity have many paths open to           it,  will always separate or
                                                     it
spread itself among those paths in inverse proportion to the resistance
which each opposes to its progress. The greater the resistance, the
smaller the current        the less the resistance, the greater the current.
     If
                      ;
        we have two paths or lines open to       acurrent, and these two lines
be of exactly equal resistance, the current will divide itself between
them in exactly equal proportions.
      The next point, almost as self-evident as the previous one, but
 which time will not allow me to illustrate by experiment,           is   that the
magnitude of the magnetism produced in the electro-magnet               is simply
 proportional to the strength of current passed through that magnet.
      The last elementary fact    I   have to bring before you      is   that the
 polarity  or direction   of the magnetism simply depends upon the direc
 tion of the current.
      On the wall I      have two electro-magnets connected with each
other by means of       a    wire. Around each are coiled two wires of
exactly equal length and equal resistance.                 If
                                                            I   send    a  current
through     one  of  the  wires  I  produce  a   deflection  in  one   direction  ;
if
 I     senda    current through the other wire         Iget    deflection in the
                                                                a
 opposite direction.      You can imagine that one of these magnets          is in
 Brighton and the other in London, with the connecting line wire
between them.    I      want to arrange matters so that when        I      make   a
 signal at Brighton  I      shall not in any way affect my own instrument,
 and to do so I     divide my current in halves one half goes through
                                                       ;
one wire of the magnet, and tends to deflect the needle in one direc
 tion, and the other half goes through the other wire of the magnet,
 with a  tendency to throw the needle in the opposite direction.             If by
 an arrangement, such as an artificial line,         I make these two halves
 exactly equal, then no deflection of my needle takes place         ;  though at

196                            Mr. W. H. Preece                    [May   23,
the same time    I influence Brighton's needle. This gives us the first
principle of duplex telegraphy. Of course, with a similar arrangement
at Brighton, on the key at that end being depressed the needle there
remains unaffected, while at the same time the needle at this end is
deflected.    When, however, under these conditions, currents are sent
from both instruments, signals or deflections are noticed at each station.
By using resistance we are able to make an artificial line attached
to the second wire of the eloctro-magnet exactly equal to the line wire
attached to the other wire of the electro-magnet.      I  have in a box here
resistance equal to three or four hundred miles of line.        Resistance is
measured in ohms, an ohm being a unit used by electricians, and which
represents about a yard of fine platinum wire, or about one-tenth of a
mile of ordinary iron wire.        The resistance contained in this box is
divided into quantities ranging from one to two thousand ohms, any
portion of which can be brought into use by simply taking out pegs
representing the amount required.         With this ready means at hand
you will easily comprehend the facility with which a balance can be
adjusted, and the opposition to the two halves of the current passing
through the electro-magnet be made equal. Whatever the distance of
the line, whether between here and the Central Telegraph Station, or
between here and Calcutta, or any distant place to which you choose
 to exert your imagination, the effect is just the same.       To show yon
this system in actual working      I have here instruments joined to a wire
which passes through the streets to the Central Telegraph Station in
the city. It is just as easy for us to connect a wire up in actual opera
 tion as to have assistants secreted in the adjoining room, which is some
 times supposed to be the case.      I must first of all explain to you how
 telegraphic signals    are interpreted into ordinary language.       It is by
 means of what is known as the Morse alphabet, which consists of
 combinations of dots and dashes used to represent the ordinary letters.
 A dot and a dash, for instance, represents a, a dash and three dots
 represents o, dash dot dash dot c, and so on throughout the alphabet
 A dot itself is represented on the instrument before us by a shert
 sound or beat, and a dash by a longer one. The sounds caused by the
 signals appeal to the consciousness through the ear, and are translated
 into the proper language. (The central station was called up, and a
 message was sent to him at the same time that one was being received
 from him, in illustration of duplex working.)
      The operation which you have just seon going on exactly corre
  sponds with that which     I just described to you. The division of the
  cm-rent is arranged at each end by the use of a resistance box or
  " rheostat," and the signals are sent without any interruption between
  the one and the other.
      The duplex system of telegraphy is employed to a very large
  cxtont in this country, no less than 320 circuits being so fitted. The
  system is applicable to long and short lines, and even long cables in
  the Bed Sea, Indian Ocean, and across the Atlantic (in one case 2400
  miles long), have been successfully so fitted.

     Its application enables really more than double the amount of
work being      done to that which the wire (if an ordinary land line)
would perform when working singly.            This arises from the fact that
no interruption ensues from repetitions being required or questions
asked, but the messages pass in a continuous stream in opposite
directions almost without let or hindrance.
     I  would just mention another fact in answer to any who are
surprised at errors taking place in the transmission of messages.         The
signals representing certain letters are very similar, and it is very
easy for a faint dot to be missed or a short dash to be misinterpreted
for a dot, and as the difference between the letter t (represented by a
dash) and r (represented by a dot, dash, dot) is simply two dots, you
will not be surprised that a message, informing some friends of the
arrival of a party of ladies, " all right," was delivered as, " all tight."
And, again, a friend of mine in Manchester, whose wife wished to
inform him that the " rash was all gone," was astonished to receive an
intimation that the " cash was all gone."         Many of these errors are
simply due to the failure of a dot or the shortness or breaking of a
dash, and the wonder is that with more than one hundred million
messages which are despatched          every year in this country the per
centage   of errors  is not greater  than  the small amount it is.     I hope
that, after  the  practical illustration  you have just had of the extreme
care and exactitude which is attendant on the accurate receipt of
signals, you will deal lightly with errors of conversion of words such
             into " cash," " right into " tight," &c.
           "                         "
as " rash
     So far as regards duplex telegraphy.
     We have now to deal with another class, and that is called diplex
telegraphy.       Duplex telegraphy means sending two messages in
opposite directions at the same time ; diplex means sending two
messages at the same time in the same direction.            I  have here two
little instruments which give out their signals in musical tones, and       I
have also two keys attached to a battery in connection with them.

There is only one wire between them. If press down, say, key No. 1
I  call up the sounder which emits a deep tone ; if       I   press down key
No. 2    I  obtain a response from the sounder with a tone an octave
higher.     If I  press both keys down at the same time both sounders
answer, and whichever key is depressed it is always answered by its
proper sounder.        This power of sending two signals or messages at
the same time in the same direction is called diplex telegraphy.
     It is difficult to explain how this is performed without the aid of
a diagram, and it really requires some amount of courage to attempt
the feat.      Currents of electricity are developed in two ways ; they
differ in the direction in which they flow and also in their strength.
      The key on my right hand simply reverses the direction in which
the currents flow every time it is depressed ; the other key simply
increases the strength of the current flowing, whatever may be its
direction.     The relay here employed, which is connected to the deep-
toned sounder, responds to a reversal of the current whatever its

  198                         Mr.  W.  H. Preece                    [May 23,
 strength may be, and the other relay, which is connected to the light
 sounder, responds to the increased strength of the current whatever its
  direction may be ; so that on depressing the key which reverses the
 current the deep-toned sounder responds ; and if        I  touch the other
 key   I simply make the light sounder speak by increasing the strength
 of that current. (Mr. Preece here very minutely traced the different
 currents from the battery through key and relay to sounder, so as to
 produce sounds by currents, varying in either direction or strength,
 and acting upon one or both sounders at the same time, or separately
 at will.) The increase of current is brought into action by means of
 the one key having attached to it a greater proportion of cells of the
 battery.
      That is diplex telegraphy.
      How is this diplex used for quadruplex working ?        I  showed you
 in duplex working that we simply split the current in two paths made
 exactly equal to each other. It matters not whether we have one or
 any number of relays in.     Theoretically, it is possible to insert a great
 number of relays, but practically only two are used ; and in quadruplex
 working wo simply duplex what      I  have called the diplex arrangement.
 On one end of the table before you we have two sides of the quadruplex,
 or one diplex ; and on the other end of the table we have the other
 side of the quadruplex which also works diplex, and by this apparatus
 we are able to send four messages at the same time on the single wire,
 which you see goes from the table to the wall, and so proceeds to the
 Central Telegraph Station.      (The various courses of the currents and
 adjustments of balance necessary, chiefly owing to variations of
 temperature, &c., were here described, but without the aid of a
 diagram it would be next to impossible to follow them.) The system,
 although difficult in description, is really wonderfully and beautifully
 simple, and if it were only requisite to follow out what        I have just
 said, quadruplex working would be a very easy matter indeed. But
 there is such a thing in England as a climate, and there also is
unfortunately such a thing as rain, and rain interferes very consider
 ably with the action of our duplex and quadruplex working.             In a
word, the effect of rain is precisely the same as reducing the length
of our line. Supposing we have a wire between Liverpool and
London, about 200 miles long, then when we have rain it covers the
insulators with moisture, and the moistened insulators allow the
current to escape to earth, and the result is just the same as though
the line itself were reduced in length ; and to compensate for this it
is necessary to take out resistance equal to the loss. But by means
 of the rheostat it is not a very difficult matter to adjust a balance, and
by carefully noting and watching storms of rain, snow, sleet, or fogs
and mist, which are so troublesome to the working, a clerk has simply
to vary his rheostat, and can so maintain working on wires of ordinary
length.
      When we come to very long lengths of wire the weather disturb
ance interferes very much.

1879.]
     There is another disturbance           besides that produced by rain or
weather, and that is         one due   to the  existence in a telegraphic line of
what is called      electrostatic   induction.    This is a very hard word, but
it really   means     something similar to the effect of friction in pipes on
the flow of    water    or gas.   When gas or water is forced through pipes,
a quantity     of  it  adheres   to  the sides, and produces a diminution of
pressure    due   to  friction.   So,  when we try to force electricity through
a wire, a quantity of it adheres, as it were, to the sides of the wire,
remains there as a charge, and diminishes the action of the current,
and produces what is called retardation in signals.                   Retardation
means really reducing the rate at which we work.                If  it is possible,
 say, between London and Aberdeen to work as fast as ever we like,
then if we attempt to work over a submarine cable of equal length the
 speed diminishes very greatly indeed. Between London and Cork, and
 between London and Aberdeen wo are at the present moment working
 practically as fast as the instruments will run, at the rate of about
 150 words a minute, while through the Atlantic cable, with all their
 skill, they cannot work at more than twenty-five words a minute, and
 this is due to the disturbing element of electrostatic induction.               To
 compensate for this it is necessary to make your artificial line exactly
 similar in all respects to your real line, and, with duplex circuits, this
 is done by inserting, in addition to the rheostat, a condenser. A
 condenser is simply a series of leaves of tinfoil separated by paraffined
 paper. A series of alternate paraffined papers and tinfoil really
 comprise a Leyden jar, and such a Leyden jar would have the capacity
 of retaining a charge similar to that retained by the line ; and it is
 only necessary to increase the size of the condenser until the same
 electrostatic capacity in it is obtained as is experienced in the line
 itself.    Here is a condenser which has not the appearance of being a
 very    formidable     instrument, but it has sufficient electrostatic capacity
 to compensate for a line about 200 miles long.
      We will now work the quadruplex apparatus before you.                    I do
  not hope to have made you comprehend the action of the system ;                  I
  only hope that     I   have given you an idea which you can work out for
  yourselves, and which will give you more interest in seeing the system
  in actual operation.
      (Communication was then opened with the Central Telegraph
  Station, and several messages were sent to and from the Institution
  on the quadruplex apparatus.)
      Many people are suspicious of operations of this kind going on at
  lectures.    I   may tell you that a few years ago         I  gave a lecture at
  Southampton, and took special care to have a wire joined through
  London to the Continent (we only had one cable at that time), and at
  the proper period of the evening spoke to London, Vienna, Berlin,
  and Amsterdam, and received answers.               I  then asked what time it
  was in Vienna (it was nine o'clock in Southampton), and received
  answer, "Twenty minutes past eight."                 This was wrong, and it
  turned out that a clerk in London had been personating the

Continental places, and knowing that thcro was forty minutes' differ
ence in the time he put it on the wrong side !
    We have in England at the present moment six circuits worked
with the quadruplex system. In America the system is carried out
to a much larger extent, and sixty-three wires are fitted with      and   it,
over these sixty-three circuits no less than eight million messages are
transmitted annually.
    The question may arise in your minds as to why the quadruplex
apparatus is   not used as extensively in this country as in America,
and the answer would ho that in this country we have not the same
necessity for it. We have apparatus in use superior to the quadru
plex. I    mean the Wheatstonc automatic, an instrument which was
in its early stage brought before an audience of this Institution.               It
enables us to transmit messages and news with enormous rapidity,
and makes us quite independent of any of those supposed advanced
inventions.

it really makes us regard with wonder what science         doing for us.

       The Colour-Sense    in Insects : its Development     and Reaction.*
The lecturer began by pointing out the probahlo absence of all bright-
coloured flowers and insects in the world whose fauna and flora have
been    preservod to us by the primary rocks.               Hence it might be
inferred that no animals then possessed          a  colour-sense, because there
were few or no coloured objects upon          which   it could be exercised.
     He traced   the  development     of  colour-perception in insects to the
gradual growth      of   entomophilous flowers.         All parts of plants in
which    oxidation   is taking   place   are  liable  to  display brilliant pig
ments other than green ; and this is especially the case in the neigh
bourhood of the floral organs. Flowers which exhibited this tendency
in a high degree would attract the eyes of insects, and so gain easier
fertilization. While, conversely, insects which were able to dis
criminate such patches of colour to the greatest extent, would best
discover the pollen and honey.          Thus nascent colour in flowers and
 the nascent colour-sense in insects would develope side by side, till
 they reached their present high point of perfection.
      But not only would a power to discriminate different hues ariso
 in the process of evolution : a taste for bright tints would also spring
 up in the insect consciousness. This taste exerts itself actively in
the preference for beautiful mates, which is especially visible amongst
flower-haunting insects. The lepidoptera exhibit the brightest hues
 of all, while the rose-chafers, the anthophilous diptera, and the other
 tribes of like habit, rank next to them in beauty of colouration.
      The lecturer combated the idea that such selective preference
 transcends the faculties of insects, and showed that various other facts
 lead up to a similar conclusion.           Certain species and genera were
 proved by Maller's observations to possess greater aesthetic sensibility

notice comparatively minute distinctions of colour, form, and orna
mental markings.         The spots and lines on entomophilous flowers,
which act as honey-guidos to bees, were further adduced as showing
that insects pay great attention to varieties of colouration.
      Finally, the lecturer pointed out that an immensely large pro
portion of what wo consider beauty in the external world is due
to the colour-sense in insects.

                            Spectroscopic  Investigation.
 In KirchhofFs       celebrated paper " On the Isolation between                the
 Badiating and Absorbing Powers of different Bodies for Light and
 Heat," the remarkable experiments pf reversing the bright lines of
 lithium and sodium by causing sunlight to pass through the vapours
 of those metals, volatilized in the flame of a Bunsen's burner, are
 described.     Bunsen and Kirchhoff reversed the stronger lines of
 potassium, calcium, strontium, and barium by deflagrating their
 chlorates with milk-sugar, before the slit of the solar spectroscope.
 Becent researches on the artificial formation of Fraunhofer lines
 havo been made by Cornu, Lockyer, and Roberts.
      Cornu .improved upon a method previously used by Foucault.
 It depends upon so arranging the electric arc that the continuous
 spectrum of the intensely heated poles is examined through an atmo
 sphere of the metallic vapours volatilized around them.                    By this
 means Cornu succeeded in reversing several lines in the spectra of the
 following metals, in addition to thoso above mentioned, viz. thallium,
 lead, silver, aluminium, magnesium, cadmium, zinc, and copper, fie
 observed that, in general, the reversal began with the least refrangible
  of a group of lines, and gradually extended to the more refrangible
 lines of the group, and drew the conclusion that a very thin layer
  of vapour was sufficient for the reversal. In almost every case the
  lines reversed are the more highly refrangible of the lines character
 istic of each metal.
      Lockyer's plan was to view the electric arc through the vapours of
  the metals volatilized in a horizontal iron tube. The iron tube had
  its ends covered with glass plates, and was heated in a furnace, a
  current of hydrogen passing during the experiment.                     He did not
  succeed in observing any new reversal of bright lines, with the
  exception of an unknown absorption line which sometimes appeared
  when zinc was experimented on.                 He confirmed, however, the
  channelled-space absorption spectra observed by Boscoe and Schuster
  in tho cases of potassium and sodium, and recorded channelled-space

 spectra in the caso of antimony, phosphorus (?), sulphur, and arsenio
                  " As the temperature employed for the volatilization
 (probably).
 of the metals did not exceed bright redness, or that at which cast
 iron readily melts, the rapge of metals examined was necessarily
 limited ; and in order to extend these observations to the less fusible
 metals, as well as to ascertain whether, the spectra of these vola
 tilized at the lower temperature would be modified by the application
 of a greater degree of heat," a new series of experiments were
 undertaken by Lockyer and Roberts, in which the combined action
 of a charcoal furnace and the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe was employed.
 A lime crucible after the form of Stas was used to replace the iron
 tube.    By this means they obtained still no new reversal of a metallic
 line, but they observed channellcd-space spectra in the cases of silver,
 manganese, chromium, and bismuth.         They observed, however, that
 the metal thallium gave the characteristic bright green line, the light
 of the arc not being reversed.
      In the above-mentioned experiments, the coolness of the ends of
 the tube, which acted as condensers of the metallic vapours, and the
 continual change of density and temperature necessarily produced by
 the maintenance of a current of hydrogen through the tube, appear
 to account for the failure in observing reversals.
      The following facts have been acquired during the course .of a
 long series of conjoint experiments with my distinguished colleague,
 Professor Liveing, of Cambridge.*
      In order to examine the reversal of the spectra of metallic vapours,
 it is more satisfactory to observe the absorptive effect produced on
 the continuous spectrum emitted by the sides and end of the tube in
 which the volatilization takes place. For this purpose it is convenient
 to use iron tubes about half an inch in internal diameter, and about
 27 inches long, closed at one end, thoroughly cleaned inside, and
 coated on the outside with borax, or with a mixture of plumbago and
 fireclay.   These tubes are inserted in a nearly vertical position in a
 furnace fed with Welsh coal, which will heat about 10 inches of the
 tube to about a welding heat, and observations are made through the
 upper open end of the tube, either with or without a cover of glass
or mica. To exclude oxygen, and avoid as much as possible variations
of temperature, hydrogen is introduced in a gentle stream by a narrow
tube into the upper part only of tho iron tube, so that the hydrogen
floats on the surface of the metallic vapour without producing convec
tion currents in it.     By varying the length of the small tube con
veying the hydrogen, tho height in the tube to which the metallic
vapour reaches may be regulated.       Thus different depths of metallic
vapour may be maintained at a comparatively constant temperature
for considerable periods of time. The general plan of the apparatus
is given in Plate I. (at the end of the paper).

     By tins means the characteristic lines of the volatile metals thal
lium and indium may be easily reversed.
     Metallic lithium, alono or mixed with sodium, gave no results.
Similarly, chloride of lithium and metallic sodium, introduced together,
gave no better results.     To a tube containing mixed potassium and
sodium vapour, lithium chloride was added.          Now the bright-red
lithium line was sharply reversed, and remained well defined for a
long time. The lithium line was only reversed in a mixture of the
vapours of potassium and sodium, and it seems highly probable that
a very slightly volatile vapour may be diffused in an atmosphere
of a more volatile metal, so as to secure a sufficient depth of vapour
to produce a sensible absorption.      This would be analogous to well-
known actions which take place in the attempt to separate organic
bodies of very different boiling points by distillation, where a sub
stance of high boiling point is always carried over, in considerable
quantity, with the vapour of a body boiling at a much lower tempera
 ture.
     Sodium and potassium, when observed in such tubes, give none of
the appearances noted by Lockyer, " On a New Class of Absorption
Phenomena," in the ' Proceedings of the Royal Society,' vol. xxii., but
 tho channolled-space spectrum of sodium described by Eoscoe and
                                                       '
Schuster in the same volume of the ' Proceedings         was often seen.
Potassium gives no channelled-space absorption, but continuous
absorption in the red, and one narrow absorption band, with a wave
 length of about 5,730, not corresponding with any bright line of that
metal.
     The absorption spectrum of sodium vapour is by no means so
 simple as has been generally represented. The fact that the vapour
 of sodium in a flame shows only the reversal of the D lines, while the
 vapour, volatilized in tubes, shows a channelled-space absorption cor
 responding to no known omission spectrum, appears to be a part of a
 gradational variation of the absorption spectrum, which may be induced
 with perfect regularity.    Experiments with sodium exhibit the follow
 ing succession of appearances, as the amount of vapour is gradually
 diminished, commencing from the appearance when tho tube is full of
 the vapour of sodium, part of it condensing in the cooler portion
 of the tube, and some being carried out by the slow current of
 hydrogen.    During this stage, although the lower part of the tube
 is at a white heat, as long as the cool current of hydrogen displaced
 metallic vapour, on looking down the tube it appeared perfectly
 dark.   The first appearance of luminosity is of a purple tint, and,
 with tho spectroscope, appears as a faint blue band, commencing
 with a wave-length of about 4,500, and fading away into the violet.
 Next appears a narrow band in the green, with a maximum of light,
 with a wave-length of about 5,420, diminishing in brightness so
 rapidly on either side as to appear like a bright line. This green
 band gradually widens, and is then seen to be divided by a dark band
 with a wave-length of about 5,510. Eed light next appears, and

between tbo red and green light is an enormous extension of the D
absorption line, while a still broader dark space intervenes between
the green and the blue light. The dark line in the green (wave
length about 5,510) now becomes more sharply defined.            This line
appears to have been observed by Eoscoo and Schuster, and regarded
by them as coinciding with the double sodium line next in strength
to the D lines, but it is considerably more refrangible than that double
line.    In the next stage, the channelled-space spectrum comes out in
the   dark   space between the green and blue, and finally in the red.
Gradually the light extends, the channels disappear, the D line
absorption narrows, but still the dark lino in the green is plainly
discernible.     Lastly, there is only D lines absorption.
     The method of observation described may be used to observe
emission as well as absorption spectra ; for if the closed end of the
tube be placed against the bars of the furnace so as to bo relatively
cooler than the middle of the tube, the light emitted by the vapours
in the hottest part is more intense than that emitted by the bottom of
the tube.     This succeeds admirably with sodium.
     The volatility of rubidium and cffisiurn rendered it advisable to try
the effects first in glass tubes.   For this purpose a piece of combustion
tnbing had one end drawn out and the end turned up sharply, and
sealed off (like an ill-made combustion tube of the usual form), so as
to produce an approximately piano face at the end of the tube ; a
small bulb was then blown at about an inch from the end, and the
tube drawn out at about an inch from the bulb on the other •side, so
as to form a long narrower tube.          Some dry rubidium or cmsium
chloride was introduced into the bulb; and a fragment of fresh cut
sodium, and the narrow part of the tube turned up, so as to allow
the tube and bulb to bo seen through in the direction of the axis
of the tube. The shape of tube is given in Plato I. The open
end was then attached to a Sprengel pump, and the air exhausted ;
 the sodium was then melted, and afterwards cither dry hydrogen or
dry nitrogen admitted, and the end of the tube sealed off at nearly
 the atmospheric pressure. It is necessary to have this pressure of
 gas inside the tube, otherwise the metal distilled so fast on heating
 that the ends were speedily obscured by condensed drops of metal.
Through these tubes placed lengthways in front of a spectroscope, a
 lime light was viewed. On warming the bulb of a tube in which
 rubidium chloride had been sealed up with sodium, the D lines were
of course very soon seen ; and very soon there appeared two dark
lines near the extremity of the violet light, which, on measurement,
 were found to bo identical in position with tlio well-known violet
lines of rubidium.       Next appeared faintly the channelled spectrum
of sodium in the green, and then a dark lino in the blue, very sharp
and decided, in the place of the more refrangible of the charac
 teristic linos of caesium in the flame spectrum. As the temperature
 rose, these dark lines, especially those in the violet, became sensibly
broader ; and then another fine dark line appeared in tho blue, in the

208                           Professor Dewar                   [Juno  6,
place of the loss refrangible of the caesium blue lines.     During this
time no dark line could be observed in the red ; but as the tempera
ture rose, a broad absorption band appeared in the red, with its centre
about midway between B and 0, ill defined at the edges, and though
plainly visible not very dark. The lines in the violet had now
become BO broad as to touch each other and form one dark band.        On
cooling,    the absorption  band   in the  red became  gradually lighter
without becoming defined, and was finally overpowered by the chan
nelled spectrum of sodium in that region.       The double dark line in
the violet became sharply defined again as the temperature fell.
There arc two blue lines in the spectrum of rubidium taken with an
induction-coil very near the two blue lines of caesium ; but they are
comparatively feeble, and the two dark lines in the blue observed
in the places of the characteristic blue lines of caesium must have
been duo to a small quantity of caesium chloride in the sample of
rubidium chloride.       These blue lines were not, however, visible
when some of the rubidium chloride was held in the flame of a
 Bunsen's burner, nor when a spark was taken from a solution of the
chloride ; but the more refrangible of them (Csa) was visible in the
 spark of an induction-coil, without a Leyden jar, taken between beads
of the rubidium chloride fused on platinum wires.
      When a tube containing caasium chloride and sodium was observed,
 in the same way, the two dark lines in the blue were seen very soon
 after the heating began, and the more refrangible of them broadened
 out very sensibly as the temperature increased.    The usual channelled
 spectrum of sodium was seen in the green, and an additional channelling
 appeared in the yellow, which may bo due to caesium or to the mixture
 of the two metals. Indeed the caesium chloride was not free from
 rubidium, and the dark lines of rubidium were distinctly seen in
 the violet.    Metallic lithium acts on the chlorides of caesium and
 rubidium, giving the same results as sodium.
      It is remarkable that these absorption lines of cresium coincide
 with the blue lines of crosium as seen in the flame, not with the
 green line which that metal shows when heated in an electric spark of
 high density. It is to be observed, however, that when sparks from an
 induction-coil without a jar are taken between beads of cresium chlo
 ride fused on platinum wires, a spectrum similar to the flame spec
  trum is seen, and it is only when a Leyden jar is used that the
  spectrum is reduced to a green line.    In like manner both the violet
  lines of rubidium are reversed, and both these violet lines are seen
  when the spark of an induction-coil, without jar, is passed between
  beads of rubidium chloride fused on platinum wire, though only one
  of them appears when a Leyden jar is used.
      Mixtures of carbonate of caesium with carbon, and of carbonate of
  rubidium with carbon, prepared by charring the tartrates, heated in
  narrow porcelain tubes, placed vertically in a furnace, gave sharp
  results.   A small quantity of the caesium mixture, introduced into u
  tube at a bright red heat, showed instantly the two blue lines reversed

1879.]                 on Spectroscopic Investigation.                 209
and so much expanded as to be almost in contact.        The width of the
dark lines decreased as the caesium evaporated, but they remained
quite distinct for a long time.     A similar effect was produced by the
rubidium mixture, only it was necessary to have the tube very much
hotter, in order to get enough of violet light to see the reversal of
the rubidium lines. In this case the two lines were so much expanded
as to form one broad dark band, which gradually resolved itself
into two as the rubidium evaporated. The reversal of these lines
of  caesium and rubidium       seems to take place almost or quite as
readily  as that of the D lines by sodium, and the vapours of those
metals must be extremely opaque to the light of the refrangibility
absorbed, for the absorption was conspicuous when only very minute
quantities of the metals were present.       The red, yellow, and green
parts of the spectrum were carefully searched for absorption lines,
but none due to caesium or rubidium could be detected in any case.
It is perhaps worthy of remark that the liberation of such extremely
electro-positive elements as ciesium and rubidium from their chlorides
by sodium and by lithium, though it is probably only partial, is a proof,
if proof were wanting, that so-called chemical affinity only takes a
part in determining the grouping of the elements in such mixtures ;
and it is probable that the equilibrium arrived at in any such case is a
dynamical or mobile equilibrium, continually varying with change of
temperature.
    It is difficult to prevent the oxidation of magnesium in the iron
tubes, and tubes wider than half an inch did not give satisfactory results.
With half-inch tubes, the lines in the green were clearly and sharply
reversed, also some dark lines, not measured, were seen in the blue.
The sharpness of these lines depended on the regulation of the
hydrogen current, by which the upper stratum of vapour could be
cooled at will.
     (1) The absorption spectrum
                                     of magnesium consists of two sharp
lines in the green, of which one, which is broader than the other,
and appears to broaden as the temperature increases, coincides in
position with the least refrangible of the 6 group, whilo the other is
less refrangible, and has a wave-length very nearly 5,210. Theso
lines are the first and the last to bo seen, and were first taken for the
extreme lines of the 6 group.
    (2) A dark line in the blue, always more or less broad, difficult
to  measure    exactly, but very near the place of the brightest blue
line of magnesium. This line was not always visible, indeed rarely
when magnesium alone was placed in the tube.           It was better seen
when a small quantity of potassium or sodium was added.               The
measure of the less refrangible edge of this band gave a wave-length
of very nearly 4,615. •
    (8) A third line or band in the green rather more refrangible
than the 6 group.      This is best seen when potassium and magnesium
are introduced into the tube, but it may also be seen with sodium
and magnesium. The less refrangible edge of this band is sharply

210                           Professor Dewar                       [June 6,
defined, and has a wave-length about 5,140, and it fades away towards
the blue.
    These absorptions are all seen both when potassium and sodium are
used along with mgnesium, and may bo fairly ascribed to magnesium,
or to magnesium together with hydrogen.
    But besides these, other absorptions are seen which appear to be
due to mixed vapours.
    (4) Thus when sodium and magnesium are used together a dark
line, with ill-defined edges, is seen in the green, with a wave-length
about 5,300. This is the characteristic absorption of tho mixed
vapours of sodium and magnesium ; it is not seen with either vapour
separately, nor is it seen when potassium is used instead of sodium.
    (5) When potassium and magnesium are used together, a pair of
dark lines are seen in the red. The less refrangible of these some
times broadens into a band with ill-defined edges, and has a mean
wavo-length of about 6,580.      The other is always a fine sharp lino,
with a wave-length about 6,475. These lines are as regularly scon
with the mixture of potassium and magnesium as the above-mentioned
line (5,300) is seen with the mixture of sodium and magnesium, but
are not seen except with that mixture.
    Thoro is a certain resemblance between the absorptions abovo
ascribed to magnesium, and the emission spectrum seen when tho
sparks of a small induction - coil, without Leydon jar, aro taken
between electrodes of magnesium.
    The coincidences of the series of the solar spectrum hitherto
observed have, for the most part, been with lines given by dense
electric sparks; while it is not improbable that tho conditions of
temperature, and the admixtures of vapours in the upper part of tho
solar atmosphere, may resemble much more nearly those in our tubes.
    It became a question of interest to find the conditions under which
the same mixtures would give luminous spectra, consisting of the lines
which had been seen reversed.       On observing sparks from an induc
tion-coil taken between magnesium points in an atmosphere of hydro
gen, a bright line regularly appeared, with a wave-length about 5,210,
in the same position as one of the most conspicuous of the dark
lines observed to bo produced by vapour of magnesium with hydrogen
in our iron tubes.     This lino is best seen, i. e. is most steady, when
no Leyden jar is used, and the rheotome is screwed back, so that it
will but just work. It may, however, be seen when the coil is in
its ordinary state, and when a small Leyden jar is interposed ; but
it disappears (except in flashes) when a larger Leyden jar is used,
if tho hydrogen bo at the atmospheric pressure. This lino docs not
usually extend across the whole interval between the electrodes, and is
somotimes only seen near the negative electrode.        Its presence seems
to depend on the temperature, as it is not seen continuously when a
largo Leyden jar is employed, until the pressure of tho hydrogen and
its resistance is very much reduced. When well-dried nitrogen or
carbonic oxide is substituted for hydrogen, this line disappears en

1879.]                   on Spectroscopic    Investigation.                       211
tirely  ; but if any hydrogen or traces of moisture be present it comes
out when the pressure is much reduced. In such cases the hydrogen
lines C and F are always visible as well. Sometimes several fine lines
appear on the more refrangible side of this line, between it and the b
group, which give it the appearance of being a narrow band, shaded on
that side. Various samples of magnesium used as electrodes, and hydro
gens prepared and purified in different ways, gave the same results.
      In addition to the above-mentioned lino, there is also produced a
series of fine lines, commencing close to the most refrangible line
of the 6 group, and extending with gradually diminishing intensity
towards the blue.        These lines are so close to one another, that in a
small spectroscope they appear like a broad shaded band. We have
little doubt that the dark absorption line, with wave-length about
5,140, shading towards the blue, observed in our iron tubes, was a
reversal of part of these lines, though the latter extend much further
towards the blue than the observed absorption extends.
      Charred cream of tartar in iron tubes, arranged as before, gave a
broad absorption band extending over the space from about wave
length 5,700 to 5,775, and in some cases still wider, with edges ill-
defined, especially the more refrangible edge.            By placing the charred
cream of tartar in the tube before it was introduced into the furnace,
and watching the increase of light as the tube got hot, this band was
at first seen bright on a less bright background, it gradually faded,
and then came out again reversed, and remained so. No very high
temperature was required for this, but a rise of temperature had the
 effect of widening the band.         Besides this absorption, there appeared
a very indefinite faint absorption in the red, with the centre at a wave
length of about 6,100, and a dark band, with a tolerably well-defined
 edge on the less refrangible side, at about a wave-length of 4,850,
 shading away towards the violet.           A fainter dark band was sometimes
 Been beyond, with a wave-length of about 4,645 ; but sometimes the
 light seemed abruptly terminated at about wave-length 4,850. It will
 be noticed that these absorptions are not the same as those seen when
 potassium is heated in hydrogen, nor do they correspond with known
 emission lines of potassium, although the first, which is also the most
 conspicuous and regularly visible of these absorptions, is very near a
 group of three bright lines of potassium. It seemed probable that
 they might be due to a combination of potassium with carbonic oxide.
 Potassium heated in -carbonic oxide in glass tubes, united readily with
 the gas, but the compound did not appear to volatilize at a dull red
 heat, and no absorption, not even that which potassium gives when
 heated in nitrogen under similar circumstances, could be seen.               Induc
 tion sparks between an electrode of potassium and one of platinum
 in an atmosphere of carbonic oxide, gave the usual bright lines of
 potassium, and also a bright band, identical in position with the above-
     ' With greater dispersion this lino is seen as the sharp edge of a series of very
fine lines shading off towards the blue like the ordinary hydrocarbon spectrum.

 212                         Professor Dewar                    [June 6,
mentioned band, between wave-lengths about 5,700 and 5,775. This
band could not be seen when hydrogen was substituted for carbonic
oxide. A mixture of sodium carbonate and charred sugar, heated in
an iron tube, gave only the same absorption as sodium in hydrogen.
There were also no indications of any absorption due to a compound of
 rubidium or of caesium with carbonic oxide.
     A mixture of barium carbonate, aluminium filings, and lamp-black,
heated in a porcelain tube, gave two absorption lines in the green,
corresponding in position to bright lines seen when sparks are taken
from a solution of barium chloride, at wave-lengths 5,242 and 5,136,
marked a and ft by Lecoq do Boisbaudran.          These two absorptions
were very persistent, and were produced on several occasions.         A
third absorption line, corresponding to line 8 of Boisbaudran, was
sometimes seen ; and on one occasion, when the tomperature was as
high as could be obtained in the furnace fed with Welsh coal, and a
mixture of charred barium tartrate with aluminium was used, a fourth
dark line was seen with wave-length 5,535. This line was very fine
and sharply defined, whereas the other three lines were ill-defined at
the edges ; it is, moreover, the only one of the four which corresponds
to a bright line of metallic barium.
     Repeated experiments with charred tartrates of calcium and of
strontium mixed with aluminium gave no results ; but on one occasion,
when sodium carbonate was used along with the charred tartrate
of strontium and aluminium, the blue line of strontium was seen re
versed : and on another occasion, when a mixture of charred potassium,
calcium, and strontium tartrates, and aluminium was used, the calcium
line, with wave-length 4,226, was seen reversed.
     In order to command higher temperatures, experiments were made
with the electric arc enclosed in lime, magnesia, or carbon crucibles.
The different forms used are represented in Plate II. Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4,
and 5 ; and the plan for projecting reversals in Plate   III.
     In the first experiments thirty cells of Grove were employed ; in
the later ones the Siemens arc from the powerful dynamo-machino
 belonging to the Royal Institution.
     The electric arc in lime crucibles gives a very brilliant spectrum
of bright lines, a copious stream of vapours ascending the tubo. On
drawing apart the poles, which could be done for nearly an inch with
out stopping the current, the calcium line with wave-length 4,226
almost always appears more or less expanded with a dark line in the
middle, both in the lime crucibles and in carbon crucibles into which
some lime has been introduced ; the remaining bright lines of calcium
aro also frequently seen in the like condition, but sometimes the dark
line appears in the middle of K (the more refrangible of Fraunhofer's
lines H), when there is none in the middle of H. On throwing some
aluminium filings into the crucible, the line 4,226 appears as a broad
dark band, and both H and K, as well as the two aluminium lines
between them, appear for a second as dark bands on a continuous
background.      Soon they appear as bright bands with dark middles ;

1879.]                on Spectroscopic  Investigation.              213
gradually the dark line disappears from H, and afterwards from K,
while the aluminium lines remain with dark middles for a long time.
 When a mixture of lime and potassium carbonate was introduced
into a carbon crucible, the group of three lines with wave-lengths
 4,425, 4,434, and 4,454 were all reversed, the least refrangible being
 the most strongly reversed, and remaining so longest, while the most
refrangible was least strongly reversed, and for the shortest time.
     When aluminium was put into the crucible, only the two lines of
that metal between H and K were seen reversed. The lines at the
red end remained steadily bright.
     When magnesium was put into a lime crucible, the 6 group
expanded a little without appearing reversed, but when some alumi
nium was added, the least refrangible of the three lines appeared
with a dark middle, and on adding more magnesium the second line
put on the same appearance; and lastly, the most refrangible was
reversed in like manner. The least refrangible of the three remained
reversed for some time ; and the order of reversibility of the group is
that of refrangibility.   Of the other magnesium lines, that in the
yellowish-green (wave-length 5,527) was much expanded, while the
blue line (wave-length 4,703), and a line still more refrangible than
the hitherto recorded lines, with wave-length 4,354, were still more
expanded each time that magnesium was added.
     The following experiments were made in carbon crucibles : —
    With strontia the lines with wave-lengths 4,607, 4,215 and 4,079
were all seen with dark lines in the middle, but no reversal of any
strontium line less refrangible could be seen.
    A mixture of barium and potassium carbonates produced the
reversal of the lines with wave-lengths 5,535 and 4,933. When
barium chlorate was dropped into a crucible, the four lines with
wave-lengths 4,553, 4,933, 5,545, and 5,518 were reversed.
    To observe particularly the effects of potassium a mixture of lime
and potassium carbonate previously ignited was thrown in. The violet
lines of potassium, wave-length 4,044, came out immediately as a broad
black band, which soon resolved into two narrower dark bands having
wave-lengths nearly 4,042 and 4,045. On turning to the red end the
two extreme red lines were both seen reversed. No lines of potassium
between the two extremes could be seen reversed, but the group of
three yellow lines were all expanded, though not nebulous, and other
lines in the green were seen much expanded.
     Sodium carbonate gave only the D lines reversed, though the other
lines were expanded, and the pairs in the green had each become
a very broad nebulous band, and D almost as broad a black band.
When sodium chlorate was dropped into a crucible, the pair of lines
with wave-lengths 5,681, 5,687, were both momentarily reversed, the
latter much more strongly than the former.
     When a very little charred rubidium tartrate was put in, the two
violet lines were sharply reversed, appearing only as black lines on
a continuous light background.        Turning to the red end, the more

214                          Professor Dewar                       [June 6,
refrangible of the two lines in the extreme red (wave-length 7,800) was
seen to have a decided dark line in the middle, and it continued so for
some time. The addition of more rubidium failed to cause any reversal
of the extreme rod line, or of any but the three lines already mentioned.
     On putting lithium carbonate into the crucible, the violet line
of lithium appeared as a nebulous band, and on adding some alu
minium this violet band became enormously expanded, but showed no
reversal. The blue lithium line (wave-length 4,604) was well reversed,
as was also the red line, while a fine dark line passed through the
middle of the orange line.    On adding a mixture of aluminium filings
and the carbonates of lithium and potassium, the red line became a
broad black band, and the orange lino was well reversed.        The green
lino was exceedingly bright, but not nebulous or reversed, and the violet
line still remained much expanded, but nnreversed.
     Metallic indium placed in the crucible gave the lines with wave
lengths 4,101 and 4,609, and both were seen strongly reversed. No
other absorption line of indium could be detected.
     In some cases a current of hydrogen or of coal-gas was intro
duced into the crucibles by means of a small lateral opening, or by
a perforation through one of the carbon electrodes, as is shown in
Plate II. Fig. 4 ; sometimes the perforated carbon was placed
vertically, and we examined the light through the perforations.
When no such current of gas is introduced, there is frequently a
flame of carbonic oxide burning at the mouth of the tube.              The
current of hydrogen produces very marked effects.            As a rule, it
increases the brilliance of the continuous spectrum, and diminishes
relatively the apparent intensity of the bright lines, or makes them
altogether disappear with the exception of the carbon lines.         When
this last is the case, the reversed lines are seen simply as black
lines on a continuous background.        The calcium line with wave
length 4,226 is always seen under these circumstances as a more
or less broad black band on a continuous background, and when
the temperature of the crucible has risen sufficiently, the lines
•with wave-lengths 4,434 and 4,454, and next that with wave-length
4,425, appear as simple black lines.    So, too, do the blue and red lines
of lithium, and the barium line of wave-length 5,535, appear steadily as
sharp black lines, when no trace of the other lines of these metals,
either dark or bright, can be detected.       Dark bands also frequently
appear, with ill-defined edges, in the positions of the well-known bright
green and orange bands of lime.
     With sodium chloride, the pair of lines (5,687, 5,681) next more
refrangible than the D group were repeatedly reversed.            In every
 case the less refrangible of the two was the first to be seen reversed,
 and was the more strongly reversed, as has also been observed by
 Mr. Lockyer. But our observations on this pair of linos differ from
 his in so far as ho says that " the double green line of sodium shows
 scarcely any trace of absorption when the lines are visible," while we
 have repeatedly seen the reversal as dark lines appearing on the

 1879.]                 on Spectroscope Investigation.                 215
 expanded bright lines ; a second pair of faint bright lines, like ghosts
 of the first, usually coming out at the same time on the more
 refrangible side.
      Potassium carbonate gave, besides the violet and red lines which
 had been reversed before, the group, wave-lengths 5,831, 5,802, and
 5,872, all reversed, the middle line of the three being the first to show
 reversal.     Also the lines wave-lengths 6,913, 6,946, well reversed,
  the less refrangible remaining reversed the longer.     Also the group,
 wave-lengths 5,353, 5,338, 5,319 reversed, the most refrangible not
 being reversed until after the others. Also the line wave-length
 5,112 reversed, while two other lines of this group, wave-lengths 5,095
 and 5,081, were not seen reversed.
      Using lithium chloride, not only were the red and blue lines, as
 usual, easily reversed, and the orange line well reversed for a long
 time, but also the green line was distinctly reversed ; the violet lino
 still unreversed, though broad and expanded. Had this green lino
 belonged to caosium, the two blue lines of that metal which are so
 easily reversed could not have failed to appear ; but there was no
 trace of them.
      In the case of rubidium, the less refrangible of the red lines
was well reversed as a black line on a continuous background, but
 it is not easy to get, even from the arc in one of our crucibles,
 sufficient light in the low red to show the reversal of the extreme ray
 of this metal.
      With charred barium tartrate, and also with baryta and aluminium
 together, the reversal of the line with wave-length 6,496 was observed,
 in addition to the reversals previously described. The less refran
 gible line, wave-length 6,677, was not reversed.
      With charred strontium tartrate, the lines with wave-lengths
 4,812, 4,831, and 4,873, were reversed, and by the addition of
 aluminium, the line wave-length 4,962 was reversed for a long time,
 and also the lines wave-lengths 4,895, 4,868.
      On putting calcium chloride into the crucible, the line wave
 length 4,302 was reversed, this being the only one of the well-marked
 group to which it belongs which appeared reversed.          On another
occasion, when charred strontium tartrate was used, the line wave
length 4,877 was seen reversed, as well as the strontium line near it.
The lines wave-lengths 6,161, 6,121, have been seen momentarily
reversed.
     With magnesium, when a stream of hydrogen or of coal-gas was
led into the crucible, the lino wave-length 5,210, previously seen
in iron tubes, and ascribed to a combination of magnesium with
hydrogen, was regularly seen, usually as a dark line, sometimes
with a tail of fine dark lines on the more refrangible side similar to
the tail of bright lines seen in the sparks taken in hydrogen between
magnesium points.        Sometimes, however, this line (5,210) was seen
bright. It always disappeared when the gas was discontinued, and
appeared again sharply on readmitting hydrogen.        These effects were

however, only well defined in crucibles having a height of at least
8 inches above the arc.
     On putting a fragment of metallic gallium into a crucible, the less
refrangible line, wave-length 4,170, came out bright, and soon a dark
line appeared in the middle of it. The other line, wave-length 4,031,
showed the same effect, but less strongly.
     Reviewing the series of reversals which have been observed, in
many cases the least refrangible of binary groups is the most easily
reversed, as has been previously remarked by Cornu.
     Making a general summation of the results respecting the alkaline
earth metals, potassium and sodium, having regard only to the
most characteristic rays, which for barium may be taken as 21, for
strontium 34, for calcium 37, for potassium 31, and for sodium 12,
the reversals number respectively 6, 10, 11, 13, and 4. That is in
the case of the alkaline earth metals about one-third, and these
chiefly in the more refrangible third of the visible spectrum, the
characteristic rays remaining unreversed in the more refrangible
part of the spectrum being respectively 2, 5, and 4.
     The curious behaviour of the lines of different spectra with regard
to reversal induced a comparison with the bright lines of the chromo
sphere of the sun, as observed by Young. It is well known that some
of the principal lines of the metals giving comparatively simple
spectra, such as lithium, aluminium, strontium, and potassium, are not
represented amongst the dark lines of Fraunhofer, while other lines
of those metals are seen : and an examination of the bright chromo-
spheric lines shows that special rays highly characteristic of bodies
which appear from other rays to be present in the chromosphere are
absent, or are less frequent in their occurrence than others.
     In the following table the relation between the observations on
reversals and Young's on the chromospheric lines is shown.

                                 The          Thunderer        Oun Explosion.
THE explosion of the gun on board the ' Thunderer' — such, you will see,
on referring to the notice paper, is the subject of my lecture to-night,
and       I
          commence by reading that title to you to introduce the state
ment          I
           desire to make, that the subject of this lecture is a very limited
one.     It is not artillery generally, nor " big guns " generally, nor
muzzle-loaders compared with breech-loaders, nor the consideration
of what is the best material to employ in the construction of big
guns ; and it is not any or all of these, for one very obvious reason.
The least of the subjects                       I
                                 have mentioned would require an evening
to itself to deal with it in the merest outline, while those of more
importance would each demand a long course of lectures. My subject
is, asI     have said, the limited one of the " Explosion of the gun on
                             "
board the Thunderer            but limited as    is,   feel the difficulty of

of the hour allotted to me.
  I     am aware the remark may be made, What more can you tell us
than   we   can discover for ourselves by reading the report of the Com
mittee? and        am also aware
                       I                 just possible there may be some

                                                    is
in   ithas therefore died out. These, however, were not the feelings of
the Managers of the Institution (of whom, let me say,        was not one                I
at the time            it
                was suggested     should deliver this lecture)

the subject has died out, and that the nation        no longer concerned     is
in the investigation of an occurrence attended with such grievous
results to so many of the faithful servants of our Queen, and the
cause of     deeply rooted apprehension that the armaments in which
                  a
we trust are unworthy of that trust, and might not only fail us in
the hour of need by refusing to act against the enemy, but worse
still, might side with that enemy by inflicting wounds and death upon
ourselves.    Further, Parliamentary      papers have not an inviting
appearance, and      think   Inot improbable that but few of those who

honour me with their presence to-night are in the habit of reading
such documents, or if they are, that they find them, in the absence of
models and of familiar explanation, readily intelligible.              Bearing all
these considerations in mind, it appeared to me that a plain, un-
technical account of the investigation into tho causes of the explosion
 by one who took part in it from first to last, more especially if that
account were aided by diagrams and models, would not be uninteresting
 to the members of the lioyal Institution, and might not be without
 its use in assisting to dissipate any feeling of doubt as to the safety
 of our artillery which still lingered in tho minds of some who knew
 that a gun had exploded on board the ' Thunderer,' but who did not
 know under what circumstances that explosion had occurred.
     Let me hero say, although         I   think it barely necessary to do so,
 that having been placed by the Admiralty in the position of Assessor
 to the Committee which made the investigation,            I  should never have
 thought for one moment (notwithstanding            that  our  report was in the
 hands of the public) of giving this lecture unless            I  had ascertained
 that my doing so would meet with the full approval, as             I  am happy to
 say  it does,  of  the authorities  of  the  Admiralty.
     I   will now ask you to direct your attention to Diagram 1,
 representing a longitudinal section, of tho 38-ton gun which ex
 ploded.     This gun you will see was composed of six pieces, namely,
 the steel tube 12 inches in bore, and 16 feet 6 inches long internally,
 upon which at the rear end is shrunk the wrought-iron coiled breech
 piece ; the 1 B coil shrunk on to tho tube in advance of the breech
 piece ; the B tube shrunk on to the steel tube in front of all, and
 forming the chase or muzzle of the gun ; the 0 coil shrunk outside the
 breech piece ; and the cascable screw in rear of all.             The trunnions
 by which tho gun is supported on its carriage are forged in one with
 the C coil.      It will be observed that the ends of the different parts
 overlap, and that at these overlapping places there aro appropriate
 recesses, and projections to hook into those recesses, by which endway
 connection is made among the various parts.                 Similarly, there are
 certain projections on the exterior of the steel tube itself, which
 prevent its endway motion.             The tube is made from a solid steel
 forged ingot, which is bored out to nearly the desired size, and after
 having been toughened in oil (and about this toughening               I shall have
 something     to  say presently),  has  shrunk  upon  it  the breech piece and
 1 B coil and the B tube in succession.
     You will observe      I frequently use the word " coil when speaking
                                                                 "
 of the envelopes by which the tube is surrounded. They have this
 name because they are made by winding bars of wrought iron of a
 suitable transverse section round and round until they are made into
 gigantic ringlets, ringlets very closely twisted, as you will see on
 reference to Diagram 2. This represents a coil lying on its side ; it is
 turned up on end and placed in a furnace to be heated.               The doorway
                      I
 of this furnace, may say in passing, is large enough to be traversed
 by a full-sized coach.       Here the heating is continued until the whole

                                        '
 1879.]              on the ' Thunderer   Gun Explosion.                223
 body of the iron is raised to the full welding point, and then the door
 being opened a pair of tongs nearly 60 feet long and weighing in them
 selves as much as 22 tons, grasp the coil, withdraw it from the furnace,
 and place it on the anvil of a 40-ton steam hammer which, beating
 on the top of the coil, welds each convolution to its neighbour, and
 makes that which was before but a ringlet, into a tube.         It will be
 seen from the foregoing description that the fibre of the wrought bar
 goes round about the gun.      After the forging, the coils are turned in
 a lathe and are bored to such dimension as will not quite allow of
 their being placed when they are cold outside the steel tube, but on
being suitably heated they expand sufficiently to admit of the tubo
 being inserted within them, and then in cooling they shrink upon
 the tube and embrace it firmly. Similarly the G coil is shrunk upon
 the breech piece.
      This making of the rear end of the gun in two layers outside the
 steel tube by shrinking the C coil upon the breech piece, is not done
with the mere object of reducing the weights of the pieces to be
handled, but with the further and more important object of obtaining
greater assistance from the metal in the gun to resist explosion.         I
regret very much that time will not permit of our investigating this
interesting subject ;   I will content myself by saying that if there were
no countervailing      considerations, the gun which would give the
greatest strength for the weight of metal employed in it would be one
made up of a large number of very thin coils shrunk one upon
another. To put it popularly, if the outside coil, the C coil, is in a
state of tension owing to shrinkage, then it is on its guard and is
prepared to assist the breech piece and the tubes within it in resisting
the strain produced by the explosion ; while if the C coil were not in
that state of tension, the tube and the breech piece might be split
by the pressure before the strength of the outer coil was brought to
their aid. You will see from the diagram that the extreme diameter
of the gun is as much as 57.V inches ; while its extreme length is as
much as 19 feot 2 inches ; its weight, as we all know, is 38 tons ; and,
as  I  have said, the bore of this gun is, 12 inches, which is the bore
also of its fellow, the bore of the other 38-ton guns in the service
being as much ns 12.1 inches.
     You are all aware that the modern projectile is not a sphere, but a
cylinder with a pointed end, and that these projectiles are from 2^ to
3 diameters in length.        The cannon ball is a thing of the past.
You are also probably aware that it would be impossible to shoot
cylindrical projectiles of these proportions for even a short distance
without the risk of their turning sideways and of going anywhere but
where thoy were wanted to go, unless a rotary motion were given by
the rifling. You will observe in Diagram 1 the rifle grooves are
shown commencing at 27£ inches from the rear end of the bore and
reaching to the muzzle.        There are nine of these grooves, each of
them 1 £ inch wide by £ of an inch deep.
     Diagram 3 represents that which is called a "development" of

   the interior of the bore, and shows the nature of the rifling. To
   account to yourselves for the appearance presented by this diagram,
I    will ask you to imagine that the bore of the gun had been lined
  with a paper tube on which the rifling has been drawn, and that then
  the tube had been removed from the gun and slit by a straight longi
  tudinal cut extending from end to end, and opened out flat, and
  suspended on the wall before you. This would exhibit, as Diagram 3
  does, the rifling round the tube when developed on to a flat surface.
  You will observe that the grooves, where they commence at the
  rear end, are parallel with the bore of the gun, but that they at
  once begin to depart from this parallelism, the inclination of de
  parture gradually increasing to the very muzzle, at which point each
  groove is a portion of a helix of such an inclination as would make
  one complete turn round about the barrel, if that barrel were pro
  longed for 35 feet beyond the muzzle.     It is technically called 1 turn
  in 35 calibres ; and the calibre being in this instance exactly 1 foot,
  the inclination is equal, as   I   have said, to one turn in 35 feet.
  Assuming, therefore, that the projectile were moving with a velocity
  of say 1400 feet per second, which is 40 times 35 feet, that projectile
 would be spinning on its axis at the rate of 40 revolutions in a
 second.
      This kind of rifling is called the increasing twist. Diagram 4
 shows rifling of a uniform twist — that is to say, the departure from
 parallelism is as great at the very commencement of the rifling as at
 its termination.
      In the gun under consideration, the vent through which the charge
 is ignited is at 12 inches forward of the rear end of the bore.
    I   need hardly tell you that all the materials used in our guns are
 most carefully tested.    These tests are directed to ascertain not only
 that the metal will support a certain load, carefully and gradually
 applied to a specimen of a standard size, before rupture ensues, but
 also to ascertain that the metal is elastic and tough, and competent,
 therefore, to support shocks. The elasticity is judged of by the
 extension which a sample under strain will afford with a given load,
 such extension disappearing on the removal of that load. The tough
 ness is judged of by the total extension occurring before rupture, and
 by the ability to support bending without fracture.     I    have already
said that the steel tube is toughened in oil ; this toughening, which is
performed by heating the steel and then cooling it in oil, has a
very marked effect in increasing the resistance to strain, and also
in increasing the elastic limit. Speaking generally, when the steel
is reduced to the size of the test sample before the toughening, a
specimen which would require, when untoughened, 30 tons per square
inch to break it,  will, when toughened, require 45 tons, while the elastic
limit, which in the untoughened state would be attained by strain of
                                                              a
about 15 tons per square inch, will in the toughened state not bo
reached under 30 tons to the square inch.       Samples of iron and steel
are on the table, and an examination will show how, before rupture,

they became diminished in sectional area as they were pulled out
under the strain.
    Having now described the gun,           I
                                        will ask your attention to the
subject of the powder and of the projectiles.
    I  do not propose to say anything about the chemistry of gun
powder, but   I wish to make a few observations about the differences
which arise in the use of gunpowder from variation in the size of the
particles or grains, and to explain why it is that as the particles
enlarge the combustion is slower, and as it may be said takes place by
degrees.
    With respect to this suggestion that powder may burn by             degrees,
 I remember the     amusement  that was caused by Tom Hood's ' Beport
from Below,' where Mrs. Bound, the washerwoman, has occasioned
great alarm to Mr. and Mrs. B. by emptying the whole contents
of Mr. B.'s powder-horn into the fireplace of the washing copper,
in order to clear out the flue and stop it from smoking. Mrs. Bound
is rendered insensible, but the servant who escapes and rushes up
stairs to give an account of the occurrence, does so in the following
words : —
   " As Mrs. Round and I, marm, was a-standing at our tubs,
     And Mrs. Round was seconding what little things I rubs,
    '
    '
      Mary,' says she to me, I '
                                  say,' and there she stops for ooughin",
      That dratted copper flue has took to smoking very often ;
    But, please the pigs,' for that's her way of talking in a passion,
    ' I'll blow it
                   up, and not be set a-coughin' in this fashion."
    So down she takes my master's horn (I mean his horn for loading),
    And empties every grain alive for to set the flue exploding.
    '
      Lawks 1 Mrs. Round,' says I, and stares, ' that quantum can't be proper   ;
    I'm sartin sure it ne'er can take a pound to sky a copper.'
    Them words sets up her back, so, with her hands upon her knees,

    I'll put it in the fire and let it burn up by degrees." "
     At the time this poem was written, everyone was prepared for the
catastrophe which, as on reading     you will find did occur and even
                                      it,                          ;
now,     one were to speak of powder burning up by degrees,
        if                                                         would

               ;
the   Beport from Below      was written, for then the largest-grained
   '                        '
cannon powder was but dust as compared with the cannon powder of
the present day.    Ihave before me samples of these powders, the very
smallest of which, the B.L.G., or Bifle Large Grain,          of goodly
                                                                 is

    It tolerably easy to see why the combustion of powder in large

are small. Although powder contains within itself the elements neces
sary for its combustion, and does not need therefore the presence of
air to burn   it,nevertheless, as combustion does not occur until                   a

certain temperature is reached, and as that temperature when a light
is applied to powder proceeds from the outside towards the centre of
each grain, it      a is,
                      as    have said, easy to see why, if pound of powder
                            I                                              a

 place, more time will be required for the combustion of such                 pound      a
of powder, owing to the slowness with which the heat would travel
from the outside to the centre of                 grain of these dimensions as
                                                         a

                                          1
taneously heated on their exteriors to the temperature of ignition.
And following this up, one understands readily how much more rapid
would be the burning of the powder                    the same weight, instead of
                                                             if
being in the form of 16 cubes of an             inch    each, were in the state of
thousands of      small    grains.    In  short,  one     can readily see why                     it   is
that the larger     the  particles,  the  slower   the    combustion.
    I   need hardly say that the expressions quick and slow are but
comparative terms, and that even the slowest of gunpowders finishes
its combustion in what          popularly called
                                  is                   " no time." But " no time "
though    it  be, the unassisted eye can readily detect the difference in
the rate of burning due to variations in the size of the powder.
    I  will now ask Professor Abel, who, am glad to say,     I               with us    is
to-night, to show you by an experiment which he has kindly prepared,
that there     isthis marked difference in the rate of combustion in powder
of varying sizes.
    I  will next endeavour to explain in what way                    that the slower
                                                                          it   is
combustion, while equally efficacious in propelling the shot, acts less
severely on the gun.

Now,  if   this velocity were got by the action of gravity, and               one be    if
allowed to leave out of consideration atmospheric resistance and the

resistance of friction, it would be a matter of indifference as regards
the ultimate velocity whether the shot fell perpendicularly 30,000 feet
or slid down a (frictionless) slope of no matter how gradual an incli
nation, or whether it descended by a curved path, so long as it did,
between the commencement         and the end of its journey, traverse
30,000 feet measured perpendicularly.
                                 I
     To illustrate my meaning, will ask your attention to Diagram 5.
Here the straight vertical line, Fig. 1, represents 30,000 feet ; if the
projectile were to fall from A to B, it would at B attain a velocity of
 1400 feet in a second. The inclined line, Pig. 2, represents a (friction-
less) slope of an angle of 30°, but having the same vertical height
of 30,000 feet.    If  the shot were to slide down this, its velocity at
the bottom would still be 1400 feet a second ; but it would have
 required double the time to attain this velocity, because it would
 during its passage through any unit of length in its descent have been
 subjected but to one-half of the downward impulse that it would have
received when falling vertically.     Fig. 3 shows a frictionless concave
curve having a vertical height as before of 30,000 feet.         Again the
final velocity would be the 1400 feet a second ; but the time occupied,
while greater than that required for the vertical fall, would be less
than that needed to pass down the slope, because, as will be seen,
the early part of the downward journey is made nearly vertically, and
thus the shot has already attained a high speed before it reaches
the lower and flatter parts of the course where the downward impulse
of gravity and the acceleration are but small.            Fig. 4 shows a
convex frictionless curve of the height of 30,000 feet.        In this case
also, when the shot had reached the bottom, the velocity would be
the 1400 feet a second, but the time required would be more than in
any of the preceding cases, because the first part of the journey
is made upon a path which departs but gradually from the horizontal,
and therefore the motion of the shot is but slow while traversing
this first part.
     A consideration of these four figures will show, that so long as a
certain total impulse is applied, it is a matter of unimportance as
regards the velocity when produced, whether that impulse bo large
and uniform and needing therefore to act but through a small space
and for a short time as in Fig. 1, whether it be less and uniform, and
needing therefore to act through a greater space and a longer time
as in Fig. 2, whether it be variable as in Fig. 3, where it is great to
begin with, and becomes less towards the end, a condition of things
requiring comparatively a short time, or whether it be variable as in
Fig. 4, where it is small to begin -with, and becomes greater towards
the end, a condition demanding the longest time of all.
     Now these propositions, which are true when a body is caused
by the action of gravity to attain a velocity of 1400 feet a second,
are equally true when that velocity arises from the body being im
pelled by a force vastly superior to that due to the action of gravity,
and needing therefore to be exercised through a correspondingly

diminished distance, and for a correspondingly diminished time. Take,
for example, the force arising from the combustion of gunpowder,
and applied to the projectile through the space which that projectile
traverses in the hore of a cannon, and applied during the short time
in which that traverse is made.
      I  have already told you that the length of the 38-ton bore is
16 feet 6 inches, but from this must be deducted, say, 2 feet for the
length of the cartridge, leaving about 14^ feet as the distance through
which the shot moves under the influence of the powder pressure.
Now 14£ feet is the ^^ ,,th part of 30,000 feet ; therefore the average
pressure on a projectile while traversing this 14J feet must be
2069 times as great as the weight of the shot, in order to give it as
great a velocity, 1400 feet in a second, as it would have attained by
falling 30,000 feet.      I have said that this must be the average
pressure. Obviously as regards strain tending to burst the gun, the
most favourable condition of things would be that this average pressure
should be exercised, but, equally obviously, the explosion of a charge
of powder is not a means by which such an average can be attained.
 To put it popularly, one feels that the explosion of the charge
 in the small space which it occupies between the rear end of the
 tube and the base of the projectile before that projectile begins to
 move, must give rise to an intense pressure which will gradually
 die out as, owing to the progression of the shot, the space becomes
 enlarged, and as the gases are cooled. This being so, and 2069
 times the weight of the shot being needed as the average pressure, it
 follows that as the final pressure falls much below the average, the
 commencing pressure must be greatly above it ; and it is this great
 commencing pressure which strains the gun and demands the enor
  mous thicknesses of metal which you see surrounding the powder
 chamber.
       I believe I have now, by what  I fear has been too long an introduc
  tion, prepared the way to show you why it is that the large-grain slow-
  burning powders tax the resisting power of the gun less than it is taxed
  by the small-grain and quick-burning, for it will readily occur to you
  that if the chamber be occupied by large cubes of powder which
  begin burning from the outside, and in this beginning of burning
  generate a certain pressure, the shot will commence to move, and the
  space in which the powder gases are confined will commence to in
  crease, so that by the time the whole of the powder is ignited the
  chamber will have become larger, and thereby the intensity of the
  pressure will be reduced ; while if the powder had been composed of
  small grains, like those used in a rifle, the explosion of the charge
   would take place in so short a time that the shot would not have
  appreciably moved before the whole of the charge was in combustion,
  and in this way a very high pressure would be produced.             I may
  mention that the French apply to this small-sized powder when used
  in cannon the expressive title " poudre brutale."
                       "
        Diagram 6 is a curve of pressures."     Imagine that the horizontal

1879.]               on the' Thunderer' Gun Explosion.                 229
line A B represents the length of the bore traversed by tho shot, and
that the vertical linos represent tons pressure per square inch ; and
assume that the black vertical dotted line A to D represents 24 tons
and is the maximum pressure arising from burning the charge of
pebble powder, and that this pressure is maintained for a very short
time, and therefore through a very small distance as represented by
the summit C of the hillock to which       I now point, and that then by
the increase of space arising from the moving of the shot and by the
cooling of the gases the pressure diminishes until when the shot is
leaving the muzzle of the gun, the pressure has fallen to - ! tons on
the square inch, as represented by the height B E. The average of
these varying pressures will be represented by the dotted line x y,
and will be found to be about 6 tons per square inch ; which pressure
when applied on the area of the base of a 12-inch projectile, equals
568 tons, or 2069 times the weight (as     I shall presently have occasion
to tell you) of the common shell, empty, but with its gas check, for
this gun. The maximum strain you will see to attain this average
pressure has been only 24 tons to the square inch.
     Assume next that a quick-burning powder had been used, and that
 this had given a maximum pressure, as shown by the dotted line
 A F, of 30 tons on the inch, but that this pressure had continued for
 a still shorter time and for a less distance, as shown by the position of
 the hillock G, and had then fallen until at tho muzzle it retained
 only the pressure expressed by B N. The average would still be
 represented by the line x y, and the effect in propelling the shot
 would be just the same as before, but the gun would have been
 strained by a maximum pressure of 30 tons per inch, instead of by a
 maximum pressure of only 24 tons.
     Although Diagram 6 represents the varying pressures which
 propel the projectile, it does not, until after the maximum pressure
 is reached, that is to say it does not, except in front of the point of
 maximum pressure, represent the extent to which the gun is subjected
 to these pressures.     In the absence of wave action (to which action   I
 shall have to refer hereafter), if a pressure exists at the base of the
 shot, that same pressure must prevail throughout the bore of the gun
 to the rear of tho shot. Diagram 6a correctly shows the strains which
 come upon the gun under the conditions of propelling pressure repre
 sented in Diagram 6.
      From that which     I have just been saying, you will be prepared
 to hear that, other things being equal, the intensity of the explosion
 is increased when the space occupied by the powder is diminished.
 In practice the cartridges are made of such length, that every pound of
 powder as it lies in the gun between the base of the projectile and the
 rear end of the bore, reposes in a space the cubic contents of which are
 30 inches, or rather more than the contents (27£
                                                      inches) of a pound of
 water, and if the cartridge were made of double the length and of cor
 respondingly attenuated girth, so that the powder lay with practical
 uniformity in the cartridge along the bottom of the bore, and thus each

230                        Mr. F.  J.  Bramwell                  [June  13,
pound had devoted to it 60 cubic inches of space, the intensity of the
explosion would bo greatly reduced. While on the other hand, if the
powder were made into a solid block occupying the space demanded
by its specific gravity of 1'76, namely only 16 cubic inches, and if
that block could by some means, say by threading it in all directions
with platinum wires, be made red hot by electricity, and be ignited
throughout simultaneously, the intensity of the explosion would be at
a maximum.
    There is no need for me to tell yon that it is in the highest
degree important in designing a gun, that the designer should know
with a considerable approach to accuracy, what are the pressures the
gun may be called upon to sustain, and what are the varying pres
sures to be expected in the different parts of the same gun.          Now
there are two modes by which the pressures may bo ascertained.
The first mode is by calculation from the velocity of the projectile
or from the recoil of the gun, if it could bo left free to recoil ; the
second mode is by the introduction of pressure gauges called from
the mode in which they are acted upon " crusher
                                                         "
                                                            gauges placed
within the gun itself.      I  have already shown you how if the
velocity of the shot when it leaves the muzzle is known, and the
weight of that shot, and of the powder which is also in motion is
known, and the distance from the part of the bore where the base
of the shot was situated before it started to the muzzle is known,
it is comparatively easy to calculate, after making duo allowance for
the pressures required to set up rotation, the mean pressure that has
been exerted in the gun, but (as     I  have stated) the information thus
arrived at does not tell the inquirer what the varying pressures
have been, nor what the maximum pressure has been.               But if it
were possible to ascertain what was the velocity of the projectile,
say when it had traversed half-way along the bore, it would then be
easy to compute the average pressure which had prevailed from the
commencement     of the journey to this half-way point, and then the
average pressure from this point to the muzzle ; and this clearly would
be a step gained in the solution of the question, what are the varia
tions of pressure during the passage of the shot ? Similarly, if the
length of the traverse of the shot in the gun were divided into
say ten parts, and the velocity as the shot passed each of these
imaginary points of division could be known, the average pressure
in each section could be calculated, and thus the maximum pressure
and the variations would be ascertained. You will,          I think, agree
with me that it is a difficult task to detect at what speed a projectile
is travelling when ton or twelve feet within the bore of a gun. The
way in which up to a certain date this information was obtained with
small arms, was to cut off successive lengths from the barrel of a rifle
so that each part of the barrel in turn became the muzzle, and thus
the velocity of the bullet as it issued could bo recorded in the usual
manner.     But this mode would bo a costly ono to pursue with large
cannon, and, moreover, it is open to the great objection that a record

1879.]                     on the ' Thunderer'   Gun Explosion.         231
of velocity is obtained       at only one place for each discharge, and
thus if there were any accidental variation in the weight, or in the
dryness, or in the circumstances attending the ignition of the charge,
discordant results would ensue.
      We owe to the study and to the inventive genius of Captain
Andrew Noble, F.E.S., an apparatus, the chronoscope, which enables
the inquirer to determine the velocity of the projectile within the
gun at as many points as ho may deem necessary. Diagram 7 repre
sents the chronoscope ; you will see that it consists of a train of
wheelwork by which the smooth circumference of the final wheels
lettered A can bo made to move with great velocity.              As much as
100    feet per  second are reached.
      Assume now that the circumferences of the wheels be clothed
•with properly prepared paper bands, and that a wire be brought in
proximity to the paper on each wheel, and be so coupled up to
an electrical apparatus, that on the wire being broken in some part
of its length, electricity shall pass from the point of the wire through
the paper to the wheel, making a mark on the paper.             Next assume
 that the wire, properly insulated, is applied to a suitable trigger-
 like apparatus, such as is shown on the diagram, in the side of the
 bore of the gun to be experimented upon ; then if the shot be fired,
 it will as it passes each apparatus push in the trigger, and will
 thereby break the wire, and will cause a record to be left on the
 paper ; and         if,
                     as suggested,    several wires be applied to the gun,
 say at ten points, these will be broken in succession as the shot
 passes them, each rupture will make its own mark on its band of
 paper on the edge of its wheel, and the velocity of that band being
 known, the varying distance of the marks from           common datum will

 be a   measure of time, and therefore of the velocity which the shot had
 in passing each wire in the gun, and thus the varying pressures in
 the gun can be calculated.            have said that
                                        I                velocity as high as

pressure per inch as the bore of the gun is receiving at the part
where the gauge is inserted, and in this way the piston is subjected to
an outward pressure equal to the maximum pressure per square inch
prevailing in that part of the gun multiplied by the area of the end
of the piston. You will see that the only thing which prevents the
piston from being driven outwards under this pressure is the copper
cylinder ; but this cylinder is designedly made too small in area to
support the pressure without being shortened and thickened out. By
trial in a proper machine, where the pressures are known, the beha
viour of similar copper cylinders under varying loads is ascertained,
and in this manner an examination of the extent to which the cylinder
has been shortened by the pressure in the gun gives at once the infor
mation needed, namely, what that pressure had been.
    Eeverting to Diagram 60, 1 will now state that this shows by the
full lines the maximum and varying pressures which have been
ascertained by experiment to prevail in such a gun as that which
                                  '
burst on board the ' Thunderer when using 85 Ibs. of pebble powder,
occupying 30 cubic inches to the pound. You will remember that
the maximum is 24 tons on the square inch, that this pressure prevails
over the length of the powder chamber, and for a short distance
beyond, and that then the pressure drops in the manner indicated by
the curved line, until at the muzzle it is only 2J tons per inch, as
shown by the vertical line B E. With such a curve of pressures it is
easy to ascertain what is the strain tending to burst the gun at any
part of the bore ; for example, at the point h the pressure would be
represented by the vertical line h i, and would be found to be 10 tons,
while at the point m it would be represented by the line m n, and
would be found to be 5 tons.
    I will now ask your attention to the projectiks used in these guns.
Two kinds are employed. One is known as a common shell ; it is
a hollow cylinder of ordinary cast iron, terminating in a conoidal
point, and containing within it a very considerable bursting charge.
This shell weighs, when fitted with its gas check, but empty, 590 Ibs.,
and to propel it that which is known as the full charge, namely
85 Ibs. of pebble powder, is employed.     Such a shell would be unfit
to penetrate armour plating, as the point of the shell would fail on
striking the plate ; but if proper iron (that which is known as mottled
pig-iron) be employed, and if when fluid it be poured, not into a sand
or loam mould, but into a mould made of cast iron, the exterior of the
casting will be rapidly cooled (chilled) by contact with the iron sides
of the mould, and the result will be the production of a material ex
ceeding in hardness the very highest tempered steel. Such a projectile
is competent to penetrate armour plate ; and if time admitted  I should
very much like to go into the reasons why, but      I must abstain from
so doing.    These shells contain only a small bursting charge. They
weigh when empty, but with their gas check, as much as 700 Ibs.,
and they are propelled by the battering charge of 110 Ibs. of pebble
powder.    Samples of the actual shells, cut open, are before you.

     To cause the shells to obey the action of the rifling, and to rotate
on their axes, they are provided with as many rows of studs as there are
rifle grooves — namely, nine rows, with three studs in each row. The
studs are secured into the shells in the following manner. Diagram 9
shows, greatly exaggerated by Fig. 1, a section through a stud-hole.
This is circular, and, as you will see, is undercut ; it is made by drilling
out a parallel hole, as represented by the dotted lines, and then by
introducing a tool, a sample of which      I now show you, provided with
a hinged cutter, which projects further and further as the tool
descends, until by the time it has reached the bottom of the hole the
projection is sufficient to give the undercut form shown. Fig. 2 repre
sents one of the gun-metal studs placed in such a hole.        Tou will see
the stud is cylindrical, but that the bottom of it is cupped.     If  severe
pressure be applied to the top of the stud, the cavity of the cup will
 be flattened, and the inverted brim, so to speak, of the cup, will be
 swelled outwards, and will fill up the countersunk part of the hole
 (see Fig. 3), and in that way it will be securely fixed into the shell,
without the possibility of becoming unscrewed or detached.
     The Falliser chilled shell is too hard to admit of the stud-holes
being drilled out ; they are therefore formed in the act of casting, by
a process which is technically known as coring — that is to say, sand
is rammed into a box the shape of the desired hole ; the sand is then
dried, and becomes a plug which is fixed in the side of the chill mould ;
the metal flows round about the plug, and when the metal is set the plug
is cleared away, and a hole of the form of the box in which the sand
plug itself was made is left in the casting ; but such a hole will not have
the smooth surface of one that has been cut out by a drill.             You
have before you samples of the cores, samples of the cored holes, and
samples of the drilled holes; also studs which have not yet been
compressed into a hole, and a number of studs which have been com
pressed, some into drilled holes and some into cored holes.             The
appearance    of the parts  which have  been  in these respective classes   of
holes differs, as might be expected, bearing in mind that the one class
has been cut out so as to be smooth, while the other has been cored
out, and is comparatively rough. The difference is sufficiently marked
to enable one to say which of the studs have been in cored holes and
which of them have been in drilled holes.
     The projectiles do not fit the bore of the gun accurately, and thus
there is a space (a very small one, it is true, but still a space)
through which the gases from the ignited powder can pass between
the projectile and the walls of the bore.        This escape of gas causes
a slight decrease in the useful effect of the powder, but is more preju
dicial for another reason, namely, that the high velocity at which
the heated gases pass operates injuriously upon the bore of the gun
by erosion in the neighbourhood of the base of the projectile.             To
prevent this escape and the injury arising from it, the base of the

  some extent making them also fit into the rifle grooving.                        may I

  as an implement to cause the rotation of the projectile, thus dispensing
  altogether with the studs.

arises from the discharge of the gun when loaded, and this                   itdoes in
 the following manner. Connected to the rear end of the cylinder                           f

but assuming the gun to have been run out to the firing position and
to have been fired, then the recoil drives the gun back with great
violence, and thereby causes the piston               to press on the water in the

the energy imparted to the gun and carriage by the recoil has become
expended in driving out the water through the loaded valves.                      The
resistance offered by the water under these circumstances                    isalways
sufficient to stop the recoil by the time that the gun has only made a
portion of its inward run, and the remainder of that run has to be
accomplished by putting the lever              into the position number

 the noise of the explosion is board, the gunner No. 1 in charge of the
lever g, does put it into this running-in position. At first, and without
 consideration, one is tempted to say this must be a wrong thing to do,
 because the object at that time to be obtained by the apparatus is to
 check the recoil, and therefore the putting the lever g in such a
 position as (apparently) to cause a water pressure to aid the recoil
 must be wrong.      But reflection shows this not to be the case ; the
opening through which the water from the accumulator enters is so
 small, that even when all resistance is removed, the water cannot flow
 into the cylinder  f with sufficient rapidity to fill the space between the
 end d and the piston e, as that space is enlarged by the rapid motion
                                                       I
 of the piston when driven in by the recoil ; and need hardly tell you
 that if the water does not fill the space, the unfilled part will be in a
 vacuous condition, and practically to as great an extent as if no water
 were there at all.    When any water is there, the vacuous space will
 be less ; but less though it be, it will be equally vacuous, if     I may use
 such an expression, and therefore no pressure will be applied to the
 piston e to drive it towards the left hand, and thus to assist the
recoil.
     Now, as the object of the crew working the gun is to do so with
 rapidity, and as the necessary inward run of the gun, as       I have already
 told you, is not effected by the recoil alone, there is every reason why
 the man in charge of the lever g should move it directly he hears
 the explosion, because by doing so he does not, as        I have pointed out
 to you, aggravate the effect of the recoil, and he does make a connec
 tion with the water in the accumulator, so as to cause the pressure
from it to continue, without a break, the run in which had been com
 menced by the recoil ; whereas if this course of putting over the lever
immediately were not adopted, the man would be compelled to wait
until the motion from the recoil came to an end, and then the gun
would have to wait until the space between the piston e and the
cylinder end d was filled up before the gun would re-start on its
inward run.
     I have already told you how the position of the slides as regards
elevation and depression may be altered ; but         I  need hardly say that
the inclination of the gun for aiming at each time of firing is not made
in this manner, but is effected by vibrating the gun on its trunnions
by appropriate apparatus ; and it is this apparatus which also depresses
the muzzle of the gun into the position for loading, about which        I shall
have to speak shortly : but previously     I must say a few words as to the

guns are practically identical with the 38, but being loaded by hand
from within the turret they are of necessity some 3 feet shorter than
the 38-ton guns, which, as you will presently hear, are loaded

movement of the gun to bring it to bear on the object aimed at is
attained by causing the turret to move in one direction or the other.

      Assuming the turret to be brought into position suitable for one of
 the loading gears, the muzzles of the guns are depressed, as you will

and loading apparatus — for they are one and the same — is hydraulic,
and consists of an inclined cylinder so placed on supports as to
have its centre upon the prolongation of an imaginary line passing
through the axis of the gun when in the loading position.           Within
this cylinder is contained a plunger, which is hollow and has
within it a second plunger, so that the cylinder with its two
plungers may be likened to a threefold telescope.       The inner plunger
carries on its end a head (the rammer), which is surrounded by the
sponge, not an actual sponge, but a sponge-like fabric ; the head is
hollow, and is supplied with water under pressure by being in con
nection with a hole which extends along the centre of the plunger ;
the front of the head is provided with a little valve opening inwards
and kept closed, therefore, by the pressure of the water.        There is a
small pin on the front of this valve, which projects.       This being the
construction of the apparatus, the action is as follows.       The man in
charge moves the lever, and thereby admits water under pressure into
the cylinder of the rammers, which water drives out the plungers, and
almost always, as it possesses the greater area, the large plunger starts
first and goes outwards (until checked by a stop), carrying with it the
smaller plunger and the head well up into the bore of the gun, and
then the smaller plunger starts out under the influence of the pressure,
and continues the carrying of the head forward until it reaches the
end of the bore, when the pin on the little valve strikes the rear end
of the bore, opens the valve, so as to allow the water to escape, to
wash out the gun and to saturate the sponge cloth. The lever is then
reversed, the water pressure is made to act upon certain annular
surfaces round about the plungers and in the reverse direction, and in
this way the telescope shuts up, withdrawing the head from the gun.
Two men then lift the cartridge and put it into the loading tube. The
projectile has been previously brought in a truck and placed on the
platform of the hydraulic lifting gear, and, the cartridge being in, the
lever is moved, which admits water pressure into a vertical hydraulic
cylinder, and thereby raises the plunger within         it,
                                                        carrying upwards
the platform, the truck, and the projectile to     definite position which
                                                    a
is  one that places the projectile in the exact line of the bore.
     A papier-mache disc wad    is next put upon the rammer head. You
will see the wad consists of disc, of tubular socket, and of collar
                                a
                                        is a

round about that socket.       The wad      held in place by the socket,
being received   into
                    a   cavity provided for    in the rammer head, while
                                               it
the collar keeps the back of the disc away from the head and from
pressing on the pin of the water valve, and thus prevents the pressure
exerted in ramming from opening that valve and deluging the gun
 while loading.    A wad   is wanted for two reasons one, thu ordinary

large number of hard wooden wedges strung upon              rope, made up

be introduced     with their points between the shot and the gun, and be
rammed hard home.         The second purpose, and the unusual purpose
for which a wad is required in the case of the 38-ton guns of the
' Thunderer,' is to make sure that the
                                             projectile shall not return down
the inclined bore of the gun     on  the  withdrawal    of the rammer.
       I have told you  that the muzzle    of the  gun  is inclined downwards
when loading,     but  I havo  not yet   stated  the  angle : it is 11£°, and I'
may say      that  very  careful experiment      on   board  the ' Thunderer
proved that this angle is as nearly as possible the angle of repose of
a projectile lying on the bore of the gun.
       In several cases the rammer on being very quietly withdrawn, was
not followed by the projectile ; in other cases it was ; but in no
instance were more than some 7 or 8 Ibs. needed to uphold the
projectile with absolute certainty.          As regards the cartridge, the
 inclination must be much greater before that will commence to slide
 down the bore ; we made careful experiments with cartridges put in
 loosely and with cartridges rammed home, and we found, speaking
 roundly, that some 45 to 50 per cent, of the weight of the cartridge
 was needed in direct pull to keep the cartridge moving down the bore
 at this inclination. The suggestion that the cartridge has at any time
 slipped down the bore when once rammed home, or even when once
 placed home loosely, is entirely unwarranted, as the makers of such a
 suggestion would very soon find if they were to perform the simple
 experiment of trying to pull the cartridge down the inclined bore.
 But although there is not the slightest ground for fearing that the
 cartridge would slip down, there is great probability that the pro
 jectile would do so, and therefore it becomes necessary, irrespective of
  the question of the ship rolling, to use a wad.            Assuming as some
 have done that one of these guns can be burst by means of a wad,
  I   would ask you which of the two wads is the more dangerous,
 the old wooden wedge wad, where the points of the wedge are driven
  in between the projectile and the walls of the bore, or the papier-
  mache disc wad, which is not inserted between the projectile and the
  walls of the bore at all, but is merely retained in the gun by the
  pressure around the edge of the disc.           The effect of this pressure
  can be overcome (as we ascertained by direct experiment) by nothing
  short of the force of 8 to 10 men pulling directly at the wad.
        That which 1 have had to say about the wad has been so lengthy
  I  fear you may have forgotten that we left the cartridge in the loading
  tube, and the projectile elevated in a line with the bore waiting to be
   rammed in ; this ramming in is effected by a similar movement of the
  lever to that which was employed in the sponging.               The telescope
   again shoots out and the head goes into the gun ramming before it the
   wad, the projectile, and the cartridge.      You will have remarked that
   owing to the larger plunger of the two moving first and then coming
   to a stop when the ramming homo is by no means complete, that it is
  impossible to see from any mark on the rammer how far the head has
   advanced into the gun after the first joint of the rammer has come to

                      on the ' Thunderer

 rest. The information that the charge is home, is afforded audibly,
 by the concussion arising from the striking of the cartridge against
 the end of the bore, and the position of the rammer is indicated
 visibly by a hand made to revolve on a dial by means of a line
 attached to the rammer head.
      When the gun is loaded, those in charge of that operation give
 also a visible signal by a tell-tale, to the crew within the turret :
 " Left gun ready," or "right gun ready," as the case may be. The gun
 is then raised from the depressed position, is run out by the hydraulic
 apparatus through the port, and is adjusted as to level for firing, the
 turret is unlocked and is revolved until the gun bears upon the object,
 and then the gun is fired. This firing may be done either electrically
 or by hand : in either case a tube is inserted into the vent ; this tube
 contains powder closely rammed, and there is a composition in its
 head which in the case of electrical firing is ignited by an electric
 spark conveyed through a wire coupled up to another small wire
 which you see projecting from the head of the tube.
      Electrical firing is used to give a simultaneous discharge from all
 the guns, so as to concentrate their fire upon the object aimed at.
 When electrical firing is employed, the whole ship becomes the
 gun carriage and the firing is done not by the officers in the
                                   "
 turret, but from the " conning      tower; to a key in which the wires are
 connected.    When the officer in the conning tower sees by the aid of
 an instrument, the " Director," which he has there, that the guns are
 bearing on the object, he depresses the key, and thus if no misfire
 takes place delivers a concentrated broadside.       In the other mode of
 firing the guns, the composition in the head of the tube is ignited by
 a friction arrangement ; this is put into operation by pulling a lanyard,
 and there is a contrivance by which, if desired, both the lanyards in
 ono turret can be pulled simultaneously.
      Having now described to you the construction of the gun, the
 mode   of loading, and other matters necessary to be described in order
to place you in a position to appreciate what occurred,       I will briefly
narrate the circumstances attendant on the working of the guns on the
2nd of January last.
      The two guns of the fore turret and the two in the after turret
were each loaded with a battering charge of 110 lbs. of pebble
powder, and with a Palliser shell, empty, the two guns of the fore
turret having in addition disc wads.         In the after turret the naval
wedge wad was not used, as the guns were loaded in a horizontal
position, and the sea being smooth there was no fear of the projectile
being shifted by the rolling of the vessel.
     All four guns were primed with electric tubes, and were to be
discharged as an electric broadside, the discharge being effected, as
already stated, by the depressing of the key in the conning tower. On
the depression of the key on this occasion, beyond all question there
was a misfire as regards one of the two guns of the after turret.

I"  say beyond all question, because the charge was subsequently
   wormed" out of the gun, and the torn cartridge, with its 110 lbs. of
powder, was thrown overboard.              The Committee say, and I, the
assessor to that Committee, say that there was a similar misfire as
regards the left-hand gun of the fore turret, the one which afterwards
burst.   Following the electric broadside, the order was given for
independent firing, that is to say, each gun was to be fired by itself,
and the firing was to take place while the turrets were revolving.
                                                 "
 The charge was to be the " full charge of 85 lbs. pebble powder,
and an empty common shell.             This was inserted into the left gun
of the fore turret.       The gun was raised and run out to its firing
position, was fired, and burst, with the disastrous results we all
but too well know ; and       I  now, at this late period, come to the real
 object of  my   lecture,  the  consideration of what it was that caused the
 explosion.

 will sound the end of the hour allotted for this lecture before have                  I

     I will refer you to Diagram 14, which shows the external appear
ance presented by the ruins of the gun when brought together, and to
Diagram 15, which represents the interior of the splinters of the steel
tube that have been found, when also laid side by side in their proper
juxtapositions.     This last diagram, you will see,         like the diagrams
                                                                   is

in speaking of those diagrams,          gives
                                       it       representation of that which

open of the tube     from   end to end, to be laid out flat.
     I will ask your particular attention to splinters                and    and
                                                                             1,   2,         3,

the piece of steel tube remaining in the breech coil you will see a      :
shaded mark upon each of them at the left-hand end, which was
caused by an abrasion extending here across the splinters, and made
at an angle to the surface of the tube.
     Diagram 16 shows     a    longitudinal section through splinter         and             1,
through splinter 13, which        isone of the splinters forward of        and          1,        it
shows them in the position and under circumstances which account
for the abrasions on the left-hand ends of              and

but reverse abrasions on the front piece 13.
     An inspection of the remains shews clearly that the centre of the
explosion was at the point A, the former point of union between
splinter  1   and the pieces which were in continuation rearward of
splinter 13. With A as the centre of the explosion, the effect would
have been as shewn, to bulge the gun out at that part, and thus
to break away the left-hand ond of splinter              from the part of the
                                                              1

tube remaining in the breech, and to do so by making the corner B of
the breech piece into a fulcrum.     On this happening, the left-hand
corner of splinter 1 would be raised above the general line of the
bottom of the boro, and thus if any part of a projectile were at that
moment in the rear of the splinter, that projectile could not pass
forward without abrading away the protruding corner of the splinter,
and this is precisely what has happened.
     And      I
            will tell you what is the proof that the marks on these
splinters 1, 2, and 3 must have been made by a projectile in motion,
and not by accidental collision with any hard substance        after the
explosion occurred. Pieces 1, 2, and 3 form among them about one-
half of the circumference of the 12-inch tube, and therefore, being
hollow, they could not be uniformly mai'ked, as wo now see they are,
by anything except a convex body of the same diameter of 12 inches.
Is it credible that these three pieces each of them happened to
strike in its flight some cylindrical body of 12 inches diameter, the
axis of which was in an exact alignment with that of the concave
curve of the fragment at the time of impact ?                    I
                                                     venture to say it is
impossible, and that no other explanation can be given of these marks
than that the pieces were tilted so as to form parts of a cone, the base
being at A, and that while thus tilted a projectile passed by them.
An examination of the marks shows that the abrasion was in the
direction of the motion of the projectile.
                       I
     Further, will now show you why it is impossible that these marks
could have been made by something protruding from the projectile.
They commence at the left-hand end of the splinters 1, 2, and 3 ; the
remains of the tube from which these splinters have been parted are
absolutely free from mark : had the marks on 1, 2, and 3 been made
while they were in one with the rest of the tube forming part of
a cylinder, it is clear that fellow marks must have been found on
the tube itself.    There are no such marks, and only one conclusion
can be drawn, and that                is,
                               that the marks are not due to any protrusion
from the projectile,   but  owe their origin to the canting of the splinters
 1,    and
         2,   and 3,to  this  canting having brought their left-hand top
corners   above  the line  of the bore, so as to necessitate the abrading of
these corners (at the angle at which they have been abraded) to allow
of the passage of the projectile.
     There may be some of you who will say,           the point
                                                            if        B
                                                                   were used
as the fulcrum for the enormous strain required to tear the splinter
away from the part of the tube remaining in the breech piece, that
fulcrum being of soft material, wrought iron, must exhibit signs of
                                a

                                                                 I
it does exhibit these signs, and in the most unmistakable manner.           It
   literally bell-mouthed by the pressure that has been exerted upon
it, is
    and there are distinct prominences left in this bell-mouth between
the parts where the splinters of the tube pressed.
   I   will now ask you to turn your attention to splinter 13.            If
                                                                          this

242                           Mr. F. J. Bramwett                 [June   13,
the bevel should be the opposite of that of the abrasion on splinter 1 ;
and that which should be, is, for splinter 13 is thus abraded, as shown
at C, and the abrasion has been made by a cylindrical body moving
with enormous rapidity ; that is to say, by tho projectile which had
previously abraded the left-hand end of splinter 1.
     These indications, in tho judgment of the Committee, and       I  trust
in your judgment, prove to demonstration that at the time of the
explosion, the centre of effort of which was at the point A, a projectile
was to the rear not only of A, but as regards some part of it at least
to the rear of the left hand of splinter No. 1.      But if that projectile
were the common shell that had just been loaded into the gun, its
85 Ibs. of powder must have been in its rear, and therefore 6 to 7 feet
away from the seat of the explosion.       If this had been so, what force
was it that produced explosion in a part of the gun in advance of the
projectile, and where, according to the suggestion, there was nothing
but atmospheric air ?
     I  leave it to those who say there was but the single charge in the
gun,   to  give a satisfactory answer to this question, and in the mean
 time  I  will offer to your consideration the hypothesis of the double-
 loading — an hypothesis which fulfils every necessary condition.
Probably the best way of showing to you how exactly it does fulfil these
conditions will bo to make use once more of our diagram model, No. 13.
This model has already been loaded with the battering charge of
 110 Ibs., and the Palliser shell with its gas check and wad ; and    I  will
 take it that at the electric broadside there was, as regards the gun this
model is intended to represent, a misfire ; that this circumstance not
being known, the gun was depressed to tho loading position, and that
 the order was given (by the tell-tale) from those within the turret to
 those without to sponge and load, whereupon they sponge out, they
 put in the 85-lb. charge, the common shell in front of it with its gas
 check and wad, and then send in tho signal, " Gun loaded."        Look at
 it when thus double-loaded, and observe where the 85 Ibs. of powder
 are in reference to the seat of the centre of the explosion, a little to
 tho rear, but not more than would be rectified by the very first move
 ment forward of the Palliser shell (see A', Fig. 17).       Now imagine
 the 110-lb. charge ignited, the flash from it passing along the riflo
 grooves outside the gas check to the 85 Ibs. in front, and igniting this
 85 Ibs. placed between a common shell weighing 590 Ibs. in front, and
 the Palliser shell of 700 Ibs. in the rear, and being urged forward at
 that time by the commencement of tho explosion of the 110 Ibs. of
  powder, and thereby compressing the 85-lb. charge into the smallest
  possible space, and it may bo, as suggested by Professor Osborne
  Eeynolds, generating as much heat as would have ignited that powder,
  even in the absence of the flash along the rifle grooves.
                                                                  I
      You will remember how, in an early part of this lecture, pointed
  out to you that the diminution of the space occupied by the powder
  added to tho intensity of the explosion, and also how, if you could

so that it would be ignited all at once, the intensity would be at a
maximum, in fact a detonation would take place. This is what well
may have happened under the circumstances occurring here ; but even
in the absence of such additions to the ordinary force of the explosion,
you have but to look at the proportions of that part of the gun where
the 85-lb. charge was at the time of its explosion, to see that those
proportions could not withstand the pressure arising from even a com
mon ignition of that weight of powder. Referring also to Diagram 6a,
the curve of pressures in the gun, you will see that the maximum
pressure which conies on this part of the gun in ordinary use is only
some 4 to 5 tons, instead of the 24 tons which would arise from the
ordinary explosion of 85 Ibs. of pebble powder.
     Diagram 17 is intended as a rough representation of what took
place when the hinder charge was fired with the other charge in front.
     There is a further evidence that at the time the gun exploded the
Palliser shell was still in           it,
                                 and that      that which

stud which was picked up in the turret.
    I  have explained to you the difference between the modes of
making the holes in the common shells and in the Falliser shells.

result, studs when taken out indicate by their appearance whether
they have been in     Palliser shell or in common one.

accidentally in the turret.    In the first place, owing to the manner in
which the studs are fixed in the shells,         practically impossible for

a recoil so violent as to drive the buffers through the wrought-iron
transom on which they were carried, and this, notwithstanding that
the hydraulic apparatus for absorbing the recoil was acting, and must
have been doing so with extra vigour, as will be readily understood
when one recollects the augmentation of pressure necessary to drive
water through orifices at      greatly increased rate. Let me say here,
                                  a
in anticipation of any objection that may be urged against the
hydraulic apparatus, as being too delicate an implement for purposes
of warfare, that notwithstanding this explosion occurred within the
turret the hydraulic apparatus was uninjured, and we were able to uso

 I    hopeI   have now proved to you that double-loading would account

244                        Mr. F.  J. Bramwell                      [June 13,
for all that    happened, and if time permitted    I  would endeavour to
show you that nothing else would account for it.        I   know, however,
that the common impression is, although the double-loading would
account for all, double-loading is simply impossible, and must be
discarded.    I  have had this said to me by many, but        I  have had it
persevered in by none after the facts of the case were brought to their
knowledge.
    Before stating what the objections are that          I   find generally
advanced against the possibility of double-loading,       I   will allude to
portions of the evidence which bear on this subject, more especially
as most of the objectors have not been at the pains even of reading
the report, still less of studying the evidence.      The captain of the
vessel, one of the officers, and a sailor were watching the electric
broadside, and they give evidence that three shots came from it. Now,
as we know one of the guns in the after turret did not go off, if
these three witnesses were not deceived as to what they saw, the
suggestion of double-loading is a mistake ; but in opposition to this
evidence is to be set that of five sailors, including a signalman, who
were all of them clear that two shots only came from that broad
side, and that one of them came from each turret.        Having said this
much,   I   will now comment upon the reasons commonly given for
holding the double-loading hypothesis to be impossible.
     The first observation generally is : The noise and concussion of
the explosion could have left those in the turret in no doubt as to
whether the gun had gone off.      The answer, concurred in by all who
have been present in a turret at firing, is that the noise and concussion
produced by one 38-ton gun when fired off are as great as the human
ear can take in, and that two guns going off simultaneously (for            I
must ask you to remember that these guns were to be fired together
electrically) would not add to the effect that would be produced by the
explosion of one gun.
    The next observation is: Those who loaded the gun must have known
by the position of the rammer whether there was a charge remaining
in the gun ; but when it is explained to them that the rammer is tele
scopic, and that all motion of the visible part has ceased long before
the second charge would be rammed home against the first, and that
the index was out of action, that ground fails the objector.
     The third and final reason for its being impossible to have double-
loaded the gun that has ever been offered to me is : That the misfire
must have been known, because the gun would not have recoiled and
would have required running in by hand.
                                                                I
     The answer to that is already in your possession, but will repeat
it. The gun is run in without manual labour, and by hydraulic
 power. Even when the gun is fired the recoil is not sufficient to send
it in to the required extent and has to be supplemented by the hy
 draulic pressure which is applied immediately the explosion is heard.
     Direct experiment shows that in from 4 to 6 seconds the
 hydraulic pressure alone will bring the gun in as far as the recoil

or by the hydraulic.   Thus all three grounds for the " impossible "
fail. Simultaneous electric firing makes an end of the information to
be given by the noise of the explosion  telescopic rammers, of the in

source of information nugatory.
         Just   a   few words about other suggested causes.
   First, and most important, that the gun was inherently too weak.
I will not trouble you with the calculation which proves that                               it   is
abundantly strong, not only to bear a charge of 85 lbs. of pebble
powder, but to bear far greater charges, but        will ask you to consider
                                                                     I
facts.   The  fellow  gun has fired  precisely the  same number of rounds,
and     unstrained.
         is            The two 35-ton guns, which         have told you areI
the same as the 38 only shorter, have also fired the same number of
rounds, and with the same result.        At the time of the explosion there
were many guns identical with the exploded gun, with the important
exception that they were bored to 12\ inches instead of to 12 inches, and
that therefore they were subjected to greater total pressure, and that
they had less metal to resist it. These guns had each been proved with
at least two rounds of 150 lbs. of P3 powder, and at least 130 lbs. of
similar powder, the projectilo used weighing over 800 lbs. One gun,
No.    had fired 271 rounds varying from 130 lbs. to 170 lbs. of powder,
         1,
with an 800-lb. projectile; another gun, 217 rounds of the same
character as those last mentioned        and another gun, an experimental

powder.    Since the explosion, the Dreadnought's          four 38-ton guns

                                                  is

                                   is   to say that the other guns in the
ship had had an exactly similar service and are uninjured, and that
there     not an appearance of the commencement of
              is                                               crack in that        a

    Then it is said the materials might have been bad, or the work
manship might have been faulty.            The answer to this is that we have
tried samples cut out of the very gun itself, and notwithstanding these
samples have been taken from pieces of metal which have been so
much strained all over as to have been torn asunder in many places,
the intervening metal from which we cut our samples, which must
have been equally strained, afforded good results.                 Moreover, the
splinters of the tube must have been extremely tough, for they exhibit
an extension equal to about        li    inch in the whole circumference of
the tube.     With respect to the workmanship, it was excellent, as any
one may see by examining the remains.
     Next it is said that the projectile was wedged by a stud, or by the
wad — a papier-mache wad, as             I  have told you.        The navy, and
indeed the land service, have for years used hard wedge wads rammed
in between the shot and the tube, and nobody ever suggested that
evil resulted from this practice. With respect to the stud, if that bo
the cause, why are not guns repeatedly burst ? and how is a stud to
become detached from one of these shells ?                   I
                                                           must confess      I

conceive the possibility of it. Moreover, and this is the true answer
to all the foregoing suggestions, and to the final suggestion, which                 I
will deal with presently, none of these supposed causes could have
produced an explosion in front of the projectile, and nothing but an
explosion in front of the projectile can account for the appearances
presented by the remains of the gun.

     You probably are all acquainted with the principle of the Mon-
golfier water ram, where the sudden arresting of column of water in
                                                                 a
motion causes an intensity of pressure which drives                portion of the

water up to    a   much greater height than that which had produced
the movement of the column.            Similarly, to state      very familiarly,
                                                                  it                 a

distance away from the cartridge, and then that cartridge to be
fired.   The powder, as we know, weighs probably from                       | to     ^
of the weight of the projectile itself. And that the powder, or the gases
arising from   it, being in motion and suddenly arrested by the projectile,
might produce      a  pressure immediately at the base of the projectile
greater   than   that  which would have prevailed              the projectile had
                                                                 if

to depend on, but has also the support of the metal on each side of
it, which metal at the sides is not similarly strained. Obviously the
metal in advance of the base of the shot is not exposed to pressure
at all.    I  wish time admitted of my describing to you certain
experiments   I made as long back as the year 1870 on the " Contre-
vapeur" break, in which        I  succeeded    in obtaining by this ram
principle  a  much    higher pressure    of steam   in the cylinders of a
locomotive engine than was at the time prevailing in the boiler ;
but  I must content myself by referring those who may be interested
in pursuing this subject to the volume for the year 1870 of the
'
  Transactions of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers."
     Further, with regard to this question of air space, it is well known
that a sporting gun may be burst by the muzzle being choked with
snow or with dirt when it is fired. The explanation of this is simple.
The bullet, at the time it reaches the neighbourhood of the muzzle,
has attained great velocity, and the pressure required to set even such
light weights as snow or a little earth practically instantaneously into
motion as rapid as that of the bullet, is sufficient to force these
materials out sideways, and to produce a burst in the same way as
the resistance offered by water to the sotting up of sudden great
velocity is sufficient to cause a shot to ricochet.
     The best illustration of the way in which a bullet striking a soft
obstacle near the muzzle, would act on that obstacle is, probably,
to imagine a diaphragm of water extended across the barrel of a
musket. One then has no difficulty in seeing that the intense pressure
set up on such a diaphragm must be communicated to the side of the
barrel.   Again, in a musket the bulging may be due to the expansion
of the projectile itself when striking a foreign object placed in its
way. And     I  may tell you that Captain Noble has experimented, by
putting a wax wad near the muzzle of a musket, the wad being equal
in weight to the projectile itself, and that on firing, this obstacle was
expanded and bulged, and split the barrel.       Ho then placed the pro
jectile near the muzzle, and fired the wax wad: a similar result
ensued.    Finally, on this subject       I will ask your attention to
Diagram 18, which shows the experiments as to air spaces made by
Captain Noble in a 10-inch gun, having a 12-inch powder chamber,
and with the following results :—
     The powder used in the first experiment was pebble powder, and
occupying such a space as would give a pressure of about 20 tons to
the square inch, and would impart to a 400-lb. projectile a muzzle
velocity of 1487 feet per second.     A crusher gauge was placed in the
bottom of the bore of the gun, and three such gauges were fixed in
the base of the projectile ; one as near as possible to its top, one in its
centre, and one near the bottom ; these gauges had been previously
compressed so as not to move unless a pressure exceeding 10 tons per
square inch came upon them.           The projectile was placed 2 feet
away from the cartridge, that is to say, there was a 2-feet air space ;
as the result, the velocity was only 1240 feet per second instead of the

248                            Mr.  F. J. Bramwett                [June   13,
14:87, showing that the mean pressure must have been only 76 per cent,
of that which would have prevailed if no air space had been left ;
and further, so far from the maximum pressure having been even
locally increased, at the bottom of the bore of the gun it was but
11 • 7 tons, while at the base of the projectile it could not have
amounted to 10 tons on the square inch, as none of these three gauges
had moved.
     In the next experiment the air space was as much as 4 feet ; the
muzzle velocity was only 1067 feet, instead of the 1487, showing
that the average pressure was only 68J per cent, of that which would
have prevailed without an air space.
     In this experiment the crusher gauge in the bottom of the bore
and that in the centre of the base of the projectile had been previously
subjected to 10 tons pressure, while the gauges at the top and
bottom were left in their natural condition.       The pressures recorded
were, at the bottom of the bore 10 • 1 5 tons ; at the top of the projectile
7 • 6 tons ; at the bottom 6 tons, and at the centre something below
10 tons, as the gauge was not affected.
     These two experiments having totally failed to set up a local
pressure, the next experiment was made not with pebble powder but
with the rifle large grain. The air space was again 4 feet ; on this
occasion the pressure at the bottom of the bore was 16 • 7 tons upon
the square inch ; on the top gauge in the projectile was 25 • 5 tons ; in
the centre of the projectile was 35 • 3 tons ; and at the bottom was 23 • 3
tons ; while with this powder had the gun been fired without an air
space the pressures would have been from 27 to 30 tons.            In these
experiments no wad was used, and it was determined to make others
with a disc wad.          In the first instance 85 Ibs. of pebble powder
being employed,        and   a 6-feet air space being left, the wad being
close     to  the   projectile, the muzzle velocity was 849 feet, the
pressure     at the bottom of the bore under 10 tons, in the base of the
                       8 tons, in the centre 5 6 tons, and at the bottom
                                                 •
shot   at  top  under
nnder 8 tons. The last experiment consisted in leaving a 2-feet air
space between the cartridge and projectile, and a 4-feet air space be
tween the projectile and the canted disc wad, while the muzzle velocity
was 1208 feet as compared with the 1240 feet of the previous experi
ment with the 2-feet space ; the pressure at the bottom of the bore was
11-1 tons as compared with 11-7 on the former occasion; while the
pressure at the top of the base of the projectile was 7 9 tons, at its
                                                              •
                 •                             •
centre was 9 2 tons, and at its bottom 8 4 tons on the square inch.
During the previous experiment it will be remembered that the gauges
having been adjusted for 10 tons afforded no other information than
that that pressure had not been reached.
    I  think these results sufficiently show that no harm would ensue
from pebble powder, even if air spaces had existed, but there was abun
                                                     '

this proof. But once more, let me remind you that an explosion of

the gun from an air space would not have occurred 4 to 5 feet in
front of the projectile.
     I will now leave this subject of other suggested causes, and will,
without pausing to describe them, merely remark that precautions
have been proposed by the Committee, which, if adopted, would
render double-loading in future practically impossible.          I  will also
refer you to Diagram 19, which exhibits the improved construction
of the rammer indicator on board the ' Dreadnought.'
     In conclusion, let me say that the fellow 38-ton gun being, as you
know, in England,     I do hope the authorities will accede to the recom
mendation of the Committee, will try that gun with air spaces, and in
any other way that anyone can reasonably suggest as having any real
 connection with the ' Thunderer

 then  this  gun will  be double-loaded   and fired.   I  do not think that
ench a trial is needed to give confidence to the service at large ; it
certainly is not needed to give confidence to those who are best able to
 form an opinion — witness the attendance at the working of the self
 same kind of guns the other day on board the ' Dreadnought — but
                                                                       '
I  believe such an experiment with the fellow gun would be the most
 ready and most efficacious mode of satisfying the general public, who
 have not the means of investigating the question, or of coming to a
 right judgment upon it.

                    Investigations at High Temperatures.
I INTEND   to discuss on the present occasion the results of a preliminary
study of the chemical interactions taking place at the temperature of
the electric arc, and the inferences which can be deduced from a series
of radiation experiments as to the probable temperature of this source
of heat.
       On the Formation       of Hydrocyanic Acid in      the Electric Arc.
     The conclusion that the so-called carbon spectrum is invariably
associated with the formation of acetylene,* induced me to try and
ascertain whether this substance can be extracted from the electric
arc, which invariably shows this peculiar spectrum at the positive
pole, when it is powerful and occasionally intermittent.                For this
purpose the carbons were used in the form of tubes, as shown in the
following figure, so that a current of air could be drawn by means of
an aspirator through either pole, and the products thus extracted
from the arc, collected in water, alkalies, and other absorbents. Gases
may bo led through one of the poles, and suction induced through the
other, in order to examine their effect on the arc and the products
obtained from it.
     The following results were obtained by means of the Siemens and
De Meritens magneto-machines, recently presented to the Royal Insti
tution through tlf.: munificence of the Duke of Northumberland and
Mr. Siemens : —
     Air drawn by an aspirator from the arc through a drilled negative
carbon, and the gases passed through potash, iodide of potassium, and
               * As              by Pliicker, Angstrom, and Thale'n.

starch paste, gave no reaction for the presence of nitrites. The potash
contained sulphides.
    Hydrogen led in through the positive pole, and the gases extracted
as above gave the well-known acetylene compound with ammoniacal
sub-chloride of copper ; while, at the same time, a wash-bottle con
taining water gave distinct evidence of the presence of hydrocyanic
acid.
                                  Fig. 1.
    A  hydrogen flame burning between the carbon poles gave no sul
phides or hydrocyanic acid, when treated in the above manner. The
condensed water from the combustion gave the reaction for nitrites.
    Air drawn through the negative carbon gave considerable quanti
ties of hydrocyanic acid, which was greatly increased by extracting
the gases through the positive carbon.     Air was aspirated at the rate
of about one litre per minute.
    The same carbons used with the long arc of the De Meritens
magneto-machine gave no hydrocyanic acid.
    Carbons purified in chlorine and hydrogen gave with De Meritens'
arc nothing ; with Siemens' and a draught of air through the negative
pole, a small quantity of hydrocyanic acid, but a larger yield when
the positive pole was used.    The gases extracted from the arc after
the absorption of the hydrocyanio acid contained acetylene. If the
carbons are not purified, sulphuretted hydrogen is always found along
with the other gases.
    The inference drawn from the above experiments is that the high
temperature of the positive pole is required to produce the reaction,
which is in all probability the result of acetylene reacting with free

1880.]            on  Investigations at High Temperatures.               259
nitrogen, as when induction         sparks are passed   through the mixed
eases, viz. : —
and that the hydrogen is obtained from the decomposition of aqueous
vapour, and the combined hydrogen in the carbons. It is possible
that traces of alkaline salts in the carbon poles may favour the forma
tion of hydrocyanic acid, but, as all attempts to purify the poles so as
to stop the reaction failed,      I  am inclined to believe it is a direct
synthesis.    The acetylene reaction is one of the many remarkable
syntheses discovered by Professor Berthelot, of Paris.        The presence
of sulphuretted hydrogen is doubtless due to the reduction of the
sulphates, invariably present in the ash of the carbon.
     The discovery of the formation of hydrocyanic acid in the electric
arc necessitated a more complete examination of the various reactions
taking place in the arc with poles of various kinds, and in presence of
different gaseous media.
     Various difficulties have impeded the satisfactory progress of the
investigation.    During the course, however, of numerous experiments,
facts of interest have been recorded which are worthy of appearing as
preliminary results in a very extensive and difficult research.
                     Formation of Cyanogen Compounds.
     The influence of impurities in the carbon on the production of
hydrocyanic acid had first to be ascertained.      For this purpose, drilled
Siemens' carbons were placed in a porcelain tube, and treated for
several days at a white heat with a rapid stream of chlorine, until the
greater part of the silica, oxide of iron, alumina, &c., were volatilized
in the form of chlorides.        Sometimes the carbons had a subsequent
treatment with hydrogen, or were directly treated with a current of
chlorine while the arc was in operation.
     Carbons treated in this way continued to yield hydrocyanic acid,
when a steady current of air was drawn through the positive pole
as formerly described, even when the same pole had several succes
sive treatments with chlorine during the electric discharge.       Natural
graphite poles gave     the same  result.
     As it was evident that the elimination of a large portion of the
impurities had little influence on the production of the hydrocyanic
acid, the only other explanation of its formation appeared to be the
presence of aqueous vapour, and organic impurities in the air, or a
direct formation of cyanogen from carbon and nitrogen through the
acetylene reaction formerly described. To obtain a pure and dry
atmosphere in which such experiments could be carried out, the follow
ing apparatus was employed : —
     A tin vessel, Fig. 2, about 2 feet high and 1 foot in diameter, had
an annular space, through which a constant stream of water was kept
flowing.    This cylinder was placed upon a porcelain stand, having a
narrow groove filled with mercury, so as to make an air-tight joint.
                                                                T 2

260                       Professor Deicar                   [Jan.   16,
The lamp   was placed inside this vessel, the wires connecting it with
the machine being brought through the bottom of the stand. A tube
passed through the porcelain base, which allowed a current of dry air
to be forced through the vessel.    A small aperture in the top of the
tin vessel allowed the glass tube coming from the positive pole to pass
with little friction, through which the products from the arc were
drawn.    This annular vessel was very convenient, not only for exa
mining the products formed in the arc, but also those formed outside
of    it,
       and the water flowing round        served the double purpose of
                                         it
keeping     cool and enabling
            it                a  determination of the amount of total
radiation in heat units to be made.
                                  FIG.   2.
    Vessels containing pumice moistened with sulphuric acid and
phosphoric anhydride were placed inside the cylinder in order to dry
the interior as completely as possible.
    Numerous experiments made by forcing perfectly dry air into the
vessel through the tube A, and drawing      out by the tube
                                              it            B  through
a weighed sulphuric acid bulb, gave after an hour    a  few milligrams
of increase, owing, no doubt, to some slight defect in the soldering of

1880.]              on Investigations at   High   Temperatures.               261
the tin, which allowed a capillary film of water to cover part of the
surface and diffuse into the interior.
      When the ordinary Siemens' carbons were used as poles in this
almost dry atmosphere, the yield of hydrocyanic acid was still very
marked, purified carbons yielding the same results.
      As the yield of cyanogen compounds did not appear to be dimi
nished, and it seemed almost impossible to get the large volume of
air in the tin vessel perfectly dry, another plan was adopted.                The
poles were enclosed in an egg-shaped glass globe about 8 inches long
and 6 inches in diameter, in order to diminish the volume of air to be
dried and dispense with the water covering.               The globe, balanced
through a system of pulleys, was firmly attached to the lower or nega
tive pole, with which it moved without impeding the automatic action
of the lamp.
      Dry air was sometimes forced through the negative carbon itself,
at other times through a glass tube passing up the side of it into the
globe, the products from the arc being drawn through the positive
pole as before.
      As the glass globe soon became very hot, and as a far larger
supply of dry air was forced through the globe than was drawn out
from the arc, it is inconceivable that any moisture could remain near
the arc after it had been in operation for a few minutes.
     Seven consecutive experiments, each of ten minutes' duration,
made with the same purified carbon poles, did not show any diminu
tion in the quantity of hydrocyanic acid, unless in one of the experi
ments, when the arc would not be drawn into the interior of the carbon

      These experiments show that drilled carbons even after prolonged
treatment with chlorine, still contained a quantity of combined
hydrogen, and organic analyses showed that the amount of ash and
combined hydrogen in the various samples was never less than about
                                                •
0 • 75 of the former, and as much as 0 1 of the latter.               Poles made
with especially purified carbon by Messrs. Siemens for these experi
ments proved to be no better in respect to the quantity of hydrogen
and ash they contained.
      The well-nigh impossible problem of eliminating hydrogen from
masses of carbon such as can be employed in experiments of this kind,
proves conclusively that the inference drawn by Mr. Lockyer,f as to
the elementary character of the so-called carbon spectrum from an
examination of the arc in dry chlorine, cannot be regarded as satis
factory, seeing that undoubtedly hydrogen was present in the carbon,
and in all probability nitrogen in the chlorine.
    * Cyanogen is difficult to recognize in presence of pruasio acid when in email
quantity, especially when imparities from the carbons complicate the tests.
In speaking generally of the formation of this acid in the arc,     I do not mean
to exclude the possibility of cyanogen being formed as well.

                      Experiments with Carbon Tubes.
     In order to ascertain whether the formation of hydrocyanic acid
and acetylene in the arc was really due to transformations induced by
some occult power located in the arc, or was simply the result of the
high temperature attained by the carbons, experiments were made
in carbon tubes, the arc being merely used as a means of heating.
The method of arranging the arc for this experiment is represented
in Fig.  8.
                                  Fig. 3.
     A block of lime about 5 inches long by 3 inches thick was drilled
horizontally, as shown in the drawing, another hole being drilled bo
as to meet it in the contro of the mass.
     The new bricks used in the Bessemer converters do very well for
all the experiments of this description.
     A drilled purified carbon was placed in the horizontal channel and
made the positive pole, the negative pole being a solid rod of carbon
passing through the vertical aperture.      Gases were passed through
the positive carbon, and were thus subjected to the intense heat of the
walls of the tube, the arc passing outside.
     The walls of the positive carbon were pierced by the arc with
great rapidity, not lasting, as a rule, more than fifteen minutes. This
action could only be retarded by using thicker carbons, or by rotating
the tube.
     The porosity of the carbons, which allowed a constant diffusion of
gases through   their walls, was a great source of difficulty.
     In order to prove that the temperature in the interior of the
carbon tube is higher than that of the oxyhydrogen flame, it is suffi
cient to place in it a few small crystals of diamond, and to maintain
a current of hydrogen to prevent oxidation.      In a few minutes the
diamond is transformed into coke.
     On passing a mixture of three volumes hydrogen and one volume
nitrogen thoroughly dried through the positive pole, a large yield of
hydrocyanic acid was always obtained, and on using equal volumes
of hydrogen and nitrogen the quantity was, if anything, increased.
     Pure dry hydrogen by itself gave a trace of hydrocyanic acid, and
a considerable quantity of acotylene.

       Pure dry air gave no hydrocyanic acid or acetylene ; moist air, on
 the contrary, giving abundance of the former, but only a trace of the
 latter.
       The yield in all these experiments altered considerably with the
 rate at which the gases were passed, a quick stream always producing
 more than a slow one, unless when oxygen was present.
                        Formation       of Nitrites in      the   Arc.
       In these experiments the annular vessel was made use of, in which
 the lamp      was allowed to work automatically, often for an hour or
 two. A continuous stream of dry air was kept circulating through
 the interior, being afterwards passed through a series of wash bottles
containing dilute caustic soda, or directly through strong sulphuric
acid, to absorb the oxides of nitrogen.                    The nitrous acid was esti
mated in the former case by titratiou with permanganate of potash,
and the total combined nitrogen by the mercury process.
       In this way many experiments were made with a Siemens lamp,
both with a long and short arc; Jablochkoff's candles without any
insulating material between the poles were also employed with the
highest intensity current of a De Meritens machine, in order to have
the greatest variety in the character of the discharge.
      The stream of dry air was forced through the vessel at varying
degrees of speed, and was found to have a decided effect on the
quantity of nitrites produced, the more rapid stream giving the largest
yield of nitrites.

in a number of different experiments.

      In
       theso experiments, the total nitrogen estimated by the mercury
process was almost identically the same as the amount of nitrogen
obtained by a very careful dilution of the acid in a large quantity of
water and titration with permanganate, proving that the main product
was nitrous anhydride, which may be erplained by the fact that the
quantity of oxygon in presence of nitrogen in the immediate neigh
bourhood of the poles is greatly diminished by the combustion of the
carbons, or that the nitric peroxide formed is subsequently reduced
by contact with the red hot carbon, or other reducing products.
    It is thus proved the carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen being
present at the temperature of the electric arc, the compound sub
stances hydrocyanic acid, acetylene, and nitrous acid are invariably
formed.
                         Radiation Experiments.
      In   a report to the   British Association * on the determination of
high temperatures in the year 1873, it was experimentally proved
that the law of Dulong and Petit could not be used as a basis for the
estimation of high temperatures, seeing that it " gives a far too rapid
increase for the total radiation." It was further observed that the value
of the radiation emitted by the same substance at different temperatures
expressed in terms of the thermo-electric current increase of intensity,
                                                      "
plotted in terms of the temperature, represented a parabolic curve."
Assuming the general accuracy of this law for high temperatures, the
total radiation may be taken as nearly proportional to the square of
the temperature.     From this law the hypothetical temperature of the
sun was " estimated as at least 11,000 C." Eosetti has recently made
a more elaborate investigation on the subject, and has arrived inde
pendently at a formula of a parabolic order. Bosetti f represents his
results by the equation —
                           n =   oT'(T- 8)-&(T-S),
where      //. the total radiation measured by intensity of thermo
                 is
electric current, T° the absolute temperature of the source, 0° that of
the medium surrounding the pile, and a and           constants. However

ments,     it certain that his results for temperatures above 150° may

     If   the differences in the galvanometer readings for every ten
degrees in the first table be tabulated, it will be observed the second
difference may be regarded as constant, considering the errors of this
kind of observation. A parabolic formula can therefore represent the
results with sufficient accuracy.      These second differences are far more
constant than similar numbers deduced from Bosetti's observations,
and his moro complete formula in terms of the absolute temperature
is too extensive, considering the range of the experiments where tem
perature was accurately known.           The results of Table II. extend to
the boiling points of mercury and sulphur, and the numbers are in near
accord with the simple square of the temperature.              The alteration in
the condition of the radiating surface at high temperatures causes
great complications, and until this difficulty is overcome, experiments
at high temperatures must remain uncertain.              All the experiments
show that for an approach to a knowledge of temperatures beyond the
range of our actual thermometric scale, the law given in 1873 is a
sufficiently correct reproduction of the facts, considering the limited
data at our disposal.
     The intensity of the radiation of the positive pole of the Siemens'
arc, as compared with the same surface heated with a largo oxy-
hydrogen blowpipe, was determined by employing a hollow nogative
carbon which allowed the intensely heated surface to radiate directly
on to the pile, as shown in Fig. 4. A large number of observations

1880.1          on Investigations at  High  Temperatures.             267
have been made by this method at different times, and with slight
modifications in the order of the experiments, leading to the average
result that the intensity of the total radiation of the positive pole of
the Siemens' arc is ten times that of the same substance at the tempe
rature of the oxyhydrogen flame.     If we take an average result of nine
to one, then we may infer that the temperature of the limiting positive
pole is about 6000° C., seeing that the mean temperature of the oxy
hydrogen may be taken as 2000° C. • The mean value of the total
radiation of the Siemens' arc was determined by observing the rate of
flow of the water through the annular vessel, represented in Fig. 1,
together with the mean increment of temperature.        This gave on the
average 34,000 gram-units per minute, or a little more than three
horse-power.

         Land and Sea    considered  in relation to Geological Time.
WHEN, in the summer of 1871,        I placed before the First Lord of the
                                                                '
Admiralty (Mr. Goschen) the scheme of the ' Challenger Expedition,
I ventured to say that     " the key to the interpretation of much of the
past history  of our   globe is at present lying at the bottom of the sea,
waiting only    to  be  brought up."      This prediction has been most
fully verified ; but, as in the case of many another prophecy, in a
sense very different from that in which it was uttered.
    The first of the general objects specified in my programme was
" the determination of the Physical condition of the Deep Sea in the
great Ocean Basins, as to depth, temperature, composition, and move
ment," carrying out, over the Oceanic area generally, the inquiry
which had been inaugurated by my colleagues and myself on the
eastern margin of the North Atlantic.           This object has been most
successfully accomplished, by a series of observations taken along
well-selected lines in the North and South Atlantic, the North and
South Pacific, the Southern and Antarctic Oceans ; which, combined
with the observations taken in the recent Arctic expeditions — British,
German, and Norwegian — afford a body of information as to the
Physics of the Ocean, 'sufficiently complete to afford a safe basis for the
scientific discussion of the remarkable phenomena now for the first
time brought into clear view.
    The second of the general objects which        I specified was the deter
mination of " the distribution of Animal Life on the Deep-sea bottom,
and the relation of the Deep-sea Fauna to that of past Geological
epochs." The inquiries previously carried out by my colleagues
and myself had shown (1) that there is probably no limit to the depth
at which Animal life can exist on the ocean-bed — a Fauna containing
representatives of all the principal types of marine Invertebrates,
having been found nearly three miles beneath the surface; (2) that
temperature exerts a most important influence on the distribution of
animal life on the sea-bottom ; and (3) that many of the forms now

 1880.]       on Land and Sea in relation  to Geological Time.         269
 existing on the deep-sea bed so nearly represent Cretaceous types
 supposed to have long since become extinct, that we may fairly
 suppose them to be their lineal descendants.        Hence,  I  went on to
       " the question of the continuity of ' descent with modification '
 say,
 will probably receive more elucidation from the study of the Deep-sea
 Fauna, than from any other line of scientific inquiry."              This
 anticipation, also, is in course of complete fulfilment.    An enormous
 amount of Zoological material has been carefully collected from
 various parts of the great Oceanic area, and at depths ranging down
 wards to from three to five miles ; and this is being studied, with a
 view to all the determinations   I have indicated, by Naturalists of the
 highest competency in their respective departments.       The results of
 this part of the inquiry have so far been only disappointing to those
 who had somewhat unreasonably expected that, because Cretaceous
 types had been found still living in the deep seas of our part of the
 globe, the Ammonites of the Secondary period, and even the Trilobites
 of the Palaeozoic, might be lurking in abyssal depths elsewhere, — an
 expectation which    I never myself shared.
      But whilst the past history of Animal Life on our globe will
 doubtless receive all the new light which     I had anticipated from the
 scientific study of the 'Challenger' collection, au unexpected clue
 has been found in the examination of the sediments now in process
 of deposition on the Ocean-bottom, to the solution of a question in
 Physical Geology, second to none in importance and interest, which      I
propose now to bring before you.
      Every tyro in Geology knows it to be a fact not admitting of a
doubt, that all our existing Land has at some period or other been
under the sea ; and the converse proposition — that every part of the
Sea-bottom has at some period or other risen above the surface —
has been very generally accepted, even by geologists of the highest
eminence.     Thus Sir Charles Lyell, in his chapters on the vicissitudes
in Climate caused by geographical changes, assumed it as a fact
beyond dispute, not only " that every part of the space now covered by
the deepest ocean has been land," but oven that " the bed of the ocean
                                                               "
has been lifted up to the height of the loftiest mountains ; and con
                          "
sidered it proved that if we had a series of maps, in which restora
tions of the physical geography of thirty or more periods were de
picted, they would probably bear no more resemblance to each other,
or to the actual position of land and sea, than docs the map of one
hemisphere bear to that of the other." — These statements,         I  may
remark, are repeated without any qualification in the twelfth chapter
of the latest edition of his masterly ' Principles ' ; notwithstanding
that towards tho conclusion of the same chapter, he distinctly recog
nized the enormous disproportion between the average elevation of
the Land and the average depth of the Ocean-basins, whereby, while a
vertical depression of 1000 feet would submerge a large part of the
present continental land, a vertical elevation of from twelve to fifteen

  270                     Dr. William B. Carpenter                [Jan. 23,
  times that amount would be required to raise any large areas of the
  ocean-bed above the existing sea-level.
       Many Geologists who would not accept in all their fulness Sir O.
  Lyell's rather sweeping assertions, seem by their language to imply
  their belief in less extensive interchanges between Land and Sea ; in
  fact, I think a general belief has been entertained of a sort of see-saw
  movement in the Earth's crust, — one portion going up while another
  goes down, — which has seemed to draw confirmation            from Mr.
  Darwin's admirable researches on Coral Islands.
       Some of the ablest among living Geologists, on the other hand,
  have been led by the convergence of several independent lines of
  inquiry — of which it is my purpose to give you a concise sketch — to
  a belief in the permanence, throughout all geological time, of what may
  be called the framework of the existing Continents, on the one hand,
  and of the real Oceanic basins on the other. According to this view,
  the repeated changes which havo unquestionably occurred at various
  periods in the distribution of sea and land, have been generally pro
  duced by elevations and subsidences, for the most part of very mode
  rate amount, in portions of elevated areas in the original crust of
  the earth, which occupied the general position of our existing Conti
 nents ; the upheaval of lofty mountain-chains, and the formation of
 very deep local troughs, in which long successions of sedimentary
 deposits have been formed, having taken place in parts of those
 originally elevated areas, especially near their margins.        The far
 larger Oceanic basins on this view, occupy areas of the crust which
 were originally depressed by an abrupt border, many thousands of feet
 beneath the continental platforms ; and, like them, had a nearly
 uniform level, until disturbed by local upheavals and depressions
 occasioned by forces subsequently generated during the progressive
 contraction of the molten sphere within — these upheavals and depres
 sions, when considerable vertically, being usually limited in area, and
 only breaking the general uniformity of bottom-level as the elevation
 of the Ural chain interrupts the uniformity of the great plain of
 north-east Europe and northern Asia.

      I. Now the first consideration to which would draw your atten
 tion, is the enormous disproportion which we now know to exist
between the depth of the real Ocean-floors beneath the sea-level,
and the height of the Land elevated above it ; which, when taken in
connection with the relative areas of the existing Sea and Land,
seems to render it highly improbable that interchanges extending
over large portions of the earth's surface could ever have taken place
between them. — The proportion which the area of the existing Land
bears to that of the Sea may be conveniently stated as about 1 to 2j,
or as 4 : 11 ; so that, if the entire surface of the globe were divided,
into fifteen equal parts, the Land would occupy only four of these, or
rather more than a quarter, whilst the Sea would cover eleven, or
rather less than three-quarters.     But when we compare the volume of

the Land above the sea-level with that of the Water which occupies
the Ocean-basins, a far greater disproportion shows itself. For the
average elevation of the whole Land of the globe certainly does not
exceed 1000 feet; — that of Asia and Africa being somewhat above
that amount, while that of America (North and South), Europe, and
Australia is considerably below it. On the other hand, the average
depth of the Ocean-basins is now known to be rather over than under
2£ miles, and may be taken (for the convenience of a round number)
at 13,000 feet.       Thus the average depth of the ocean being thirteen
times as much as the average height of the land, and the area of the
sea being 2, times that of the land, the total volume of the Ocean-water
 is just thirty-six times that of the Land above the sea-level.
      The Northern hemisphere is pre-eminently the land hemisphere,
and the Southern the water hemisphere ; and the distribution of the
 two components of their respective surfaces, so far from being
 " capricious " (Lyell), is found to have a remarkable symmetry. It
 is between lat. 30° and 70° that Water most predominates in the Southern
 hemisphere ; the Southern Ocean forming a continuous girdle around
 it between Cape Horn, Int. 56° 8., and the Antarctic continental
 platform.     On the other hand, it is between lat. 30° and 70° that
 Land most predominates in the Northern hemisphere, girdling nine-
 tenths of its circumference between lat. 60° N. and the Arctic
 Ocean.
      The great land-masses of the Northern hemisphere send down
 three extensions into the Southern, viz. South Africa, South America,
 and the Fapuo-Australian continent ; which last may be considered as
 the southward extension of the Asiatic, being connected with it by a
 nearly continuous though partly submerged continental platform, of
 which the peninsula and archipelago of Malaya are the most elevated
 portions.     It is further remarkable that each of these southward
 extensions is almost entirely detached from its northern land-mass
 by an intervening sea ; — South from North America by the Gulf of
 Mexico and Caribbean Sea ; Africa from Europe and Asia by the
 Mediterranean and Red Seas ; and the Malayan continental platform
  from south-east Asia by the shallow Yellow Sea, and by those smaller
  seas, some of them remarkable for their depth, that lie among the great
 islands of the Malay Archipelago— the interruption in each case coin
 ciding with an area of great Volcanic activity.
      On the other hand, the vast Oceanic area of the Southern hemi
 sphere sends three great extensions northwards ; the Pacific, the
  Atlantic, and the Indian Oceans, of which the two former are pro
 longed as far as the North Polar area.
      But the existing borders of these Oceans by no means correspond
 with the borders of their real basins. The deep-sea soundings of the
                   have brought out this remarkable fact — that the ocean-
 '               '
    Challenger
 floors present a uniformity of level which corresponds with that of
 our most level and extensive Continental plains ; so that in long
 section-lines the differences of depth (when represented on true pro

portional scale*) show themselves — except in cases of local dis
turbance — as undulations of scarcely perceptible gradient.
     Again, we now know that the borders of these vast depressed
areas are generally, if not uniformly, very abrupt ; the sudden descent
from a comparatively shallow bottom to a very deep one, which was
first noticed in the line of soundings taken with a view to the laying
of the Atlantic Telegraph cable, being not an exceptional but a
general fact. Taking this as the real border of the North Atlantic
Ocean, and looking to the smallness of the gradients presented by its
sea-bed (except in the volcanic area of the Azores) until we come
upon the like steep inclination at some distance from the American
coast-line, which obviously marks the true western border of the
oceanic area, we see that the term "basin "is a misleading one ; a
far truer representation of the Atlantic depression being a flat
" waiter " with elevated sides, having an upward bulge along the
median line of its bottom. On this view, the shallow band which
generally intervenes between the edge of a deep Oceanic depression
and the ostensible coast-line, is really to be regarded as a submerged
portion of the adjacent Continental platform.
     The contrast between the real and the ostensible borders of the
Ocean-basins is nowhere more remarkably exhibited than in the seas
which girdle the British Islands.         These are all so shallow, that their
bed is undoubtedly to be regarded as a continuation of the European
Continental platform; an elevation of the north-western corner of
which, to the amount of only 100 fathoms, would reunite Great
Britain to Denmark, Holland, Belgium, and France, and wonld bring
it into continuity with Ireland, the Hebrides, and the Shetland and
Orkney Islands.      Not only would the whole of the British Channel
be laid dry by such an elevation, but the whole of the North Sea also,
with the exception of a narrow deeper channel that lies outside the
fiords of Norway. Again, the coast-line of Ireland would be extended
seawards to about 100 miles west of Galway, and that of the
Western Hebrides to beyond St. Kilda ; while a little further west, the
sea-bed shows the abrupt depression already spoken of as marking the
commencement of the real Atlantic area.              A like rapid descent has
 been traced outside the 100-fathom line in the Bay of Biscay (a con
siderable part of which would be converted into dry land by an
elevation of that amount), and along the western coast of Spain and
 Portugal, where, however, it takes place much nearer the existing
                                                                  '
land-border.    The soundings of the U.S.S. ' Tuscarora in the North
 Pacific, have shown that a like condition exists along the western
 coast of North America : a submerged portion of its Continental
platform, covered by comparatively shallow water, forming a belt of
variable breadth outside the existing coast-line ; and the sea-bed then
descending so rapidly as distinctly to mark the real border of the

 vast Pacific depression.      And as similar features present themselves
 elsewhere, it may be stated as a general fact that the great Continental
platforms usually rise very abruptly from the margins of the real Oceanic
 depressed areas.
     If,  on the other hand, we inquire what would be the effect of a
 depression of the existing Land of northern Europe to the same, or
 even half that amount, we find that very extensive areas of what is
 now dry land would be overflowed by sea ; the higher tracts and
 mountainous regions alone remaining as representatives of the Conti
 nental platform, to which, nevertheless, the submerged portions equally
 belong.     This, as every geologist knows, has been, not once only, but
 many times, the former condition of Europe; to which a singular
 parallelism now shows itself in that great Continental platform, of
 which the peninsula and islands of Malaya are the most elevated
portions.     For the Yellow Sea, which forms the existing boundary of
south-eastern Asia, is everywhere so shallow, that an elevation of 100
fathoms would convert it into land ; while half that elevation would
lay dry many of the channels between the Malay Islands, so as to
bring them into continuity not only with each other, but with tho
continent of Asia. And Mr. Wallace's admirable researches on the
zoology of this region have shown that such continuity undoubtedly
existed at no remote period ; its Mammalian fauna being essentially
Asiatic. On the other hand, a like elevation would bring Papua into
land-continuity with Australia; with which, in like manner, the
intimacy of its zoological relations shows it to have been in former
connection.      The Indo-Malay province is separated from the Papuo-
Australian province by a strait, which, though narrow, is so much
deeper than the channels which intervene between the separate
members of either group, that it would still remain as a fissure of
considerable depth, even if the elevation of the two parts of the great
area it divides were sufficient to raise each into dry land.                The
Malay an land-area would, however, be still broken by small Inland Seas
of extraordinary depth. One of these, known as the Snlu Sea, which
lies between the north-west coast of Borneo and the Philippines, and
is elsewhere enclosed by smaller islands and reefs connecting them,
ranges downwards to 2225 fathoms. Another, the Celebes Sea, which
lies to the west of Borneo between Mindinao and Celebes, has a depth
of 2050 fathoms.          And the Banda Sea, which lies between the
southern part of Celebes and New Guinea, with the islands of Ceram
on the north and Timor to the south, has the still more extraordinary
depth of 2800 fathoms. A general elevation of a few hundred fathoms
would detach these Seas from the two great Oceanic areas which they
now help to connect * ; and yet they would still remain by far the
    * The depth down to which each of them communicates with the Ocean out-
Bide, is determinable by its correspondence  in temperature. Below the plane of
continuity, the temperature of the enclosed Sea remains constant to the bottom
(as in the Mediterranean), while that of the Ocean shows a continuous descent.

areas.
     The occurrence of these gigantic pit-holes in this region of
 extraordinary Volcanic activity has a singular significance ; especially
 when taken in connection with the fact that like depressions of the
 Ocean-bed which have been elsewhere met with, are also in Volcanic
                                                '
areas.     Thus the first of the ' Challenger soundings which showed a
depth (3875 fathoms) greatly exceeding that of the ordinary floor of
 the Atlantic, was made not far north of St. Thomas's, in what may be
                                         "             "
 regarded as a continuation of that line of fire which is so marked
 in the lesser Antilles. The sounding-wire of the United States ship
 ' Tuscarora ' twice broke, without
                                        reaching bottom, in near proximity
 to the volcanic region of Japan, at depths considerably exceeding
 4000 fathoms.     And the deepest bottom sounded by the ' Challenger,'
 4575 fathoms or 27,450 feet, — which seems to have been a local depres
sion of a sea-bed averaging about half that depth, and was met with
on the passage between New Guinea and Japan, not far from the
Ladrone Islands, — was also presumably in a line of volcanic dis
turbance.
     Again, the 'Challenger' observations enable it to be affirmed
with confidence, that wherever Land shows itself * in the great Oceanic
area, forming what are distinguished as " oceanic islands
                                                                  "
                                                                    from those
which are merely outlying portions of continental platforms, those
islands are all volcanic ; their elevation having been due to forces acting
only in limited spots or over particular lines, and not to any general
uplifting of the bottom of the basin. So, on the other hand, the
contours of the Deep-sea bed, so far as they have been determined,
 give no countenance whatever to the notion of such a general
subsidence as would have produced the submergence of a great
Continental platform in any part of the vast Oceanic area ; and this
negative conclusion receives striking confirmation (as will hereafter
appear) from the entire absence, in the sediments at present in process
of deposition at a distance from existing continental land, of any
traces of land-degradation.
     II. The progress of Geological inquiry has now made it apparent
that the movements of elevation that have occurred from time to time
in various parts of the Land-areas of the globe, have been the result
of forces acting in two different directions — vertical and horizontal.
Extensive platforms, of which European Bussia affords a conspicuous
example, have been several times raised into land (with alternations
of depression) by a force that seems to have operated directly upward ;
and with such uniformity over a vast area, as to have produced very

 little change in the relative levels of its different parts. These alter
nations of depression and elevation have all been apparently of very
moderate vertical amount. Over the vast area of Eussia, we find, as a
rule, that the sediments which have been successively deposited upon
it exhibit a most regular stratification, and have undergone little or
no metamorphic change ; Silurian clay-slates being represented by
hardened clay; and Carboniferous limestone showing itself as an
aggregate of compacted (foraminiferal) Fusulince.
      On the other hand, a force acting horizontally against the margin
of a previously level area, will throw it into plications, of which the
elevated portions will form mountain-ranges.           The strata forming
these ranges, which show by their contorted condition the enormous
lateral thrust to which they have been subjected, always exhibit
more or less of metamorphic change ; and this metamorphism is now
generally regarded as the effect of heat, acting in conjunction with
moisture, and usually under pressure.*           The source of this heat
is to be found in the very mechanical energy which effects the
plication; resistance to which, as in ordinary friction and compression,
will cause it to take that converted form. This plicating process acts
along definite lines and bands, the width of which is usually small in
proportion to the vast area of the wide continental platforms ; and
thus it happens that notwithstanding the enormous height to which
the most elevated peaks may be lifted (Mount Everest 29,000 feet),
little is added by Mountain-making to the average level of any great
continent.    But, again, the operation of this lateral thrust is now
generally recognized, not merely in the elevation of mountain-ranges,
but also in Volcanic action; the fusion of the compressed rocks
being, in fact, only a further stage of metamorphism, and being fairly
attributable, like     it,
                       to the production of heat by the conversion of
mechanical force.

         The recent progress of Physical Astronomy, again — mainly
through the application of the Spectroscope to the study of the phy
sical and chemical conditions of celestial bodies in various stages of
aggregation — seems now to have placed         beyond reasonable doubt

of  whose theoretical views       will show how entirely they harmonize with
the conclusions    drawn     from  inquiry into the present conditions of the
                            —  " As   the globe has cooled from fusion, it
great Oceanic      areas  :
has been    all through     time   a contracting   globe ; and this contraction
of  the  crust  has  been    the  chief  agency  in determining the evolution
of the earth's surface-features, and the successive phases in its long
history." " The crust which should form over a melted sphere, as it
cooled, would have the size the sphere had at the time. As it thick
ened downwards by the continued cooling, the added portions would
contract ; and this would occasion lateral pressure through the crust,
which would increase as the cooling and thickening continued."
Reasons are adduced by Professor Dana for the belief that the forma
tion of the solid crust would not go on at the same rate all over the
sphere ; but that some portions of the surface would solidify into a
layer several miles in thickness, whilst over other large areas the
surface would still be liquid or in a state of only incipient solidifica
tion.   The level of the latter would be gradually lowered by the con
traction of the cooling mass beneath ; and the crust of these depressed
areas would constitute the Ocean-floors, whilst the elevated areas, rising
by abrupt sides from their borders, would remain as Continental
plateaux.     The study of the geological structure of the North Ameri
can continent leads Professor Dana to the conclusion that
                                                                    " in its very
inception,   not only   was    its  general topography foreshadowed, but its
great mountain-chains appear to have been begun, and its great inter
mediate basins to have been defined. The evolution of the grand
structure-lines of the continent was thus early commenced, and the
system thus initiated was the system to the end.            Here is one strong
reason for concluding that the continents have always been continents ;
that while portions may have at times been submerged some thousands
of feet, the Continents have never changed places with the Oceans"
     The progressive shrinkage of the internal mass, as its cooling
proceeds, must produce a falling inwards of the crust formed around
it ; and the lateral pressure thus exerted through the whole crust will
necessitate a yielding somewhere.            The lateral thrust is likely to be
exerted most advantageously from the floors of the depressed Oceanic
areas against the sides of the elevated Continental plateaux ; and this
is borne out by the fact that " the continents have mountains along
their borders, while the interior is generally low ; and that " the vol
                                                         "
canoes of the continental areas are mostly confined to the sea-borders."
 Further, " the largest and loftiest mountain-chains, greatest volcanoes,
and other results of uplifting and disruptive force, characterize the
borders of the greatest oceans, showing that the lateral pressure from
the direction of the oceans was approximately proportional to the ex
tent of the oceanic basins."          Thus, in North America the lofty and
massive Alleghanies are raised up on the Pacific side ; the minor
Appalachian chain on the Atlantic. In South America, the great
chain of the Andes, with its lofty volcanoes, is in like contrast with
the comparatively insignificant mountains of Brazil. So, on the Euro

 pean side of the Atlantic, the mountains which border the Oceanic
 basin correspond in scale with those on its western border, rather than
 with those on the Pacific slope of the American continent. On the
 western side of the Pacific, on the other hand, the Malayan Archipe
 lago constitutes (as already pointed out) a region of extraordinary
 volcanic activity ; and this is probably the greater on account of the
 comparative narrowness of this continental plateau, so that it is subject
 to the lateral thrust of the sea-bed of the Indian Ocean in addition.
     But the lateral thrust exerted by these floors, being resisted by the
buttresses presented by the continental plateaux, will tend to produce
 an upward bulging of these floors themselves, especially in their
 median portion. And this, again, corresponds with fact ; such an up
 ward bulging showing itself in the median portion of the bed of the
 Atlantic, both north and south ; while the force which raised this, also
 manifests itself in the volcanic action which has pushed up the Azores
and Tristan d'Acunha in corresponding positions.         So, in the North
 Pacific, we have the remarkable volcanic Hawaian group, occupying
 the same relative position as the Azores in the North Atlantic; while
over the still wider expanse of the South Pacific, there seem to be
 several of these upward bulgings, that have exploded (so to speak),
here and there, in local volcanic action.
    I   must not follow Professor Dana's masterly hypothesis into
further detail, but must content myself with noticing one point which
seems to me of singular interest — namely, the explanation he gives of
the depression of portions of what he regards as the original continental
platforms, over which long series of sedimentary deposits have been
formed, of course implying a subsidence of their base to an amount
at least equal to their total thickness.      The first step in ordinary
mountain-making by lateral thrust, is affirmed by Professor Dana to
be a downward bend of the crust, or " geosynclinal."      " In the
                                                                   making
of the Appalachians, there was first, under the lateral pressure, a
slowly progressing subsidence ; it began in, or before, the Primordial
period, the commencing era of the Silurian, and continued in progress
until the Carboniferous age closed. As the trough deepened, deposits
of sediment, and sometimes of limestone, were made, that kept the
surface of the region near the water-level ; and when the trough
reached its maximum, there were 40,000 feet of thickness of stratified
rock in  it,and this, therefore, was the depth of the trough. The Green
Mountains began in      a  similar subsidence, and at the same time     ;
and the trough was kept full with deposits as        itprogressed. Such
facts are in the history of many,   ifnot all mountains."
     The foregoing arguments may be thus combined —       :
     A. The enormous depth of the Oceanic sea-bed, as compared with
the height of the Land above the sea-level, renders  very unlikely that
                                                      it
any subsidence of Land-area should be compensated by such an up
                    a
lifting of portion of the Ocean-floor as would raise above that level.
         a                                                it
Thus, supposing that all the Land of the globe were to sink down to tho

278                      Dr. William B.  Carpenter               [Jan. 23,
sea-level, such subsidence would be balanced (according to the current
idea of compensatory alternation) by an elevation up to that level of a
portion of the average Ocean-floor, amounting to no more than l-36th
of its existing area. On the other hand, the sinking of such an area
as that of Papuo-Australia (which forms about l-17th of the existing
land-surface) to the depth of the average Ocean-floor, would require
to balance it an elevation of the whole remainder (13-14ths) of the
existing Land to double its present average height above the sea-
level.
     B. Wherever the uniform elevation of an extensive Land-area in
dicates its upheaval by a force acting vertically throughout, the amount
of such elevation seems to have been very limited, — no such level area
showing itself at any considerable height above the sea. Conversely,
there is no adequate reason to believe that any extensive area has ever
uniformly subsided beneath the sea-level, to any greater depth than
that at which lie the submerged portions of some existing Continental
platforms.
     C. On the other hand, all great elevations, whether rising from
Continental platforms or from the Oceanic sea-bed, are clearly attribu
table to lateral thrust; and such are everywhere of very limited
extent, forming mountain-chains or high table-lands in Continents,
and volcanic islands in the Oceanic area, — in neither case having the
least resemblance to continental plateaux.     And, conversely, the very
deep depressions in which long series of stratified deposits have
accumulated, only occur as consequences of the lateral thrust which
produces plication, and which elevates mountain-ranges as part of the
same operation.      Local subsidences of this kind, therefore, give no
support to the idea of such vast general subsidences, as would be
required to create a deep Oceanic depression over any area now occu
pied by a Continental platform. — Inland seas, in fact, may be regarded
as troughs of this kind, which have been formed in regions of extra
 ordinary disturbance, in which the troughs have been formed more
rapidly than they can be filled by the accumulation of sediment from
the elevations of which they are the complements. \ The largest of
 them (the Mediterranean and Central American) may possibly have
 been original breaks in their Continental platforms.
     Thus, then, all our knowledge of the existing relations between
 Continental plateaux and Ocean-basins, and of the forces by which
 those relations might probably be disturbed, points distinctly to the
 inference that these relations have never been very different from
 what they are now.      And the entire conformity of the results of this
 reasoning from the present to the past, with those of Professor Dana's
 reasoning in the contrary direction from the primal assumption
 (which no man of science would now call in question) of the Earth's
 original fluidity, affords strong confirmation of its validity.
     I am far from affirming that considerable local changes may not
 have occurred in past epochs, which may have had very important

effects upon the distribution of Plants and Animals ; so that, on the one
hand, Land-continuity has been established where there was formerly a
complete interruption ; whilst on the other, continents now for the most
part separated by Oceanic areas, or islands cut off from neighbouring
continents by deep channels, may have been at one time in continuous
connection. My contention is that such connections have been formed
by the elevation of mountain ridges (terrestrial or submarine) by
lateral thrust ; and not by the vertical elevation of a great area of
Ken-bottom   into a continental plateau. Thus, there appears to be
valid evidence that the surface-connection between North and South
America is comparatively modern ; a communication between the
Atlantic and Pacific basins having formerly existed whore now in
terrupted by the Isthmus of Darien, the elevation of which probably
does not date back further than the early Tertiary period.           So, in
the North Atlantic, the extension of the European platform to the
west of the Shetland Islands, the existence of a ridge at only about
200 fathoms' depth beneath the surface between the Faroes and Ice
land, and of another ridge at a greater depth between Iceland and
Greenland, renders it not unlikely that at some former period Europe
and North America may have had a baud of connection along this
line. On the other hand, the knowledge we now possess of the con
figuration of the more southerly part of that Oceanic area, seems to
preclude the probability of the former extension of a great continental
platform (the hypothetical Atlantis) between Europe and America in
the parallel of the Azores.     So, as it seems to me, the remarkable
relations pointed out by Sir J. D. Hooker between the Floras of New
Zealand, Tasmania, and South America, may be accounted for by
connecting ridges raised by lateral thrust, without supposing the ex
istence of a vast Antarctic continent now deeply submerged.*           And
the former connection of Madagascar with the African continent,
distinctly indicated by the distribution of animal and vegetable life
on the western portion of the island, might easily have been esta
blished by an elevation of the bottom of the Mozambique Channel by
lateral thrust. There are even indications, in the groups of volcanic
islets lying to the north-east of Madagascar, that this great island
may have been once in connection through them with the Asiatic
continent.
     Such limited and local changes,       I
                                          again repeat, are perfectly con
sistent with the doctrine of general permanence. And                I
                                                                have now,
in conclusion, to show how remarkably this doctrine is confirmed by

     IV. The examination which Mr. Murray has made of the samples
of the Oceanic deposits brought up by the ' Challenger ' soundings and
dredgings, affords conclusive evidence, that the floor of the real Oceanic
area, unless in the near neighbourhood of the Continental platforms,
is not, and never has been, covered with sediments formed by the
 degradation of the existing land ; such sediments being deposited only
on the shallow bottoms not far from shore, which (as already pointed
out) may be considered as in reality submerged portions of those
very platforms, and as not belonging to the true Oceanic area. With
the exception of certain patches of clay, which there is strong evidence
for regarding as a product of the decomposition of pumice ejected
from volcanic vents, all the sediments now in process of deposition
on the Oceanic sea-bed are of organic origin : a calcareous ooze, re
sembling chalk, being produced by the decomposition of the con
tinually accumulating shells of Foraminifera ; and a siliceous ooze
being formed by the like accumulation of the skeletons of Kadiolarians
in the warmer zones, and the loricse of Diatoms in the colder.
Although volcanic sand was of course met with over the volcanic
areas, ordinary siliceous sand, resembling that of our own shores and
shallow bottoms, has nowhere been detected on the deep-sea bottom.
And thus, if this bottom were to be raised into dry land, it would be
found entirely destitute of those inorganic sedimentary deposits, which
constitute by far the larger part of the succession of stratified for
mations with which geological inquiry has made us familiar.           I can
best make obvious to you the full significance of this fact, — which, as
Professor Geikie has recently remarked, is of the profoundest interest
for geologists and geographers, — by citing the views of that eminent
geologist as to the mode of formation of the long succession of strati
fied rocks, which originated in the deposit of sediments formed by
the degradation of pre-existing land.      "
                                             Among the thickest masses
of sedimentary rock — those of the ancient Palaeozoic systems — no
features recur more continually than the alternations of different
sediments, and the recurrence of surfaces covered with well-preserved
ripple-marks, trails and burrows of annelids, and polygonal and
irregular desiccation-marks like the cracks at the bottom of a sun-
dried muddy pool.      These phenomena unequivocally point to shallow
and even littoral waters. They occur from bottom to top of formations
which reach a thickness of several thousand feet.           They can be
interpreted only in one way, viz. that the formations in question began
to be laid down in shallow waters ; that during their formation the
area of deposit gradually subsided for thousands of feet ; yet that the
rate of accumulation of sediment kept pace on the whole with this
depression ; and hence, that the original shallow-water characters of
the deposits remained, even after the original sea-bottom had been
buried under a vast mass of sedimentary matters." The same he holds
to be true of the relatively thin and much more varied formations of
later date.  So it is evident that the materials of these sedimentary
rocks must have been deposited in near proximity to the land by

1880.]            on   Land and Sea in relation   to   Geological Time.   281
the degradation of which they were produced.         " From the earliest
geological times the great area of deposit has been, as it still           is,
the marginal belt of sea-floor skirting the land."           This double
process of degradation of old land, and deposit of materials for the
new, "belongs to the terrestrial and shallow oceanic parts of the
earth's surface, and not to the deep and wide oceanic basins."        The
  Challenger    explorations have now furnished absolute proof, that
'             '
the deposits now in progress on the floors of the ocean-basins have no
real analogy among the past sedimentary formations which geological
inquiry brings into view.      " We now know by actual inspection,
that the ordinary sediment washed off the land sinks to the sea-bottom
before   it reaches the deeper abysses     and that, as
                                            ;               rule, only the
                                                                a
finer particles are carried more than       few score of miles from the
                                             a
shore."    On the abyssal depths the sedimentary deposit gathers
so slowly, that the particles of meteoric iron — the star-dust which falls
from outer space — form an appreciable part of it.
    " From all this evidence," continues Professor Geikie, " we may
legitimately conclude that the present land of the globe, though con
sisting in great measure of marine formations, has never lain under
the deep sea but that its site must always have been near land." " The
              ;
present Continental ridges have probably always existed in some form        ;
and as   a corollary we may infer that the present deep Ocean-basins
likewise date from the remotest geological antiquity." *
    It now nearly eleven years ago, that first ventured in this
         is                                            I

                   The Photographic Spectra   of the Stars.
IN the year    1863 my friend Dr. William Allen Miller exhibited on
the screen in this room a photograph of the spectrum of the star
Sirius, which we had taken the evening before in my observatory.
The images of stars in the telescope had already been photographed
as points, but this was the first time that their rays after dispersion
by a prism had recorded themselves upon a photographic plate. For
certain instrumental reasons, the photographs which we then took
did not possess sufficient purity of the spectrum to give them a
scientific value.
      Several researches in other directions to which       I subsequently
devoted myself, prevented me for some years from resuming this
                                         I
inquiry, until a few years ago, when took up the subject again.           I
 purpose this evening to give an account of this recent work, and of
the results which have come out of it.
      Our common notion of light is limited not by the actual extent of
 range of the radiations of a luminous body, but by the power of our
 eyes to see them.    Of the long range of radiations which comes from
highly heated matter, the sun for example, only a small portion falls
 within the power of the eye.         Beyond the extreme violet, where
 visibility ends, a great range of shorter vibrations beats upon the eye,
 and we know it not. So on the other side below the red all con
 sciousness of light fails us ; but here another sense, that of the feeling
 of heat and warmth, enables us still to know that a radiated influence
 from the hot body is coming upon us.           These two invisibles, the
 ultra-violet and the ultra-red, though they cannot stimulate our eyes
 directly, can make themselves known to us mediately, through certain
 actions on other bodies.
      One of these is the disturbing influence they exert on delicately
 balanced salts of silver, which we call their photographic power.
 This action was regarded as so exclusively the property of the ultra
 violet portion of the spectrum, that these rays have been distinguished
  by the names, " chemical rays," " photographic rays." Quite recently,

 tion of silver bromide, has brought the whole of the other end       of th<
 spectrum, the ultra-red, within the power of the photographic         platr
 He has,I   believe, taken the photograph of   kettle of boiling
                                                a                     water
 in the dark by means of its own radiation.
     This evening we shall have to do exclusively with the            ultra
 violet portion of the spectrum.
      In the years 1865 and 1869 had the honour to bring before this
                                 I
 Institution the results of the observations of Dr. Miller and myself
 on the visible spectra of some of the stars.      These eye observations
 embraced range of vibrations extending from
          a                                         alittle below C   in the
 red to about G   in the blue. The recent researches, to which nowI
 at once proceed, begin where the eye observations ended, about G,
 and carry our knowledge of the stellar spectra beyond       0, and in some
 cases beyond  S, in the ultra-violet.
     We shall, perhaps, underrate the importance of          aknowledge of
 the ultra-violet spectra of stars, if we regard these phetographs as
 simply adding so much in length to the visible spectrum, for there
are reasons why     knowledge of this part of the spectrum may be of
                    a
exceptional value to us.
    I   shall describe first, in some little detail, the instrumental
methods by which the very great difficulties which present them
selves in so delicate an inquiry were successfully overcome.            The
two principal difficulties with which the inquirer      is at once brought
face to face, are the feebleness of the star's light after dispersion by   a
prism, and the circumstance that the stars are in apparent motion,
arising from the earth's rotation.
     It was therefore necessary to do two things, first, to obtain         a
sufficiently pure and detailed spectrum with the least possible loss of
light, and secondly, to devise some method by which the star's image
could be kept absolutely invariable in position within       a very narrow
slit.
     After passing the limit of the visible spectrum, the transparency
of glass diminishes rapidly, until at length   itbecomes opaque to the
rays of very high refrangibility  ; for this reason   was necessary to
                                                        it
avoid altogether the use of this substance. A telescope of the reflect
ing form, in which the light    is received upon    ametallic speculum,
was employed. This instrument has speculum of 18 inches diameter.
                                      a
The spectrum apparatus must also contain no glass. There were two
substances available, Iceland spar and quartz, both of which are very
transparent to this part of the spectrum.    Quartz   harder and takes
                                                        is
a higher polish and was used for the lenses, but its dispersive power
is so small that more than one prism would have been needed, intro
ducing loss of light and other drawbacks,     ifthis substance had been
employed.     Iceland spar possesses  a much higher dispersive power     ;
itis, indeed, about equal to moderately dense flint glass. One prism
of this substance of 60°, which was beautifully cut for me by Mr.
Hilger, was found to be sufficient for the purpose.

    The apparatus is represented in this diagram (Fig. 1). It is
mounted on a base plate a with bevelled edges, which enables it to be
accurately adjusted at the end of the telescope. The prism is at c.
The image of the star is brought upon the slit b. The light is rendered
parallel by lens d ; it passes through the prism, and is then, by a
second lens of quartz, made to converge and form an image on the
photographic plate /, which is inclined so as to bring a considerable
part of the spectrum to focus upon the plate.

     This apparatus       was found   to meet very satisfactorily  the one
primary condition of diminishing the star's light to the least possible
 extent compatible with obtaining a spectrum full of fine details and
well denned.        The photographs taken with this instrument measure
not more than half an inch from G to O, and yet under suitable
magnifying power seven lines can be counted between H and K.
    The second important difficulty was to find a ready means of
bringing the luminous point, into which the star's light is gathered up
by the mirror, accurately upon any part of the very narrow chink, the
3^ part of an inch, through which the light has to enter the spectrum
apparatus, and further to maintain the star's image precisely within
the same part of this chink during the whole time of exposure of the
photographic     plate, which    might   be as long as   one  hour or even
more.
    The   telescope was, of course, mounted upon an equatorial stand —
that is, one in which the axis of motion is placed parallel to the earth's
axis of rotation,  — so that the   telescope when kept in suitable motion

 288                       Dr. William Huggins                    [Feb. 6,
 by clockwork     will remain invariably pointed to any star, notwith
 standing that the rapidly rotating earth is carrying the telescope and
 the observer round with it. This clock motion is one of exceptional
 excellence, due to the inventive skill of Mr. Grubb, being furnished
 with a secondary control by means of a pendulum in electrical con
 nection with a standard clock.    But even these instrumental arrange
 ments, although of exceptional excellence, were not delicate enough.
 It was found necessary to supplement them with a method of con
 tinuous supervision and control by hand.
      In this diagram (Fig. 2) you have represented a portion of the
 reflecting telescope, which is of the Cassegrain form.       The small
 mirror was removed, and the spectrum apparatus accurately adjusted
                                  Fig. 2.
by its sliding base plate, so that the slit was brought precisely to the
principal focus of the largo speculum.       Now over this slit is placed
a highly polished silver plate c, with a narrow opening rather larger
than the slit.
     The next point was to fix on the side of the telescope a small
mirror d, by which artificial yellow light could be thrown upon the
plate.    One point further.  The great speculum has a central hole ;
now behind this, in place of the usual eyepiece, is fixed a small
Galilean telescope or opera-glass.
     Now if the observer directs the telescope to a star, and then looks
into this small telescope, he sees before him tho silver plate and tbe
slit within the opening by means of the artificial illumination, and
also at the same time the star's image as a bright point somewhere on
the plate. It is then easily within the observer's power to bring the
star's image exactly upon any desired part of the slit. In the figure
at i, Fig. 1, you have represented what the observer sees. The star's

image being rather larger than the width of the slit, its place, even
when upon the slit, can be seen. If, therefore, the observer keeps his
eye fixed upon the star's image during the whole time of exposure, half
an hour, one hour, or it may be two hours, he can instantly correct by
hand any small irregularities of the motion of the telescope, and so
maintain the star's image invariably fixed upon the slit
     Further, it was necessary to obtain the photographs under such
conditions that it should be possible afterwards to determine with
accuracy the value in wave lengths of the positions in the spectrum of
the stellar lines.
     For this purpose the slit was provided with two small shutters, as
represented at h and y, Fig. 1. One of these only remains open
while the photograph of the star is taken.
     When the exposure is finished this shutter is closed. The other
can then be opened, and a second spectrum upon the same plate for
the purpose of comparison taken.           It may be the solar spectrum
reflected from the moon, or the spectrum of a known star, or a
terrestrial spectrum, or the apparatus may remain until the following
day, and then the solar spectrum be taken upon the plate directly.
     Afterwards, from these comparison spectra, by the aid of a suitable
measuring apparatus attached to a microscope, the wave lengths of the
stellar lines were determined.        And for this purpose use was made
of the excellent map of M. Cornu of the ultra-violet, and of his
determinations, and those of Mascart, of the wave lengths of the lines of
cadmium, aluminium, and zinc.         Various photographic methods were
tried, but the great sensitiveness which may be given to gelatine
plates, as well as the great advantage of employing plates in a dry
state, led to the exclusive use of this method of photography.
     I  was about to complain of how few nights sufficiently fine for
this work present themselves during a whole year — they may be
counted upon the fingers — but      I forbear when    I remember that, not
withstanding    the  terrible   drawbacks of  our  climate,  no country con
tributes more largely than our own to the advance of astronomy.
     Before proceeding to the results of my work,        I will endeavour to
make visible to you some portion of the ultra-violet part of the
spectrum.
     Besides their photographic power, there is another mode of action
by which the ultra-violet rays may make themselves visible to us.
There are some substances which absorb these very rapid vibrations,
and then give back the energy they have received, in the form of
vibrations which are sufficiently long to come within the power of the
eye.    They transform the invisible energy into visible light. This
property of fluorescence is possessed in a high degree by sulphate of
quinine, and by aesculin, a substance which exists in the bark of the
horse-chestnut.     I  have a small screen which has been brushed over
with a solution of this substance.
     Professor Dewar has kindly placed at my disposal one of his
electric-arc crucibles.       I  cannot forbear congratulating     Professor

Dewar on having inaugurated so fruitful a method of spectroscopic
investigation.      Instead of the usual optical arrangement of glass,        I
have substituted a lens of quartz, and a prism of Iceland spar, similar
to that which     I have used in my star work.
     I will now ask Mr. Cottrell to throw first upon the usual screen
the visible spectrum.        Even now, when no glass is used, you see how
brilliant are the blue and violet parts of the spectrum. The part of
 the spectrum we shall have to do with in the stars lies for the most
part beyond. Now, if this prepared screen be held beyond, you see
that the invisible energy is translated for us into characters which the
eye can read.       In the crucible we have the vapours of calcium and
aluminium, and we now see, not merely the ultra-violet light, but
the bright lines of these substances in this part of the spectrum.
     I now proceed to the results which have come out of this work.
     In 1865     I  exhibited on the screen several coloured drawings of
spectra taken from the observations of Dr. Miller and myself in
illustration of the different kinds of spectra which the stars present.
                          I
It is desirable that pass three or four of them in review before              I
exhibit the photographic spectra corresponding to them.
     The first diagram represents the spectrum of Sirius. The spectrum
of  this star may be taken as typical of the stars which shine with white
light. Most of the photographs belong to this class of star. Very
early Dr. Miller and myself called attention to the distinctive charac
teristics of the spectra of stars of this class. The great distinguishing
feature of their spectra consists of throe or four very broad and intense
lines. By a method of direct comparison we found three of these lines
to coincide with lines of hydrogen.         The first corresponds to C of the
solar spectrum, the second with solar F, and the third with a line of
hydrogen near G. This last line near G appears as the first strong
line of the photographic spectrum. There are, indeed, numerous very
fine lines also present, but these are so delicate as to be seen, fitfully
only, except under the most favourable conditions.           We satisfied our
selves of the double line of sodium at D, the least refrangible of t ho
magnesium group, and a line at E — a line of iron — and some others.
This class includes the largest number of bright stars. The spectra
of the different stars of this class are chiefly distinguished from each
other by the greater or less breadth and diffuseness of these lines
of hydrogen, and also by various degrees of strength and visibility of
the finer lines.
     I will now show you the spectrum of another class of stars of
which the light is tinged with yellow.          This spectrum is that of the
star Aldebaran.       This class includes our sun. In this star the lines
of hydrogen are reduced to about the proportion they possess in the
solar spectrum.       The other lines of the spectrum are no longer fine
and difficult to see.       Here we have in full the triple line of mag
nesium.     I  now    show   the spectra of two stars of a different class
indeed,  but  in  both  cases the light is orange.  I will not stop to describe
those spectra,     but   pass to one more class, the stars in the light of

   which the predominant colour is less refrangible,             These stars are
   of  a full red colour.
        Now we return to the class of white stars,

   graphs     were     exhibited    on the
   screen.] As this photograph is a
   negative, of course the black lines
   are    represented by        transparent
   spaces and the continuous spectrum
   by a dark band. We shall be able,
   therefore, better to study the peculi
  arities of the spectrum if we substi
   tute for it a positive taken by direct
   superposition.      Here (Fig. 3) the
  dark and light are not reversed.
  The circumstance, which is so
  marked as to compel us to give it
  first attention, is the distinctly sym
  metrical character of this strong
  group of lines.       When the negative
  is examined under suitable condi
  tions of illumination, twelve lines
 may be counted. As the refrangi
 bility increases, the lines diminish
 in breadth and the distance be
 tween any two lines is less as the
 refrangibility of the lines in
 creases.     It is also of importance to
 notice that the spectrum does not
 end with them. Beyond the last of
 the group of lines the continuous
 spectrum runs on far beyond S in
 the ultra-violet.      The point where
 the group ends is between M and N.
       The first in order of refrangi
bility of these lines is the well-
known line of hydrogen near G,
which you saw in the visible spec
trum of the star. The second of
these lines is also a line of hydro
gen, coincident with h of the solar
spectrum.       The next line coincides
in position with the strong line H
of the solar spectrum. But where
is H2 or K ? It is represented by
this very thin line, which is barely
recognziable.       You remember how narrow a slit was used, and that if
this were a photograph of the solar spectrum, some
                                                                seven lines or
more would be clearly visible in this space.         We shall now be able to
                                                                    X 2

292                        Dr. William Huyginn                    [Feb.  6,
study the spectrum bettor by a reference to this diagram (Fig. 4), in
which tho lines are put down according to their wave lengths.          The
two lines H and K, as is well known, coincide with two lines of cal
cium, and we attribute them usually to tho vapour of that substance.
    The remarkable behaviour of those lines in the stars was pointed
out by me at the end of 1876.           A few months previously, Mr.
Lockyer suggested     that photographs  of the brighter stars might show
a modification of this character, and that if such were the case, it
would support his view as to the dissociation of the vapour of calcium
in the hottest stars. In a subsequent paper to the Eoyal Society
Mr. Lockyer explained in more detail his views of the dissociation of
the terrestrial elements, and also the bearing of his views in con
nection with the different kinds of visible star spectra. I wish also here
to acknowledge the kindness of Professor Dewar, who permitted me to
witness the experiments conducted by himself and Professor Liveing.
I saw the lines of calcium corresponding to H and K in the emission
spectrum of that substance vary in relative brightness until for a
moment the line corresponding to H alone remained.
    Are this thick line of tho star spectrum and tho thin line at K really
due to calcium ?

1880.J                on the Photographic Spectra     of tie Stars.                     293
    Now, beyond these lilies there is another pair of strong lines in
the calcium spectrum more refrangible.      The question arises, are
these represented in the star's spectrum by any strong lines ?  They
are not.   Two strong lines are near them, but do not coincide with
them.
    Again, in the photographic spectrum of hydrogen there is a line
at the position of H. It is seen in Mr. Capron's photographic spectra.
It is also present in my own photographs. Mr. Lockyer called atten
tion to the coincidence of this line with H in December, 1879.
     In this diagram the photographic spectrum is completed by the
addition of the strong lines in the visible one, and laid down according
to the scale of wave lengths.      Of these the first four are certainly
lines of hydrogen ; the fifth, H, coincides both with calcium and
hydrogen.         I
                suspect in some of my photographs of hydrogen fine
lines at the positions of several of the more refrangible lines of the
stellar group.*
     That all the lines of this remarkable group are members of a
common physical system becomes very highly probable indeed, if we
convert the wave lengths into their reciprocals, the wave frequencies,
and then plot them down, as is done in this diagram (Fig. 5). It then
becomes evident that they lie on, or very near, a definite curve, a
state of things which we could not suppose to happen by chance.
Mr. Johnstone Stoney, in a letter to me, remarks on this point :—
     " The question whether they lie actually or only near a definite
curve     is,ifmistake not, of great significance in the theory.
                I                                                   they           If
lie on   acurve, obeying any exact mathematical law, their connection
mustI,   think, be attributed to their corresponding to the consecutive
overtures of some vibrating system. If, on the other hand, they lie
near but not on the curve, this circumstance would support the
hypothesis (which seems to accord with other facts) that the visible
lines are members of long series of harmonics, most of the members
                           a
of which are invisible, those which are seen being those whose posi
tions chance nearly to fulfil     definite state of things which

294                            Dr. William Huggine                       [Feb.  6,
shown to exist in some acoustic arrangements, and which where it
exists exalts the intensity of the harmonics whose positions nearly
fulfil the requisite condition.        I  converted the wave lengths into wave
frequencies.      ...   I think  it  must  be accepted that the lines do not lie
on, but near a definite curve. This appears to be corroborated by
finding that H, and G, (hydrogen line near G) are connected har-
monially, these rays being exactly the 35th and 32nd harmonies of a
 vibration     whose fundamental        is _        (r being the time in which
 light travels a millimetre in air) . . . ."
       Under these circumstances one is led to regard the whole series
 of lines as due to hydrogen. In this connection it may be stated
 that Messrs. Dewar and Liveing find that the line of calcium K is
 more easily reversed than the line at the position of H.
       This spectrum of Vega may be taken conveniently as typical of the
 whole class of white stars, so that in our consideration of the other
 stars of this class we shall consider the distinctive features peculiar
 to each, as modifications, or departures, from this common typical
 form.       To facilitate these comparisons          I  have distinguished   the
 typical    lines  by the  letters  of the  Greek  alphabet, beginning   with the
 line more refrangible than H.
       In this map (Fig. 4)        I  have arranged the spectra of five other
  stars of the white group in their order of change, approximately at
  least, from the spectrum of Vega.
       I  will point out some of the directions in which these changes
  show themselves, and       I will then exhibit upon the screen the photo
  graphs themselves of these stars.
        There are principally three directions in which the changes take
  place :—
        1. In the breadth and greater or less marginal diffuseness of the
  typical lines.
        2. In the presence or absence of E, and, if present, in its breadth
  and intensity relatively to H.
        3. In the number and distinctness of other lines in the spectrum.
        Now in these stars we see modifications in these three directions,
  a successive diminution of breadth of the typical lines, and of the
  nebulosity at the edges ; the lines become at the same time narrower
  and defined at the edges.
        In Sirius the lines are about the same thickness as in a Lyra, and
  the line corresponding to K of about the same fineness.
        In the next star, a Ursse Majoris, we have the same typical group,
  but the lines are less broad and rather more defined at the edges.
   There is no fine line at the position of E, but some other lines make
   their appearance.
        The star next in order is a Virginis.           Here the typical lines are
   still narrower and more defined. E is stronger relatively to H, and
   numerous lines are visible beyond the last of the typical group.
        In the spectrum of a Cygni the typical lines are still narrower

  and more defined. The line at E is nearly as broad as H, and there
  are other lines present
       In the last spectrum of the map, that of Arcturus, we come to
  that of a star of another order, which includes the solar type, but this
  star appears to be further removed than the sun is, in the order of
  change from the typical form, as we meet with it in Vega and Sirius.
  Here the typical lines are no longer present as a strong group. The
  line at K is stronger relatively to H than it is in the solar spectrum.
  The spectrum is crowded with fine lines, and in the visible part
  resembles the solar spectrum, but beyond H the lines are more intense
  and differently grouped.
       We cannot resist the feeling that we have here to do with a star
  which has departed farther from the condition in which Vega now is
  than our sun has yet done.
       The question presents itself —Have we before us stars of per
 manently different orders, or have we to do with some of the life-
 changes through which all stars pass ?
       Does the sun's position somewhere before Arcturus in the order
  of change indicate also his relative age ?
       On. these points we know nothing certainly.         If I   may give some
 play     to the  scientific use  of the  imagination,    I  would   ask you to
  imagine    an  inhabitant  from  some  remote part   of  the   universe  seeing
 for the first time an old man with white hair and wrinkled brow, to
 ask, Was he born thus ? The answer would be, No ; in this child,
 this youth, this man of mature age, you see some of the life-changes
 through which the old man has passed.              So, giving play to the
 scientific imagination, there may have been a time when a photograph
 of the solar spectrum would have presented the typical lines only
 which are still in Vega. At a subsequent period these would have
 been narrower and more defined, and other lines would have made
 their appearance.         And if we allow this scientific imagination to
 project these Friday evenings into the far future, the lecturer, clad
 it may be in the skin of a white bear, may have to describe how the
 spectrum of the then feeble sun has already passed into the class of
 spectra which now distinguishes the stars which shine with red light.
      There remain only two other points. In 1865               I  described the
method of observing the spectrum of a planet compared directly with
 the solar spectrum under similar conditions of terrestrial atmosphere.
The planet is observed in the early evening, when the light from the
sky is bright enough to give a spectrum. With a long slit one sees a
broad spectrum of the sky, and then upon it the brighter spectrum of
the planet.       Making use of this method, spectra were taken of the
planets Venus, Mars, and Jupiter.
      I will now exhibit upon the screen the spectrum of Venus. This
broad spectrum is that of the light from the sky.                   Tho narrow
stronger spectrum is that of the planet Venus.              You see line cor
responds to line, and that there are no modifications or additions
which indicate a planetary atmosphere.

     Tho same in true of the planets Mara and Jupiter.            These two
last-named planets do show indications of atmospheric absorption in
the visible part of the spectrum.           Similar photographs taken of
different    small   areas  of  the   moon under different conditions of
illumination     are  negative as  to any lunar atmosphere. It must not
be supposed that such observations are necessarily antagonistic to tho
existence of a lunar atmosphere. They simply tell us nothing as to
its  existence.
      There are many other directions in which the photographic
arrangements       I have described may be doubtless successfully em
ployed.      I  hope to photograph any lines that may exist in the ultra
violet part of the spectra of the gaseous nebula. The apparatus will
 give us the spectra of different portions of a sun-spot.     It may enable
 us to determine the difference of velocity in the line of sight of two
 stars ; and also we may record by it the sun's rotation by the altera
 tion in refrangibility of the lines of the spectra of opposite limbs.
      One of the great charms of the study of Nature lies in the
 circumstance that no new advance, however small, is ever final.
 There are no blind alleys in scientific investigation.           Every new
 fact is the opening of a new path. As the description of a first step
 in a new and broad highway,            I venture to hope the last hour's
 discourse has not been wholly wanting in interest.

                         Nihil quod tetigit non ornavit."
 Some are inclined to think that the great literary giant of one
 hundred years ago thought more of the roundness of his periods than
 of the facts they clothed, but a greater man than Samuel Johnson said
 of a greater man than Oliver Goldsmith — in fact, our well-beloved
 Faraday said of Charles Wheatstone that there was nothing ho touched
 that he did not adorn.
      Wheatstone's familiar form was very well known to the old
 habitues of this theatre.     Whenever either of his favourite subjects,
 light, sound, or electricity, was under discussion, his little, active,
 nervous and intelligent form was present, eagerly listening to the
 lecturer.   He was no lecturer himself, yet no one was more voluble
 in conversation. At explaining any object of his own invention,
 or any apparatus before him, no one was more apt, but when ho
 appeared before an audience and became the focus of a thousand eyes,
 all his volubility fled, and left him without a particle of that peculiar
 quality which enables an individual with confidence to come before a
 critical audience, such as is represented by the members of this
 Institution, to develop scientific facts or describe apparatus. This
 defect proved fortunate, for it was the cause of Wheatstone obtaining
 the aid of the greatest lecturer of the age, and the annals of this
 Institution bear record of many a Friday evening being occupied
 by Faraday expounding the "beautiful developments," as he called
 them, of Wheatstone.
      Up to the year 1834 Wheatstone devoted his time almost entirely
 to the investigation      of sound.      In that year he was appointed

 298                       Mr. W. H. Preece                     [Fob. 13,
 Professor of Natural Philosophy at King's College, and then com
 menced that career of electrical investigation, that wave of success on
 whose crest he moved until it broke on the shore " of that country
 from whose bourn no traveller returns." The many electrical inven
tions by Wheatstone which were brought forth after 1834 were
derived more or less from his telegraphic achievements. He was not
an electrical investigator ; no one could be while Faraday existed.
He was essentially a practical man, who applied the discoveries of
others to the wants and purposes of mankind.         Somebody has said
that nothing is easier than the discovery of yesterday. Nothing is
more difficult than the discovery of to-morrow 1 The telegraph itself
was no new idea. The scroll of time bears the names of Lomond, Lo
Sago, Scemmering, Bonalds, Ampere, Schilling, and others, but it was
only in the year 1837 that all these fingerposts led up to that point
where two men met who made telegraphs practical.
     In 1837 Cooke, Morse, Steinheil, and Wheatstone all focussed the
labours of previous inventors, and gave the starting point from
which telegraphy became what it is. Cooke and Wheatstone went
hand in hand. Wheatstone was the brilliant, fertile, ingenious man
of science.   Cooke was the sanguine, energetic, practical man of busi
ness.    When Cooke came to England from Heidelberg he was
(through Eoget and Faraday) brought into contact with Wheat-
stone, and he found that Wheatstone had cracked the Columbus
egg — he had discovered the possibility of bridging over space.       All
previous attempts to apply electricity to useful purposes had failed,
from the difficulty of obtaining sufficient force at a distance to
bo productive of effect.   By applying the laws of Ohm to the facts of
Ampere and Oersted, Wheatstone succeeded in finding the proper
basis for arranging wires and magnets in such proportions as to
produce evident effects.   The electrical effects utilized for telegraph
purposes are very numerous.         The one upon which Cooke and
Wheatstone worked was the simple fact that whenever a current of
electricity passes in the neighbourhood of a magnet, such as the
mariner's compass, that magnet was deflected; and Wheatstone
arranged five mariners' compass needles in a horizontal row, each
needle deflecting when a current of electricity was sent along the wire
to which it was attached, deflecting to the right or left according to
the direction of the current.   Such deflections or beats to the right
or left represented symbols, combinations of which could be translated
into letters and words.
     Here is a five-needle hatchment-shaped instrument, made on the
            I
principle have just explained. This was the original kind of speak
ing telegraph instrument. It soon became apparent that five needles
were not required to form symbols to represent all the letters, and a
four-needle instrument was introduced ; and practice and experience,
the great utility tests, proved that when one or other of these four
needles became faulty or unworkable, communication could still be
readily kopt up on the remaining needles.       Thus it was soon found

1880.]       on the Telegraphic Achievements     of Wheatstone.          299
that a double-needle instrument was capable of meeting all require
ments, and here before you are instruments of the original design on
the double-needle principle.       This one of an elegant architectural
design was made for use in the New House of Parliament about 1850.
Before you are the first two double-needle instruments that were ever
used, and they are greatly prized for their historical value.           This
kind of instrument met the same fate as its predecessors, and was
superseded by a single-needle instrument which gave out its signals
quite as efficiently as its earlier brethren possessing a greater number
of needles. This form has remained in use to the present day, and
may be seen at any railway station in the country.           It is used to a
greater extent than any other kind of telegraph instrument, there
being at the present moment at least 10,000 employed by railway
companies, and 3500 by the Post Office.             It is an instrument of
simple   construction, but  I will  not  detain  you by explaining details.
You can easily see that when         I  press  down   a pedal the needle is
deflected ; if it be the right-hand pedal then the needle goes to the
right, and if the left-hand pedal it goes to the left, and one deflection
to the left and one to the right represents the letter A, one to the
right and three to the left B, four beats, viz. one right, one left, one
right and one left G, and so on through the alphabet.
     Wheatstone saw the necessity of doing away with the trouble of
acquiring familiarity with this kind of instrument, and set to work to
introduce one which could be understood by anyone in a moment's
acquaintance.      This, of course, meant representing the ordinary
letters of the alphabet without requiring translation from signals.
He produced an instrument which printed the ordinary letters, but
the mechanical complexity of its arrangement compelled him to
abandon it. He then thought of a permanent alphabet on a dial
 which revolved in front of an open window or around which the
 indicating needle could revolve and point out the exact letters sent.
 This proved more practicable, and the result was the alphabetical
 instrument, such as   I  now show you. The indicating portion works
 in a very similar manner to the second hand of an ordinary clock.
 In a clock the hand makes a slight pause at each point representing
 a second on its dial, and proceeds by jerks round and round the diul,
 being stopped at each second by the cogs of a wheel.           The hand or
 indicator of an alphabetical instrument works round the dial con
 taining the alphabet just in the same way, but is controlled by a
 piece of mechanism which only answers to the current being sent.
 Each current moves the mechanism to which is attached the indicating
 needle, and each movement jerks forward the needle one step as it
 were. To cause the needle to make one revolution round its dial wo
 will suppose requires fifty-two steps (really it is many more). Then
 if it is made to wait or rest at every second step, and opposite that
 step a letter is placed, it is easy to see that in one revolution all the
 letters may be successively indicated.         The indicator is caused to
 rest or wait by the depression of small keys placed round the dial of

the sending portion of the instrument opposite to the printed letters.
The whole apparatus is based on one of the most remarkable dis
coveries of the century, that by which Faraday found it possible to
obtain electricity from a magnet.         I have here the identical apparatus
that Faraday himself used in developing this beautiful idea. It was
not an accident (none of Faraday's discoveries were accidental), but it
was the result of continued self-education, scientific training, ex
perience, and observation, and forms one of the most interesting
episodes in the scientific history of this country.           Faraday, by taking
this magnet and placing over it a soft iron armature, around which
wire is wound, was able to produce electricity on moving the magnet
backwards and forwards.          He thus caused currents to flow in the
wire round the armature, which produced sparks as you see               I now do.
The following lines were written upon this experiment :—
                     " Around the magnet Faraday
                       Wag sure that Volta'e lightnings play,
                       But how to draw them from the wire?
                         He took a lesson from the heart.
                         "Tis when we meet, 'tis when we part,
                       Breaks forth the electric fire."
      Wheatstono applied this fact first of all to produce artificial
alarums.      Here is an instrument (which old electricians call a
" thunderpiunp
                  ") containing an arrangement similar to that used
by Faraday, the magnet being caused to move by the pressure of a
handle.     The ends of a wire round the armature are joined to an
                                                          "
 alarum, and on my pressing down the " pump handle you hear the
bell ring, which is caused by the electricity produced, and sent along
the wire by the moving magnet.            The bell might be fifty miles away,
but the effect would be the same.          The same idea was adopted for an
ABC instrument, and a wheel (like a ship's steering wheel) was made
to send a current every revolution.           A case is marked off with the
letters of the alphabet,     and  the   wheel   is made to stop opposite the
letter sent.    This  apparatus   was   used  in  1840.     It was too cumbrous
for practical adoption,   and  so  fell  out of  use.   From   then to 1858 little
or nothing was done, but in that year Wheatstone introduced quite
a novel feature in the manufacture of his instruments in the way of
 making them of the most perfect mechanism, and as accurate in their
 fittings as chronometers ; and to enable this to be done he fortunately
 succeeded in acquiring the assistance of perhaps one of the finest
mechanical geniuses and workmen that England has had for many a
long day ; and that is Mr. Stroh, whose name              I  need not say is well
 known to this Institution.         Here is a specimen of the improved
alphabetical transmitter.       When the handle is turned, currents of
 electricity are produced which when the keys opposite the letters are
 pressed down, go to the other end of the wire, to which is attached
 the receiver or indicator, the needle of which moves according to the
 currents sent.    (The method by which the indicating needle revolved
 was explained by the use of a large model with toothed wheel and

 springs ; and when the actual mechanism of the sending portion of
 the alphabetical instrument was reflected on a screen the prin
 ciple of the instrument was clear.)       I  have shown you the primi
 tive instrument of 1840, and its improved though cumbrous form of
 1858 ; and here is its elegant representative of 1880, which is joined -
 up to a wire between this room and the Central Telegraph Station,
 and by which we will have a little conversation.        There is scarcely
 a portion of this instrument that is not an improvement on the earlier
 forms, and some of the improvements have passed through many
 stages before reaching their present perfection.      The original prin
 ciple adopted by    Wheatstone   remains,   but the teachings of practice
 and observation showed practical defects which have been removed,
 and so brought the instrument to what you now see. (Several items
 of general news were received on the alphabetical instrument from
 the Central Station.)    While this instrument is slow, it is sure, and,
 comparing its pioneer of 1840 to a cart-horse, may be said to be a fine
 racer. It is very useful for private purposes or at outlying offices
 where little business is done ; and many thousands of them are so
employed.
     Having succeeded so far in obtaining simplicity, Wheatstone
 turned his attention to the practicability of sending telegraphic
signals by machinery without the aid of the hand in manipulation,
and thus increasing the capacity of wires for carrying messages.
 Bain in England, Siemens in Germany, and others had been working
in a similar field, and in 1858 the genius of Wheatstone, combined
with the mechanical ingenuity of Mr. Stroh, developed au entirely new
system of automatic telegraphy on the principle of the Jacquard loom.
A paper ribbon was passed through a piece of mechanism consisting
of three keys with cutting punches, which, when pressed on the
paper, perforated it according to the key depressed. The centre
key cut a continuous row of holes, which were used to push forward
the paper. The left-hand key cut two holes directly opposite each
other, and represented the left-hand beat of a needle, or the dot of the
Morse alphabet.      The right-hand key cut two holes, one above and
one below the middle row, but in a slanting direction from left to
right, and represented the right-hand beat of a needle, or the dash of
the Morse alphabet.        The paper so perforated was then passed
through   the automatic  transmitter, the action of which   I can, perhaps,
make clear by the use of a model.
     Wheatstone's automatic instrument transmits a succession of
currents of electricity in opposite directions, and if no paper were
interposed to prevent these currents going except at the proper time,
this succession of currents would be continually transmitted.           (A
model of the transmitter was explained in detail.)        So that when no
holes present themselves to the rocking prongs for the currents to
pass through, nothing goes to line ; but if two holes, representing a
dot, present themselves, then a current passes, and a dot is produced
at the receiver ; and so, if the holes representing a dash admit the

  prongs, a dash is transmitted to the receiver. Each reversal of the
  current forms a dot, and if the reversal is stopped, a dash is formed ;
  and it is by controlling these reversals with the perforated paper that
  reversals are sent at the proper time to make the required signals.         I
  have an actual apparatus fitted up here in connection with the Central
 Station, and we will set it going and see what news is passing on the
 wire on which the instrument has been placed. At the present
 moment    I may tell you that this wire is transmitting intelligence to
 distant offices, and our instrument is placed on it so that by setting
 it going we can see for ourselves what is passing. (Odd items of
 news were read off by the assistant.)
      When Wheatstone invented this apparatus it was only workable
 at an average rate of seventy or eighty words a minute, but scientific
 training, observation, thought, and care have resulted in improving
 upon this so much that, on making inquiry yesterday morning,                 I
 found that one of our Wheatstone instruments was actually working
 at the rate of 180 or 190 words a minute.         When the Queen's Speech
 was transmitted to the country last week it was sent to several towns
in five minutes, and as it contained 800 words, the average rate was
 160.    To long distance places it is not possible, from various causes,
to maintain this high rate without the insertion of a translator or
repeater, which receives what      I may call the almost exhausted signals,
and sends them on reinvigorated to their destination.          Until recently
the rate of working between London and Cork was sixty words a
minute, but, by inserting a repeater at Haverfordwest, this speed was
doubled.     The repeater is a complicated instrument, and         I  will not
attempt to describe it. Its function, reduced to simple words, is, that
it receives the currents from London, and transmits fresh ones to
Cork. Repeaters are being generally introduced on our long circuits.
To apparatus not on Wheatstone's principle repeaters can also be
applied, and this has been done even in such complicated machinery
as the duplex apparatus.
     Wheatstone's great achievements were the needle, alphabetic, and
automatic instruments.         The first telegraph was erected on the
 Camden incline, and is now called the fossil telegraph, though it only
 dates as far back as 1837.      It consisted of five wires inserted in wood,
and five needle instruments were fitted at each end.               On recent
operations going on where this old line was laid, portions of it were
                I
dug up, and have a piece now before you.
     Here is a phetograph of an original document referring to the early
needle telegraph.       It is now reflected on the screen, and you see that
                      "
in the year 1842, under the special patronage of Her Majesty and

 in operation daily (Sundays excepted), from 9 a.m. till 8 p.m. at

and goes on to say that by this powerful agency murderers have
been apprehended, thieves detected, and lastly (which is of no little
importance), the timely assistance of medical men has been procured
in cases which would otherwise have proved fatal."        There are some
of the brilliant ideas thought of Wheatstone's telegraph in 1842.
Everyone knows of the enormous development of the telegraphs.           In
1870 the commercial part of the business was transferred to the
Government, and at that time the business done in four weeks
represented 554,000 messages.        In the four weeks just expired it was
1,900,000.      In the  metropolis alone, while the number of messages of
all sorts dealt with in four weeks in 1870 amounted to 130,000, in the
four weeks just passed there were 726,000. It is very curious to note,
in quoting these figures, that the high figure of the past few weeks is
to a large extent owing to the tremendous fogs we have had, which
were the cause of a marvellous increase in telegraph business.
Pecuniarily, therefore, from this point of view, fogs are not objection
able.   The traffic for two days at the Central Station in February,
1870, was 14,000; during the past week the average has been
40,000.
     But it is in the transmission of news where Wheatstone's telegraphic
achievements have proved of such marvellous benefit. In 1871 there
were distributed to the different papers copies of messages, some 2000
words long, others as short as 10 words, a total of 32,000.       In 1879
they amounted to nearly 50,000. The number of words delivered in
one week in 1871 was 3,598,000 ; in 1879 they amounted to nearly
6,000,000, which means 300 millions for the year, or 15,000,000
columns of ' The Times.'        There is not a town in the United King
dom possessing a daily newspaper that is not in direct communication
with London for news purposes, and by this means every man receives
at his breakfast table the latest item of news, Parliamentary or
 general, just as readily as we do in London. And all this is done by
 the Telegraph Department with the Wheatstone apparatus.          In 1870
there were only six wires used for special press purposes, now thero
are twenty-four.        Besides the million words sent a day, there are
 newspapers     in  Glasgow, Dublin, and Edinburgh that rent wires for
 themselves, fitted up with different kinds of apparatus, by which they
 transmit all the debates of the Houses, &c.
     In 1870 the number of Wheatstone alphabetical instruments was
 1200, now 5000 are in use.        There are now 151 circuits worked by
 the Wheatstone automatic apparatus, in 1870 there were only eight.
 This system has proved its superiority for the rapid despatch of news,
 and, in time, will no doubt be adopted by all countries employing the
 telegraph.     I  have not the slightest hesitation in saying that our

304                  Mr. W. H. Preece  on Wlteatslone.           [Feb. 13,
telegraphic apparatus (thanks to Wheatstane) is at the head of that
of the world, and my own impression is that the time is not far
distant when even America will take advantage of the inventions we
are now using.
     On the table before you are specimens of the telegraphic achieve
ments of Wheatstone which are worthy the attention of those who are
interested in the subject.
     One of the chief characteristics of Wheatstone was his extreme
 devotion to science.     I doubt whether anyone ever gave himself up
 so completely   to  science,  in every shape or form. He was not a
 philosopher,  nor  was  he a deep investigator ; but he was essentially
 an experimenter, and designer of delicate apparatus.           The chief
 merits of his apparatus were their wonderful originality, their refined
 beauty, their marvellous fecundity, and their eminent adaptability
 for the purposes for which they were designed.      I told you he was no
 lecturer, nor was he a prolific writer ; but he was an unrivalled con
 versationist, and those who had the pleasure of his conversation could
 never forget the lucidity with which he explained his apparatus. His
 bibliographical   knowledge was almost incredible.        He seemed to
 know every book that was written and every fact recorded, and any
 one in doubt had only to go to Wheatstone to get what he wanted.
 His power of deciphering puzzles was marvellous — it was instinct.
 A secret despatch of Charles I., that puzzled everybody since tho
 days of that monarch, was placed into Wheatstone's hands, and was
 almost instantly explained.                   I
                                  His mind, as told you, was eminently
 practical.   His powers over the forces of Nature are shown by his
 telegraphic achievements in the beauty of the apparatus before yon.
 The elegance of the design of everything Wheatstone accomplished
 must always maintain him in the very first rank of the wonderful
  geniuses of this wonderful century.

     The lecturer    began by saying that the collection of violins and
basses   now before the audience, weighing but a few ounces each,
represented several thousands of pounds worth.         The variety in shape
and style of the viol tribe, ancient and modern, showed the inox-.

and the sound of the violin. To begin with the wood.             At Brescia
makers use pear, lemon, and ash ; at Cremona, maple, sycamore, and,
of course, pine. The wood came into the markets of Mantua, Brescia,
Cremona, Venice, Milan, from the Swiss Southern Tyrol, unlimited in
supply, often mighty timbers of great age — plentiful then, scarcer
now. The makers had their pick ; they tested it for intensity and
quality.    Cut strips of wood and strike them, you will see how they
will vary in musical sound. When a good acoustic beam was found
the maker kept it for his best work.          In Joseph Guarnorius and
Stradiuarius the same pine tree crops up at intervals of years. A
good maker will patch and join and inlay to retain every particle of
tried timber.    Old wood is oddly vocal. As       I  sat in my room sur
rounded by these instruments       I could not cough or move without
ghostly voices answering me from the sixteenth, seventeenth, and
eighteenth centuries ; and even the old-seasoned backs and bellies of
unstrung violins are full of echoes."

" The violin is  made of fifty-eight or seventy pieces.   It is a miracle
of construction.   It is as light as a feather and as strong as a horse.
Wood about as thick as a half-crown, by exquisite adjustment, resists
for centuries a pressure of several hundred-weight.     The belly of soft
deal, the back of hard sycamore, are united by six ribs of sycamore,
supported by twelvo blocks with linings. The sound-bar running
obliquely under the left foot of the bridge is the nervous system of
the violin, the sound-post supporting the bridge is the soul, through
it  pass all the heart-throbs or vibrations generated between the back
and the belly ; on its position depends mellowness, tightness, or
intensity of sound. The prodigious strain of the strings is resisted
first by the arch of the belly, then by the ribs, strengthened with the
upright blocks, the pressure among which is evenly distributed by the
linings which unite them, and lastly by the supporting sound-bar and
sound-post and back."
     After describing the other parts of the instrument, Mr. Haweis
alluded to the Cremona varnish, which he described after Mr.
Charles Reado as probably a heterogeneous varnish, first of oil
with gum in solution, then of colour evaporated in spirit.                 "A
red and a yellow gum appear to have been used and combined.
Although it was said that the secret was now lost, Dod, as late as
1830, who employed the Fendts and Lott and always varnished
with his own hand, had the receipt for something very like the Cremona
varnish ; and, lately, Mr. Perkins has not only analyzed the varnish
of Joseph Guarnerius and found amber in          it,
                                                  but has himself produced
varnish   oi  an extraordinary quality.
     " The supreme interest of the violin   is not far to seek.    It lies not
only   in its simplicity, beauty, strength, subtlety, and  indestructibility,
which fit   it  for the cabinet of the collector, but       it   the king of

instruments in the hands of tho player.          It combines accent with
modification of sustained tone. The organ has sustained tone without
accent, the piano accent without sustained tone, the violin accent and
sustained tone modified at will. Within its limits          it  scientifically

                                                                      is

the fittest. On the screens you see its rough elements, which had to
be collected from the rebek, the crowth, and the rotta or guitar tribe.
About the eleventh century an instrument of the viol tribe emerged
with frets, but 150 years were required to got rid of these marplots
before even    a step towards the true viol could be made.         Before tho
end of the fourteenth century viols were made in great profusion of
every size and shape — the knee viol, the bass viol, viol de Gamba, of
which certain South Kensington specimens are before you. But tho
rise of the true violin tribe begins with the rise of modern music.
About the time when Carissimi and Monteverde — 1585-1672 — dis
covered the true octave and the perfect cadence, part singing received

  to these four divisions, the violin, tenor, bass, and later contrabasso,
 before mo, gradually separated themselves from the confused nebulte
 of viols behind me, and shone out clearly as the true planetary system
 of the musical firmament."
       After illustrating the qualities of the violin, tenor, double-bass, and
  violoncello, Mr. Haweis alluded in detail to the schools of Brescia and
  Cremona.      "Although here is an antique Duiffoprugcar (1520), the
  great Italian creators of the violin date, not from Mantua or Bologna,
  but from Brescia.       Gaspar di Salo, 1560-1610, brought down the
  tubby German viol and struck a more elegant outline and proportion.
  He was almost the inventor of violin sound; beneath his flattened
  bellies and rounded backs the muffled sob began to vanish and the
  tone is loud and full. Maggini, 1590-1640, carried on the flat form,
  lowering his ribs ; his tone is somewhat crisper and sweeter than
 Gaspar.      The Maggini model passed into the hands of Andreas
 Amati, 1520-80, who had had ample opportunity as a contemporary
 maker of old viols to study the Brescian models, and while adopting
 their gaping sound-holes and drooping corners, reverted to the raised
 model, and thus retarded the triumph of the Cremona sound. It may
 bo that the new loud fiddles seemed harsh to the monks, and wanting
 in mellowness after the soft old viols ; but the charm of power once
 intuitively grasped by the Brescians, along with the flatter model,
 only wanted the intelligence of Jerome Amati, who again brought
 down his violin bellies, leaving his brother Anthony in the old ways.
 Still the violins by the brethren, Jerome dominating, are highly
 prized.    Unfortunately they brought in the scoop on either side of
 the bridge, weakening the belly, and weakening if (as it is said)
 sweetening the tone.         The later Amati, however, narrowed tho
 Brescian sound-holes, thus retaining and prolonging their vibrations.

pointed corners, paved tho way for his great pupil, Antonius
Stradiuarius."
      After a brief account of Stradiuarius, Mr. Haweis alluded to his
four periods, which, he said, ran into each other. " For thirty years
this extraordinary man was content to work under the acknowledged
influence of N. Amati. In 1668 he sets up for himself, but copies
Nicholas till 1686 ; from 1686-94 his form fluctuates, but inclines to
the earlier Brescian model (not in the corners), grows flatter, corners
bold and full of character. In 1687 he makes the long or rather
narrow model, which he did not adhere to. In 1700-3 ho enters on
bis golden period after countless experiments. The last trace of the
Amati scoop has disappeared. Some of his finest violins of the
'grand' pattern were made 1720-25.            They have all the grace and
boldness of a Greek frieze drawn by a master's hand.             The arch of
the belly, not too flat nor too much raised, is the true natural curve

wave, flow down and seem to eddy up into the four corners, where
they are caught and refined away into these inimitable angles.         The

There is a violin of 1736, bearing date and name ; it was made in the

seldom signed his work.      Alas 1 that has been since done for him by
thousands who would be at pains to make even a respectable tub."
     Mentioning Carlo Bergonzi as the chief pupil of Stradiuarins,
Mr. Haweis alluded briefly to the other Italian schools of Venice,
Naples, &c., and then passed to the French school, dwelling on Pique
and Lupot, 1768-1824 ; the Gorman school, showing a specimen of
Jacob Steiner, 1684, but slightly touched with the Crcmonese in
                                "

attention to the fact that while France clave to Cremona from the
first, England adopted the popular German Steiner, for nearly 100
years before returning to the Italian model.
     In the course of the lecture His Eoyal Highness the Duke of
Edinburgh's fine Stradiuarius, 1728, made by the master for Count
Platen, given by him to the present Duke of Cambridge's father, and
by the present Duke to His Eoyal Highness of Edinburgh, was
exhibited — and another which, His Eoyal Highness had informed
Mr. Haweis, had belonged to the Emperor Alexander II., and was, in
fact, the property of the Kussian Eoyal Family.
     After noticing the reasons of the Cremonese supremacy as con
sisting in the selection and arrangement of wood, obedience to certain
curves and thicknesses, which would vary endlessly according to the
acoustical properties of each piece, the wood being cut thicker when
soft and thinner when hard, the varnish, the sunny climate, the
workmanship, and the lapse of years, Mr. Haweis closed the lecture
by some practical illustrations on the sound of the violin, playing a
few passages on several violins to illustrate their different qualities.

                  Sequel to the Thunderer Gun Explosion.
IT will probably be in the recollection of most of my hearers of to
night that in January, 1879, actually on the 2nd of that month, ono
                                                                  '
of the 38-ton guns in the fore turret of the ' Thunderer burst explo
sively, resulting unhappily in the death of many of those engaged in
the working of the guns ; and that, upon intelligence of this disaster
being received in England, a Committee was appointed to inquire
into the cause of the explosion.
    That Committee, of which           I  was Assessor, met at Malta (where
the 'Thunderer' was then lying), and reported.                After the report
was published, I, with the full assent of the Admiralty, delivered in
this Institution, on the 13th of June last, a lecture, the title of which
was " The ' Thunderer Gun Explosion," while that of the present
                            '
lecture is the " Sequel to the Thunderer

                                                    Gun Explosion."
     I  will call your attention to the diagram model (1) exhibited  I
at the last lecture, showing the gun in its turret, and will just re
state that the bore was 12 inches, the length of the tube 16^ feet,
or 198 inches ; that the gun was made of an internal steel tube, sur
rounded by four wrought-iron coils ; that the powder used in it was
known as P or Pebble powder, of which samples are on the table ; of
this powder two differing quantities are employed in the cartridges,
the one, the " full charge," weighs 85 Ibs., with this is used a common
shell, which     when empty weighs with its gas-check 590 Ibs.; the
other    quantity, 110 Ibs., is the "battering charge," and this is used
with   a  Palliser chilled shell, which when empty weighs with its gas-
check 700 Ibs.
     Diagrams (2) and (3) show the cartridges, with their projectiles
and gas-checks.
     The two guns in the after turret of the ' Thunderer ' were also of
 12 inches bore, but were only 35 tons in weight, the difference of
 3 tons being duo to the fact that the after turret guns were 3 feet
 shorter than the guns of the fore turret.             This extra length of the.

fore turret guns rendered it practically impossible to load them by
hand from within the turret, and thereupon it became necessary to
resort to some other means.     The plan adopted was that of depressing
the muzzle of the gun (when run in) to an angle of about 11^°, and
this enabled the muzzle to be presented to a tubular opening, or
loading tube, which when the gun was in this position formed a con
tinuation of the bore. This opening was made through the wall of
the turret, below the level of the firing port, and so low down as to be
between the main deck and the battery deck.
     When the gun was thus depressed, the cartridge was lifted up and
inserted into the loading tube, the projectile was placed on a carriage,
which was raised by hydraulic pressure to the line of the loading
tube, and then a telescopic hydraulic rammer, which had been pre
viously used as a sponger-out, was caused to move outwards against the
projectile to drive it off the carriage, and to send it and the cartridge
up the bore of the gun. The projectile was prevented from running
down the gun, in case of the ship rolling, by means of a papier-
mache disc wad placed upon the rammer head, and sent up the gun with
it. Hydraulic apparatus was also used for running the gun out, and
for running it in, when, as at drill, there was no recoil, and, to supple
ment the running in, due to the recoil, when the gun was fired.       This
same hydraulic arrangement served also to absorb any excess of recoil.
     Prior to the meeting of the Committee at Malta, and not only
subsequent to the Beport of the Committee, but up to within the last
few weeks, many persons believed that the explosion of the gun was
duo to an air space being left between the cartridge and the shot, or to
one between the shot and the wad ; and it was suggested, so far as
regards the air space between the cartridge and the shot, that it might
have been caused by the wad failing to act efficiently, and by the shot
slipping down the inclined bore of the gun towards the muzzle.
Such a supposition those who had the advantage, as        I
                                                          had, of investi
gating into the matter, knew to be without foundation, our experiments
having conclusively proved that the inclination at which the gun lay
was just that of the angle of repose of the shot, and that practically the
shot had no tendency, or but the slightest tendency, to move down
wards.    This was shown by the fact that the upward pressure of
the testing apparatus we employed, even when unweighted and when
exerting a pressure not exceeding 8 Ibs., was more than sufficient in
all cases to retain the shot in its place, while the friction of the wad
not only amounted to this 8 Ibs., but far exceeded  it,indeed it was such
as to need the exercise of the pressure given by the hydraulic rammer
to readily send the wad in. With respect to the other suggestion, that
an air space existed between the projectile and the wad, there was con
clusive evidence to show that no such space could have existed at the
time of the explosion, because  it  was demonstrated, beyond the possi
bility of doubt, that after the wad socket, by which alone the rammer
could withdraw the wad, had become detached from the wad disc, there
were repeated rammings which had sent the disc home against the shot.

 1880.]          Sequel to the Thunderer'   Gun Explosion.           311
     This same evidence was equally fatal to another class of sugges
 tions as to the cause of the explosion, namely that the wad had become
 canted in front of the projectile, which, on the gun being fired, had
 passed over the wad and converted it into a wedge of such character
 as to burst the gnn.
     Reverting to the air space suggestion, the Committee in their
 Report showed that even if air spaces had existed, the result would be
 to diminish the pressure of the powder generally, although in some
 instances, and under particular circumstances, a local pressure might
 be developed upon a narrow band of the circumference of the bore in
 the neighbourhood of the base of the projectile. A pressure, however,
 of this kind would not be such as to endanger the gun, having regard
 to the limited area over which it would act, and to the fact that this
 limited area, besides having its own inherent strength, would receive
 aid from the metal both in its rear and in its front, that in the rear
 being exposed to but a comparatively slight pressure, while that in the
 front would bo exposed to scarcely any pressure at all.
     Further, there had been the experiments on Sir Win. Palliser's gun
and the experiments by the Armstrong and Whitworth Committee
made long ago, which had shown that air spaces were not sources
of danger to a gun. Moreover, at the time of the inquiry at Malta
we had before us the fact of an air space of 4 feet having existed in
the 100-ton gun on the occasion of one of the trials at Spczzia ; and
              I                                                I
by the time had delivered my last lecture, we had had, as showed
by the diagrams, experiments made by Captain Noble on a 10-inch
gun chambered to 12 inches. In these last experiments the air spaces
varied from 2 feet to G feet. The general result was the lowering of
the pressure, but with the special result, however, when Rifle Large-
grain powder was used in lieu of the Pebble powder, of generating the
local pressure which      I  have said may be produced under certain
circumstances.     All these experiments show that, whether tho local
pressure was generated or whether it was not, the gun was uninjured.
     Other suggested causes of the explosion were, that the gun was
unfitted for ordinary use, because the materials were bad, or that it
had been injured by previous firing.
     The Committee, as you may remember, reported, for good reasons,
as it appears to mo, against all the preceding suggestions, and for
equally good reasons — the best of all reasons — the evidence afforded
by the fragments of the gun itself — gave it as their unanimous convic
tion, that the explosion had resulted from tho gun being fired while
two charges were in it.
     This judgment of the Committee,      I am glad to say, commended
itself at the time to many of those who were in possession of the
whole of the facts and who duly considered and weighed them ; but
we now know that a large number of professional men, well acquainted
with the practice of gunnery generally, but not taking the pains to
inquire into the special circumstances attending upon tho working
of the gun in the fore turret of the ' Thunderer,' were opposed to

312                       Mr. F.   J.   Bramwell.               [Feb. 27,
tbo conviction of the Committee.        They urged that, for a gun to be
inadvertently double-loaded, those who were working the gun must
be assumed to be ignorant of whether they had fired it or not, and
this they said was on the following grounds an absurdity : that it
involved their not knowing whether the gun had recoiled or not, for
the recoil would have been evidence that the gun had not missed fire,
and the want of the recoil evidence that it had missed fire, and it was
impossible there could have been any doubt upon this question of
recoil.   Further, some of them urged that it must have been known
by the noise of the report whether the gun had gone off or not ; and,
lastly, they all urged that any body of men must have noticed that the
rammer used did not send the second shot to the position that it
ought to have occupied if the gun had been empty, but that it stopped
several feet short of this.
     All these were very pertinent observations upon guns fired singly
and unprovided with hydraulic running in and out gear, and with
hydraulic telescopic loading gear ; but they were inapplicable to, and,
in the proper, but not the conventional, sense of the word, were
impertinent to, the matter under consideration.
     Let me briefly recapitulate the facts attending upon the loading
                                  '
and firing of the ' Thunderer gun.
     Two 38-ton guns in one turret, electrically coupled up to a firing
key placed in the conning tower, to which key also the two guns in
the after turret were coupled up.        On the depression of this key by
the officer in the conning tower (without any act on the part of those
in the turrets), it was intended that all four guns should be simul
taneously discharged to give a broadside.        These electric discharges
are by no means certain in their action.      At the very broadside under
consideration, one of the guns in the after turret was most certainly
not fired off, although its electrical fuse was exploded.  I  say most cer
tainly, because after the steps had been taken that were rendered
necessary by the explosion in the fore turret, the charge of this gun
 in the after turret was extracted.       There is therefore no certainty
 that because the key in the conning tower was depressed, both guns
 in the fore turret must have been discharged.
      With respect to the men in the turret knowing by the sound, or
 concussion, that the gun had been discharged, all those who have been
 present in a turret when a single gun of this size has been fired, and
 again, when two guns have been fired, will agree in saying, that the
 effect upon the ear of the firing of one gun is such, that the explosion
 of the charge of the second gun does not add to     it,  and that thusit
is  impossible to tell whether one or two guns have gone off.
     Next as regards the inward run of the gun due to recoil. In        a
 manually worked gun that part of the inward run which         is   not so
 made has to bo laboriously performed by hand, and     it   would bo soon
known whether the gun had not come in some part of its run by recoil    ;
if   ithad not, this would at onco givo evidence that the charge had
not exploded.        But with hydraulically worked guns, the valve

                               '
1880.]         Sequel to the       Thunderer1 Gun Explosion.        313
 lever is quite properly, and to save time, put into the in-running
 position directly the gun is supposed to have been discharged, and in
a very few seconds the whole work of running in is accomplished ;
and whether it has been done by hydraulic power alone, or by that
power aided by recoil, no one who does not happen to be closely
observing the first part of the inward run of the gun could
possibly tell.
     Then with respect to the rammer giving an indication, the largo
joint of a hydraulic telescopic rammer having a greater area than the
smaller one, it follows, almost as a matter of necessity, that on tho
water pressure being turned on, the large joint starts first on the
journey and carries the rammer head with the smaller joint up into
the bore of the gun, tho smaller joint not starting to run out from
 the large one until tho largo one has made tho whole of its traverse,
 and has come to rest ; and thus it is that, in the absence of some
 indicator, there is nothing to tell those who are working the rammer
 to what distance the rammer head carried on the small joint goes
 up tho bore, before it is stopped by the projectile and cartridge in
the gun.
    Thus concussion, recoil, position of rammer — all means that
persons acquainted with the working of ordinary guns would rely on
as affording information of the non-explosion of tho first charge — fail
when one is considering the question of double-loading of guns such
as those in the fore turret of the ' Thunderer,' when fired in pairs by
electricity.
    From the very outset it was felt by the Committee of investiga
tion, that notwithstanding their strong and unanimous conviction as
to tho cause of tho explosion, based upon tho evidence they them
selves had heard and the investigations they had made of the frag
ments of the gun, there was great reason to fear that the public, and
it might bo some artillerists, including naval officers, not having tho
opportunity, or not caring to incur tho necessary labour, to closely
examine into tho facts and evidence, would bo likely to reject the
conclusion arrived at by tho Committee, and would hold the belief
that the gun had exploded because the gun was dangerously near the
exploding point even when used in tho ordinary manner ; and if this
were true with respect to artillerists and naval officers, still more
likely was it to be the case with reference to the gunners and sailors,
whose education and training in all probability, as a rule, would not
be such as to enable them to weigh the evidence and to follow the
arguments based upon that evidence (even if they had access to        it)
and thus to come to a   proper conclusion upon    question such as this.
                                                   a
    It was under these circumstances that the Committee which sat at
Malta expressed their hope that the Government would devote the
fellow gun of tho one which burst, to trials of all suggested causes,
and finally to tho firing with tho double charge, so as to prove, both
negatively and affirmatively, that tho Committee were correct in the
conclusion to which they had come.

314                        Mr. F. J. Bramwell.                  [Feb. 27,
    On tho occasion of my previous lecture on this subject,      I stated
my earnest desire that tho Government would sco fit to accede to that
recommendation of the Committee, although         I  trusted it was not
needed for the satisfaction of the service at large ; but the time that
has elapsed since that lecture, has brought evidence, that there were
many who needed, to re-assure them, the indisputable proof which the
double-loading could alone afford.
    I  am glad to say, as we now all know, that this proof has been
given, and that the gun, after having been experimented with in the
modes which    I shall have occasion to detail to you presently, was
finally double-loaded and fired ; and    I for one desire to tender my
most sincere thanks to those in authority for having pursued this
course, and  I hope that everyone in this room will feel that in thus
acting the Government wcro doing no more than they were bound to
do, bearing in mind the fact that officers and men must of necessity
carry out the orders given to them, wholly irrespective of tho risk
attending upon their obedience.      It seems to me impossible for any
right-thinking man to dissent from the proposition, that under such a
state of things it is tho duty of those who are placed in a position of
authority — authority such that tho orders they give cannot be dis
puted — to satisfy those who are compelled to obey, and to convince
them by practical proof that in that obedience they incur no risk
arising from the imperfection of tho weapons put into their hands.
     I hope that this expression of satisfaction will be general among
those whose opinion is worth having, because it is easy to see that
tho time is coming when there will be those who will say, " Why was
this waste made of a valuable gun ? The Committee had stated tho
cause of bursting.     The members of it who were in England and its
Assessor said there is no doubt as to the result of tho double-loading ;
and if this were so, and it was a foregone conclusion that double-
                                                             "
loading would burst the gun, why was the gun wasted ?           Probably
among these objectors will be found those who by that time will have
forgotten, as by this time they are beginning to forget, they ever
denied that double-loading could burst a gun, and asserted that tho
bursting must have been due to some other cause.
     I once heard an eminent chemist, lecturing on the history of a
great discovery, say there were generally three stages through which
all new truths have to pass. First, It is absurd, and cannot be.
 Second, Why should it not be ? — it is as likely as not. Third, Why
do you take up our time by labouring a conclusion with which every
sensible man must agree, and always has agreed.       Or — shortly, " We
told you so."
     I have not the least doubt but that we shall find these or similar

wedging, with the exception of one or two still faithful adherents, is
now discarded as a most unlikely cause : " Absurd to suppose that a
                                                                         "
wronght-iron or steel gun could be burst with a piece of brown paper !
And with respect to the double-loading,        I  doubt not before many
weeks are over it will be found that there is nobody who did not know
from the very first that if a gun were double-loaded and fired it must
burst.    It appears to me that if it were only to bring persons into
this condition of mind, the gun has been well expended, because if the
truth be generally accepted and believed in, it matters little whether
persons remember that this desirable state of mind has been arrived at
against their previous convictions, or whether they delude themselves
into the condition of believing that they never had any other opinion
upon the subject, than that double-loading would burst the gun, and
that nothing else would.      Whatever may be the origin of the state of
 their minds, it is for the good of the service that the universal settled
 conviction should be, that the gun was strong enough for ordinary
 use, and was only burst by an extraordinary use, which in all pro
bability never will recur, and which can be made a matter practically
impossible to recur.
     Other of tho former suggested causes of the explosion, such as the
insufficiency of the gun to withstand tho effects of exploding a single
cartridge, fired in tho ordinary manner, arising either from badness of
materials, or of workmanship, or from the gun having been injured
by previous use, have practically been abandoned, and need not
occupy your time for one moment. Neither need we devote much
consideration to a novel suggested cause, which .does great honour to
the ingenuity of its author.     He says, " When pushing in a drawer of
a chest of drawers, if you push it on one side it sticks."    I am afraid
the gentleman's furniture must have been defective. " Now apply
that reasoning to the projectile in the gun ; if you push that upon
one side that would also stick, and therefore tho gun would burst."
Therefore he reflects, "    If I can but find some sufficient cause why
the projectile may have been pushed more on one side than on tho
other, my homely chest of drawers has enabled me to solve this great
problem."     He no doubt had read those exhortations " to keep your
powder dry," and it occurred to him that if dry powder wore a good
explosive, damp powder must be a less good explosive ; thereupon ho
suggests that if one side of the cartridge, say the upper side, happened
to contain a stratification of damp powder, while the other side had
dry powder, that the one side of the shot would be impelled with a
pressure greater than that which was acting on the other, tho shot
would jam, and the gun would burst.
     I will now call your attention to the tables, Diagrams (4) and (5),
which show the results of firing tho gun with air spaces between the
cartridge and the base of the projectile.     As you will sec, as many as
seven experiments were made with each of the quantities of powder,
which on all occasions was P, or pebble.        The first experiment was
made without any air space : in the subsequent experiments the pro

jcctile  was moved further and further    from the cartridge until an air
space   of 10 feet was loft.
    You will observe that the pressure,      as indicated by the crusher
gauge, decreased as the space increased, so that with the 110-lb. charge
and the Palliser shell, instead of a pressure of 21 • 8 tons per square
inch when there was not any air space, there was a pressure of only
 6 2 tons per square inch when that air space was increased to 10 feet,
  '
and with the 85-lb. charge and the common shell instead of a pressure
of 20 -2 when there was not any air space I/O ton only was exerted
 when the air space was increased to the 10 feet.
     The velocity of the shot and the recoil of the gun, it will also be
observed, diminished as the air spaces increased.
    These experiments entirely corroborated those which had been
made by Captain Noble prior to my last lecture.
    Although in the foregoing experiments with pebble powder
burning comparatively slowly, no excess of pressure was attained,
because the general diminution of pressure, owing to the enlarged
space the gases had for their expansion, more than compensated for
any increase due to ram action, yet it is perfectly possible by the use
of a small grain, or highly inflammable powder, to set up a local
pressure on the base of the shell precisely on the principle on which
a water ram acts, and precisely on the same principle as that in which
in the year 1870    I showed to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers
how steam might be caused to deliver a greater pressure than that
 which prevailed in the boiler from which the steam came.
     The question arose in the following manner. The late M. Le
Chatelier had devised a mode of arresting railway trains without the
use of breaks, by means of that which has become known as the
" Contre Vapeur " system.        This consisted in (as we engineers say)
putting the engine into "back gear," so that the pistons instead of being
propelled by the steam were converted into pump buckets forcing the
steam back into the boiler.        You may say, as many did say, that
this amounted to nothing more than that which every engine driver
does as a last resource to avoid collision — reverse the engine ; but the
reversal of an engine while in rapid motion is with an ordinary
locomotive never resorted to except in dire necessity, because there is
great danger of scoring the cylinder and the piston-rod, and of burn
ing the packing in the stuffing boxes. This arises from the rise of
temperature in the cylinders, due to the conversion of the stored-up
energy of the train into heat.       Le Chatelier was aware of this diffi
culty, and provided against it by admitting a small jet of water into
the cylinders ; this water was converted into steam, which, in common
with the steam that came from the boiler, was pumped back into it.
    The plan has had considerable use in France, but has never made
its way in this country.
     In the year 1869, however, Mr. Beattie, the then locomotive
engineer of the London and South- Western Railway, fitted one of
their engines for the purpose of trial, and      I had the opportunity of

experimenting with it in order to lay the results of the experiments
 before the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.            In making these
experiments,   I  found  to  my  astonishment  that the pressure of steam in
the cylinder was greater than that in the boiler from which the steam
 had set out. Had the difference) been only two or three pounds             I
should have attributed it to the excess needed to force the steam back
into the boiler, but the observed difference was as much as 30 lbs., and
moreover it was obvious that the true limit of pressure had not been
 reached, but that the further rise of the indicator had been stopped,
 the spring then in the indicator having been compressed to tho full
 extent of its range. My first impression was that the indicator was
out of order, although in its immediately previous use, on the engine
 when running in forward gear in the ordinary manner, it had accorded
 so completely with the pressure of steam in the boiler as to render
 such an assumption very improbable ; but on testing the indicator it
 was found to be quite accurate.         I then had to cast about for the
 causo of the phenomenon of the excess, which was revealed by the indi
 cator diagrams, enlarged copies of which diagram (6) are on the wall.
 To explain this cause    I   must refer you to the skeleton diagram (7)
 of the locomotive. From this it will be seen that the steam was taken
 from one end of the boiler, and was then conducted by a pipe the
 whole length of the boiler to the cylinders.      When working in reverse
 gear the steam is suddenly admitted from the boilers into the cylinder
when the piston is about half-way along the cylinder ; as a result
 the steam is set in very rapid motion in the long pipe, and then upon
 the cylinder being filled, its motion is resisted, and the stored -up work
 in the weight of steam travelling at the high velocity along this pipo
 is sufficient to cause the pressure to rise in the cylinder to such a
                                                                         "
point above the pressure in the boiler as will absorb the " work in
the steam in the pipe.
    I  think   I  shall bo ablo to illustrate that which          I
                                                                mean by the
little apparatus     I have here. This is a gas-holder, now, however,
filled with air, giving, as you will see by the gauge, a statical pressuro
 of nine inches of water, which      I    must ask you to accept as the
equivalent of the pressure of the steam in the boiler.            From the
 gas-holder a horizontal pipe (the equivalent of the long pipe in
 the boiler) proceeds.      This pipe terminates in a vessel which is the
equivalent of the cylinder in the locomotive.          The pipe is shut off
from the gas-holder by a stop-cock, and is shut off from the pressuro
gauge, placed at its end, by a little valve opening outwards towards
that gauge, the gauge itself deriving its pressure from another pipe
having a small hole of connection.          On the sudden opening of the
stop-cock, I    think you will find that the air on rushing along the
pipe and filling the vessel at the end of          will not be content with

gangc to a higher point than that at which it is now standing,
although that point, bo it remembered, is that which indicates the
pressure of the air in the holder.
     This simple experiment and those made in the locomotive illus
trate the ram action of an elastic fluid, and the manner in which a
local pressure at the base of the shot may bo set up when, with a
suitable air space, a very quick burning powder is used.         But it would
be found if we were to apply pressure gauges, that this pressure is
extremely local, and as      I  have said, would not cause injury, because,
it is resisted by the strength of the ring of metal against which it
presses, and that ring is aided to resist it by the metal on each side
of this area of local effort ; which last-mentioned metal is not itself
subjected to the local pressure, and therefore has a surplus of strength
to aid its neighbour.
     I will now call your attention to Diagram (8) showing the experi
ment which was made to test the value of the other suggested cause
of explosion, namely, an air space between the projectile and the
canted wad, over which wad it was assumed the point of the projectile
might pass, thus converting the wad into a wedge and bursting the
gun. All that      I have to say about this experiment is that.tho effect
was absolutely nil, as was also an experiment made with a similar air
space, but with the wad not canted.
     With respect to the non-injurious effect of air spaces, many persons
have asked me, " How do you distinguish between the bursting of a
sporting gun from a little snow being in the barrel when the gun is
fired, and the bursting or non-bursting of the 38-ton gun with an air
space ? Are not these two states of things similar, and if the sporting
gun bursts in consequence of the air space between the charge and the
                                                                      "
snow, why should not the 38-ton gun burst with its air space ?           The
answer is, that the sporting gun is not burst by the air space but by
the snow.    I  have here two barrels which have been purposely burst
                 I
in the manner will describe to you.
     Diagram (9) shows these barrels in their burst condition.
     One of them, as you will see, is split open by a longitudinal split
of some length.       This was effected by placing a plug of wax at the
point a a shewn on the drawing, and firing a bullet against that plug.
The pressure required to put the wax instantly into motion at a
velocity equal to that of tho bullet was, of course, infinite, but, as
infinite pressures cannot be obtained, a compromise was arrived at
between the shot and the wax. The shet retained part of its energy,
and moved forward at a reduced velocity ; the wax moved forward
with the same reduced velocity ; but as even this velocity could not
be obtained instantaneously and without heavy pressure, the first effect
of the impact, on the wax, was to cause it to expand laterally, aud
thereby to burst the gun.
    The second barrel, you will see, has a ring bulge, which illustrates
very strikingly that which       I have been saying as regards local pressuro
at the base  of  a  projectile.     This ring bulge was obtained by placing

                                        '

a bullet in tho barrel, at the point b b, and by then firing at the
bullet a pellet of wax. The wax meeting the base of the bullet was
subjected to the pressure requisite to put the bullet into motion at the
velocity, whatever it was, at which the bullet was then moving, and
that pressure was sufficiently great over the small area shown to
bulge the gun in the manner in which you see it.
     There should be nothing difficult to understand in this fact of the
bursting power of a small stationary object of a character such as, under
pressure, to behave in the manner of a fluid, if we consider how the
heaviest shot, moving at the highest velocity, will, on striking a yield
ing material like water, if they are of the appropriate form, be deflected
from their lines of flight, and caused to assume an entirely different
 course. Especially is this the case with pointed projectiles.

they fell a fow feet short, and struck the water some little distance

     Let me ask you to suppose that up to the present time no shot had
ever been fired so as to come into contact with water (and that no ono

on being fired against a similar stationary shot, placed near the muzzle
of a barrel, it would not split, and yet would not be so soft as to expand
on tho collision between the two cylinders taking place, tho result
would be that the barrel would not be injured.
     After the air space and the wedge wad experiments, nothing re
mained but the firing of the gun with double-loading.          I  ought to
have said that more than one person urged thc authorities to try the
double-loading before tho canted wad experiment was made, on the
ground that as the canted wad would burst the gun, there would be no
gun left to fire double-loaded.    Tho authorities, however, having con
fidence in the Report of tho Malta Committee, did not accede to this
request, as they felt assured that after the double-loading there would
be nothing but fragments with which to experiment.
     To guard against accident very considerable precautions had to
be taken.     These wore most thoroughly carried out by the Royal
 Engineers, and were in every way successful.          The gun, provided
with a hydraulic cylinder recoil gear, was contained within a cell
constructed of upright timber sides, and a timber roof; against the
 sides sandbanks were formed, and the roof was loaded with many
 thousand bags of sand. A transverse opening was left just at the rear
 of the gun from side to side of the cell, and above this opening two
 ventilating shafts were placed.       The cell projected about 20 feet
 beyond the muzzle of the gun. There was then an opening of 4 feet,
 and beyond that another cell filled up solid with sand, into which the
 projoctiles, and any splinters of the gun that went forward, were to be
 received.    Diagram (10) shows the arrangement.
     On tho morning of the 3rd of this month, all preparations being
 complete, the gun was loaded, first with 110 lbs. charge of P. powder,
 then with a Palliser shell and gas-check, the shell being empty, then
 a disc wad.     This wad fitted so tightly into the gun as to require a
 mallet to insert it. It was rammed home with a rammer worked by
 eight or ten men, and when in place a mallet was used on the end
 of the rammer.
      Then a full charge, 85-lb. cartridge, of similar powder was put
 into the gun. Then a common shell with its gas-check, but empty,
 was inserted, and then another disc wad, which was similarly rammed
 homo.     When tho whole charge was in the gun      I  measured from the
 front of the muzzle to the front of the disc of the wad, and found I
 the front of that disc to be 84i inches from the muzzlo, or exactly fair

 as tho space occupied by the two shells, the two cartridges, and the
  two wads : allowing for the circumstance of the points of the shells
 penetrating the holes in the wads, and for the fronts of the cartridges
 being within the rim of the gas-checks, and for the front of the hinder
 wad being indented into the rear of the front cartridge, it will be
 found that the cartridges must have been occupying 8 to 4 inches less
 than the length nominally allotted, thus clearly showing that there
 was no defect in the hand ramming as practised on this occasion, such

as would cause the loading to differ from that which was effected by
the hydraulic apparatus.
     The loading being complete, those present at the experiment
retired about two hundred yards.         The gun was then fired. The
report was not very remarkable ; but it must be borne in mind that the
gun was so thoroughly enveloped in the cell that the sound was, of
necessity, much deadened.       There was a very large volume of smoke,
obviously more than would have occurred from an ordinary charge.
Some planks which were laid across the space between the two
cells were blown into the air, and these were all the indications
exterior to the chamber, that were given.
     On entering the cell it was at once seen that the gun was
utterly destroyed, the breech part with the trunnion alone being left
in position. The rest, with the projectiles, had either penetrated the
sand in front, or was lying in fragments about the cell, the sides of
which were scored.
     The gun, or rather the remains of       had recoiled the full distance

blocks which had been put there as       afinal stop, and these blocks had
their ends indented into the transverse timbers, showing that the
pressure had been very large. Moreover,          was clear from the condi

apparatus had been such as to burst the cylinder which, unlike the

of the cell at this part being literally anointed with the contents of
the cylinder. Subsequent examination has shown that the end of the
hydraulic cylinder had given way and had been opened out around
moro than half of its circumference.

of the principal portions of the recently exploded gun and of its

 and is absolutely without flaw for 3 feet 6 inches from the rear
 end ; at this point some of the cracks can be traced, but it must be
 remembered that these are cracks which do not originate here, but
 which terminate here, their point of origin having been far forward
 or under the 1 B coil.
     The second of these photographs, Diagram (13), represents the
 hinder part of the gun (but to a smaller scale), and — laid out in order,
 BO far as it has been possible as yet to determine the order — the frag
 ments of the 1 B coil, those of the front of the C coil, those of the
 B tube, and those of the steel barrel ; from this photograph you will
 see that the 1 B coil has been burst, not only in several places longi
 tudinally, but also transversely at about the middle of its length, or
just over the point to which in all probability the front charge had
 moved at the time of explosion.     You will also observe that the front
 part of the steel tube remains as a complete cylinder ; this and some
 of the pieces immediately in its rear are on the table, and you will see
from them that they have been ploughed into and deeply indented by
a cylindrical body of the bore of the gun.             I
                                                     have no doubt whatever
but that this body was the broken Palliser shell.
    I  will now ask your attention to the third of these photographs,
Diagram (14), which shows the ruins of the rear shell, the Palliser,
which, with its gas-check, is on the table.         The fourth photograph,
Diagram (15), exhibits the front part of the common shell, with its
gas-check, and part of the fragment.               I
                                                   much regret that some
extremely remarkable pieces of the rear of this shell have not been
included in the photograph ; they are however on the table and afford
very considerable information.       I  find   Ihave omitted to state that
crusher gauges were put    in the steel  tube at its base, were inserted into
the base of the Palliser shell and into that of the common shell ; these
gauges, before being put in, had been set to show no pressure below
36 tons.    The gauges at the base of the tube, and at that of the Pal
liser shell, record that this pressure of 36 tons was not exceeded, in all
probability was not reached ; but the gauge at the base of the common
shell tells a very different story.       I
                                          will ask you to refer to Diagram
(16),  which  shows  a crusher  gauge   in its working condition, and then
to compare with it Diagram (17), which shows the change that had
been made in the gauge in the base of the common shell.          The piece of
copper, the "crusher," was yielding under the pressure, and had already
collapsed as far as 40 tons, when the bottom of the shell was blown
inwards, and in being so blown in, was jammed between the walls of
the steel tube and the outside of the crusher gauge ; the pressure was
BO enormous that the cast iron of the common shell has received on
it a print of the rifling of the gun, and the cylinder containing the
pressure gauge has been contracted upon the steel piston so as to nip
it and to stop its further descent, and has thus unhappily prevented
our obtaining the true record of the pressure which did prevail.           It
has been suggested that this driving in of the base of the common
shell was due to a blow from the Palliser shell behind         it,  but most

certainly this could not have taken place until the bursting of the gun
had suffered the gases of the forward charge of powder to escape; and
further, the remains of the common shell, with its crusher gauge and
its gas-check, make it clear that no such contact took place. If the
Palliser shell had struck the common shell fairly, it would have broken
the rear end of the common shell crusher gauge to pieces. There is
not a mark upon       while it,   had struck eccentrically, as under the

clear, therefore, that the base of the common shell was driven in by
the excessive pressure of the explosion of the first charge,    pressure                  a

In fact it must bo made as shown in Diagram (18). This would have
the result of adding 12 tons to the weight of the gun, or in other
words to provide against an extremely remote probability — a proba
bility which, small as it is, can be diminished, as the Committee
pointed out, by a simple appliance, until the probability comes to the
verge of an impossibility — it is suggested that the 38-ton gun should
be made into a 50-ton gun, while only retaining the efficiency of a
38-ton gun.
     These considerations have I trust convinced you of the practical
impossibility of attempting to make a 38-ton gun fit to carry two
charges placed in the position which they would occupy when the
gun is double-loaded, even assuming that the forward charge in that
position exploded with no more effect than it would have produced if
placed at the base of the barrel, and fired in the ordinary manner. But
everything points to the conclusion that the forward one of the two
charges when fired explodes with a violence far in excess of anything
that would result from its being fired as a single charge.
     Assuming, as is most probable, that the ignition takes place from
the flash of the hinder charge, and from that alone, this flash would
 certainly proceed along every one of the rifle grooves, BO that in nine
equal spaces round about the circumference and for the whole length
of the cartridge would ignition take place, instead of its occurring at
one point only, that of the firing tube of the ordinary charge, and
further when the powder was thus fired it would be highly compressed
by the forward movement of the hinder projectile.
     The specific gravity of gunpowder without any air space whatever
may be taken at    If times that of water, or 16 cubic inches to the Ib.
The space allowed for its combustion is 30 inches to the Ib., but by
the time the cartridges are rammed home this is perhaps contracted
to 27£ inches, or in other words the space then allowed for a given
weight of powder is thus just equal to that which would be required
to contain an equal weight of water.
     Captain Noble on one occasion exploded in a close vessel, powder,
when the space it occupied was such as to represent the density of
 11 times that of water. The result was the raising of the pressure from
43 tons, which such powder had when fired in a close vessel giving a
space of 30 inches per Ib., to 59 tons, so that the diminution of space
from that which occurs with the gravity of '925 to that which occurs
with the gravity of 1 • 2 was sufficient to make an increase in pressure
of 37 per cent.
     But one knows that the front charge of powder when acted upon
by the rear shot urged forward by a pressure of some 2500 tons would
be so driven together as to obliterate practically all air space, and
thus to bring the powder up to its full specific gravity of 1| times
 that of water. The result of an explosion from powder thus com
 pressed  I do not pretend to oiler you in tons, but looking at what
 happened from the firing of powder of 1^ times the density of water,
 it is clear the pressure must be enormous. In a small gun the

 pressure would bo much reduced. Let us imagine the cartridge to
 be made up of a number of parallel cylinders of powder, each cylinder
 being 1 inch in diameter, and of the whole length of the cartridge,
 and assume that the projectile          is,
                                      in length, say      times the diameter

 of the bore of the gun. Then, in 6-inch gun, the projectile would
                                               a
be 15 inches long, and each of the imaginary cylinders of powder of
1  inch diameter would find the expansion of the gases arising from its
combustion opposed by the inertia of              cylinder of iron
                                                        a                 inch     1
diameter by 15 inches long.        But     the gun were 12 inches diameter
                                               if
of bore and the shot 2£ diameters in length, then each cylinder of
powder of      1 inch diameter would find the expansion of the gases
arising from its combustion opposed by the inertia of             cylinder of
                                                                         a
iron of 30 inches long. This circumstance should bo borne in mind
when considering the results arising from cases of double-loading
which have from timo to time occurred in comparatively                  small
cannon.
     Further, as pointed out by Mr. Osborne Reynolds, now nearly a
year ago,     it   not impossible that the front charge may have been
                   is
ignited by the rise in temperature caused by the conversion of                              a
portion of the energy in the rear projectile, into heat.         It     by no     is
means difficult to ignite gunpowder in this way.
     The bursting charge of         Palliser shell, for instance, consists of
                                     a
powder without any fuse or detonating composition to ignite                but     it
                                                                                   ;
by the striking against an armour plato the velocity of the shell            so        is
materially reduced, that the powder contained within              continuing
                                                                        it
to rush forward, strikes the front end of the shell, and by this mere
stoppage generates sufficient heat to ignite itself.
    I  have here an apparatus similar to one used by Professor Abel
many years ago to investigate this question.          Professor Abel,       am     I
glad to say,      present with us and will exhibit

point of explosion, and powder ignited at every portion of its bulk at
the same moment.
                                      I      I
    With respect to the heating, find have not called your attention
to the importance — the twofold importance — of this.        The first way
in which it is important is, that heating renders the chemical changes
which occur when the powder is inflamed more rapid, and thereby
causes the explosion to be more violent than it would be if the
temperature were not raised.              The second way in which the
heating up is important        is  owing to the fact, that, when powder
explodes,   the effect  of   the   explosion is due, not alone to the ex
pansion   which   arises  from    the  conversion of the solid into a gas,
but very largely     to  the   further   expansion which arises from the
heating up   of the  gas produced.       Anything therefore which abstracts
heat from the products of the explosion, diminishes the expansion of
the gas, and thereby diminishes the effect produced. Now, assuming
the inflaming point of gunpowdor to be about 660 degrees, and
assuming it to be of the temperature of the atmosphere, or say
60 degrees, the whole weight of gunpowder has to be heated 600
degrees before it attains the point of combustion, and this heat is
abstracted from that which would otherwise go to augment the bulk
of the gases.   I  am not speaking now of the heat requisite to convert
the solid into a gas, for that must be expended in any event, but         I
am speaking of the heat needful to raise the solid from the ordinary
temperature of the air to the temperature of ignition.
    We have again to thank Professor Abel for an experiment which
will show you the effect on the burning of powder of the rapid
abstraction of heat.
    There are here two similar pieces of pebble powder. One has
been cooled down to freezing, the other has been heated up to about
850°. On firing them you will see that while the first burns slowly,
the second burns more rapidly.
    Another mode of showing the effect arising from the abstraction
of heat was devised by Professor Abel many years ago. There is
here an exhausted receiver, containing powder at the ordinary tem
perature.    On igniting it by a wiro heated electrically up to white
ness, it will be found that the powder, instead of exploding, will burn
in the immediate neighbourhood only of the wire ; indeed, if we can
succeed in throwing the image on the screen, the powder will appear
to be boiling, and producing a vapour ; and it will not be until after
such an interval that the production of gas has partially restored
pressuro in the receiver, or nntil air is admitted, that the residue
of the powder will explode, the reason being that in the vacuous
condition existing here, the gas generated expands with great readi
ness, and takes up the heat rapidly, and this goes on until, as has

   been said, the accumulation of the gas in the receiver or the admission.*
   of air has destroyed the vacuum, and then the expansion not being so
   great, and the absorption of tho heat being correspondingly less, the
  powder explodes.
       I trust that the public, and above all the officers and men who are
  to work guns such as these on board the ' Thunderer,' • are now
  thoroughly convinced that these guns are safe, when properly used,
  and are only unsafe when, by almost a miracle of ill luck, they are
  double-loaded.      And looking at the large number of guns of this
  design of large weights and calibres which are provided for our
  turret ships and our fortifications, it is in the highest degree neces
  sary that the absolute safety of these guns should be thoroughly
 established.     They have cost much money, they have involved a large
 expenditure of time, and they are the guns on which, at the present
 moment at all events, tho country has to rely for its safety in the
 event of war.
      But it may well be, looking at the fact of the increase in the
 length of guns which is taking place, owing to the difference in the
 nature of the powder used, that muzzle loading will cease to be
 practicable with guns of the largest dimensions, and that breech
 loading will be employed.     If  this be so, then all danger of a double
 charge is done away with.
      There are, of course, many attendant difficulties, and care will
 have to bo exercised as well with a breech-loader, as with a muzzle-
 loader, and in fact one can conceive, that it will require some practice,
 or some special provision, before those who load breech-loading guns
can be taught to believe, that the shot has to bo put into the gun
point foremost, and that it has to precede the powder, and not to
follow it. But this question of breech-loaders is one upon which              I
must not further enter ; at all events, not this evening.
      It only remains for me to thank the authorities for their kindness
in allowing tho specimens from the broken gun to be exhibited here
to-night, and to thank you for the attention with which you have
listened to that which   is,   of necessity, to

                    (This lecture hag been published In full In Nature.')
  AFTER some account of the physical conditions under which life
 occurs in the deep sea, the lecturer described the improved apparatus
 for deep-sea dredging, which has been introduced since the ' Challenger'
 Expedition by Mr. Alexander Agassiz. A steel wire rope with a
 hemp core only 1-^j inch in circumference is used.                       Three or four
 hauls can be made with it in a day in depths in which only one
 would be made by the ' Challenger.'               A reversible trawl is used in the
 place of   the  old net, which was useless if it fell on its back on the
 bottom.
      All animal and plant life originated in the sea in shallow water,
 and spread thence on to the land and into the depths. Only one
 plant exists in the depths, a parasitic fungus which infests corals.
 The absence of sunlight excludes others. Many genera of all groups
 of animals and even not a few species range from the shores down to
 very great depths. One species of coral ranges from 30 to 2900
 fathoms. There are, however, certain well-marked deep-sea forms
 which are not now met with in shallow water, unless in Polar
 regions.
     There being scarcely any difference in the physical conditions of
 life from a depth of 500 fathoms downwards, the deep-sea fauna
exhibits no zones of distribution in depth. Its upper limit varies
much in position, approaching shallow water in the higher latitudes,
but even in some places in the tropics coming within 300 or possibly
100 fathoms of the surface.              It is impossible to recognize a geo
logical deposit as having been .formed in the deep sea, from the
nature of its fossil contents.
     The deep-sea fauna is world-wide in its distribution, there being

832                            Mr. H. N.   Moseley                   [March  5,
no barriers     to hinder migration.      Mr. Agassiz has dredged off the
West Indies and the          east coast of North America nearly all the
                           '
types obtained by the Challenger' all over the world.
     It is probably as correct to say that deep-sea animals have
colonized the shallower waters of the Polar regions as to say that
Arctic animals have occupied the deep sea elsewhere.
     There seems to be a close relation between the pelagic fauna and
deep-sea fauna.       There are surface-swimming representatives of most
deep- sea forms. Ehizopoda both with calcareous and arenaceous tests
live abundantly in the deep sea, and Mr. Henry Brady concludes that
the Globigerina mud is formed by animals living at the bottom, the
pelagic representatives of these bearing but a small proportion to the
main mass.
      The most important question now remaining to be solved with
regard to deep-sea life is the range of life at the various depths
between the surface and the bottom of the ocean.            At present nothing
is known with regard to this matter. Possibly there is a wide zone
between the surface and bottom devoid of life.          The lecturer described
a net which he had demised, by which this question could be deter
mined. By means of an electrical arrangement its mouth can be
opened and closed at will at any depth. Mr. Agassiz intends to make
 use of it or some similar appliance.        Some deep-sea animals possibly
 pass   their early stages   of existence at the  sea surface.
      The deep-sea basins being very probably of the remotest geo
 logical antiquity, it is remarkable that scarcely any ancient animals
 occur amongst the deep-sea fauna. Almost all the most ancient forms
 known are from comparatively shallow water ; for example, Heliopora,
 Limulus, Lingula, Trigonia, Nautilus, Amphioxus, lampreys, ganoids,
 and Cestracion.      The deep-sea fish are of modern origin, allies of the
 cod, salmon, and angler.         Scarcely a single animal of first-rate zoo
 logical  importance    has   been found in the deep sea.
      The deep sea was probably uninhabitable in early geological times,
 being highly charged with salts and gases in solution and mud in
 suspension, the results of its primitive superheated condition.
      The deep-sea animals must depend for sight entirely on the
 phosphorescent light of themselves or others. The sense of touch is
 probably mainly relied on by them.            Investigations on their organs
  of hearing might give valuable results. None have as yet been made.
       The deep-sea animals are more abundant towards the upper limit
  of their range ; the ultimate source of their food is the sea surface, or
  derived from the land and shore. Their food is probably always most
  abundant near coasts.
       Some animals are dwarfed, others enlarged by deep-sea conditions
  of life. A Pycnogonid was obtained measuring two feet in length.
       The usual parasites have accompanied their hosts into deep
  waters.
       Some deep-sea    animals are brilliantly coloured, having retained
  colours which were effective in shallow-water ancestors ; but colours

are often useless to the animals possessing them as such, and may be
merely accidental properties of chemical compounds required for
other physiological purposes.     A large bottle full of a solution of the
bright red colouring matter of a deep-sea Pentacrinus was exhibited
to the audience, and the light was also thrown on the screen through
cells containing the solution. It is green when alkaline, red when
acid, and yields well-marked absorption-bands in the spectrum, which
were shown upon the screen.        Other colouring matters of deep-sea
animals yield well-defined absorption spectra, and are hence easily
identified.  In several instances the lecturer has proved them to be
identical with these of allied shallow-water or pelagic forms.
    The lecture was illustrated by numerous photographic figures
thrown upon the screen.

      The Dynamo-Electric    Current and some       of its Applications.
                                (Abstract.)
THE lecturer commenced with a reference to Faraday's great dis
covery of the magneto-electric or induced current, which was first
shown to the members of the Eoyal Institution in 1831.              So slight
and instantaneous was the current, that although Faraday had from
a priori reasoning arrived as early as 1824 at the conclusion that such
a current must be set up in a coil surrounding an armature, when the
latter was forcibly severed from a permanent magnet, seven years
elapsed before he could detect that current with the instruments then
at his command.
     It was further shown that although each induced current was feeble
and only instantaneous in its action, it differed from a galvanic current
in the important particular that it was the immediate outcome of the
expenditure of mechanical force, and that by repeating the operation of
severance by suitable mechanical arrangements a rapid succession and
an aggregation of these currents could be directed through a metallic
conductor, and produce in it all the phenomena of a continuous current
of great magnitude. The single current revealed by Faraday's original
experiment might be likened to the single drop of rain, which, though
impuissant by itself, was, when repeated often enough in its fall upon
an elevated plateau, capable of giving rise to streamlets and streams,
until at last a mighty river and a source of power, such as the Falls
of Niagara, might be produced. It was shown by experiment that the
single current resulting from the forcible severance of an armature
from its magnet was capable, if directed through the coils of another
armature in contact with its own magnet, of effecting its severance
from the same ; and that the force expended bore a definite* relation
to the force obtained in moving the second armature.             In viewing
this experiment by the light of advanced science it followed that in
this way the conversion of mechanical force into electric current, and

 1880.]        on Applications   of the Dynamo-Electric Current.           335
from electric current back into mechanical force, was clearly demon
 strated.
      The utilization of the induced current had, however, been a work
of much time and thought on the part of those who followed in the
wake of the great discoverer.         One of the first attempts to utilize the
magneto-electric     current   in  telegraphy  was made by Wheatstone in
1844, when ho brought out his magneto-electric step-by-step instru
ment.      But, notwithstanding the great ingenuity displayed in the
same, the current induced was found practically insufficient to move
the receiving instrument with a sufficient degree of certainty.
      An important    step towards aggregating     magneto-electric currents
was made by
                                                                  I
                 Dr. Werner Siemens in 1856, who constructed an arma
ture resembling in section a double-headed rail, or double
hollow of which the insulated wire was wound longitudinally. In
                                                                    , into the
mounting this armature upon bearings, and giving it a rapid rotation
between the poles of a series of permanent magnets, an accumulative
effect was produced through the simultaneous action of each perma
nent magnet in setting up a current in one and the same coil ; thus a
succession of currents was set up, which, when directed by means of
a commutator into an outer metallic circuit, was capable of producing
a continuous      current of considerable power.          A magneto-electric
step-by-step instrument constructed on this principle was shown in
operation, and also a more powerful arrangement of the same descrip
tion for exploding mines, and for igniting platinum wire. It was
 also shown that in turning the handle of such a machine, and con
necting its leading wires to another similar machine, motion was set
up    in the latter, and sufficient force was obtained    to work a ventilator
with considerable effect.
       The magneto-electric machines of Holmes and Wilde were next
passed in review, which it was shown marked a further step towards
the attainment of powerful effects by the accumulation of magneto
currents when steam power was employed for their production.
       The dynamo-electric principle attributable to Werner Siemens
 and Wheatstone was next adverted to, and the first machine con
 structed on this principle by the lecturer, and brought by him before
 the Eoyal Society in 1867, was shown in operation.             This machine
 differed from magneto-electric arrangements in the substitution of
 electro - magnets for permanent or steel magnets, which electro
 magnets were excited by the current produced by the rotation of
 the helix or armature of the machine itself.          The advantage of the
 machine consisted in the accumulative action it evolved, giving rise to
 currents of considerable magnitude which were strictly proportionate
 to the mechanical power expended.
       The adaptations of this accumulative principle by Professor
  Facinotti, by Gramme, by von Heftner-Alteneck,             and others, were
  alluded to, leading up to a recent modification of the dynamo- electric
  machine by the lecturer, by which a further increase in the strength
  of current and improved steadiness of action could be realized. The

 336                     Dr. C. William   Siemens             [March 12,
 form of the machine was not materially         altered by this change,
 which consisted in so arranging the wire on the rotating helix and on
 the exciting electro-magnets, that the maximum current produced for
 the power expended was attained when the outer resistance was such
 as was usually required.
      Amongst the applications of the dynamo-electric current, the
 lecturer showed in the first place that of the transmission of power,
 illustrating this portion of his subject by working a circular saw,
 receiving its motion from a dynamo-electric machine (constructed
 according to the modified plan alluded to) placed in the basement
 of the Royal Institution and receiving motive power in its turn from
 a gas engine.    It was shown that by such an arrangement 60 per
 cent, of the engine power expended could be utilized at another
 place, and that thus natural sources of power, such as waterfalls,
 might be made available for supplying motive power at distances even
 of twenty or thirty miles; or power might be transmitted to the
 depths of mines and collieries by the establishment of a stout leading-
 wire connected with an electro-motor on the bank.
      The lecturer next described a novel application of the dynamo-
electric current for the propulsion of tramway cars upon railways, by
 preference upon elevated railways.      Dr. Werner Siemens had made
such an application very successfully last year in connection with a
 Berlin Exhibition, and the experiment would very shortly be repeated
at the Crystal Palace.    One of the carriages composing the train was
fitted with an ordinary dynamo machine, and another similar machine
was worked on terra firma by engine power.         A central rail or con
ducting rope was introduced for the conveyance of the current, the
return circuit being completed through the side rails, and the person
in chargo on the train could by moving a handle start and stop the
train as required.    The tractive force was considerable, and increased
with the resistance, amounting in ascending an incline to 200 kilo
grammes, and falling to 70 or 80 kilogrammes on level ground.
From thirty to forty persons wero conveyed easily at a speed of from
ten to twelve miles an hour.
     Dr. Siemens explained that whenever a current was passed through a
conductor, a loss was incurred varying as the square of the intensity of
the current and as the resistance encountered, but that what was loss
of current when the object was the simple transfer of electrical energy
might be turned into a gain where light and heat were to be produced.
Platinum and iridium were notoriously bad conductors, and on putting
a piece of wire of these metals into a circuit they become hot and
luminous, as was well known.        It would readily be conceived that
the greater the electrical resistance in any one point of a circuit the
greater must be the luminosity produced, and Sir Humphry Davy
had shown as far back as 1810, before the Royal Institution, that
the greatest local resistance, and the highest degree of heat and
luminosity, could be produced in the electric arc between two carbon
electrodes placed a short distance apart.

     The electric light was therefore no novelty ; but the interest
attaching to it at the present time was entirely due to the compara
tively cheap rate at which the electric current could be produced by
the expenditure of mechanical energy resulting from the combustion of
coal, whereas formerly zinc had to be consumed or burnt in the gal
vanic battery.     Much ingenuity had been displayed of late in devising
electric lamps and electric candles, the various devices proposed
having for their object to produce a steady action. These might be
divided into two classes — the glow lights, and the regulators of the
 electric arc.     It was shown that glow lights furnished the most
simple solution of the problem, but could never rival the arc in
economy of result, because the intensity of the latter could be made
to approach that of solar light, whereas glow lights were limited
in intensity to the fusing or dispersing point of the conductor em
ployed.
     It had been proved that even in the electric arc the major portion
of the rays emitted were heat rays, but in the best glow light pro
bably not more than 2 or 3 per cent, were rays of high luminosity,
all the rest being lost as regards the effect to be produced. It was also
shown that greater efficiency could be obtained from a powerful arc
than from divided arcs, and that therefore the development of electric
lighting should be Bought in the direction of creating powerful centres
 of light, and not in its subdivision.
      Electric light, properly applied, was much cheaper than gas light,
but was not likely to supplant the latter for purposes where great
subdivision was indispensable ; besides which, gas was essentially
a heating agent, and would find ever-increasing application in that
direction.
     The sensitiveness of gas shares to the announcements of mere
varieties of glow lights showed that the principles upon which electric
lighting depended were not sufficiently appreciated. The regulation
of the electric arc to the varying conditions of current and to imper
fections in the carbons was, however, a matter of practical difficulty,
which admitted of an almost unlimited number of solutions.               The
question was which practical combination was at the same time the
most simple and efficient.        The lecturer had himself worked out
several solutions, one of which recommended            itself by its absence
of all clockwork arrangement in making the advancing carbons abut
against a fixed metallic stop.           Other solutions might, however,
have their particular advantages,         but it was not the purpose of
his present lecture to enter upon a consideration of such details of
arrangement.
     The electric light, if properly carried into effect, was a cheap light.
By burning, for instance, a thousand cubic feet of gas in burners, and
consuming the same quantity in a gas engine, giving motion to a
dynamo-electric machine feeding an electric light, it could be shown,
as the lecturer had done before the House of Commons Committee
on Lighting by Electricity, that about twenty times the luminous effect

would be produced in the latter case.              In practical working, the
difference would not be so great, owing to the imperfect arrange
ments as yet adopted ; but he could show, from actual experience
extending over several months, that electric illumination if applied
to halls, and places of a certain magnitude, was three or four times
cheaper than gas lighting.
     The application of the dynamo-electric current next dealt with
was that of the fusion of metals and other substances.          Sir Humphry
Davy    had  as  early as 1810   obtained  in  the electric arc sufficient heat
to decompose potash, and Professor Dewar in experimenting with the
dynamo-electric current had shown recently that in his lime tube or
crucible several of the metals assumed the gaseous condition as
shown by the reversal of the lines in his spectrum, thus proving that
the heat obtained by him was not much inferior to solar heat.
      The lecturer had experimented for some time with an electric
furnace, not with a view of attaining these extreme degrees of heat,
 but rather with the practical object of melting such refractory
 materials as platinum, iridium, and steel in considerable quantities.
He was led to these experiments by the consideration that a good
steam engine converted nearly 15 per cent, of the heat energy residing
 in coal into mechanical effect, and that by the dynamo-electric machine
 nearly 80 per cent, of that mechanical energy could be converted
 into electric energy.      If  this could be expended without loss within
 an electric    furnace   or  crucible,  12 per cent, of the total energy
 residing   in  the  coal would    be conveyed to the refractory material to
 be melted at any degree of temperature required, and such a result
 would far exceed in economy that of the best furnaces yet
 constructed.
      In the small furnace placed before the meeting, the positive
  electrode (of iron) entered from below a crucible containing the
  metal to be melted, whereas the negative electrode was in the shape
  of a rod of carbon, or of a metal tube cooled by a current of water,
  which, descending through the crucible cover, was attached by means
  of a lever to a solenoid regulator. The crucible was packed in char
  coal or other non-conducting material contained in a copper vessel to
  prevent loss of heat, and so great was the heat accumulated within
  the crucible, that in the course of about twenty minutes a kilogramme
  of broken files was completely melted. The arrangement was such
  that it could easily be applied upon a larger scale, and electric fusion
  had the great advantage that the access of the atmosphere and of the
  products of combustion to the substance under treatment was entirely
  prevented.
      Another application of the electric arc which the lecturer thought
  might ultimately assume an important character was to horticulture.
  Having experimented with an electric light of 1400 candle power in
  his own greenhouses at Sherwood, near Tunbriclge Wells, he had
  arrived at the conclusions that electric light promoted the formation
  of chlorophyll, starch, and cellulose in plants, and could be made

1880.]      on Applications  of the Dynamo-Electric   Current.       339
nearly equal  to daylight in its beneficial effects upon them ; that tho
plants  did not  require a time of rest by night, but became all the
more rigorous if put under the influence of day and electric light
alternately without intermission, and that the development of flowers
and the ripening of fruit would be greatly accelerated and improved
through the action of electric light.        Various plants, including
mustard, carrots, peas, roses, lilies, and strawberries with the fruit
partially developed were exhibited, a portion of which had been
exposed to daylight only, another to electric light only, being kept in
the dark during the daytime, and a third portion to day and electric
light, which clearly justified the conclusions already stated.
    The cost of electric light in this application, if steam had to be
used for its production, would no doubt be considerable, but not too
great probably to prevent its being employed for forcing early
vegetables and fruits ; but its cost would be quite inconsiderable in
situations where water power could be made available.
     Other applications of the dynamo-electric current for electro-
 decomposition, photography, and telegraphy, could only be alluded
to by the lecturer, but enough had been said, ho thought, to show the
extraordinary uses to which Faraday's great discovery made fifty
years ago was likely to lead.

        GEORGE   BUSK, Esq. F.R.S. Treasurer and Vice-President,

                    PROFESSOR    TyNDALL, D.C.L. F.K.S.
                          Goethe's ' Farbenlehre.'
 IN  the days of my youth, when life was strong and aspiration high,
 I found   myself standing one fine summer evening beside a statue of
 Goethe in a German city.         Following the current of thought and
 feeling started by the associations of the place,     I  eventually came to
 the conclusion that, judging even from a purely utilitarian point of
 view, a truly noble work of art was the most suitable memorial for
 a great man.     Such a work appeared to me capable of exciting a
 motive force within the mind which no purely material influence could
 generate.   There was then labour before me of the most arduous kind.
 There were formidable practical difficulties to be overcome, and very
 email means wherewith to overcome them, and yet              I  felt that no
 material means could, as regards the task         I  had undertaken, plant
 within me a resolve comparable with that which the contemplation of
 this statue of Goethe was able to arouse.
      My reverence for the poet had been awakened by the writings of
 Mr. Carlyle, and it was afterwards confirmed and consolidated by the
 writings of Goethe himself.        But there was one of the poet's works,
 which, though it lay directly in the line of my own studies, re
 mained for a long time only imperfectly known to me. My opinion
 of that work was not formed on hearsay.            I  dipped into it so far
 as to make myself acquainted with its style, its logic, and its general
 aim ; but having done this    I  laid it aside, as something which jarred
 upon my conception of Goethe's grandeur.              The mind willingly
 rounds off the image which it venerates, and only acknowledges with
 reluctance that it is on any side incomplete ; and believing that
 Goethe in the 'Farbenlehre' was wrong in his intellectual, and
 perverse in his moral, judgments — seeing above all things that he had
 forsaken the lofty impersonal calm which was his chief characteristic,
 and which had entered into my conception of the god-like in literature —
 I abandoned the ' Farbenlehre,' and looked up to Goethe on that side
 where his greatness was uncontested and supreme.

1880.]                      on Ooetlie's ' Farbenlehre.'                           341
     But in the month of May, 1878, Mr. Carlyle did me the honour
of calling upon me twice ; and I, not being at home at the time, visited
him in Chelsea soon afterwards.                Ho was then in his eighty-third
year,   and  looking   in  his  solemn     fashion   towards that portal to which
we   are all  so rapidly hastening,       he  remembered      his friends. He then
presented    to  me,  as "a  farewell     gift," the  two  octavo  volumes of letter
press   and  the  single  folio  volume,     consisting   in  great part of coloured
diagrams,     which   are  here    before    you.     Exactly   half a century ago
these volumes were sent by Goethe to Mr. Carlyle,                      They embrace
the ' Farbenlehre,' — a title which may be translated, theugh not well
                                        '
translated, ' Theory of Colours — and they are accompanied by a long
letter, or rather catalogue, from Goethe himself, dated the 14th of
June, 1830, a little less than two years before his death.                  My illus
trious friend wished me to examine the book, with a view of setting
forth what it really contained.             This year for the first time       I  have
been able to comply with the desire of Mr. Carlyle ; and as                   I  knew
that your wish would coincide with his, as to the propriety of making
some attempt to weigh the merits of a work which exerted so great
an influence in its day,*       I have not shrunk from the labour of such a
review.
      The average reading of the late Mr. Buckle is said to have
amounted to three volumes a day. But they could not have been
volumes like those of the ' Farbenlehre.'              For the necessity of halting
and pondering over its statements was so frequent, and the difficulty
of coming to any undoubted conclusion regarding Goethe's real
conceptions was often so groat, as to invoke the expenditure of an
 inordinate amount of time.           I   cannot even now say with confidence
 that  I fully realize all the thoughts of Goethe. Many of them are
strange to the scientific man.            They demand for their interpretation
a sympathy beyond that required, or even tolerated, in severe physical
 research.     Two factors, the one external and the other internal, go to
 the production of every intellectual result.                There is the evidence
 without and there is the mind within on which that evidence impinges.
 Change either factor, and the result will cease to be the same. In the
 region of politics, where mere opinion comes so much into play, it is
 only natural that the same external evidence should produce different
 convictions in different minds.             But in the region of science, where
 demonstration instead of opinion is paramount, such differences ought
hardly to be expected.            That they nevertheless occur is strikingly
exemplified by the case before us ; for the very experimental facts
 which had previously converted the world to Newton's views, on
appealing to the mind of Goethe, produced a theory of light and
colours in violent antagonism to that of Newton.
     * The late  Sir Charles Eastlake translated a portion of the ' Farbenlehre ' ;
 while the late   Mr. Lewes, in his ' Life of Goethe,' has given a brief, but very
clever account   of the work. It is also dealt with, in connection       with Goethe's
other scientific labours, in Ilelmheltz's Lectures.

342                             Professor Tynddl                    [March   19,
                                               '
     Goethe prized the ' Farbonlehro             as the most important of his
works.                   I
           " In what have done as a poet," he says to Eckermann, "             I
take no pride, but      I  am proud of the fact that      I am the only person
in this century who is acquainted with the difficult science of colours."
If the importance of a work were to bo measured by the amount of
conscious labour expended in its production, Goethe's estimate of
                      '
the ' Farbenlehre       would probably be correct.         The observations and
experiments there recorded astonish us by their variety and number.
The amount of reading which he accomplished was obviously vast.
He pursued the history of optics, not only along its main streams, but
on to its remotest rills.       Ho was animated by the zeal of an apostle,
for ho believed that a giant imposture was to bo overthrown, and that
he was the man to accomplish the holy work of destruction.               He was
also a lover of art, and held that the enunciation of the true principles
of colour would, in relation to painting, be of lasting importance.
Thus positively and negatively he was stimulated to bring all the
strength he could command to bear upon this question.              The greater
part  of  the  first volume    is taken   up   with Goethe's  own  experiments,
which are described in 920 paragraphs duly numbered. It is not a
consecutive argument, but rather a series of jets of fact and logio
emitted at various intervals.        I picture the poet in that troublous war
time, walking up and down his Weimar garden, with his hands behind
his back, pondering his subject, throwing his experiments and re
flections into these terse paragraphs, and turning occasionally into his
garden house to write them down. This first portion of the work
embraces three parts, which deal respectively with : Physiological or
Subjective Colours, with Physical or Prismatic Colours, and with
Chemical Colours and Pigments.              To these are added a fourth part,
bearing the German title,
                                   " Allgemeine Ansichten nach innen"; a
fifth part, entitled " Nachbarliche Verhaltnisse," neighbouring rela
tions ; and a sixth part, entitled " Sinnlich-sittliche Wirkung der
Farbo," sensuously-moral effect of colours. It is hardly necessary
to remark that some of these titles, though doubtless pregnant with
meaning to the poet himself, are not likely to commend themselves
to the more exacting man of science.
     The main divisions of Goethe's book are subdivided into short sec
tions, bearing titles more or less shadowy from a scientific point of view :
Origin of white ; Origin of black ; Excitement of colour ; Heighten
ing ; Culmination ; Balancing ; Reversion ; Fixation ; Mixture real ;
Mixture apparent ; Communication actual ; Communication apparent.
He describes the colours of minerals, plants, worms, insects, fishes,
birds, mammals, and men.           Hair on the surface of the human body
ho considers indicative rather of weakness than of strength.                The
 disquisition    is  continued    under    the   headings:   How  easily  colour
arises ; How energetic colour may be ; Heightening to red ; Complete
ness of manifold phenomena ; Agreement of complete phenomena ;
How easily colour disappears ; How durable colour remains ; Relation
to philosophy ; Relation to mathematics ; Relation to physiology and

pathology ; Relation to natural history ; Relation to general physics ;
Relation to tones.      Then follows a series of sections dealing with
the primary colours and their mixtures.        These sections relate less
to science than to art.      The writer treats, among other things, of :
Esthetic effects ; Fear of the Theoretical ; Grounds and Pigments ;
Allegorical, Symbolical, and Mystical use of colours. The headings
alone indicate the enormous industry of the poet; showing at the same
time an absence of that scientific definition which he stigmatized as
" pedantry " in the case of Newton.
     In connection with his subject, Goethe charged himself with all
kinds of kindred knowledge. He refers to ocular spectra, quoting
Boyle, Buffon, and Darwin ; to the paralysis of the eye by light ; to
its extreme sensitiveness when it awakes in the morning ; to irradia
tion — quoting Tycho Brahe on the comparative apparent size of the
dark and the illuminated moon.          He dwells upon the persistence of
impressions upon the retina, and quotes various instances of abnormal
duration. He possessed a full and exact knowledge of the phenomena
of subjective colours, and described various modes of producing
them. He copiously illustrates the production by red of subjective
green, and by green of subjective rcxl.         Blue produces subjective
yellow, and yellow subjective blue. He experimented upon shadows,
coloured in contrast to surrounding light.         The contrasting sub
jective colours he calls " geforderte Farben," colours " demanded
                                                                          "
 by the eye.    Goethe gives the following striking illustration of these
 subjective effects.    I"   once," he said, " entered an inn towards
evening, when a well-built maiden, with dazzlingly white face, black
 hair, and scarlet bodice and skirt came towards me.          I  looked at
her sharply in the twilight, and when she moved away, saw upon
 the white wall opposite a black face with a bright halo round          it,
 while the clothing of the perfectly distinct figure appeared of         a
 beautiful sea-green." With the instinct of the poet, Goethe dis
 cerned in these antitheses an image of the general method of nature.
 Every action, he says, implies an opposite. Inhalation precedes
 expiration, and each systole has its corresponding diastole.         Such
is  the eternal formula of life. Under the figure of systole and diastole
 the rhythm of nature  is   represented in other portions of his work.
      Goethe handled the prism with great skill, and his experi
 ments with it   are numberless.    He places white rectangles on black
                                                                  a
 ground,  black  rectangles  on  a white ground, and shifts their apparent
 positions by prismatic refraction.     He makes similar experiments with
 coloured rectangles and discs.         The shifted image    is sometimes
¦projected on  a    screen, the experiment being then ''objective."      It
 is sometimes looked at directly through the prism, the experiment
 being then
               " subjective." In the production of chromatic effects,
 he dwells upon the absolute necessity of boundaries — " Granzen."
 The sky may be looked at and shifted by prism without the pro
                                                   a
 duction of colour ;    and if  the white rectangle on   ablack ground be
 only made wide enough, the centro remains white after refraction, the

colours being confined to the edges.        Goethe's earliest experiment,
which led him so hastily to the conclusion that Newton's theory of
colours was wrong, consisted in looking through a prism at the white
wall of his own room. He expected to see the whole wall covered
with colours, this being, he thought, implied in the theory of Newton.
But to his astonishment it remained white, and only when he came to
tho boundary of a dark or a bright space did the colours reveal them
selves. This question of "boundaries" is one of supreme importance
to tho author of the ' Farbenlehre
                                       '
                                         ; the end and aim of his theory-
being to account for the coloured fringes produced at the edges of his
refracted images.
      Darkness, according to Goethe, had as much to do as light with
 (lie production of colour.   Colour was really due to the commingling
of both. Not only did his white rectangles upon a black ground
yield the coloured fringes, but his black rectangles on a white ground
did the same.     The order of the colours seemed, however, different in
the two oases. Let a visiting card, held in the hand between the eye
and a window facing the bright firmament, be looked at through a
prism, then supposing the image of the card to be shifted upwards by
refraction, a red fringe is seen above and a blue one below.       Let the
back be turned to the window and the card so held that the light
shall fall upon it ; on being looked at through the prism, blue is seen
above and red below.        In the first case the fringes are due to the
decomposition of the light adjacent to the edge of the card, which
simply acts as an opaque body, and might have been actually black.
In the second case tho light decomposed is that coming from the
surface of the card itself.    The first experiment corresponds to that
of Goethe with a black rectangle on a white ground ; while the
second experiment corresponds to Goethe's white rectangle on a black
ground.     Both these effects are immediately deducible from Newton's
theory of colours.     But this, though explained to him by physicists
of great experience and reputation, Goethe could never be brought to
Bee, and he continued to affirm to the end of his life that the results
were utterly irreconcilable with the theory of Newton.
      In his own explanations Goethe began at the wrong end, invert
ing the true order of thought, and trying to make the outcome of
theory its foundation.     Apart from theory, however, his observations
are of great interest and variety.       He looked to the zenith at raid-
night, and   found before  him  the blackness  of space, while in daylight
he saw the blue firmament overhead ; and he rightly adopted the
conclusion that this colouring of the sky was due to the shining of
the sun upon a turbid medium with darkness behind.              He by no
means understood the physical action of turbid media, but he made
a great variety of experiments bearing upon this point.         Water, for
example, rendered turbid by varnish, soap, or milk, and having a black
ground behind   it,  always appeared blue when shone upon by white
light. When, instead of black background, a bright one was placed
                          a
behind, so that the light shone, not on, but throtigh the turbid

liquid, the blue colour disappeared, and he had yellow in its place.
Such experiments are capable of endless variation.      To this class
of effects belongs the painter's " chill."    A cold bluish bloom,
like that of a plum, is sometimes observed to cover the browns of
a varnished picture.   This is due to a want of optical continuity
in the varnish. Instead of being a coherent layer it is broken up
into particles of microscopic smallness, which virtually constitute a
turbid medium and send blue light to the eye.
    Goethe himself describes a most amusing illustration, or, to use
his own language, " a wonderful phenomenon," due to the temporary
action of a turbid medium on a picture.      " A portrait of an esteemed
theologian  was  painted  several years ago by an artist specially skilled
in the treatment of colours. The man stood forth in his dignity clad
in a beautiful black velvet coat, which attracted the eyes and awakened
the admiration of the beholder almost more than the face itself.
Through the action of humidity and dust, however, the picture had
lost much of its original splendour. It was therefore handed over to a
painter to be cleaned, and newly varnished. The painter began by
carefully passing a wet sponge over the picture. But he had scarcely
thus removed the coarser dirt, when to his astonishment the black
velvet suddenly changed into a light blue plush; the reverend gentle
man acquiring thereby a very worldly,         if,
                                               at the same time, an old-
fashioned appearance.      The painter would not trust himself to wash
further. He could by no means see how bright blue could underlie
                                               a
a dark black, still less that he could have so rapidly washed away      a
coating capable of converting     a  blue like that before him into the
black of the original painting."
     Goethe inspected the picture, saw the phenomenon, and explained
it. To deepen the hue of the velvet coat the painter had covered       it
 with    special varnish, which, by absorbing part of the water passed
over it, a
         was converted into   a turbid medium, through which the black
behind instantly appeared as blue. To the great joy of the painter,
he found that      few hours continuance in
                   a                               dry place restored the
                                                    a
primitive black.     By the evaporation of the moisture the optical
continuity of the varnish (to which essential point Goethe does not
refer) was re-established, after which        ceased to act as
                                             it                 a   turbid
medium.
    This question of turbid media took entire possession of the poet's
mind.   It was ever present to his observation. It was illustrated by
the azure of noonday, and by the daffodil and crimson of the evening
sky.   The inimitable lines written at Ilmenau —

of fine smoke from the foresters' cottages to rise high into the air.
He would thus have an opportunity of seeing the upper portion of
the column projected against bright clouds, and the lower portion
against dark pines, the brownish yellow of the one and the blue of
the other being strikingly and at once revealed. He was able to
produce artificially at will the colours which he had previously
observed in nature. He noticed that when certain bodies were incor
porated with glass this substance also played a double part, appearing
blue by reflected and yellow by transmitted light.*
     The action of turbid media was to Goethe the ultimate fact — the
                                              " We see on the one side Light
 UrpTidnomen — of the world of colours.
and on the other side Darkness.          We bring between both Turbidity,
and from these opposites develop all colours."              As long as Goethe
remained in the region of fact his observations are of permanent
value. But by the coercion of a powerful imagination he forced his
turbid media into regions to which they did not belong, and sought
to overthrow by their agency the irrefragable demonstrations of
Newton.      Newton's theory, as known by everybody, is that white
light is composed of a multitude of differently refrangible rays,
 whose coalescence in certain proportions produces the impression of
 white.    By prismatic analysis these rays are separated from each
other, the colour of each ray being strictly determined by its re-
 frangibility. The experiments of Newton, whereby he sought to
 establish this theory, had long appealed with overmastering evi
 dence to every mind trained in the severities of physical investiga
 tion.   But they did not thus appeal to Goethe. Accepting for the
 most part the experiments of Newton, he rejected with indignation
 the conclusions drawn from them, and turned into utter ridicule the
 notion that white light possessed the composite character ascribed to
 it. Many of the naturalists of his time supported him, while among
 philosophers Schelling and Hegel shouted in acclamation over the
 supposed defeat of Newton.          The physicists, however, gave the poet
 no countenance. Goethe met their scorn with scorn, and under his
 lash these deniers of his theory, their Master included, paid the
 penalty of their arrogance.
      How, then, did he lay down the lines of his own theory ? How,
 out of such meagre elements as his yellow, and his blue, and his
 turbid medium, did he extract the amazing variety and richness of the
 Newtonian spectrum?           Here we must walk circumspectly, for the
 intellectual atmosphere with which Goethe surrounds himself is by
 no means free from turbidity. In trying to account for his position,
  we must make ourselves acquainted with his salient facts, and en
  deavour to place our minds in sympathy with his mode of regarding
  them. He found that he could intensify the yellow of his transmitted
  light by making the turbidity of his medium stronger. A single

sheet of diaphanous parchment placed over a hole in his window-
shutter appeared whitish. Two sheets appeared yellow, which by
 the addition of other sheets could be converted into red. It is
quite true that by simply sending it through a medium charged
with extremely minute particles we can extract from white light a
ruby red. The red of the London sun, of which we have had such
fine and frequent examples during the late winter, is a case to some
extent in point.        Goethe did not believe in Newton's differently
refrangible rays. He refused to entertain the notion that the red
light obtained by the employment of several sheets of parchment
was different in quality from the yellow light obtained with two.
The red, according to him, was a mere intensification — " Steigerung " —
of the yellow. Colours in general consisted, according to Goethe, of
light on its way to darkness, and the only difference between yellow
and red consisted in the latter being nearer than the former to its
final goal.
      But how in the production of the spectrum do turbid media come
into play ? If they exist, where are they ? The poet's answer to
this question is subtle in the extreme.            He wanders round the
answer before he touches           it,
                                     indulging in various considerations
regarding penumbrre and double images, with the apparent aim of
breaking down the repugnance to his logic which the mind of his
reader   is only too likely to entertain.   If  you place a    white card near
the surface of    a piece of plate-glass, and look obliquely at the image
of the card reflected from the two surfaces, you observe two images,
which are hazy at the edges and more dense and defined where they
overlap.     These hazy edges Goethe pressed into his service as turbid
media.     He fancied that they associated themselves indissolubly with
his refracted rectangles — that in every case the image of the rectangle
was accompanied by      a    secondary hazy image,   a   little in advance of
the principal one. At one edge, he contended, the advanced secondary
image had black behind       it, which was converted into blue while at
                                                                      ;
the other edge    it  had white behind    it,and appeared yellow.        When
the refracted rectangle     is  made very narrow, the fringes approach
each other and finally overlap. Blue thus mingles with yellow, and
the green of the spectrum     is  the consequence.    This, in nutshell,
                                                                  a         is

viously regarded      the  narrowing   of the  rectangle   of  the  cylindrical
beam, or of the slit of light passing through the prism, which, accord
 ing to Newton,   is   the indispensable condition requisite for the pro
 duction of   a pure spectrum, as an impure and complicated mode of
 illustrating the phenomenon. The elementary fact is, according to
 Goethe, obtained when we operate with          a wide rectangle the edges
 only of which are coloured, while the centre remains white.               His
 experiments with the parchment had made him acquainted with the
 passage of yellow into red as he multiplied his layers       ;  but how this
 passage occurs in the spectrum he docs not explain.           That, however,
 his hazy surfaces — his virtual turbid media — produced, in some way

348                         Professor Tyndall                 [March 19,
or other, the observed passage and intensification, Goethe held as
firmly, and enunciated as confidently, as if his analysis of the pheno
mena had been complete.
     The fact is, that between double images and turbid media
there is no kinship whatever. Turbidity is due to the diffusion, in
a transparent medium, of minute particles having a refractive index
different from that of the medium.       But the act of reflection which
produced the penumbral surfaces, whose aid Goethe invoked, did
not charge them with such discrete particles.         On various former
occasions   I  have tried to set forth the principles on which the
chromatic action of turbid media depends.         When such media are
to be soon blue, the light scattered by the diffused particles, and
that only, ought to reach the eye.       This feeble light may be com
pared   to a  faint whisper  which   is easily rendered inaudible by a
louder noise.     The scattered light of the particles is accordingly
overpowered, when a stronger light comes, not from the particles, but
from a bright surface behind them. Here the light reaches the eye,
minus that scattered by the particles.       It is therefore the comple
mentary light, or yellow.       Both effects are immediately deducible
from the principles of the undulatory theory.       As a stone in water
throws back a larger fraction of a ripple than of a larger wave, so
do the excessively minute particles which produce the turbidity
scatter more copiously the small waves of the spectrum than the
large ones.    Light scattered by such particles will therefore always
contain a preponderance of the waves which produce the sensation of
blue. During its transmission through the turbid medium the white
light is more and more robbed of its blue constituents, the trans
mitted light which reaches the eye being therefore complementary to
blue.
     Some of you are, no doubt, aware that it is possible to take matter
in the gaseous condition, . when its smallest parts are molecules,
incapable of being either seen themselves or of scattering any sensible
portion of light which impinges on them ; that it is possible to shake
these molecules asunder by special light-waves, so that their liberated
constituents shall coalesce anew and form, not molecules, but particles ;
that it is possible to cause these particles to grow, from a size bor
dering on the atomic, to a size which enables them to copiously scatter
light. Some of you are aware that in the early stages of their growth,
when they are still beyond the grasp of the microscope, such particles,
no matter what the substance may be of which they are composed,
shed forth a pure firmamental blue; and that from them we can
manufacture in the laboratory artificial skies which display all the
phenomena, both of colour and polarization, of the real firmament.
     With regard to the production of the green of the spectrum by
the overlapping of yellow and blue, Goethe, like a multitude of
others, confounded the mixture of blue and yellow lights with that of
blue and yellow pigments.      This was an error shared by the world at
large. But in Goethe's own day, Wiiusch of Leipzig, who is ridiculed

 1880.]                      on Goethe's ' Farberdehre.'                     349
 in the ' Farbenlehre,' had corrected the error, and proved the mixture
 of blue and yellow lights to produce white. Any doubt that might
 be entertained of Wunsch's experiments — and they are obviously the
 work of a careful and competent man —is entirely removed by the
 experiments of Helmholtz and others in our own day. Thus, to sum
 up, Goethe's theory, if such it may be called, proves incompetent to
 account even approximately for the Newtonian spectrum.                He refers
 it to turbid media, but no such media come into play. He fails
 to account for the passage of yellow into red and of blue into violet ;
 while his attempt to deduce the green of the spectrum from the
 mixture of yellow and blue, is contradicted by facts which wero
 extant in his own time.
      One hole Goethe did find in Newton's armour, through which he
 incessantly worried the Englishman with his lance. Newton had
 committed himself to the doctrine that refraction without colour
 was impossible.        He therefore thought that the object-glasses of
 telescopes must for ever remain imperfect, achromatism and refraction
 being incompatible.          The inference of Newton was proved by
 Dollond to bo wrong.* With the same mean refraction, flint glass pro
duces a longer and richer spectrum than crown glass. By diminish
 ing the refracting angle of the flint-glass prism, its spectrum may be
 made equal in length to that of the crown glass.              Causing two such
 prisms to refract in opposite directions, the colours may be neutralized,
 while a considerable residue of refraction continues in favour of the
crown.      Similar combinations are possible in the case of lenses ; and
hence, as Dollond showed, the possibility of producing a compound
achromatic lens.        Here, as elsewhere, Goethe proves himself master of
 the experimental conditions. It is the power of interpretation that he
 lacks.    He flaunts this error regarding achromatism incessantly in the
face of Newton and his followers.            But the error, which was a real
one, leaves Newton's theory of colours perfectly unimpaired.
     Newton's account of his first experiment with the prism is for
ever memorable. " To perform my late promise to you," he writes
to Oldenburg, "       I shall without further ceremony acquaint you, that
in the year 1666 (at which time            I applied myself to the grinding
of optick-glasscs of other figures than spherical)             I procured mo a
triangular glass prism, to try therewith the celebrated phenomena of
colours.      And in order thereto, having darkened my chamber, and
made a small hole in my window-shuts, to let in a convenient quantity
                        I
of the sun's light, placed my prism at its entrance, that it might be
thereby refracted to the opposite wall.          It was at first a very pleasing
divertisement, to view the vivid and intense colours produced thereby ;
but after a while applying myself to consider them more circumspectly,
I  became surprised to see them in an oblong form, which according
    * Dollond was the son of a Huguenot.      Up to 1752 he was a silk weaver at
Spitalfiolds ; he afterwards became an optician.

to   the received laws of refractions,      I expected should have been
circular. They were terminated at the sides with straight lines, but
at the ends the decay of light was so gradual, that it was difficult to
determine justly what was their figure, yet they seemed semi-circular.
     " Comparing the length of this coloured spectrum with its breadth,
I  found it about five times greater ; a disproportion so extravagant,
that it excited me to a more than ordinary curiosity of examining
from whence it might proceed." This curiosity Newton gratified by
instituting a series of experimental questions, the answers to which
left no doubt upon his mind that the elongation of his spectrum was
due to the fact " that light is not similar or homogeneal, but consists
of dijjfarm rays, some of which are more refrangible than others ; so that
without any difference in their incidence on the same medium, some
shall be more refracted than others ; and therefore that, according to
their particular degrees of refrangibility, they were transmitted through
the prism to divers parts of the opposite wall.         When," continues
Newton, "    I understood this,  I left off my aforesaid glass works ; for
I   saw that the perfection of telescopes was hitherto limited, not so
much for want of glasses truly figured according to the prescriptions
of optick authors, as because that light itself is an heterogeneous
mixture of differently refrangible rays ; so that were a glass so
exactly figured as to collect any one sort of rays into one point, it
could not collect those also into the same point, which, having the
same incidence upon the same medium, are apt to suffer a different
refraction."
      Goethe harped on this string without cessation.         "The New
tonian doctrine," he says, " was really dead the moment achromatism
was discovered.     Gifted men, our own Kliigel for example, felt this,
but expressed themselves in an undecided way. On the other hand,
the school which had been long accustomed to support, patch up, and
 glue their intellects to the views of Newton, had surgeons at hand
 to embalm the corpse, so that even after death, in the manner of
 the Egyptians, it should preside at the banquets of the natural
philosophers."
      In dealing with the chromatic aberration of lenses, Goethe proves
 himself to be less heedful than usual as an experimenter.           With
 the clearest perception of principles, Newton had taken two pieces of
 cardboard, the one coloured a deep red, the other a deep blue.
 Around those cards he had wound fine black silk, so that the silk
 formed a series of separate fine dark lines upon the two coloured
 surfaces. He might have drawn black lines over the red and blue,
 but the silk lines were finer than any that he could draw.     Illuminat
 ing both surfaces, he placed a lens so as to cast an image of the
 surfaces upon a white screen.      The result was, that when the dark
lines were sharply defined upon the red, they were undefined upon
the blue ; and that when, by moving the screen, they were rendered
distinct upon the blue, they were indistinct upon the red. A distance
of an inch and a half separated the focus of red rays from the focus

of blue rays, the latter being nearer to the lens than the former.
Goethe appears to have attempted a repetition of this experiment ; at
all events he flatly contradicts Newton, ascribing his result not to the
testimony of his bodily eyes, but to that of the prejudiced eyes of
his mind. Goethe always saw the dark lines best defined upon the
brighter colour. It was to him purely a matter of contrast, and not of
different refrangibility.      He argues caustically, that Newton proves
too much ; for were he correct, not only would a dioptric telescope be
impossible, but presented to our naked eyes, differently coloured
objects must appear utterly confusing.            Let a house, he says, bo
supposed to stand in full sunshine ; let the roof-tiles be red, the walls
yellow, with blue curtains behind the open windows, while a lady
with a violet dress steps out of the door. Let us look at the whole
from a point in front of the house.         The tiles we will suppose appear
distinct, but on turning to the lady we should find both the form
and the folds of her dress undefined.         We must move forwards to see
her distinctly, and then the red tiles would appear nebulous.          And so
with regard to the other objects, we must move to and fro in order
 to see them clearly, if Newton's pretended second experiment were
correct.     Goethe seems to have forgotten that the human eye is not
 a rigid lens, and that it is able to adjust itself promptly and without
difficulty to differences of distance enormously greater than that duo
 to the different refrangibility of the differently coloured rays.
       Newton's theory of colours, it may bo remarked, is really less a
 " theory " than a direct presentation of facts. Given the accepted
 definition of refraction, it is a matter of fact, and not of theoretic
                                                       "
 inference, that white light is not " homogeneal but composed of dif
 ferently refrangible rays. The demonstration is ocular and complete.
 Having palpably decomposed the white light into its constituent
 colours, Newton reeompounded these colours to white light.              Both
 the analysis and the synthesis are matters of fact. The so-called
                                  "
 "theory of light and colours is in this respect very different from tho
 corpuscular theory of light. Newton's explanation of colours stands
 where it is, whether wo accept the corpuscular or the undulatory
 theory ; and it stands because it is at bottom not a theory but a body
 of fact, to which theory must bow or disappear. Newton himself
  pointed out that his views of colours were entirely independent of his
                               " of
  belief in the " corporiety        light.
       After refraction-colours Goethe turns to those produced by diffrac
  tion, and, as far as the phenomena are concerned, he deals very
  exhaustively with the colours of thin plates. He studies the colours
  of Newton's rings both by reflected and transmitted light. He states
  the conditions under which this class of colours is produced, and
  illustrates the conditions by special cases.        He presses together flat
  surfaces of glass, observes the flaws in crystals and in ice, refers to
  the iridescences of oil on water, to those of soap-bubbles, and to the
  varying colours of tempered steel.         Ho is always rich in facts.   But

fusion of his otherwise transcendent mind become conspicuous.
 His turbid media entangle him everywhere, leading him captive and
committing him to almost incredible         delusions.   The colours of
 tempered steel, he says, and kindred phenomena, may perhaps be
quite conveniently deduced from the action of turbid media.      Polished
steel powerfully reflects light, and the colouring produced by heating
may be regarded as a feeble turbidity, -which, acted upon by the polished
surface behind, produces a bright yellow. As the turbidity augments,
this colour becomes dense, until finally it exhibits an intense ruby-
red. Supposing this colour to reach its greatest proximity to dark
ness, the turbidity continuing to augment as before, we shall have
behind the turbid medium a dark background, which appears first
violet, then dark blue, and finally light blue, thus completing the
cycle of the phenomena.     The mind that could offer such an explana
tion as this must be qualitatively different from that of the natural
philosopher.
     The words " quite conveniently deduced," which     I have italicized
in the last paragraph, are also used by Goethe in another place. When
the results of his experiments on prismatic colours had to be con
densed into one commanding inference, he enunciated it thus: —
" Und so lassen sich die Farben bei Gelegenheit der Refraction aus
der Lehre von den triiben Mitteln gar bequem ableiten."       This is the
crown of his edifice, and it seems a feeble ending to so much prepara
tion.   Kingsley once suggested to Lewes that Goethe might have had
a vague feeling that his conclusions were not sound, and that he felt
the jealousy incident to imperfect conviction.     The ring of conscious
demonstration, as it is understood by the man of science, is hardly to
be found in the words
                        " gar bequem ableiten." They fall flaccid
                                                                     upon
the ear in comparison with the mind-compelling Q.E.D. of Newton.
     Throughout the first 350 pages of his work, wherein he develops
and expounds his own theory, Goethe restrains himself with due
dignity.    Here and there, there is a rumble of discontent against
Newton, but there is no sustained ill-temper or denunciation.      After,
however, having unfolded his own views, he comes to what he calls
the " unmasking of the theory of Newton." Here Goethe deliberately
forsakes the path of calm, objective research, and delivers himself
over to the guidance of his emotions.           He immediately accuses
Newton of misusing, as an advocate, his method of exposition.          He
goes over the propositions in Newton's optics one by one, and makes
even the individual words of the propositions the objects of criticism.
He passes on to Newton's experimental proofs, invoking, as he does
so, the complete attention of his readers, if they would be freed to
all eternity from the slavery of a doctrine which has imposed upon
the world for a hundred years.      It might be thought that Goethe had
given himself but little trouble to understand the theorems of Newton
and the experiments on which they were based.          But it would be
unjust to charge the poet with any want of diligence in this respect.

He repeated Newton's experiments, and in almost every case obtained
his results. But he complained of their incompleteness and lack of
logical force. What appears to us as the very perfection of Newton's
art, and absolutely essential to the purity of the experiments, was
regarded by Goethe as needless complication and mere torturing of
the light.     He spared no pains in making himself master of Newton's
data,   but  he lacked the power of penetrating either their particular
significance,   or  of estimating the force and value of experimental
evidence generally.
      He will not, he says, shock his readers at the outset by the utter
ance of a paradox, but he cannot withhold the assertion that by
experiment nothing can really be proved. Phenomena may be ob
served and classified ; experiments may be accurately executed,
and made thus to represent a certain circle of human knowledge ;
 but deductions must be drawn by every man for himself.             Opinions
of things belong to the individual, and we know only too well that
conviction does not depend upon insight, but upon will — that man
can only assimilate that which is in accordance with his nature,
 and to which he can yield assent.         In knowledge, as in action, says
 Goethe, prejudice decides all, and prejudice, as its name indicates, is
judgment prior to investigation.       It is an affirmation or a negation of
 what corresponds, or is opposed to our own nature. It is the cheerful
 activity of our living being in its pursuit of truth or of falsehood, as
 the case may be — of all, in short, with which we feel ourselves to be in
harmony.
      There can be no doubt that Goethe, in thus philosophizing, dipped
 his bucket into the well of profound self-knowledge.                He was
 obviously stung to the quick by the neglect of the physicists.           He
 had been the idol of the world, and accustomed as he was to the
 incense of praise, he felt sorely that any class of men should treat
 what he thought important with indifference or contempt.                 He
 had, it must be admitted, some ground for scepticism as to the recti
 tude of scientific judgments, seeing that his researches on morphology
 met at first no response, though they were afterwards lauded by scien
 tific men.    His anger against Newton incorporates itself in sharp and
 bitter sarcasm. Through the whole of Newton's experiments, he says,
 there runs a display of pedantic accuracy, but how the matter really
 stands, with Newton's gift of observation, and with his experimental
aptitudes, every man possessing eyes and senses may make himself
aware. It may, he says, be boldly asked, Where can the man be found,
 possessing the extraordinary gifts of Newton, who would suffer himself
 to be deluded by such a hocus pocus if he had not in the first instance
 wilfully deceived himself? Only those who know the strength of
 self-deception, and the extent to which it sometimes trenches on
 dishonesty, are in a condition to explain the conduct of Newton and
 of Newton's school. " To support his unnatural theory," he continues,
 " Newton heaps experiment on experiment, fiction upon fiction, seeking
 to dazzle where he cannot convince."

     It may be that Goethe is correct in affirming that the will and
prejudice of the individual are all-influential. We must, however,
add the qualifying words, " as far as the individual is concerned."
 For in science there exists, apart from the individual, objective truth ;
and the fate of Goethe's own theory, though commended to us by so
 great a name, illustrates how, in the progress of humanity, the in
dividual, if he err, is left stranded and forgotten — truth, independent
 of the individual, being more and more grafted on to that tree of
knowledge which is the property of the human race.
     The imagined ruin of Newton's theory did not satisfy Goethe's
desire for completeness. He would explore the ground of Newton's
error, and show how it was that one so highly gifted could employ
his gifts for the enunciation and diffusion of such unmitigated
nonsense. It was impossible to solve the riddle on purely intel
lectual grounds.    Scientific enigmas, he says, are often only capable
of ethical solution, and with this maxim in his mind he applies
himself, in the second volume of the ' Farbenlehre,' to the examina
tion of " Newton's Personlichkeit." He seeks to connect him with,
or rather to detach him from, the general character of the English
nation — that sturdy and competent race, which prizes above all things
the freedom of individual action.        Newton was born in a storm-
tossed time — none indeed more pregnant in the history of the world.
He was a year old when Charles I. was beheaded, and he lived to
see the first George upon the throne.      The shock of parties was in
his ears, changes of ministries, Parliaments, and armies were occur
ring before his eyes, while the throne itself, instead of passing on by
inheritance, was taken possession of by a stranger.            What, asks
Goethe, are we to think of a man who could put aside the claims,
seductions, and passions incident to such a time, for the purpose of
tranquilly following out his bias as an investigator ?
     So singular a character arrests the poet's attention.     He had laid
down his theory of colours, he must add to it a theory of Newton.
 The great German is here at home, and Newton could probably no
more have gone into these disquisitions regarding character, than
 Goethe could have developed the physical theories of Newton.
 He prefaces his sketch of his rival's character by reflections and
considerations regarding character in general.      Every living thing,
down to the worm that wriggles when trod upon, has a character of
its own. In this sense even tho weak and cowardly have characters,
for they will give up the honour and fame which most men prize
highest, so that they may vegetate in safety and comfort.              But
the word character is usually applied to the case of an individual
with great qualities, who pursues his object undeviatingly, and
without permitting either difficulty or danger to deflect him from his
course.
    "Although here, as in other cases," says Goethe, " it is the exuberant
(Ueberschwangliche) that impresses the imagination, it must not be
imagined that this attribute has anything to do with moral feeling. Tho

 main foundation of the moral law is a good will* which, in accordance
with its own nature, is anxious only for the right. The main founda
tion of character is a strong will, without reference to right or wrong,
good or bad, truth or error.          It is that quality which every party
prizes in its members. A good will cherishes freedom, it has reference
to the inner man and to ethical aims.              The strong will belongs to
nature and has reference to the outer world — to action.                  And inas-
much as the strong will in this world is swayed and limited by the
conditions of life, it may almost be assumed as certain that it is only
by accident that the exercise of a strong will and of moral rectitude
find themselves in harmony with each other."                      In determining
Newton's position in the series of human characters, Goethe helps
himself to images borrowed from the physical cohesion of matter.
 Thus, he says, we have strong, firm, compact, elastic, flexible, rigid or
obstinate, and viscous characters. Newton's character he places under
the head of rigid or obstinate, and his theory of colours Goethe pro
nounces to be a petrified aperc,u.
      Newton's assertion of his theory, and his unwavering adherence to
it to the end of his life, Goethe ascribes straight off to moral obliquity
on Newton's part. In the heat of our discussion, he says, we have
even ascribed to him a certain dishonesty.             Man, he says, is subject
to error, but when errors form a series, which is followed pertina
ciously, the erring individual becomes false to himself and to others.
Nevertheless reason and conscience will not yield their rights.                 We
may belie them, but they are not deceived. It is not too much to say
that the more moral and rational a man is, the greater will be his
tendency to lie when he falls into error, and the vaster will be that
error when he makes up his mind to persist in it.
      This is all intended to throw light upon Newton, but when Goethe
passes from Newton himself to his followers, the small amount of
reserve which he exhibited when dealing with the master entirely
disappears. He mocks their blunders as having not even the merit of
originality. He heaps scorn on Newton's imitators.                 The expression
of even a truth, he says, loses grace in repetition, while the repetition
of a blunder is impertinent and ridiculous.            To liberate oneself from
an error is difficult, sometimes indeed impossible for even the strongest
and most gifted minds.         But to take up the error of another, and per
sist in it with stiffnecked obstinacy, is a proof of poor qualities.           The
obstinacy of a man of originality when he errs may make us angry, but
the stupidity of the copyist irritates and renders us miserable. And if in
our strife with Newton we have sometimes passed the bounds of mode
ration, the whole blame is to be laid upon the school of which Newton
was the head, whose incompetence is proportional to its arrogance,
whose laziness is proportional to its self-sufficiency, and whose virulence
and love of persecution hold each other in perfect equilibrium.

     There is   a great deal more invective of this kind, but you -will
probably, and not without sadness, consider this enough.                Invective
may be a sharp weapon, but over-use blunts its edge.            Even when the
denunciation is just and true, it is an error of art to indulge in
it too long. We not only incur the risk of becoming vapid, but of
actually inverting the force of reprobation which we seek to arouse,
and of bringing it back by recoil upon ourselves. At suitable intervals,
separated from each other by periods of dignified reserve, invective may
become a real power of the tongue or pen. But indulged in constantly
it degenerates into scolding, and then, instead of being regarded as
a proof of strength, it is accepted, even in the case of a Goethe, as an
evidence of weakness and lack of self-control.
     If it were possible to receive upon a mirror Goethe's ethical image
of Newton and to reflect it back upon its author, then, as regards
vehement persistence in wrong thinking, the image would accurately
coincide with Goethe himself.          It may be said that we can only solve
the character of another by the observation of our own.             This is true,
but in the portraiture of character we are not at liberty to mix
together subject and object as Goethe mixed himself with Newton.
So much for the purely ethical picture.            On the scientific side some
thing more is to be said. 1 do not know whether psychologists
have sufficiently taken into account that as regards intellectual endow
ment, vast wealth may co-exist with extreme poverty.              I do not mean
to give utterance here to the truism that the field of culture is so
large that the most gifted can master only a portion of it. This
would be the case supposing the individual at starting to be, as
regards natural capacity and potentiality, rounded like a sphere.
Something more radical is here referred to. There are individuals
who at starting are not spheres, but hemispheres ; or, at least, spheres
with a segment sliced away — full orbed on one side, but flat upon the
other.     Such incompleteness of the mental organization no education
can repair.      Now the field of science is sufficiently large, and its
studies sufficiently varied, to bring to light in the same individual
antitheses of endowment like that here indicated.
     So far as science is a work of ordering and classification, so far as
it consists in the discovery of analogies and resemblances which
escape the common eye — of the fundamental identity which often
 exists among apparently diverse and unrelated things — so far, in
 short, as it is observational, descriptive, and imaginative, Goethe,
had he chosen to make his culture exclusively scientific, might have
been without a master, perhaps even without a rival.               The instincts
and capacities      of  the    poet  lend   themselves   freely  to  the natural
history   sciences.   But  when   we   have   to deal with stringently physical
and mechanical conceptions, such instincts and capacities are out of
place. It was in this region of mechanical conceptions that Goethe
failed.    It was on this side that his sphere of capacity was sliced
away.      He  probably was not the only great man who possessed a
 spirit  thus   antithetically   mixed.      Aristotle himself was a mighty

1880.]                     on Goethe's ' Farbenlehre.'                   357
classifier, but not a stringent physical reasoner. And had Newton
attempted to produce a Faust, the poverty of his intellect on the
poetic and dramatic side might have been rendered equally manifest.
But here, if not always, Newton abstained from attempting that for
which he had no capacity, while the exuberance of Goethe's nature
caused him to undertake a task for which he had neither ordination
nor vocation, and in the attempted execution of which his deficiencies
became revealed.
    One task among many — one defeat amid a hundred triumphs. But
any recognition on my part of Goethe's achievements in other realms
of intellectual action would,    I fear, be regarded as impertinent.     You
remember the story of the first Napoleon when tho Austrian plenipo
tentiary, in arranging a treaty of peace, began by formally recognizing
the French Republic.       " Efface that," said the First Consul ; " the
French Republic is like the sun ; he is blind who fails to recognize
                  I
it." And were to speak of recognizing Goethe's merits, my effacement

can hardly be pointed out in history than Newton and Goethe.             For
Newton went astray not only as regards the question of achromatism,
but also as regards vastly larger questions touching the nature of
light. But though as errors they fall into the same category, the
mistake of Newton was qualitatively different from that of Goethe.
Newton erred in adopting            awrong mechanical conception in his
theory of light, but in doing so he never for            moment quitted the
                                                         a
ground of strict scientific method. Goethe erred in seeking to
engraft in his Farbenlehre methods altogether foreign to physics on
                '               '
to the treatment of a purely physical theme.
    We frequently hear protests made against the cold mechanical
mode of dealing with testhetic phenomena employed by scientific
men.     The dissection by Newton of the light to which the world
owes all its visible beauty and splendour seemed to Goethe           desecra

tion.    We find, even in our own day, the endeavour        of Helmholtz   to
arrive at the principles of harmony       and  discord  in music resented  as
an intrusion of the scientific intellect into   a  region which ought to be
sacred to the human heart.       But   all this  opposition and antagonism
has for its essential  cause   the  incompleteness of those with whom     it
originates.    The  feelings  and    aims with which Newton and Goethe
respectively approached     Nature    were radically different, but they had
an equal warrant in the constitution of man.           As regards our tastes
and tendencies, our pleasures and pains, physical and mental, our

heirs of all the ages that preceded us ; and of the human nature thus
handed down poetry is an element just as much as science.             The
emotions of man are older than his understanding, and the poet
who brightens, purifies, and exalts these emotions may claim a posi

man of science. They minister to different but to equally permanent
needs of human nature ; and the incompleteness of which        I  complain
consists in the endeavour on the part of either to exclude the other.
There is no fear that the man of science can ever destroy the glory of
the lilies of the field ; there is no hope that the poet can ever success
fully contend against our right to examine, in accordance with scientific
method, the agent to which the lily owes its glory. There is no
necessary encroachment of the one field upon the other. Nature em
braces them both, and man, when he is complete, will exhibit as large
a toleration.

                    [Reprinted from    Nature,' May   6, 1880.]
MANY of you will bo familiar with the aspect of this small green-
covered book.      It is a copy of the first edition of the 'Origin of
Species,' and bears the date of its production — the 1st of October,
1859. Only a few months, therefore, are needed to complete the
full tale of twenty-one years since its birthday.
    Those whose memories carry them back to this time will
remember that the infant was remarkably lively, and that a great
number of excellent persons mistook its manifestations of a vigorous
individuality for mere naughtiness ; in fact there was a very pretty
turmoil about its cradle. My recollections of the period are particu
larly vivid ; for, having conceived a tender affection for a child of
what appeared to me to be such remarkable promise,                    I acted for
some time in the capacity of a sort of under-nurse, and thus came
in for my share of the storms which threatened the very life of the
young creature.      For some years it was undoubtedly warm work;
but considering how exceedingly unpleasant the apparition of the
new-comer must have been to those who did not fall in love with
him at first sight,   I think it is to the credit of our age that the war
was not fiercer, and that the more bitter and unscrupulous forms of
opposition died away as soon as they did.
    I speak of this period as of something past and gone, possessing
merely an historical,    I had almost said an antiquarian interest.          For,
during the second decade of the existence of the ' Origin of Species,'
opposition, though by no means dead, assumed a different aspect.
On the part of all those who had any reason to respect themselves,
it assumed a thoroughly respectful character. By this time the
dullest began to perceive that the child was not likely to perish of
any congenital weakness or infantile disorder, but was growing into a

362                          Professor Huxley                           [April   9,
stalwart personage, upon whom mere goody scoldings and threatening!*
with the birch-rod were quite thrown away.
    In fact, those who have watched the progress of science within
the last ten years will bear me out to the full when          I assert that
there is no field of biological inquiry in which the influence of the
                        '
*
  Origin of Species is not traceable ; the foremost men of science in
every country are either avowed champions of its leading doctrines,
or at any rate abstain from opposing them ; a host of young and
ardent investigators seek for and find inspiration and guidance in
Mr. Darwin's great work ; and the general doctrine of Evolution, to
one side of which it gives expression, finds in the phenomena of
biology a firm base of operations whence it may conduct its conquest
of the whole realm of nature.
     History warns us, however, that it is the customary fate of new
truths to begin as heresies and to end as superstitions ; and, as
matters now stand, it is hardly rash to anticipate that, in another
twenty years, the new generation, educated under tho influences of
the present day, will be in danger of accepting the main doctrines
                               '
of the ' Origin of Species with as little reflection, and it may be with
as little justification, as so many of our contemporaries, twenty years
ago, rejected them.
     Against any such a consummation let us all devoutly pray; for
the scientific spirit is of more value than its products, and irration
ally-held truths may be more harmful than reasoned errors. Now
the essence of the scientific spirit is criticism.      It tells us that to
whatever doctrine claims our assent we should reply, Take it if
you can compel it. The struggle for existence holds as much in the
intellectual as in the physical world.      A theory is a species of think
ing, and its right to exist is coextensive with its power of resisting
extinction by its rivals.
     From this point of view it appears to me that it "would be but a
                                                        '                   '
poor way of celebrating the Coming of Age of the Origin of Species
were  I  merely to dwell upon the facts, undoubted and remarkable as
they are, of its far-reaching influence and of the great following of
ardent disciples who are occupied in spreading and developing its
doctrines.     Mero insanities and inanities have before now swollen to
portentous size in the course of twenty years. Let us rather ask
this prodigious change in opinion to justify itself; let us inquire
whether anything has happened since 1859 which will explain, on
rational grounds, why so many are worshipping that which they
burned, and burning that which they worshipped.           It is only in this
way that we shall acquire the means of judging whether the move
ment we have witnessed is a mere eddy of fashion, or truly one with
the irreversible current of intellectual progress, and, like      it,
                                                                  safe from
retrogressive reaction.
     Every belief is      the product of two factors the first
                                                   :               the state
                                                                  is
of the mind to which the evidence in favour of that belief is
presented and the second
          ;                    is     the logical cogency of tho evidence

  1880.]                  on   The Origin of Species.'                363
 itself.    In both these respects the history of biological science
  during the last twenty years appears to me to afford an ample
 explanation of the change which has taken place ; and a brief
 consideration of the salient events of that history will enable us to
                                                  '
 understand why, if the ' Origin of Species appeared now, it would
 meet with a very different reception from that which greeted it in
 1859.
      One-and-twenty years ago, in spite of the work commenced by
 Hutton and continued with rare skill and patience by Lyell, the
 dominant view of the past history of the earth was catastrophic.
 Great and sudden physical revolutions, wholesale creations and
 extinctions of living beings, were the ordinary machinery of the
 geological epic brought into fashion by the misapplied genius of
  Cuvier.    It was gravely maintained and taught that the end of
 every geological epoch was signalized by a cataclysm, by which
 every living being on the globe was swept away, to be replaced by
 a brand-new creation when the world returned to quiescence.            A
 scheme of nature which appeared to be modelled on the likeness
 of a succession of rubbers of whist, at the end of each of which the
 players upset the table and called for a new pack, did not seem to
 shock anybody.
      I  may be wrong, but      I doubt if at the present time there is a
 single responsible     representative  of these opinions left. The pro
  gress  of  scientific geology   has  elevated the fundamental principle
  of uniformitarianism, that the explanation of the past is to be sought
 in the study of the present, into the position of an axiom ; and the
  wild speculations of the catastrophists, to which we all listened with
  respect a quarter of a century ago, would hardly find a single patient
 hearer at the present day. No physical geologist now dreams of
 seeking outside the range of known natural causes for the explana
 tion of anything that happened millions of years ago, any more
 than he would be guilty of the like absurdity in regard to current
 events.
      The effect of this change of opinion upon biological speculation
 is obvious. For, if there have been no periodical general physical
 catastrophes, what brought about the assumed general extinctions and
 re-creations of life which are the corresponding biological catas
 trophes?      And if no such interruptions of the ordinary course df
 nature have taken place in the organic, any more than in the
 inorganic, world, what alternative is there to the admission of
evolution ?
      The doctrine of evolution in biology is the necessary result of the
logical application of the principles of uniformitarianism        to the
phenomena of life. Darwin is the natural successor of Hutton and
Lyell, and the 'Origin of Species' the logical sequence of the
'
   Principles of Geology.'
      Tho fundamental doctrine of the ' Origin of Species,' as of all
forms of the theory of evolution applied to biology, is " that the

364                             Professor Huxley                  [April  9,
innumerable species, genera, and families of organic beings with
which the world is peopled have all descended, each within its own
class or group, from common parents, and have all been modified in
the course of descent."*
     And, in view of the facts of geology, it follows that all living
animals and plants " are the lineal descendants of those which lived
long before the Silurian epoch." t
     It is an obvious consequence of this theory of descent with
modification, as it is sometimes called, that all plants and animals,
however different they may now be, must, at one time or other, have
been connected by direct or indirect intermediate gradations, and that
the appearance of isolation presented by various groups of organic
beings must be unreal.
     No part of Mr. Darwin's work ran more directly counter to the
prepossessions of naturalists twenty years ago than this.        And such
prepossessions were very excusable, for there was undoubtedly a
great deal to be said at that time in favour of the fixity of species and
of the existence of great breaks, which there was no obvious or
probable means of filling up, between various groups of organic
beings.
     For various reasons, scientific and unscientific, much had been
made of the hiatus between man and the rest of the higher mammalia,
and it is no wonder that issue was first joined on this part of the
controversy.    I  have no wish to revive past and happily forgotten
controversies; but   I  must state the simple fact that the distinctions in
cerebral and other characters, which were so hotly affirmed to sepa
rate man from all other animals in 1860, have all been demonstrated
 to be non-existent, and that the contrary doctrine is now universally
accepted and taught.
     But there were other cases in which the wide structural gaps
asserted to exist between one group of animals and another were by
 no means fictitious ; and, when such structural breaks were real, Mr.
 Darwin could account for them only by supposing that the inter
 mediate forms which once existed had become extinct.         In a remark
able passage he says :—
     " We may thus account even for the distinctness of whole classes
 from each other — for instance, of birds from all other vertebrate
animals — by the belief that many animal forms of life have been
 utterly lost, through which the early progenitors of birds were
formerly connected with the early progenitors of the other vertebrate
classes." J
     Adverse criticism made merry over such suggestions as these.
 Of course it was easy to get out of the difficulty by supposing
extinction ; but where was the slightest evidence that such intermediate
                       * '

forms between birds and reptiles as the hypothesis required ever
existed ? And then probably followed a tirade upon this terrible
                             "
forsaking of the paths of Baconian induction."
     But the progress of knowledge has justified Mr. Darwin to an
extent which could hardly have been anticipated.            In 1862, the
specimen of Archceopteryx, which until the last two or three years has
remained unique, was discovered ; and it is an animal which, in its
feathers and the greater part of its organization, is a veritable bird,
while in other parts it is as distinctly reptilian.
               I
     In 18C8, had the honour of bringing under your notice in this
theatre the results of investigations made, up to that time, into the
anatomical characters of certain ancient reptiles, which showed the
nature of the modifications in virtue of which the type of the
quadrupedal reptile passed into that of a bipedal bird ; and abundant
confirmatory evidence of the justice of the conclusions which      I then
laid before you has since come to light.
     In 1875, the discovery of the toothed birds of the cretaceous
formation in North America by Professor Marsh completed the series
of transitional forms between birds and reptiles, and removed Mr.
Darwin's proposition that " many animal forms of life have been
utterly lost, through which the early progenitors of birds were
formerly connected with the early progenitors of the other vertebrate
classes," from the region of hypothesis to that of demonstrable fact.
      In 1859, there appeared to be a very sharp and clear hiatus
 between vertebrated and invertebrated animals, not only in their
 structure, but, what was more important, in their development.       I do
 not think that we even yet know the precise links of connection
 between the two; but the investigations of Kowalewsky and others
 upon the development of Amphioxus and of the Tunicala prove
 beyond a doubt that the differences which were supposed to constitute
 a barrier between the two are non-existent.      There is no longer any
 difficulty in  understanding   how  the vertebrate   type may have arisen
 from the invertebrate, though the full proof of the manner in which
 the transition was actually effected may still be lacking.
      Again, in 1859, there appeared to be a no less sharp separation
 between the two great groups of flowering and flowerless plants.        It
 is only subsequently that the series of remarkable investigations
 inaugurated by Hofmeister has brought to light the extraordinary and
 altogether unexpected modifications of the reproductive apparatus
 in the Lycopodiacea, the Rhizocarpcce, and the Gymnotpermece, by
 which the ferns and the mosses are gradually connected with the
 Phanerogamic division of the vegetable world.
      So, again, it is only since 1859 that we have acquired that wealth
 of knowledge of the lowest forms of life which demonstrates the
 futility of any attempt to separate the lowest plants from the lowest
 animals, and shows that the two kingdoms of living nature have a
 common borderland which belongs to both or to neither.
      Thus it will be observed that the whole tendency of biological

 366                         Professor Huxley                     [April  9,
investigation since 1859 has been in the direction of removing the
difficulties which the apparent breaks in the series created at that
time ; and the recognition of gradation is the first step towards the
acceptance of evolution.
     As another great factor in bringing about tho change of opinion
which Las taken place among naturalists,        I  count the astonishing
progress which has been made in the study of embryology.           Twenty
years ago, not only were we devoid of any accurate knowledge of the
mode of development of many groups of animals and plants, but the
methods of investigation were rude and imperfect.         At the present
time there is no important group of organic beings the development
of which has not been carefully studied, and the modern methods of
hardening and section-making enable the embryologist to determine
the nature of the process in each case with a degreo of minuteness
and accuracy which is truly astonishing to those whose memories
carry them back to the beginnings of modern histology.            And the
results of these cmbryological investigations are in complete harmony
with the requirements of the doctrine of evolution.       The first begin
nings of all the higher forms of animal life are similar, and however
diverse their adult conditions, they start from a common foundation.
Moreover, the process of development of the animal or the plant from
its primary egg or germ is a true process of evolution — a progress
from almost formless to more or less highly organized matter, in
virtue of the properties inherent in that matter.
     To those who aro familiar with the process of development, all o
priori objections to the doctrine of biological evolution appear childish.
Any one who has watched the gradual formation of a complicated
animal from the protoplasmic mass which constitutes the essential
element of a frog's or a hen's egg has had under his eyes sufficient
evidence that a similar evolution of the whole animal world from the
like foundation is, at any rate, possible.
     Yet another product of investigation has largely contributed to
the removal of the objections to the doctrine of evolution current in
1859. It is the proof afforded by successive discoveries that Mr.
Darwin did not over-estimate the imperfection of the geological
record. No more striking illustration of this is needed than a
comparison of our knowledge of the mammalian fauna of the Tertiary
epoch in 1859 with its present condition.        M. Gandry's researches
on the fossils of Pikermi were published in 1868, those of Messrs.
Leidy, Marsh, and Cope on the fossils of the Western Territories of
America have appeared almost wholly since 1870, those of M. Filhol
on the phosphorites of Quercy in 1878.       The general effect of these
investigations has been to introduce to us a multitude of extinct
animals, the existence of which was previously hardly suspected ; just
as if zoologists were to become acquainted with a country, hitherto
unknown, as rich in novel forms of life as Brazil or South Africa
once were to Europeans.       Indeed the fossil fauna of the Western
Territories of America bids fair to exceed in interest and importance

all other known Tertiary deposits put together; and yet, with the
exception of the cose of the American tertiaries, these investigations
have extended over very limited areas, and at Pikermi were confined
to an extremely small space.
    Such appear to me to be the chief events in the history of the
progress of knowledge during the last twenty years, which account for
the changed feeling with which the doctrine of evolution is at present
regarded by those who have followed the advance of biological science,
in respect of those problems which bear indirectly upon that doctrine.
    But all this remains mere secondary evidence. It may remove
dissent, but it does not compel assent.     Primary and direct evidence
in favour of evolution can be furnished only by paleontology. The
geological record, so soon as it approaches completeness, must, when
properly questioned, yield either an affirmative or a negative answer :
if evolution has taken place, there will its mark be loft ; if it has not
taken place, there will lie its refutation.
    What was the state of matters in 1859 ? Let us hear Mr. Darwin,
who may bo trusted always to stato the caso against himself as strongly
as possible.
    "On this doctrine of the extermination of an infinitude of con
necting links between the living and extinct inhabitants of the world,
and at each successive period between the extinct and still older
species, why is not every geological formation charged with such
links ? Why does not every collection of fossil remains afford plain
evidence of the gradation and mutation of the forms of life? We
meet with no such evidence, and this is the most obvious and
plausible of tho many objections which may be urged against my
theory."*
   Nothing could    have been more useful to the opposition than this
characteristically candid avowal, twisted as it immediately was into
an admission that the writer's views were contradicted by the facts of
paleontology.     But, in fact, Mr. Darwin made no such admission.
What he says in effect      is,
                            not that palaeontological evidence    against is
him, but that       not distinctly in his favour   and without attempt
                   it
                   is                                      ;
ing to attenuate the fact, he accounts for     by the scantiness and the
                                                     it
imperfection of that evidence.
    What       the state of the case now, when, as we have seen, the
              is
amount of our knowledge respecting the mammalia of the Tertiary
epoch     increased fifty-fold, and in some directions even approaches
         is
completeness       ?
    Simply this, that     ifthe doctrine of evolution had not existed
paleontologists must have invented          it,
                                         so irresistibly     forced upon
                                                                     it

the mind by the study of the remains of the Tertiary mammalia
which have been brought to light since 1859.

3G8          Professor Huxley on      The Origin   of Species'          [April 9,
by which the ancient civets passed into the more modern hyaenas;
through the Tertiary deposits of Western America, Marsh tracked
the successive forms by which the ancient stock of the horse has
passed into its present form ; and innumerable less complete indica
tions of the mode of evolution of other groups of the higher mammalia
have been obtained.
      In the remarkable memoir on the phosphorites of Quercy, to
which    I  have referred, M. Filhol describes no fewer than seventeen
varieties of the genus Cynodictis, which fill up all the interval between
the viverine animals and the bear-like dog Amphicyon ; nor do                   I
know any solid ground of objection to the supposition that in this
Cynodictis-Amphicyon group we have the stock whence all the Vive-
ridee, Felidse, Hyronidre, CanidsB, and perhaps the Procyonid® and
UrsidiB, of the present fauna have been evolved.              On the contrary,
there is a great deal to be said in favour.
      In the course of summing up his results, M. Filhol observes * :—
      " During the epoch of the phosphorites, great changes took place
in animal forms, and almost the same types as those which now exist
became defined from one another.
      " Under the influence of natural conditions of which we have no
exact knowledge, though traces of them are discoverable, species have
been modified in a thousand ways : races have arisen which, becoming
fixel, have thus produced a corresponding number of secondary
species."
      In 1859, language of which this is an unintentional paraphrase,
                     '
occurring in the Origin of Species,' was scouted as wild speculation ;
at present, it is a sober statement of the conclusions to which an
acute and critically-minded investigator is led by large and patient
 study of the facts of paleontology.        I venture to repeat what      I have
 said   before, that, so far as the   animal  world is concerned, evolution
is no longer a speculation, but a statement of historical fact. It
 takes place alongside of those accepted truths which must be taken
 into account by philosophers of all schools.
       Thus when, on the first day of October next, the ' Origin of
 Species' comes of age, the promise of its youth will be amply ful
 filled ; and we shall be prepared to congratulate the venerated author
 of the book, not only that the greatness of his achievement and its
 enduring influence upon the progress of knowledge have won him a
 place beside our Harvey ; but, still more, that, like Harvey, he
 has lived long enough to outlast detraction and opposition, and to
 soe the stone that the builders rejected become the head-stone of the
 corner.

 Mesdames     et Messieurs,
         J'ai accepts", avec grande joie, de venir echanger quolques idees
avec vous, en cot Institut illustre, voue aux plus hautes rocherches de
la science et de la vraie philosophic. Cette ile, ou j'ai tant d'amis et
que je viens de visiter si tardivement, j'y revais des mon enfance. Je
suis Breton de France ; je voyais dans nos vieux livres l'Angleterre
toujours appelee l'ile des saints ; et, en effot, tons nos saints de la Bre-
tagne armoricaino, ces saints d'nne orthodoxie douteuse et qui, s'ils
ressuscitaient, s'entendraient mieux avec nous qu'aveo les jesuites,
venaient de l'ile de Bretagne.       On me montrait dans leur chapelle
l'auge de pierre en laquelle ils avaient passe la mer. De toutes lcs
races, la race bretonne est celle qui a toujours pris la religion le plus au
serieux. Meme quand le progres de la reflexion nous a montre que
quelques articles sont a modifier dans la liste des choses que nous avions
autrefois tenues pour certaines, nous ne rompons jamais aveo le sym-
bole sous lequel nous avons d'abord goute l'ideal.        Car la foi ne reside
pas, pour nous, en d'obscures propositions metaphysiques, elle est
dans les affirmations du coeur. J'ai done choisi pour m'entretcnir
avec vous, non quelqu'une de ces subtilites qui divisent, mais un de
ces sujets chers a Fame, qui rapprochent et reunissent. Je vous parlerai
de ce livre tout resplendissant do l'esprit divin, de ce manuel de la
vie resignee que nous a laisse le plus pieux des hemmes, le c£sar Marc-
Aurele- Antonin. C'est la gloire des souverains que le plus irrepro-
chable modele de vortu se soit trouve dans leurs range, et que les
plus belles locons de patience et de detachement soient venues d'nne
condition qu'on suppose volontiers livree a toutes les seductions
du plaisir et de la vanity.
                                      I.
    L'heredite de la sagesse sur le trune est chose toujours rare ; je
n'en vois dans l'histoire que deux exemples eclatants : dans l'lnde,
la succession de ces trois empereurs mongols, Baber, Hnma'ionn et
Akbar ; a Bome, a la tete du plus vasto empire qui fut jamais, les deux

regnes admirablcs d'Antonin-lo-Pieux et do Marc-Aurelo.              De ces
deux derniers, Antonin fut, selon moi, le plus grand.           Sa bonte ne
lui fit pas commcttre do fautes ; il ne fut pas tourmente du mal inte-
rieur qui rongea sans relacbe le cceur do son fils adoptif. Ce mal
etrange, cette etude inquiete de soi-meme, ce demon du scrupule, cette
fievre de perfection sont des signes d'une nature moins forte que
distinguee.      Comme les plus belles pensees sont celles qu'on n'ecrit
pas, Antonin eut encore, a cet e'gard, une superiority sur Marc-Aurele ;
mais ajoutons que nous ignorerions Antonin, si Marc-Aurele ne nous
avait transmis de son pere adoptif ce portrait exquis, oil il semblo
s'etre appliqu6, par humilite", & peindre 1'imago d'un nomme encore
meilleur que lui-meme.
      C'est lui aussi qui nous a trace, dans le premier livro de ses Pensees,
cet arriero-plan admirable, ou so meuvont dans une lumiore toute celeste
les nobles et pures figures de son pore, de sa mere, de son ai'eul, de
 ses maitres.      Grace a Marc-Aurele, nous pouvons comprendre ce
 quo   ces vieilles families romaines, qui avaient vu le regne des mauvais
 empereurs, gardaient encore d'honnetete, de dignite, de droiture,
d'esprit civil, et, si j'ose le dire, republican!.    On y vivait dans 1'ad-
 miration de Caton, de Brutus, de Thraseas et des grands sto'iciens dont
 Fame n'avait pas plie sous la tyrannie.           Le regne de Domitien y
 etait abhorre. Los sages qui 1'avaient traverse sans flechir y efaient
 honores commo des heros.           L'avenement des Antonins ne fut quo
 1'arrivee au pouvoir do la societe des sages dont Tacite nous a
 transmis les justes coleres, societe de sages formee par la ligue de
 tons ceux qu' avait revoltes le despotisme des premiers Cesars.
      Le salutairo principe de 1'adoption avait fait de la cour imperiale,
 au deuxiume siecle, une vraie popiniere de vertu.         Le noble et habile
 Nerva, en posant ce principo, assura le bonheur du genre bumain
 pendant pres de cent ana, et donna au mondo le plus beau siecle de
 progres dont la memoire ait ete conserved.           La souvcrainete ainsi
 possedeo en commun par un groupe d'hommes d'elite, lesquels se la
 leguaient ou se la partageaient scion les besoins du moment, perdit
 une partie de cet attrait qui la rend si dangereuse.           On arriva au
 trone sans 1'avoir brigue, mais aussi sans le devoir a sa naissance ni
  a une sorto de droit divin ; on y arriva desabuse, ennuye des homines,
  prepare de longue main.       L' empire fut un fardeau civil, qu'on acccpta
  a son heuro, sans que nul songeiit a avancer cette heure. Marc-Aurele y
  fut designe si jeune quo 1'ideo de regner n'eut guerc chez lui de com
  mencement et n'exerga pas sur son esprit un moment do seduction.          A
  huit ans, quand il etait deja prccsul des protres Saliens, Adrien
  remarqua ce doux enfant triste, et 1'aima pour son bon naturel, sa
  docilite, son incapacite de mentir.      A dix-huit ans, 1'empire lui etait
  assure.    II 1'attendit patiemment durant vingt-deux annees.       Le soir
  oil Autonin se sentant mourir, apres avoir donno pour mot d'ordre au
  tribun de service, JElquanimitas, fit porter dans la chambro do son
  fils adoptif la statue d'or do la Fortune, qui devait toujours se
  trouver dans l'appartemcnt do rempereur, il n'y eut pour celui-ci ni

1880.]                            sur Marc-Aurele.                         371
surprise ni joio.     II  ctait, depuis longtemps, blase sur toutes les joies
sans les avoir goutees ;     il en avait vu, par la profondeur do sa philo
sophic, l'absolue vanite.
     Le grand inconvenient de la vie pratique et ce qui la rend insup
portable a l'homme superieur, e'est que, si Ton y transports les
principes de l'ideal, les qualit£s deviennent des defauts, si bien que,
fort souvent, l'horamo accompli y rcussit nioins bien que celui qui a
pour mobiles l'egoisme ou la routine vulgaire.           Trois ou quatre fois,
la vertu de Marc-Aurele faillit le perdre. Elle lui fit faire une
premiere faute en lui persuadant d'associer a l'empire Lucius- V^rus,
envers qui il n'avait aucune obligation.        Verus e"tait un homme frivole
et sans valeur.     II  fallut des prodiges de bonte et de delicatesse pour
l'empecher de faire des folies desastreuses.       Le sage empereur, serieux
et applique, trainait avec lui dans sa litiere le sot collegue qu'il s'etait
donne. II le prit toujours obstinement au serieux ; il ne se revolta
 pas uno fois contre cet assommant compagnonnage.             Comme les gens
 qui ont etc tres bien Aleves, Marc-Aurele se genait sans cesse ; ses facons
 venaient d'un parti-pris general de tenue et de dignite.         Les nmes de
 cette sorto, soit pour ne pas faire de peine aux autres, soit par respect
 pour la nature humaine, ne se resignent pas a avouer qu'elles voient le
mal.     Lour vie est une perpetuelle dissimulation.
     Selon quelques-uns, il aurait 6t6 dissimule envers lui-meme, puisque
 dans son entretien intime avec les dieux, sur les bords du Gran,
 parlant d'uno epouse indigne de lui, il les aurait remercies de lui avoir
 donne "une femme si complaisante, si affectueuse, si simple."             J'ai
 montre ailleurs qu'on s'est quelque pen cxagere sur ce point la patience,
 ou, si Ton veut, la faiblesse de Marc-Aurele.         Faustine eut des torts ;
 le plus grand fut d'avoir pris en aversion les amis de son mari ;
 comme ce furent ces amis qui ecrivirent l'histoire, elle en porta la
 peine devant la posterite. Mais une critique attentive n'a pas do
 peine a montrer ici les exagerations de la legende. Tout porto a croire
 que Faustine trouva d'abord le bonheur et l'amour dans cette villa de
 Lorium ou dans cette belle retraito de Lanuvium, sur les dernicres
 pen tes du mont Albain, que Marc-Aurele decrit a Fronton, son maitre,
 comme un sejour plein des joies les plus pures.          Puis elle se fatigua
 de taut de sagesse. Disons tout : les belles sentences do Marc-Aurele,
 sa vertu austere, sa perpetuelle melancolie, purent sembler ennuyeuses
 a uno femme jeune, capricieuse, d'un temperament ardent et d'une
merveillouso beaute.        II  le comprit, en soulfrit et se tut. Faustine
 resta toujours " sa tres bonne et tres fidele e'pouse."         On ne rcussit
jamais,   meme   apres quelle     fut morte, a lui faire abandonner   ce pieux
 mensonge.      Dans   un  bas-relief qui se voit encore  aujourd'hui a Beme
 au musee du Capitole, pendant que Faustine est enleveo au ciel par
 uno Bonommee, l'excellent empereur la suit de terre avec un regard
 plein d'amour.     II  etait arrive, ce semble, dans les derniers temps, a
 se fairo illusion a lui-meme et ;i tout oublier. Mais quelle lutte il dut
 traverser pour en arrivor la ! Durant do longuos annees, une maladie
 de cosur le consuma lentemont.         L'efibrt desespere qui fait l'essence
                                                                 2 o 2

  de sa philosophic, cette frene'sie do renoncement, poussee parfois
  jusqu'au sophisme, dissimulont au fond une immense blessure.           Qu'il
   faut avoir dit adiou au bonheur pour arriver a de tels exces ! On ne
   comprendra jaraais tout ce quo souffrit ce pauvre coeur fletri, ce qu'il y
   eut d'amertumo dissimulee par ce front pale, toujours calme et presque
   toujours souriant.     II est vrai que 1'adien au bonheur est le com
   mencement de la sagesse, et le moyen le plus sur pour trouver le
   bonheur.     II n'y a rien de doux comma le retour de joie qui suit le
   renoncement a la joie ; rien de vif, de profond, do charmant comme
   1'enchantement du desenchante.
        Des historiens, plus ou moins imbus de cette politique qui se croit
   superieure parce qu'elle n'est suspecte d'ancune philosophic, ont
   naturellement eherche a prouver qu'un homme, si accompli, fut un
   mauvais administrateur et un mediocre souverain.        II parait, en effet,
   quo Marc-Aurele pecha plus d'une fois par trop d'indulgence.          Mais
   jamais regno ne fut plus fccond en reformes et en progres.    L'assistance
    publique, fondle par Nerva et Trajan, recut de lui d'admirables
   developpements.       Des colleges nouveaux pour 1'education gratuite
   furent etablis ; les procuratcurs alimentaires devinrent des fonctiou-
   naires de premier ordro et furent choisis avec un soin extreme ; on
    pourvut a I'education des fommes pauvres par 1'institut des Jeunes
    Fausliniennes.   Le principe que 1'Etat a des devoirs en quelque sorte
    paternels envers ses membres (principe dont il faudra se souvenir
    avec gratitude, memo quand on 1'aura depasse), ce principe, dis-je, a
   ete proclame pour la premiere fois dans le monde par les Antonins.
    Ni le faste pueril des royautes orientales, fondees sur la bassesse et
    la stupidite des hommes, ni 1'orgueil pe~dantesque des royautes du
    moyen-age, fondees sur un sentiment exagere* de I'herodite et sur une
    foi naive dans les droits du sang, ne peuvent nous donner une idee de
    cette souveraineto toute republicaine de Nerva, de Trajan, d'Adrien,
    d'Antonin, de Maro-Aurele. Rien du prince hdreditaire ou par droit
    divin ; rien, non plus, du chef militaire ; c 'etait une sorte de grande
    magistrature civile, sans rien qui ressemblat a une cour ni qui cnlevat
    a 1'empereur son caractere tout prive.     Marc-Aurele, en particulier,
    ne fut ni pen ni beaucoup un roi, dans le sens propre du mot ; sa
    fortune etait industrielle, elle consistait surtout en briqueteries ; son
    aversion pour " les cesars," qu'il envisage comme des especes de
    Sardanapales, magniflques, debauches        et cruels, eclate a chaquo
    instant.   La civilite de ses moeurs etait extreme ; il rendit au senat
    toute son ancienne importance ; quand il etait a Eome, il no manquait
   jamais une seance, et ne quittait sa place que quand le consul avait
    prononce la formula : Nihil vos moramur, patres conscripti. Presque
    toutes les annees de son regne il fit la guerre, et il la fit bien,
    quoiqu'il n'y trouvat que de 1'ennui.    Ses insipides campagnes centre
    les Quades et les Marcomans furent tres bien conduites ; le degout
    qn'il en eprouvait ne 1'empechait pas d'y mettre 1'application la plus
    consciencieuse.
        Ce fut dans le cours d'une de ces expeditions quo, campe sur les

 1880.  J                      sar Mare-Aurele.                            873
 bonls du Gran, an milieu des plainos monotones do la Hongrie, il
ecrivit les plus belles pages du livre exquis qui nous a revele" son
 ame tout entiere.      II est probable quo, de bonno heure, il tint un
journal   intime  de ses penseos.     II y inscrivait les maximes auxquelles
il recourait pour se fortifier, les reminiscences de ses auteurs favoris,
les passages des moralistes qui lui parlaient le plus, les principes qui
dans la journee l'avaient soutenu, parfois les reproches que sa con
 science scrupuleuse croyait avoir a s'adresser. " On se cherehe des
retraitos solitaires, chaumieres rustiques, rivages des mers, moutagnes ;
comme les autres, tu aimes a rever cos biens. A quoi bon, p
t'est permis a chaque heure de to rctirer en ton ame ? Nulle part
l'homme n'a do retraite plus tranquille, surtout s'il a en luimeme do
cos choses dont la contemplation suflfit pour rendre le calme.           Sache
done jouir de cctto retraite, ot la renouvelle tes forcos.          Qu'il y ait
la de cos maximes courtes, fondamontalcs, qui, tout d'abord, rendront
la serenite it ton nme et to remettront en etat de supporter avec
resignation le monde oil tu dois revenir."          Pendant les tristes hivers
du Nord, cette consolation lui devint encore plus necessairo. II avait
pres do soixante ans; la vieillcsse etait cbez lui prematuree. Un
soir, toutes les images do sa pieuso jeunesso remonterent en son
souvenir, et il passu quelqucs heuros delicieuses a supputer co qu'il
devait a chacun des etres bons qui l'avaient entoure.
     " Exemples de mon a'ieul Verus : Douceur do mceurs, patience
inalterable."
     "
       Qualites qu'on prisait dans mon pore, souvenir qu'il m'a laisso :
Modestic, caractere male."
     " Imiter do ma mure sa

elle, non seulement de fairo le mal, mais memo d'en concevoir la
pensee ; mener sa vie frugalc, et qui ressemblait si pou au luxe habituel
des riches."
     Puis lui apparaissent tour a tour Diogenete, qui lui inspira le gout
de la philosophic et rendit agreables it ses yeux le grabat, la couver-
ture composoe d'une simplo pcau et tout l'appareil de la discipline
hellenique ; Junius Busticus, qui lui apprit a eviter toute affectation

Tous, depuis l'athee ou celui qui se croit tel, jusqu'a l'homme le plus
engage dans les croyances particulieres           de chaque culto, peuvent y
trouver des fruits d YVHficat ion.     C'est le livre lo plus purement humain
qu'il y ait.     II  ne tranche aucune question controversee.          En theo-
logie, Marc-Aurele flotte entre le deisme pur, le poly thcisme inter
prets dans mi sens physique a la facon des sto'iciens, et une sorte de
pantheisme cosmique.         II ne tient pas beaucoup plus a l'uno des hypo
theses qu'a l'autre, et il se sert indifFeremment des trois vocabulaires,
deiste, polytheiste, pantheist©.        Ses considerations sont toujours a
deux faces, selon que Dieu et l'ame ont ou n'ont pas de realite. Cost
le raisonnement que nous faisons a chaque heure ; car, si c'est le mate-
rialisme le plus complet qui a raison, nous qui aurons era an vrai et
au bien, nous ne serons pas plus dupes que les autres.           Si l'idealisme
a raison, nous aurons ete les vrais sages et nous l'aurons ete de la
seule facon qui nous convienne, e'est-a-dire sans nulle attente interessee,
sans avoir compte sur une remuneration.

      Nous touchons ici au grand secret de la philosophic morale ct do
 la religion.       Marc-Aurele n'a pas de philosophic speculative ; sa
 theologie est tout a fait contradictoire ; il n'a aucune idee arreteo sur
 1'ame et l'imniortalite.     Comment fut-il profondement moral sans les
 croyances qu'on regarde aujourd'hui           comme les fondements de la
 morale ? Comment fut-il eminemment religioux sans avoir professc
 aucun des dogmes de ce qu'on appelle la religion naturelle ? Cost co
 qu'il importe de rechercher.
      Les doutes qui, au point de vue de la raison speculative, planent
 sur les veritcs de la religion naturelle ne sont pas, comme Kant l'a
 admirablement montre, des doutes accidentels, susceptibles d'etre
 leves, tenant, ainsi qu'on se l'imagine parfois, a certains e"tats de
 l'esprit humain. Ces doutes sont inherents a la nature meme de ces
 ventes, et Ton peut dire sans paradoxe que, si cos doutes e'taient leves,
 les verites auxquelles ils s'attaquent disparaitraient du meme coup.
  Supposons, on effet, une preuve directe, positive, dvidente pour tous,
  des peines ot des recompenses futures ; oil sora le merite do faire lo
  bien ? II n'y aurait que des fous qui de gaite de coeur courraient a
 leur damnation.        Une foule d'ames basses feraient leur salut cartes
  sur table ; elles forceraient, en quelque sorte, la main de la divinito.
  Qui ne voit que, dans un tel systeme, il n'y a plus ni morale ni
  religion ? Dans l'ordre moral et religieux, il est indispensable de
  croire sans demonstration ; il ne s'agit pas de certitude, mais de foi.
  Voila ce qu'oublie le deisme, avec ses habitudes d'affirmation intem-
  pe'rante.   II  oublie que des croyances trop precises sur la destinee
  humaine enleveraient tout le merite moral.               Pour nous, on nous
  annoncorait un argument peremptoire en co genre, que nous ferions

  qui generaient notre liberte ? Nous craindrions d'etre assimiles a ces
  speculateurs de vertu ou a. ces peureux vulgaires, qui portent dans lea
  cheses de Fame le grossier egoisme de la vie pratique.           Dans les
  premiers jours qui suivirent la foi a la resurrection de Jesus, ce
  sentiment so fit jour de la facon la plus touchante. Les vrais amis de
 coeur, les dclicats aimerent mieux croire sans preuve que de voir.
 " Hcureux ceux qui n'ont pas vu et qui ont cru ! " devint le mot de la
 situation.    Mot charmant ! Symbole eternel de l'idealisme tendre
 et gencreux, qui a horreur de toucher de ses mains ce qui ne doit etre
 vu qu'avec le coeur !
      Notre bon Marc-Aurele, sur ce point comme sur tons les autre*,
 devanca les siecles.    Jamais il ne so soucia de se mettre d'accord avec
 lui-memo sur Dieu et sur l'ame.      Comme s'il avait lu la Critique de
 la liaison pratique, il vit bien que, lorsqu'il s'agit de l'infini, aucune
 formule n'est absolue, et qu'en pareille matiere on ne pout avoir
 quelque chance d'avoir vu, une fois en sa vie, la verit6 que si Ton s'ost
 beaucoup contredit.      II detacha hautement la beaute morale de toute
 theologie arretee; il ne permit au devoir do dependre, d'aucune
 opinion metaphysique, sur la cause premiere.       Jamais 1' union intime
 aveo le dieu cache ne fut poussee a de plus inou'ies delicatesses.
 " Offre au gouvernement du dieu qui est au dedans de toi un etre
 viril, muri par l'age, ami du bien public, un Romain, un empereur ;
 un soldat a son poste, attendant le signal de la trompette ; un hommc
pret a quitter sans regret la vie." — " II y a bien des grains d'oncena
destines au memo autel ; l'un tombe plus tfit, l'autre plus tard dans le
feu ; mais la difterence n'est rien." — " L'homme doit vivre selon la
 nature pendant le peu de jours qui lui sont donnes sur la terre, et,
 quand le moment de la retraite est venu, se soumettre avee douceur,
comme une olive qui, en tombant, benit l'arbre qui l'a produite, et rend
grace au rameau qui l'a portee." — " Tout ce qui t'arrange m'arrange,
6 cosmos.     Rien ne m'est premature ou tardif de ce qui, pour toi, vient
a 1'heuro.    Je fais mon fruit de ce que portent tes saisons, 6 nature.
De toi vient tout ; en toi est tout ; vers toi va tout." — " O homme ! tu
as ete citoyen dans la grande cite ; que t'importe de l'avoir ete pen
dant cinq ou pendant trois ans ? Ce qui est conforme aux lois n'est
inique pour personne. Qu'y a-t-il done de si facheux a etre renvoy^
de la cite, non par un tyran, non par un juge inique, mais par la
nature meme qui t'y avait fait entrer ? C'est comme quand un
comedien est congedi6 du theatre par le preteur qui l'y avait engage.
Mais, diras-tu, je n'ai pas jouo les cinq actes ; je n'en ai joue que trois.
Tu dis bien ; mais, dans la vie, trois actes suffisent pour faire la piece
entiere. . . . Pars done content, puisque celui^ qui te congedie est
content."
     Est-ce a dire qu'il ne se revoltat pas quelquefois contre le sort
etrange qui s'est plu a laisser seuls, face a face, l'homme avec ses
eternels besoins de devoucmont, do sacrifice, d'heroisme, et la nature,

avec son immoralite transcendante, son supremo dedain pour la vertu?
Non. Une fois du moins l'absurdite, la colossalo iniquity de la mort
le frappe.      Mais bientot son temperament completement mortifie
reprend le dessus, et il se calme.
                                         " Comment se fait-il que les dieux,
qui ont ordonne si bien toutes choses, et avec tant d'amour pour les
hommes, aient neglige un seul point, a savoir, que les hommes d'une
vertu eprouvee, qui ont eu pendant leur vie une sorte de commerce
avec la divinite, qui se sont fait aimer d'ello par leurs actions pieuses
et leurs sacrifices, ne rovivent pas apres la mort, mais soient eteints
pour jamais ? Puisque la chose est ainsi, sacho bien que, si elle avait
du etre autrement, ils n'y cussent pas manque ; car, si cela cut etc
juste, cela etait possible ; si cela cut ete conforme a la nature, la
nature l'eut comporte. Par cons6quent, do cela qu'il n'en est pas
ainsi, confirme-toi en cette consideration qu'il ne fallait pas qu'il en
fut ainsi. Tu vois bien toi-memo que faire une telle recherche, c'est
 disputer avec Dieu sur son droit.        Or, nous ne disputerions pas ainsi
 contre les dieux, s'ils n'etaiont pas souverainement bons et souveraine-
 ment justes ; s'ils le sont, ils n'ont rien laisse passer dans l'ordonnance
 du monde qui soit contraire a la justice et a la raison."
     Ah ! e'est trop de resignation, Mesdames et Messieurs. S'il en est
 veritablement ainsi, nous avons droit de nous plaindro.           Dire que si ce
monde n'a pas      sa  contrc-partic, l'homme   qui s'est  sacrifie   pour le bien
 ou le   vrni doit  le quitter content   et absoudre   les  dieux,   cela est trop
 naif.    Non, il a le droit de les blasphemer ! Car enfin pourquoi avoir
 ainsi abuse de sa credulite ? Pourquoi avoir mis en lui des instincts
 trompeurs, dont il a etc la dupe bonne to? Pourquoi cette prime
 accordee a l'homme frivole ou mechant ? C'est done celui-ci, qui ne
 se trompe pas, qui est l'hemme a vise?... Mais alors maudits soient
 les dieux qui placent si mal leurs preferences ! Je veux que l'avenir
 soit une enigme ; mais, s'il n'y a pas d'avenir, ce monde est un affreux
 guct-apens.     Remarquez, en effet, que notre souhait n'est pas celui du
 vulgairo grossier.      Ce que nous voulons, ce n'est pas de voir le
 chatiment du coupable, ni de toucher les interets de notro vertu. Ce
 que nous voulons n'a rien d'cgoiste : c'est simplement d'etre, de rester
 en rapport avec la lumiere, de continuer notre pensee commencee, d'en
 savoir davantage, de jouir un jour de cette verite que nous cherchons
 avec tant de travail, de voir le triomphe du bien que nous avons
 aime. Bien de plus legitime. Le digne empereur, du reste, le sentait
 bien.     " Quoi ! la lumiere d'une lompe brille jusqu'au moment oil
 elle s'eteint, et ne pcrd rien de son eclat ; et la verite, la justice, la
                                                                    "
 temperance, qui sont en toi, s'eteindraient avec toi !                  Toute la
 vie se passa, pour lui, dans cette noble hesitation.         S'il pecha, ce fut
 par trop de piete.       Moins rcsignc, il cut ete plus juste ; car sure-
 ment demander qu'il y ait un spectateur intime et sympathique
 des luttes que nous livrons pour le bien et le vrai, ce n'est pas trop
 demander.

ct de l'univers, ello eut evite. certains exces de rigucur. Gommo lee
ascctes     chretiens, Marc-Aurele pousse quelquefois le renoncement
jusqu'a la seclicrcsso ct la subtilite.             Ce calme qui ne se dement
jamais, on sent qu'il est obtenu par un immense effort. Certes, le
mal n'eut jamais pour lui ancun attrait ; il n'eut a combattre ancone

passion :      Quoi qu'on fasse ou quoi qu'on dise, ecrit-il, il faut que je
 sois hommo de bien, comme l'emeraude peut dire : ' Quoi qu'on dise
 ou qu'on fasse, il faut bien que je sois emeraude et que je garde ma
conleur.' Mais, pour Be tenir toujours sur le sommet glace du sto'icisme,
 il lui fallut faire de cruelles violences a la nature et en retrancher
plus d'une noble partia               Cette perpetuelle repetition des memes
 raisonnoments, ccs mille images sous lesquelles il cherche a se repre
 sentor la vanit6 de toutes choses, ces prcuves souvent na'ives, de l'uni-
 vcrsclle frivolite temoignent des combats qu'il eut a livrer pour
 eteindro en lui tout desir. Parfois il en resulte, pour nous, quelque
 chose d'upre et de triste ; la lecture de Marc-Aurele fortifie, mais ne
 console pas ; elle laisse dans l'ame un vide, a la fois delicious et
 cruel, qu'on n'echangerait pas contre la pi cine satisfaction.              L'lni-
 milite, lo renoncement, la severite pour soi-meme n'ont jamais 6te
 pousses plus loin. La gloire, cette derniere illusion des grandes ames,
 est reduite a neant          II faut faire le bien sans s'inquieter si personne
 le saura.     II  voit bien que l'histoiro parlera de lui ; il songe parfois
 aux hommes du passe auxquels l'avenir l'associera.                  " S'ils n'ont
joue qu'un role d'acteurs tragiques, dit-il, personne ne m'a condamne
 a les imiter."       L'absolue mortification oil il etait arrive avait eteint
 en lui jusqu'a la derniere fibre de l'amour-propre.
      La consequence de cette philosophic austere aurait pu etre la
 raideur et la durete. C'est ici que la bonte rare de la nature de Marc-
 Aurele eclate dans tout son jour. Sa severite n'est que pour lui. Le
 fruit de cette grande tension d'ame, c'est une bienveillance infinie.
 Toute sa vie fut une etude a rendre le bien pour le mal. Apres
 quelque triste experience de la perversite humaine, il ne trouve, le
  soir, a ecrire que ce qui suit : " Si tu le peux, corrige-les ; dans le cas
  contraire, souviens-toi que c'est pour l'exercer envers eux que t'a ete
  donnee la bienveillance.          Les dieux eux-memes sont bienveillants pour
  ces  etres ; ils  les  aident,   tant  leur bonte est grande ! a acquerir saute,
  richesse, gloire.        II  t'est  permis de faire comme les dieux."         Un
  autre jour, les hommes furent bien mechants, car voici ce qu'il ecrivait
  sur les tablettes : " Tel est l'ordre de la nature : des gens de cette
  sorte doivent, de toute necessity, agir ainsi.            Vouloir qu'il en soit
  autrement, c'est vouloir que le figuier ne produise pas de Agues.
  Souviens-toi, en un mot, de ceci : dans un temps bien court, toi et lui
  vous mourrez: bientot apres, vos noms meme ne survivront plus."
  Ces reflexions d'universel pardon reviennont sans cesse.             A peine se
  mele-t-il parfois a cette ravissante bonte un imperceptible sourire.
  " La meilleure maniere de se venger des mechants, c'est de ne pas se
  rendre semblable a eux ; ou un leger accent de fierte : " C'est chose

se dit-il a lui-meme, tu l'exhortais paisiblement, et lui donnais sans
colere, alors qu'il s'efforce de te faire du mal, des logons comme
             '
celle-ci.      Non, mon enfant ! nous sommes nes pour autre chose. Ce
n'est pas moi qui eprouverai le mal, c'est toi qui t'en fais a toi-meme,
                 '
mon enfant !       Montre-lui adroitement, par une consideration generale,
que telle est la regle, que ni les abeUles n'agissent comme lui, ni
aucun des animaux qui vivent naturellement en troupes.               N'y mets ni
moquerie, ni insulte, mais l'air d'une affection veritable, d'un coeur
que n'aigrit point la colere ; non comme un pedant, non pour te faire
admirer de ceux qui sont la ; mais n'aie en vue que lui seul."              Com
 mode (si c'est de lui qu'il s'agit) fut sans douto peu sensible a cette
bonne rhetorique paternelle ; une des maximes de l'excellent empereur
etait que les mechants sont malheureux, qu'on n'est median t que malgre
soi et par ignorance ; il plaignait ceux qui n'etaient pas comme lui ;
il ne se croyait pas le droit do s'imposer a eux.
     II voyait bien la bassesse des hommes ; mais il ne se l'avouait
pas.     Cette facon de s'aveugler volontairement est le defaut des times
d'elite.    Le monde n'6tant pas, du tout, tel qu'elles le voudraient,
elles se mentent a elles-memes pour le voir autre qu'il n'est. De la
un peu de convenu dans leurs jugements.                Chez Marc-Aurele, ce
convenu nous cause parfois un certain agacement.               Si nous vou lions
le croire, ses maitres, dont plusieurs furont des hommes assez
mediocros, auraient ete sans exception des hommes superieurs.                  On
dirait que tout le monde autour de lui a ete vertueux. Cela va a
un tel point qu'on a pn se demander si ce frere, dont il fait un si
grand eloge dans son action de graces aux dieux, n'etait pas son frere
par adoption, Lucius- Verus.       Cela est peu probable.        Mais il est sur
que   le bon   ompereur etait capable  de fortes  illusions,  quand il s'agissait
de preter a autrui ses propres vertus.
     Cette qualite, selon quelques critiques qui . se sont produites des
l'antiquite, en particulier sous la plume de l'empereur Julien, lui fit
commettre une faute enorme, ce fut de ne pas avoir desherite Commodo.
Voilti des cheses qu'il ost facile de dire a distance quand les obstacles
ne sont plus la, et qu'on raisonne loin des faits.            On oublie d'abord
que   les emperours,   depuis  Nerva,   qui  rendirent   l'adoption  un systeme
politique si fecond, n'avaient pas de fils. L'adoption avec exheredation
du fils ou du petit-fils se voit au premier siecle de l'empire, mais n'a pas
de bons resultats.       Marc-Aurele, par principes, etait evidemment

pour I'htJredite directc, 11 laquolle il voyait 1'avantagc do prevenir les
competitions.      Des que Commode fut ne, en 161, il le presenta seul
aux legions, quoiqu'il eut un jumeau ; souvent il le prenait tout petit
entro ses bras et renouvelait cet acto, qui etait une sorte de proclama
tion.     En 166, c'est Lucius- Verus lui-meme qui demande que les
deux fils de Marc, Commode et Annius- Verus, soient faits cesars.
En 172, Commode partage avec son pere le titre de Germanique ;
en 173, apres la repression de la rcvolte d'Avidius, le senat,
pour reconnaitre en quelque sorte le desinteressement de famille
qu'avait montre Marc-Aurcle, demande par acclamation 1'empire
et la puissance tributienne pour Commode.              Deja le mauvais naturel
de ce dernier         s'ctait trahi par plus d'un indice connu de ses
pedagogues ; mais comment prejuger par quelques mauvaises notes de
1'avenir d'un enfant de douze ans?              En 176, 177, son pere le fait
 Imperator, consul, Auguste.         Ce  fut  siirement une imprudence ; mais
on dtait lie par    les  actcs ant6rieurs  ;  Commode,     d'ailleurs, se contenait
encore.    Dans    les   dernieres  anneos,   lo   mal  se  decela tout a fait; a
cliaquo page     des   derniers  livres   des  Pensees,    nous   voyons la trace
du martyro interieur du pere excellent, de I'emperour accompli, qui
voit un monstro grandir a cote de lui, pret a lui succeder et decide a
prendre en toute chose, par antipathic, le contre-pied do ce qu'il
avait vu faire aux gens de bien. La pensee de desheriter Commode
dut, sans doute, alors venir plus d'une fois a Marc-Aurele.                Mais il
e'tait trop tard.       Apros 1'avoir associe a 1'empire, apres 1'avoir
proclame' tant de fois parfait et accompli devant les legions, venir a
la face du monde le declarer indigne eut 6te un scandale.                 Marc fut
pris par ses propres phrases, par ce style d'une bienveillance convenue
qui lui etait trop habituel. Et apres tout, Commode avait dix-sept ans ;
qui pouvait etre sur qu'il ne s'ameliorerait pas ? Meme apres la mort
de Marc-Aurele, on put 1'esperer.           Commode montra d'abord 1'inten-
tion de suivre les conseils des personnes de me'rite dont son pere
1'avait entour6.
     Le reproche que Ton pent faire a Marc-Aurele n'est done pas de
n'avoir point destitu6 son fils ; c'est d'avoir eu un fils.           Ce ne fut pas
sa faute si le siecle ne fut pas capable de porter tant de sagesse.             En
philosophic, le grand empereur avait place si haut 1'ideal de la vertu
que personne ne devait se soucier de lo suivre ; en politique, son
optimisme bienveillant avait affaibli les services, surtout 1'armee.
En religion, pour avoir ete trop attache a une religion d'Etat dont il
voyait bien la faiblesse, il prepara le triompho violent du culte non
officiel, et il laissa planer sur sa memoire un reproche, injuste il est
vrai, mais dont 1'ombre me'me ne devrait pas se rencontrer dans une
 vie si pure.
     Nous touchons ici a un des points les plus delicats de la biographic
do Marc-Aurele. II est malheureusement certain que quelques condam-
nations ii mort furent, sous son regne, prononcees et ex^cutees centre

anti-socialo,   rcvant le renverscment do l'cmpiro; commo tous les
hommo8 attaches      aux vieux principes romains, ils crnront ii la neccssito
do le reprimer.      II n'etait pas bosoin, pour cela, d'edits speciaux : les
lois contre los cuius illiciti, les collegia illicita etaient nombreuses.
Les chretiens tombaient, do la maniere la plus formelle, sous le coup
de ces lois.     Certes, il eut 6te digne du sage empereur, qui introduisit
tant do reformes pleines d'humanite, de supprimer les edits qui
entrainaient do cruolles et injustes consequences.              Mais il faut
observer d'abord que lo veritable esprit de liberte, comme nous
l'entendons, n'etait alors compris de personnc, et que le christianisme,
quand il fut maitre, ne le pratiqua pas niieux que les empereurs
paiens ; en second lieu, quo l'abrogation de la loi des societes illicitcs
cut ete la mine de l'empire, fonde essentiellement sur ce principe quo
 l'Etat ne doit admettrc en son scin aucuno societe differente de lni.
 Le principe etait mauvais, selon nos idees; il est bien certain, du
 moins, que c'etait la pierre angulaire de la constitution romaino.
 Marc-Aurele, loin de l'exagerer, l'attenua de toutes ses forces, et uno
 des gloires de son regno est l'extension qu'il donna an droit d'asso-
 ciation.    Cependant il n'alla pas jusqu'a la racine ; il n'abolit pas
 coinpletement les lois contre les collegia illicita, et il en resulta, dans
  les provinces, quelques applications          infiniment regrettables.     Le
  reproche qu'on peut    lui  faire est le meme   qu'on pourrait adresser aux
 souvcrains do nos jours qui no suppriment pas, d'un trait de plume,
 toutes les lois restrictives des libertes de reunion, d 'association, de la
  presse.   A la distance ou nous sommes, nous voyons bien que Marc-
 Aurele, en etant plus completement liberal, eut ete plus sage. Peut-
  ctre le christianisme, laisse libro, eut-il doveloppi', d'une facon moins
  desastrcuse, le principe theocratique et absolu qui etait en lui.        Mais
  on ne saurait reprocher a un homme d'Etat de n'avoir pas provoque
  une revolution radicale en prevision des evenements qui doivent arriver
  plusieurs siecles apres lui. Trajan, Adrien, Antonin, Marc-Aurele
  ne ponvaient connaitrc des principes d'histoire generale et d'economie
  politique qui n'ont ete aper<;us que do notre temps, et que nos dernieres
  revolutions ponvaient senles reveler. En tout cas, la mansuetndo du
  bon empereur fut, en ceci, a l'abri de tout reproche.        On n'a pas, a cet
  egard, le droit d'etre plus difficile que Tertullien :
                                                               " Cousultcz vos
  annales, dit-il aux magistrats romains, vous y verrez que les princes
  qui ont sevi contre nous sont do ceux qu'on tient a honneur d'avoir
  ens pour persecuteurs.        An contraire, de tous les princes qui ont
  respecte les lois divines et humaines, nommcz-en un scul qui ait

  ouvertement les edits contro nos freres, il en dctruisit l'effet par les
   peines severes qu'il etablit contre lours accusatenrs."           II fant se
   rappeler que l'empire romain etait dix ou douze fois grand comme la
   France, et que la responsabilite de l'empereur dans les jugements qui
   se rendaient en province etait tres faiblo.      II faut se rappeler surtout
   que le christianisme ne reclamait pas simplement la liberte des eultes ;

livre des Pensees ne vieillira jamais, car il n'affirmo aucun dogme. La
vertu do Marc-Aurele, comme.la notre, repose sur la raison, sur la
nature. Saint Louis fut un homme trcs vertueux, parce qu'il etait
chretien ; Marc-Aurele fut lo plus picux des hommes, non parce qu'il
etait paien, mais parce qu'il etait un hommo accompli.         II fut l'hon-

science viendrait a detruire en apparence Dieu et l'ame immortelle,
que le livre des Pensees resterait jeune encore de vie et de verite. La
religion de Marc-Aurele est la religion absolue, celle qui resulte du
simple fait d'une haute conscience moralo placee en face de l'univers.
Elle n'est d'aucuno raco, ni d'aucun pays. Aucune revolution, aucun

1880.]              Mr. W. H. Pollock   on Dumas Pcre.
                   WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                          Friday, April  23, 1880.
        GKOEOE BUSK,    Esq. F.E.S. Treasurer and Vice-President,
                                in the Chair.
                  WALTKB HEBBIES POLLOCK, Esq.      M.A.
                                Dumas Pere.
MB.    POLLOCK began by stating that Aloxandro Dnmas, the elder and
greater of that name, has been, perhaps, more persistently underrated,
in England at least, than any modern writer of his calibre. His only
English biographer devoted his feeble powers to the depreciation of
his subject, and swallowed all the malevolent stories invented or
exaggerated by a pamphleteer whose real name was Jficquot, and who
assumed the bettor-sounding name of Do Mirocourt.              Thackeray,
however, in the ' Kounclabout Papers,1 has constantly given praise, not
more high than deserved, to a writer who, in the 1830 group, camo
 second only, Mr. Pollock thought, to the genius who towered far
above all his companions —Victor Hugo.
     A number of interesting details were then given respecting the
                                                                           '
life and works of Dumas, selected from his ' Souvenirs Dramatiques
and ' Memoires,' which have scarcely a dull page, except when they
deal with politics. .
     Dumas came of a distinguished family, and had Creole blood.
 When very young he was a clerk in a public office, and was impelled
by his innate genius to endeavour to enlarge his moderate income
by writing dramas, having been much excited thereto through witness
                                    '
ing the performance of ' Hamlet by English actors. Idolizing Shake
speare, he aimed at copying him.        The rejection of his first piece,
'
   Christine,' through the opposition of the aged Mademoiselle Mars
and the jealousy of the Classicists, has been humorously described by
himself ; but his ' Henri     III.             '
                                   et sa Cour was highly successful at
the Theutro Francais.      After giving an analysis of this striking play,
produced when its author was only twenty-six years of age, Mr.
Pollock commented on its effect in leading tlio way to the decisive
victory which Victor Hugo gained over the Classicists              by his
'
   Hernani.'
     Dumas' generous appreciation of his contemporaries was then men
 tioned, as well as his quarrel with his collaboratour, Gaillardot, in

884                        -Mr. Walter Herries         Pollock                   [April  23,
                              '                          The authors fought a duel,
tho production of the Tour do Nesle.'
but   eventually   Gaillardet       rendered   justice     to his colleague. . . .
     Dumas excelled in telling and embellishing romantic and humorous
stories, and readers of 'The Three Musketeers' will remember many
passages in which the heroes of that immortal work are concerned in
many boyish escapades.               It may be noted in passing that amongst
the accusations brought against Dumas by his detractors is one to the
effect that the whole of 'The Three Musketeers' was written by
somebody else.        It need hardly be said that the notion is on the face
of it absurd and carries with it its own condemnation.                       But if Dumas
excelled in light dialogues and in the description of wild adventure,
there are, on tho other hand, few writers who can touch him in scenes
of dramatic passion. "There are to my mind few finer things ' in
fiction than the scenes ' in the sequel to The Three Musketeers —
                                                         '
'                                               —
  Twenty Years Later it is called which deal with the trial and
execution of Charles I.            We   know    that   they are not true to history ;
but while we road we are compelled                to  believe    in them and to follow
them with breathless          interest,    and   that,   after    all, has something to
say to the question        of     art,  whether     in  a   novelist,    a painter, or an
actor.    I remember        a    conversation     between       M.    Mounet-Sully and
an English critic concerning the performance of Hamlet by Mr.
Irving. The critic pointed out this and that defect, which ho had
discovered in the Englishman's               rendering.         The Frenchman heard
him out, and replied,
                             '
                                It  may   be  all  as  you     say, but what does that
matter ?    I   can   only    tell    you  that   he   moved      me as no other actor
has ever moved       me,   and      that  is all   that    I care   about'      There is, it
seems to    me,   in  this   speech     a  great   truth,    to  be   accepted of course,
like most generalities,          with   certain    reservations.        If  no fault were
to be    found     with   any      performance       which      stirs   our   feelings, the
occupation    of  criticism      would    be gone.      The    crudest    means    might be
employed     to  harrow     up     the  emotions      and    might     pass  for   exquisite
art.    But when a high-toned and highly artistic effort is made to
move us and succeeds in moving us, then surely, though we need not
be blind to tho shortcomings of the attempt, yet it is better to dwell
more on its successful than on its insufficient results.
     " Dumas Pere was not of course a deliberately moral writer, but
there is hardly one of his books which can be the cause of im
morality to any reasonable grown-up                         person ; while one, ' La
 Tulipo Noire,' specially mentioned by Thackeray, has not a lino
 which, to quote Mr. Podsnap, can call a blush to the cheek of tho
young person.        As to Dumas succeeding in moving his readers, that
 of course must be a matter of individual opinion and experience.
Wo live in a free country, and no one is forced to admire or like
Dumas' writing. But those who do not are,                        I  think, deprived of a
considerable pleasure.
     " Dumas was born in 1802 at Villers Cotterets, a small
                                                                                    country
town between Paris and Rheims, and he died in 1870. He began
writing when he was between twenty and thirty, and in the course

1880.]                         on Dumas Pere.                           385
of his life   ho produced rather more than three hundred romances and
eighty dramas, besides ephemeral articles. One of his detractors went
through an elaborate calculation to prove that no one man could have
written every word that appeared with Dumas' name attached to it.
It would bo absurd to argue that he did write every such word, and
his admirers would perhaps bo sorry to think, from a literary point of
view, that he was guilty of all the stuff that was put forth under his
name.      The third volume of ' Les Quarante Cinq,' for instance, is
most obviously from an alien hand. From a moral point of view it is
not perhaps desirable to defend the practice of adopting other people's
work as one's own. Only let it be observed that the work which
Dumas did so adopt is never equal to his own, and can be recognized
as not being his own, just as the pupil's work in what are called the
 studio-pictures of the old masters can be recognized.
      " As to his
                  being merely an arranger of other people's ideas, that is
 a charge which might as easily and as justly be brought against many
 writers of greater genius and fame.       He never concealed the sources
 of his inspirations.     He has recorded how his first successful drama
 was founded on a passage in an old French chronicler, and on a
 chapter in Walter Scott.      Is there anything more disgraceful in thus
 putting    two  and  two together than in Shakespeare's going for his
 plots   to  Holinshed  ?   If taking suggestions from history and fiction
 is criminal, then almost every writer of mark is worthy of the hulks.
 But the fact is that the meanest reptile, if it has a sting, is capable
 of doing damage out of all proportion to its apparent power. The
 artfully concocted slanders of Jacquot, self-styled De Mirecourt,
 have left their mark.       They have been eagerly seized on by all the
 tribe of writers to whose nature the key-note is envy ; and they
 have spread so far that unhappily one cannot say of them, what Pierre
 Cle'ment said of a libellous pamphlet on Colbert, published just after
 the great Minister's death, ' History takes no notice of these anony
 mous insults.'     All one can do is to lift up one's voice against them.
      " To sum up, Dumas was born, as has been said, in 1802, and died
 in 1870. When as a very young man he occupied a somewhat dreary
 position as a clerk in a public office, he was fired by a noble ambition
 which first assumed a definite shape under the influence of Shakespeare.
  He rose, and quickly, to the very height of success.      It was his fault
  that he bore himself with less dignity after than before he had at
  tained his success, for, amongst other things, it certainly was some
  what undignified to adopt the system of unacknowledged collaboration.
  But even if the greater part of the charges brought against him in
  this respect were admitted, it would still be seen that his industry
  was no less extraordinary than his imagination.          He acquired and
  kept a position in the first rank as a play-writer, as a novelist, and
  as a writer of that kind of discursive essay of which Mr. Sala is in
  England the master. He had immense wit, not a little poetical feeling,
  a perfect command of dramatic resource, and unflagging gaiety.          If
  he wrote much that one would not put into the hands of boys and

maidens, yet there is some of his writing which is stainless, and
where is there an author of the same calibre who has written ex
clusively for boys and maidens ? His method was at any rate, like
                                                                    '
that of the play-writer quoted by Hamlet, ' an honest method ; he
did not palter, as the modern French school of play-writing does,
with vice and virtue, keeping one foot in the dominion of earth, and
casting a false glamour of splendour around corruption.          He made
immense sums, and unhappily spent them more easily than he got
them. He was open-handed to a fault.           He had a child-like vanity
and a child-like simplicity mixed with a curious astuteness.           His
name will  I  think live, and his work be rated at its proper value
long after the efforts of his detractors are forgotten."

                             Fashion    in Deformity.
I  hate to ask your attention this evening to certain outward mani
festations of a propensity common to human nature in every aspect in
which we are acquainted with it — the most primitive and barbarous,
and the most civilized and refined — but one which             is,
                                                             as far as      I
know, peculiar to human nature.
    I shall speak of deformity in the sense of alteration of the natural
form of any part of the body, and those cases of voluntary deformation
will be considered which are performed, not by isolated individuals,
or with special motives, but by considerable numbers of members of
a  community in imitation of one another — in fact, according to fashion,
" that most inexorable tyrant to which the greater part of mankind
are willing slaves."
     Fashion     now often associated with change, but in more primi
                is
tive communities fashions of all sorts are more permanent than with
us and in all communities such fashions as those
    ;                                                    am now speak

ing of are, for obvious reasons, far less likely to be subject to the
fluctuations of caprice than those affecting the dress only, which, even
in Shakespeare's time, changed so often that " the fashion wears out
more apparel than the man."     Alterations once made in the form of the
body cannot be discarded or modified in the lifetime of the individual,
and therefore as fashion       intrinsically imitative, such alterations
                                is
have the strongest possible tendency to be reproduced generation
after generation.
     The origins of these fashions are mostly lost in obscurity, all
attempts to solve them being little more than guesses.     Some of them
have become associated with religious or superstitious observances,
and so have been spread and perpetuated some have been vaguely
                                                   ;
thought to be hygienic in motive most have some relation to con
                                          ;
 ventional standards of improved personal appearance but whatever
                                                               ;
 their origin, the desire to conform to common usage, and not to
appear singular,      the prevailing motive which leads to their con
                      is
tinuance.
     The most convenient classification of these customs will be one

 which is based upon the part of the body affected by them, and    I will
 begin with the more superficial and comparatively trivial — the treat
 ment of the hair and other appendages of the skin.
      Here we are at once introduced to the domain of fashion in her
 most potent sway. The facility with which hair lends itself to various
 methods of treatment has been a temptation too great to resist in all
 known conditions of civilization. Innumerable variations of custom
 exist in different parts of the world, and marked changes in at least
 all more or less civilized communities have characterized successive
 epochs of history.    Not only the length and method of arrangement,
 but even the colour of the hair, is changed in obedience to caprices of
 fashion.    In many of the islands of the Western Pacific, the naturally
 jet-black hair of the natives is converted into a tawny brown by the
 application of lime, obtained by burning the coral found so abundantly
 on their shores; and not many years since similar means were
 employed for producing the same result among the ladies of Western
 Europe — a fact which considerably diminishes the value of an idea
 entertained by many ethnologists, that community of custom is
 evidence of community of origin or of race.
      Notwithstanding the painful and laborious nature of the process,
 when conducted with no better implements than flint knives, or pieces
 of splintered bone or shell, the custom of keeping the head closely
 shaved prevails extensively among savage nations.      This, doubtless,
 tends to cleanliness, and perhaps comfort, in hot countries ; but the
 fact that it is in many tribes practised only by the women and
 children, shows that these considerations are not those primarily
 engaged in its perpetuation.     In some cases, as among the Fijians,
 while the heads of the women are commonly cropped or closely
 shaved, the men cultivate, at great expense of time and attention, a
 luxuriant and elaborately arranged mass of hair, exactly reversing the
 conditions met with in the most highly civilized nations.
      In some regions of Africa it is considered necessary to female
 beauty carefully to eradicate the eyebrows, special pincers for the
 purpose forming part of the appliances of the toilette; while the
 various methods of shaving and cutting the beard among men of all
 nations are too well known to require more than a passing notice.
 The treatment of finger nails, both as to colour and form, has also
been subject to fashion ; but the practical inconveniences attending
the inordinate length to which these are permitted to grow in some
parts of the east of Asia, appears to have restricted the custom to a
few localities.
     If time allowed, the exceedingly wide-spread custom of tattooing
the skin might be here considered, as a result of the same propensity
as that which produces the other more serious deformations, now to
be spoken of ; but it will be as well to pass at once to these.
     The nose, the lips, and the ears have in almost all races offered
great temptations to be used as foundations for the display of orna
ment, some process of boring, cutting, or alteration of form being

necessary to render them fit for the pnrpose. When Captain Cook,
exactly one hundred years ago, was describing the naked savages of the
                                     "
east coast of Australia,* he says : — Their principal ornament is the
bone which they thrust through the cartilage which divides the nostrils
from each other.    What perversion of taste could make them think
this a decoration, or what could prompt them, before they had worn it
or seen it worn, to suffer the pain and inconvenience that must of
necessity attend    it,perhaps beyond the power of human sagacity to
                          is
determine. As this bone        as thick as
                                   is        man's finger, and between

five and six inches long,      reaches quite across the face, and so
                                   it
effectually stops up both the nostrils that they are forced to keep their
mouths wide open for breath, and snufflo so when they attempt to speak
that they are scarcely intelligible even to each other. Our seamen,
with some humour, called      their spritsail-yard and indeed
                               it                               ;  had so           it it
ludicrous an appearance, that till we wero used to we found      difficult

to refrain from laughter."
    Eight years later, on his visit to the north-west coast of America,
Captain Cook found precisely the same custom prevailing among the
natives of Prince William's Sound, whose mode of life was in most
other respects quite dissimilar to that of the Australians, and who
belong cthnologically to    totally different branch of the human race.

                       They have likewise Holes bored in their Ears, both
                       Men and Women, when young, and by continual
                       stretching them with great Pegs, they grow to be
                       as big as a mill'd Five-shilling Piece. Herein they
                       wear Pieces of Wood, cut very round and smooth,
                       so that their Ear seems to be all Wood, with a little
                       Skin about it."
    It is a remarkable thing that an almost exactly similar custom still
prevails among a tribe of Indians inhabiting the southern part of
                                     Fio. 3.

plug or stopper. Among these people the lip-ornament consists of a
conical piece of hard and polished wood, frequently weighs a quarter of

a pound, and drags down, elongates, and everts the lower lip, so as to
expose the gums and teeth, in a manner which to our taste is hideous,
but with them is considered an essential adjunct to an attractive and
correct appearance.
     In the extreme north of America, the Eskimo " pierce the lower
lip under one or both corners of the mouth, and insert in each aper
ture a double-headed sleeve-button or dumb-bell-shaped labret, of bone,
ivory, shell, stone, glass, or wood. The incision when first made is
about the size of a quill, but as the aspirant for improved beauty grows
oWer, the size of the orifice is enlarged until it reaches the width of
half to three-quarters of an inch." * These operations appear to be
practised only on the men, and are supposed to possess some signifi
cance other than that of mere ornament.                The first piercing of the
lip, which is accompanied by some solemnity as a religious feast, is
performed on approaching manhood.
      But the people who have carried these strange customs to the
greatest excess are the Thlinkeets, who inhabit the south-eastern
shores of Alaska.t       " Here it is the women who, in piercing the nose
and ears, and filling the apertures with bones, shells, sticks, pieces of
copper, nails, or attaching thereto heavy pendants, which drag down
the organs and pull the features out of place, appear to have taxed
 their inventive powers to the utmost, and with a success unsurpassed
by any nation in the world, to produce a model of hideous beauty.
This success is achieved in their wooden lip-ornament, the crowning
glory of the Thlinkeet nation, described by a multitude of eye-witnesses.
In all female free-born Thlinkeet children, a slit is made in the under
 lip, parallel with the mouth, and about half an inch below it. A copper
 wire, or a piece of shell or wood, is introduced into this, by which the
 wound is kept open and the aperture extended. By gradually intro
 ducing larger objects the required dimensions of the opening are
 produced.     On attaining the age of maturity, a block of wood is in
 serted, usually oval or elliptical in shape, concave on the sides, and
 grooved like the wheel of a pulley on the edge in order to keep it in
 place.     The dimensions of the block are from two to six inches in
 length, from one to four inches in width, and about half an inch thick
 round the edge, and it is highly polished.           Old age has little terror in
 the eyes of a Thlinkeet belle ; for larger lip-blocks are introduced as
  years advance, and each enlargement adds to the lady's social status,
 if not to her facial charms. When the block is withdrawn, the lip
 drops down upon the chin like a piece of leather, displaying the teeth,
 and presenting altogether a ghastly spectacle. The privilege of wear
 ing this ornament is not extended to female slaves."
      In this method of adornment the native Americans are, however,
 rivalled, if not eclipsed, by the negroes of the heart of Africa.

       " The Bongo women
                                 (says Schweinfurth *) delight in distinguishing
  themselves by an adornment which to our notion is nothing less than
  a hideous mutilation.         As soon as a woman is married, the operation
  commences of extending her lower lip.               This, at first only slightly
  bored, is widened by inserting into the orifice plugs of wood, gradually
  increasing in size, until at length the entire feature is enlarged to
 five or six times its original proportions.           The plugs are cylindrical
  in form, not less than an inch thick, and are exactly like the pegs of
 bone or wood worn by the women of Musgoo.                    By this means the
 lower lip is extended horizontally till it projects far beyond the
 upper, which is also bored and fitted with a copper plate or nail, and
 now and then by a little ring, and sometimes by a bit of straw, about
 as thick as a lucifer-match.              Nor do they leave the nose intact ;
 similar bits of straw are inserted into the edges of the nostrils, and I
 have seen as many as three of these on each side.               A very favourite
 ornament for the cartilage between the nostrils is a copper ring, just
 like those that are placed in the noses of buffaloes and other beasts of
 burden for the purpose of rendering them more tractable.                     Tho
 greatest coquettes among the ladies wear a clasp, or cramp, at the
 corners of the mouth, as though they wanted to contract the orifice,
 and literally to put a curb upon its capabilities.             These subsidiary
 ornaments are not, however, found at all universally among the
 women, and it is rare to see them all at once upon a single individual ;
 the plug in the lower lip of the married women is alone a sine qua non,
 serving as it does, for au artificial distinction of race."
      The slightest fold or projection of the skin furnishes an excuse
 for boring a hole, and inserting a plug or a ring. There are women
in the country whose bodies are pierced in some way or other in little
short of a hundred different places, and the men are often not far
behind in the profusion with which this kind of adornment is carried
out.
      " The whole group of the Mittoo exhibits peculiarities by which
it may bo distinguished from its neighbours.                The external adorn
ment of the body, the costume, the ornaments, the mutilations which
individuals undergo — in short, the general fashions — have all a dis
tinctive character of their own. The most remarkable is the revolting,
because unnatural, manner in which the women pierce and distort
their lips ; they seem to vie with each other in their mutilations, and
                                      I
their vanity in this respect, believe, surpasses anything that may be
found throughout Africa.              Not satisfied with piercing the lower lip,
they drag out the upper lip as well for the sake of symmetry .f             ....
Circular plates, nearly as large as a crown piece, made variously of
quartz, of ivory, or of horn, are inserted into the lips that have been
stretched by the growth of years, and then often bent in a position

         Heart of Africa,' vol. i. p. 297.
    t The mutilation of both lips was also observed by Rohlfe     among the women
of Kadjc, in Segscg, between Lake Tsad and the Benwe.

that is all but horizontal ; and when the women want to drink they
have to elevate the upper lip with their fingers, and to pour the
draught into their month.

     " Similar in  shape is the decoration which is worn bj the women
 of Maganya    ; but though it is round, it is a ring and not a flat plate ;
 it is called ' pelele,' and has no object but to expand the upper lip.
 Some of the Mittoo women, especially the Loobah, not content with
 the circle or the ring, force a cone of polished quartz through the
 lips as though they had borrowed the idea from the rhinoceros.         This
 fashion of using quartz belemnites of more than two inches long, is in
 some instances adopted by the men."
     The traveller who has been the eye-witness of such customs may
 well add, "Even amongst these uncultured children of nature,
 human pride crops up amongst the fetters of fashion, which, indeed,
 are fetters in the worst senso of the word ; for fashion in the distant
 wilds of Africa tortures and harasses poor humanity as much as in the
 great prison of civilization."
     It seems, indeed, a strange phenomenon that in such different
 races, so far removed in locality, customs so singular — to our ideas so
 revolting and unnatural, and certainly so painful and inconvenient —
 should either have been perpetuated for an enormous lapse of time, if
 the supposition of a common origin be entertained, or else have
 developed themselves independently.
     These are, however, only extreme or exaggerated cases of the
 almost universal custom of making a permanent aperture through

the lobe of the ear for the purpose of inserting some adventitious
object by way of adornment, or even for utility, as in the man of the
Island of Mangea, figured in Cook's Voyages, who carries a largo
knife through a hole in the lobe of the right ear. Among ourselves,
the custom of wearing earrings still survives, even in the highest
grades of society, although it has been almost entirely abandoned
by one-half of the community, and in the other the perforation is
reduced to the smallest size compatible with the purpose of carrying
the ornament suspended from it.
      The teeth, although allowed by the greater part of the world to
retain their natural beauty and usefulness of form, still offer a field
for artificial alterations according to fashion, which has been made
 use of principally in two distinct regions of the world and by two
 distinct races.     It is, of course, only the front teeth, and mainly the
 upper incisors, that are available for this purpose. Among various
 tribes of negroes of Equatorial Africa, different fashions of modifying
 the natural form of these teeth prevail, specimens of which may be
 found in any large collection of crania of these people.                 One of the
 simplest consists of chipping and filing away a large triangular piece
 from the lower and inner edge of each of the central incisors, so that
 a gap is produced in the middle of the row in front (Fig. 5, 1).
 Another fashion is to shape all the incisors into sharp points, by
 chipping off the corners, giving a very formidable crocodilian
 appearance to the jaws (2) ; and another is to file out either a single
 or a double notch in the cutting edge of each tooth, producing a
 serrated border to the whole series (3).
    Upper front teeth altered according to fashion. 1, 2, 3, African j 4, 5, 6, Malay.
      The Malays, however, excel the Africans, both in the universality
and in the fantastic variety of their supposed improvements upon
nature.     While the natural whiteness of the surface of these organs

  is always admired by us, and by most people, the Malays take the
  greatest pains to stain their teeth black, which they consider greatly
  adds to their beauty.        White teeth are looked upon with perfect
  disgust by the Dayaks of the neighbourhood of Sarawak.                 In addi
  tion to staining the teeth, filing the surface in some way or other is
  almost always resorted to.         The nearly universal custom in Java is
  to  remove  the  enamel   from   the  front surface of the incisors, and often
  the canine teeth, hollowing out the surface, sometimes, but not often,
  BO deeply as to penetrate the pulp cavity (4).          The cutting edges are
  also worn down to a level lino with pumice-stone.             Another, and less
  common, though more elaborate fashion, is to point the teeth, and
  file out notches from the anterior surface of each side of the upper
  part of the crown, so as to leave a lozenge-shaped piece of enamel
  untouched ; as this receives the black stain less strongly than the
  parts from which the surface is removed, an ornamental pattern is
 produced (5). In Borneo a still more elaborate process is adopted, the
 front surface of each of the teeth is drilled near its centre with a
 small round hole, and into this a plug of brass with a round or star-
 shaped knob is fixed (6).        This is always kept bright and polished
 by the action of the lip over it, and is supposed to give a highly
 attractive appearance when the teeth are displayed.
       Perhaps the strange custom, so frequently adopted by the natives of
 Australia, and of many islands of the Pacific, of knocking out one or
 more of the front teeth, might be mentioned here, but it is usually
 associated with some other idea than ornament or even mere fashion.
 In the former case it constitutes part of the rites by which the youth
 are initiated into manhood, and in the Sandwich Islands it is performed
 as a propitiatory sacrifice to the spirits of the dead.
      The projection forwards of the front upper teeth, which we think
 unbecoming, is admired by some races, and among the negro women
of Senegal it is increased by artificial means employed in childhood.*
      All these modifications of form of comparatively external and
flexible parts are, however, trivial in their eftects upon the body to
those which    I  shall speak of next, which induce permanent structural
alterations both upon the bony framework and upon the important
organs within.
      Whatever might be the case with regard to the hair, the ears, the
nose, and lips, or even the teeth, it might have been thought that the
actual shape of the head, as determined by the solid skull, would not
have been considered a subject to be modified according to the fashion
of the time and place. Such, however, is far from being the case. The
custom of artificially changing the form of the head is one of the
most ancient and wide-spread with which we are acquainted.                  It is
far from being confined, as many suppose, to an obscure tribe of
Indians on the north-west coast of America, but is found, under various
modifications, at widely different parts of the earth's surface, and

among people who can have had no intercourse with one another.                    It
appears,     in  fact, to  have    originated independently,     in  many  quarters,

either of the tribe itself, or of its peculiar institutions, through the
intervention of some superior force, for a standard of excellence in
form, which could not bo changed in those who possessed it, was
naturally followed by all who did not wish their children to run the
risk of the social degradation which would follow the neglect of such
a custom.         " Failure properly to mould the cranium of her offspring
gives to the Chinook matron the reputation of a lazy and undutiful
mother, and subjects the neglected children to the ridicule of their young
companions, so despotic is fashion." * It is related in the narrative
of Commodore Wilkes' United States Exploring Expedition,1)' that " at

Wallawalla tribe (Fig. 6), that had just been released from its bandages,

                                      the form to which the head is subjected are
                                      undesigned, resulting only from the mode
                                      in which the child is carried or dressed
                                      during infancy. Thus habitually carrying
                                      the child on one arm appears to produce
                                      an obliquity in the form of the skull

of  the head, the most explicit is that of Hippocrates, who in his treatise,
'
  De Aeris, Aquis et Locis,' about 400 B.C., says,* speaking of the people
near the boundary of Europe and Asia, near the Palm Mteotis (Sea of
Azoff) : —   I
           " will pass over the smaller differences
                                                          among the nations,
but will now treat of such as are great either from nature or custom ; and
first, concerning the Macrocephali. There is no other race of men which
have heads in the least resembling theirs.          At first, usage was the
principal cause of the length of their head, but now nature co-operates
with usage.     They think those the most noble who have the longest
heads.    It is thus with regard to the usage : immediately after the
child is born, and while its head is still tender, they fashion it with
their hands, and constrain it to assume a lengthened shape by apply
ing bandages and other suitable contrivances, whereby the spherical
form of the head is destroyed, and it is made to increase in length.
Thus, at first, usage operated, so that this constitution was the result
of force ; but in the course of time it was formed naturally, so that
usage had nothing to do with it."
     Here, Hippocrates appears to have satisfied himself upon a point
which is still discussed with great interest, and still not cleared up
— the possibility of transmission by inheritance of artificially produced
deformity.     Some facts seem to show that such an occurrence may
take place occasionally, but there is an immense body of evidence
against its being habitual.
     Herodotus also alludes to the same custom, as do, at later dates,
Strabo, Pliny, Pomponius Mela, and others, theugh assigning different
localities to the nations or tribes they refer to, and also indicating
variations of form in their peculiar cranial characteristics.
     Recent archaeological discoveries fully bear out these statements.
Heads deformed in various fashions, but chiefly of the constricted, elon
gated shape, have been found in great numbers in ancient tombs, in the
very region indicated by Herodotus.           They have been found near
Tiflis, where as many as 150 were discovered at one time, and at other
places in the Caucasus, generally in rock tombs ; also in the Crimea,
and at different localities along the course of the Danube ; in Hun
gary, Silesia, in the South of Germany, Switzerland, and even in
France and Belgium.        The people who have loft such undoubted
evidence of the practice of deforming their heads have been supposed
by various authors to have been Avars, Huns, Tartars, or other
Mongolian invaders of Europe ; but later French authers who have
discussed this subject are inclined to assign them to an Aryan race,
who, under the name of Cimmerians, spread westward over the part
of Europe in which their remains are now found, in the seventh or
eighth century before our era.         As the method of deformation in
European specimens is not always identical, it is by no means certain
that the custom may not have been in use among more than one nation.

the heads of infants, is derived from these people, or is of independent
origin, it is impossible to say.
    In Africa and Australia no analogous customs have been shown to
exist, but in many parts of Asia and Polynesia, deformations, though

Mr. H. B. Low, by the Dayaks, in the neighbourhood of Sarawak.
Sometimes, in the islands of the Pacific, the head of the new-born
infant is merely pressed by the hands into the desired form, in which
case it generally soon recovers that which nature intended for it.      In
one island alone, Mallicollo, in the New Hebrides, the practice of
permanently depressing the forehead is almost universal, and skulls
are even found constricted and elongated exactly after the manner of
the Aymaras of ancient Peru.
     Though the Chinese usually allow the head to assume its natural
form, confining their attentions to the feet, a certain class of mendicant
devotees appear to have succeeded to a remarkable extent in getting
their skulls elongated into a conical form, if the figure in Picart's

      custom has become extinct with the people who used it ; but the Chinook
      Indians, of the neighbourhood of the Columbia River, and the natives of
      Vancouver Island, continue it to the present day, and this is the last
      stronghold of this strange fashion, though under the influence .of
      European example and discouragement it is rapidly dying out.                     Here
      the various methods of deforming the head, and their effects, have been
      studied and described by numerous travellers. The process commences
      immediately after the birth of the child, and is continued for a period
      of from eight to twelve months, by which time the head has perma
      nently assumed the required form, although during subsequent growth
      it may partly regain its proper shape. " It might be supposed,"
      observes Mr. Kane, who had large opportunities of watching the
      process,
                " that the operation would be attended with great suffering,
      but  I never heard the infants crying or moaning, although              I  have seen
      their eyes seemingly starting out of the sockets from the great
      pressure ; but, on the contrary, when the thongs were loosened and the
      pads removed,    I  have noticed them cry until they were replaced. From

     observed in various parts of the world, are found associated within
     a very small compass in British Columbia and Washington Territory,

which the skull is flattened between boards or other compressors,
applied to the forehead and back of the head, and as there is no lateral
pressure, it bulges out sideways to compensate for the shortening in the
opposite direction. (Fig. 10.) This form is very often unsymmetrical,
as the flattening boards, applied to a nearly spherical surface, naturally
incline a little to one side or the other ; and when this once commences,
unless great care is used, it must increase until the very curious oblique
flattening so common in these skulls is produced. This is the ordinary
form of deformity among the Chinook Indians of the Columbia Eiver,
commonly called
                    " Flat-heads."    It is also most frequent among the
Quichuas of Pern.
     The second form of deformity (Figs. 7, 11, and 12) is produced by
constricting bandages of deer's hide, or other similar material, en
circling the head behind the ears,

again across the vertex, behind the
coronal suture, producing a circular
depression. The result is an elonga
tion of the head, but with no lateral
bulging, and with no deviation from
bilateral symmetry.       This was the
form adopted with trifling modifica
tions by the MacrocepJudi of Hero
dotus, by the Aymara Indians of
Peru, and by certain tribes, as the
Eoskeemos, of Vancouver Island.

 been subjected to    it, concur in showing that if any modification in
 mental power   is  produced,  it  must be of a very inconsiderable kind,

 whose heads have been deformed to an extraordinary extent, as Con-

 local eminence, and the fact that the relative social position of the
 chiefs, in whose families the heads are always deformed, and the
 slaves on whom          never permitted,      constantly maintained, proves

     Although the American Indians, living a healthy life in their
native wilds, and under physical conditions which cause all bodily
lesions to occasion far less constitutional or local disturbance than is
the case with people living under the artificial conditions, and the
accumulated predisposition to disease which civilization entails, thus
appear to suffer little, if at all, from this unnatural treatment, it seems
to be otherwise with the French, on whom its effects have been
watched by medical observers more closely than it can have been on
the savages in America.             " Dr. Foville proves, by positive and
numerous facts, that the most constant and the most frequent effects
of this deformation, though only carried to a small degree, are head
aches, deafnesses,        cerebral congestions, meningitis, cerebritis, and
epilepsy ; that idiocy or madness often terminates this series of evils,
and that the asylums for lunatics and imbeciles receive a large number
of their inmates from among these unhappy people." * For this cause
the French physicians have exerted all their influence, and with great
success, to introduce a more rational system in the districts where the
practice of compressing the heads of infants prevailed.
      I will now pass from the head to the extremities, and shall have
little to say about the hands, for the artificial deformities practised
upon those members, are confined to chopping off one or more of the
fingers, generally of the left hand, and usually not so much in
obedience merely to fashion, as part of an initiatory ceremony, or an
expiation or oblation to some superior, or to some departed person.
Such practices are common among the American Indians, some tribes
of Africans, the Australians, and Polynesians, especially those greatest
 of all slaves of ceremonial, the Fijians, where the amputation of
 fingers is demanded to appease an angry chieftain, or voluntarily
performed on jthe occasion of the death of a relative as a token of
affection.
      On the other hand, the feet have suffered more, and altogether
 with more serious results to general health and comfort, from simple
 conformity to pernicious customs, than any other part of the body.
 But on this subject, instead of relating the unaccountable caprices of
 the savage, we have to speak only of people who have already
 advanced to a tolerably high grade of civilization, and to include all
 those who are at the present time foremost in the ranks of intellec
 tual culture.
      The most extreme instance of modification of the size and form of
 the foot in obedience to fashion, is the well-known case of the Chinese
 women, not entirely confined to the upper classes, but in some districts
pervading all grades of society alike.             The deformity is produced by
applying tight bandages round the feet of the girls when about five
years old. The process is an extremely painful one, and its results are
 not only an alteration in the relative position of the growing bones

and other structures, but an arrest of their development, so that they
remain permanently in a stunted or atrophied condition.           The altera
tions of form consist in two distinct processes : 1, bending the four
outer toes under the sole of the foot, so that the first or great toe alone
retains its normal position, and a narrow point is produced in front ;
2, compressing the roots of the toes and the heel downwards and
towards one another so as greatly to shorten the foot, and produce a
deep transverse fold in the middle of the sole (Fig. 14).          The whole
has now the appearance      of  the hoof    of some  animal    rather than a
human foot, and    affords  a  very  inefficient organ   of  support, as the

then see what a miserable, stiffened, distorted thing is this same foot,

when it has been submitted for a number of years to the improving
process to which our civilization condemns it. The toes all squeezed
and flattened against each other ; the great toe no longer in its normal
position, but turned outwards, pressing so upon the others that one or
more of them frequently has to find room for itself either above or
under its fellows ; the joints all rigid, the muscles atrophied and
powerless ; the finely formed arch broken down ; everything which is
beautiful and excellent in the human foot destroyed, to say nothing
of the more serious evils which so generally follow — corns, bunions,
in-growing nails, and all their attendant miseries.
     Now, the cause of all this will be perfectly obvious to anyone who
compares the form of the natural foot with the last upon which the
shoemaker makes the covering for that foot. This, in the words of

the toe to the heel will divide a fashionable boot into two equal and
similar parts, a small allowance being made at the middle part, or
" waist," for the difference between right and left foot. Whether the
toe is made broad or narrow it is always equally inclined at the sides
towards the middle line, whereas in the foot there is no such sym
metry. The first or inner toe is much larger than either of the others,
and its direction perfectly parallel with the long axis of the foot. The
second toe may be a little larger than the first, as generally repre
sented in Grecian art, but it is more frequently shorter ; the other
rapidly decrease in size (Fig. 15, A). The modification which must
have taken place in the form of the foot and direction of the toes
before such a boot can bo worn with any approach to ease is shown at
C. Often it will happen that the deformity has not advanced to so
great an extent, but everyone who has had the opportunity of examining
many feet, especially among the poorer class, must have met with
many far worse.       The two figured (Fig. 16), one (C) from a labouring
working man, the other (A and B) from a working woman, both
     English Feet deformed by wearing improperly-shaped shoes. From nature.
patients at a London hospital, are very ordinary examples of the
European artificial deformity of the foot, and afford a good comparison
with the Chinese.       It not unfrequently happens that the dislocation
of the great toe is carried so far that it becomes placed almost- at a
right angle to the long axis of the foot, lying across the roots of the
other toes.
    The changes that a foot has to undergo in order to adapt itself to
the ordinary shape of a shoe could probably not be effected unless
commenced at an early period, when it is young and capable of being
gradually moulded into the required form. It seems perfectly mar
vellous that anyone who had ever looked at a healthy pair of human

feet could have thought of the possibility of wearing a stiff, unyield
ing shoe of identical form for both right and left, and yet the very
trifling difference which is at present allowed is a comparatively
modern innovation, and is even now too frequently disregarded,
especially where most needed, as in the case of children.
      The loss of elasticity and motion in the joints of the foot, as well
as the wrong direction acquired by the great toe, are not mere theo
retical evils, but are seriously detrimental to free and easy progres
sion, and can only be compensated for in walking by a great expendi
ture of muscular power in other parts of the body, applied in a
disadvantageous manner, and consequently productive of general
weariness.     The labouring men of this country, who from their
childhood wear heavy, stiff, and badly-shaped boots, and in whom,
consequently, the play of the ankle, feet, and toes is lost, have
generally small and shapeless legs and wasted calves, and walk as if
on stilts, with a swinging motion from the hips. Our infantry soldiers
also suffer much in the same manner, the regulation boots in use in
the service being exceedingly ill-adapted for the development of the
feet. Much injury to the general health — the necessary consequence
of any impediment to freedom of bodily exercise— must also be attri
buted to this cause.       Since some of the leading shoemakers have
ventured to deviate a little from the conventional shape, those persons
who can afford to be specially fitted are better off as a rule than the
majority of poorer people, who, altheugh caring less for appearance,
and being more dependent for their livelihood upon the physical wel
fare of their bodies, are obliged to wear ready-made shoes of the form
that an inexorable custom has prescribed.
      No sensible person can really suppose that there is anything in
itself ugly, or even unsightly, in the form of a perfect human foot ;
and yet all attempts to construct shoes upon its model are constantly
met with the objection that something extremely inelegant must be
the result.    It will perhaps be a form to which the eye is not quite
accustomed ; but we all know how extremely arbitrary is fashion
in her dealings with our outward appearance, and how anything
which has received her sanction is for the time considered elegant
and tasteful, while a few years later it may come to be looked upon as
positively ridiculous. That our eye would soon get used to admire a
different shape, may be easily proved by anyone who will for a short
time wear shoos constructed upon a more correct principle, when the
prevailing pointed shoes, suggestive of cramped and atrophied toes,
become positively painful to look upon.
     Only one thing is needed to aggravate the evil effect of a pointed
toe, and that is the absurdly high and narrow heel so often seen now on
ladies' boots, which throws the whole foot in an unnatural position in
walking, produces diseases well known to all surgeons in large practice,
and makes the nearest approach yet effected by any European nation
to the Chinese custom which we generally speak of with surprise and
reprobation.     And yet this fashion appears just now on the increase

the latter the more beautiful of the two. If any should do so, let us
pause to consider whether we are sure that our judgment is sound on
the subject. Let us remember that to the Australian, the nose-peg is
an admired ornament ; that to the Thlinkeet, the Botocudo, and the
Bongo negro, the lip dragged down by the heavy plug, and the ears
distended by huge discs of wood, are things of beauty; that the
Malay prefers teeth that are black to those of the most pearly white
ness, that the Western Indian despises the form of a head not flattened
down like a pancake, or elongated like a sugar-loaf, and then let us
carefully ask ourselves whether we are sure that in leaving nature
as a standard of the beautiful, and adopting a purely conventional
criterion, we are not falling into an error exactly similar to that of all
these people whose tastes we are so ready to condemn.
     The fact is, that in admiring such distorted forms as the con
stricted waist, and symmetrically pointed foot, we are simply putting
ourselves on a level in point of taste with those Australians, Botocudos,
and negroes.     We are taking fashion and nothing better, higher, or
truer for our guide ; and after the various examples brought forward
this evening, may   I not well ask,
        " Seest thou not, what a deformed    thief this fashion is?"

                   WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                             Friday, May   14, 1880.
    WABKEN DK       LA RUB, Esq. M.A. D.C.L. F.E.S. Secretary and
                        Vice-President, in   the Chair.
                                   LOBD EBAY.
              Certain Aspects   of Social Democracy in Germany.
THE idea of socialism is to substitute collective capital and collective
labour for individual capital and for individual labour.          Individual
labour and capital disappear. The results of this combination of
capital and labour are put at the disposal of the individuals according
to the measure of their labour.          By these means it is contemplated
to put a stop to the anarchy of competition.          The division of labour
is of course left to the settlement of public officers.    Income from any
other source than labour ceases to exist.
      The object is said by its apostles to be no other than to correct
the evils resulting from the present agglomeration of capital which
has destroyed the small peasant and the small artificer, who were the
real representatives of combined capital and labour.         They could not
stand against the power of a free and better organised association of
capital and labour.       They cannot be revived. But what can be done
is to make the association which ruined them, not their antagonist, but
 their best friend by absorbing them into it. As the number of great
 capitalists grows smaller and smaller, and the number of those de
 pendent on them larger, the hour draws near, when the great capitalist
 himself must become a unit in a larger combination of labourers. It
 will be easier to force a few great capitalists into the one great central
 productive and distributive co-operative association, than to deal with
 the existing number.         It follows that the present tendency of con
 centrating capital    in  a  few hands is most welcome to the socialists,
 because it will make their task lighter in having to deal in the future
 •with a more limited number.          Whether the actual owner of capital
 acquired    it in  his  own    person or in the person of a predecessor,
 through   honest  or  dishonest   means, is of no great consequence.
      Socialists do not attack individuals, regarding their deeds as simply
 a result of the social organisation of which they form part; they
 attack that social organisation itself.       In that existing organisation
 labour does not get its due, and capital gets more than its due.
 Wages are too low, profits too high.          Labour always finds itself in

1880.]                on Social Democracy     in Germany.                   413
an inferior position to capital.      New inventions, free trade, economic
rent, enrich capitalists, but as a rule — so it is urged—do not improve
the position of the working classes.        On the other hand, if free trade,
scientific discoveries, economic rent, cheap and abundant production,
enrich everybody through the one great central institution, as started
by social democracy, no injustice can possibly arise. The increase
of wealth represents an increase of the comfort of all. In this wealth
they have a share equivalent to their labour, but which can never
make them independent of future labour.
     The question in what way an indemnity should be given to the
present owners of capital does not disturb the equanimity of socialists.
These capitalists are for a certain number of years to get in goods an
equivalent for their present property, but the process of increasing
their capital by means of these goods is arrested. Means of enjoying
life will, perhaps, bo abundantly given to several generations of rich
men, but the means of accumulating interest-bearing capital will be
stopped.      The descendants of the richest individual will sooner or
later become workmen.           Meanwhile the rich individual will have
ample leisure to prepare his grandehildren and great grandehildren
for the pleasant prospect of having to look to their own wits for their
sustenance, and if they have no wits, to the wits of the State. Capital
is no longer the property of any individual, it is the property of all.
     Though nobody will be ablo to acquiro any capital, it does not
follow that nobody will be better off than his neighbour.               For his
labour he can get anything he wishes and which is to be found in
the storehouses of the association, from which, of course, baneful
articles will be excluded.*        A difficulty arises in connection with
certain professions — for instance, medical men — but this can be over
come.     It would be unnecessary to oblige individuals to take another
doctor or surgeon than the one they liked. His pay would not allow
him to accumulate capital, because he would simply get his share
of labour-checks as an equivalent for his visits, consultations, or
operations.
     Socialism, of course, has no room for credit in any form ; the stock
exchange, the mint, mortgages, shares, bonds, consols, all disappear.
A person who does not want to settle his account against the State at
once, can leave it as a claim against the community to be settled in
future.      This claim will not yield any interest. When the claimant
requires payment ho will only get it in goods. What inconvenience
may arise in the case of perishable goods, I need not point out.
     Labour may be unequal, and the retribution of labour also un
equal, but the inequality is only an inequality of temporary ease and
comfort.      Trade and markets disappear as well as money. Labour
and checks for labour are all-sufficient !          Put the required pro-
    * Herbert Spencer's books will certainly be nowhere, and what the fate of the
great philosopher in a social democratic community would be,   I do not attempt
to describe.

414                             Lord Eeay                       [May  14,
duction, say, at three million hours of bond-fide labour, though the
labour may really be performed in four million hours, and you have
checks equivalent to one three-millionth part, and goods exchangeable
for such a check.
      The question naturally arises, what is to be done if— putting it in
its extreme form — the demand on the part of the owners of these
checks concentrates itself on, say, four or five kinds of produce,
leaving other kinds untouched. One of two things must follow ; either
the value of that produce for which there is a greater demand must
be increased, or the supply must be regulated, not according to
the demand, but according to an estimate made by the officials who
are in charge of the department of supply of goods.           With the
latter form, liberty of demand disappears, with the former, socialism
comes down to the vulgarity of our present practice, and descends
from the higher regulation latitudes into the lower latitudes of
 present economic anarchy of supply and demand.
      The great difficulty, however, is in the distribution of labour.
 Socialism cannot afford to remunerate a skilled labourer for an hour's
 good work on the same scale as an unskilled labourer, who is
 practically wasting his time though he toils the whole day. It must,
 therefore, either marshal its labouring population and assign to each
 his work, or establish varying rates of payment on the basis of
 results.   If the latter is done, the labourer retains his liberty, and
 will judge for himself whether he will pass from the field of labour
 in which he is engaged, to one in which wages rule higher and where
 the check of one three-millionth     is more easily obtained than in
 another.     The question is simply this : does socialism make it
 imperative to establish a code of labour enforcing production of
 certain goods in a certain manner ? In that case a certain number
 of men would be told off to work a certain number of hours in the
 fields, another set of men would be ordered to work a given number
 of hours in a factory, another set of men would be obliged to carry
 goods from one place to another, and strict supervision would become
 necessary to distribute the checks in proper relation to the real
 work which had been turned out. Or does socialism adopt a scale of
 remuneration by labour-checks, leaving the labourer to be drawn by
 his spontaneous action and independent judgment into those channels
  to which the wants of the community seem to him to point ? In the
 former case we should have universal vassalage, in the latter a situa
  tion not entirely at variance with that which exists.
       The former, however, seems more in accordance with the object
  aimed at than the latter, and the more practical, if the object of
  the socialists is to make the quantity of labour the only test of
  value, and the only element in civilisation worthy of encouragement
  or even of notice, and its remuneration equal. Even then how it
  would be possible to tax the labour value of two pictures, or of two
  comic songs, or of two lectures, seems to baffle human ingenuity.
       Karl Marx, by far the most eminent social democrat of the present

1880.]                 on Social Democracy in Germany.                       415
day, himself admits that there is a difference between the work of
man and that of a bee.         " Man," he says, " does not only transform
matter, but he      transforms   his design, which he comprehends, which
determines    the   mode   and   method   of his action, as a law, to which
his will  must     be   subordinate."   Putting      this in a less abstract or
Hegelian    form,   what   Marx   admits,   is  that   skill is all important in
human labour.        Hence the difficulty of equal remuneration for that
reason, also on account of another test : the usefulness of labour.
The same article may be useful on the 1st of March, and perfectly
useless on the 1st of April.
    On the other hand, the extremely complicated question of taxation
in our present condition, and certainly in the present condition of
Germany, vanishes.         As the Government of the world has in its
own warehouses every possible product, from torpedoes to oatmeal,
whatever the Government needs has simply to be taken out of them.
It becomes only a matter of book-keeping. Whether the citizen
should bear his proportion in this taxation relatively to his earned
labour-checks, or whether it should be an absolute deduction, is an
open but also a test question.      If it is the duty of every citizen to the
State to supply an equal amount of labour, there is no better way
 of punishing those who do not come up to the maximum than by
 deducting from their labour-checks             the same amount that you
 deduct from those who have earned the maximum, leaving the latter
with a larger share of what remained. To this question, therefore,
we should have a clear answer, because it would spread a flood of
light on the character of socialism.         If  the same amount of taxation
is to be paid by every citizen, we have virtually the forced labour
system of the old Indian community, with or without the lash.
    The inheritance of the citizens is limited to labour-checks and
means of enjoyment, but with these independent family life is perfectly
conceivable.      The question what kinds of production the State must
undertake will be of the utmost importance on account of the im
possibility, through the absence of private capital, of providing for
individual needs, and any provision made by the public distributive
department for needs, which are not general, must inevitably raise
discontent.     Supposing the State starts a Eoyal Institution, a hippo
drome, an aquarium, or an organ, it is obvious that all the citizens
who live far off and who do not want in exchange for labour-checks to
be informed about Marcus Aurclius, to hear the State organ, to see
the State gorilla, or to enjoy the feats of the State clown, will feel
aggrieved.      If  it is left to a combination of private individuals to
start hippodromes and music halls as private ventures, then these
individuals are pro tanto withdrawn from the collective production of
useful things to the production of useless things, and their support
by the transfer of the labour-checks of their fellow citizens lessens
in proportion the means of useful enjoyment of the community and
the quantity of useful things produced by the State.
    Another difficulty presents itself.            If   private individuals are

416                              Lord Beay                       [May   14,
forbidden to be proprietors of the means of production, then what
is to determine whether a thing is a means of production or an
object of enjoyment ? Take this instance. A citizen presents labour-
checks enough to let him have a pony out of the State breeding-stud,
and another presents a sufficient number of labour-checks to get a
hansom. If they combine and ply for hire in their leisure hours,
in exchange, of course, of labour-checks, the pony and the hansom
cease to be a means of enjoyment of private individuals, and become
a means of production, though not owned by the State.                If  in
spectors are to be appointed to determine the limit between objects
of enjoyment and means of production, and to keep people within the
limits of enjoyment and out of the limits of production,          I  do not
 envy their task.
     Socialism, it is clear from these remarks, is not Communism.
Individual labour is remunerated, inheritance is not impossible,
family life does not come to an end, education need not be moulded in
one particular form, a division of goods does not take place, saving —
though it has not the incentive, which the bearing of interest gives to
it— is not hopeless. That improvidence would arise in such a com
munity is evident, and — unless forced labour were adopted— it is not
clear how it would be dealt with.
     The great fundamental error of social democracy is that it con
stitutes society on the basis of acquisition for society, whereas
human nature compels the individual to acquire for himself. Social
 democracy is therefore Naturwidrig,        not consonant with human
instincts.
     According to the advanced evolutionists, carbon, hydrogen, oxy
 gen, and nitrogen constitute a plastidule, the most minute indepen
 dent living mass of protoplasm.        The soul with which it is endowed
 is called " die Plastidul Seele" or protoplastic soul. Virchow very
                                                          "
 wittily speaks of Carbon and Co. as the " Griinder          or promoters
                              "           "
 of the protoplastic soul.      Griinder being a term of reproach for
 the founders of unsound financial concerns, Virchow embraces in
 ono common hatred Carbon and Co., and the socialists.           With due
 regard for the vehemence of this learned sarcasm,     I venture to doubt
 whether a rapprochement      between social democracy and evolution
 can be established, as Virchow does.         I do not venture, in these
 precincts sacred to science, to attack or to defend the theory of
 evolution, but whatever it is, it is essentially opposed to socialism.
 Out of original simplicity and unity evolution develops a multitude
 of phenomena, a complex organism ; socialism wants to reduce this
 complex organism to abnormal simplicity.        The contrast is even more
 striking, when we take the theory of natural selection.           It starts
 from the inexorable competition of all living creatures, and then
 allows only the fittest to survive.    The aristocracy — taking the word
                      —
 in its proper sense instead     of  disappearing, are the only class who
 have a chance.    Socialism   starts from exactly opposite premises, and
                          "
 takes from the " fittest their vitality, clips their wings.     Whatever

evolutions the socialists may perform, they will not be of a scientific
character. Their motto will probably be Stahl's : Science must again
retrace its steps.    Complete liberty would crush the weak, complete
equality the strong ; unscientific equality is therefore adopted instead
of scientific liberty.
     It is only because in Berlin the popular lines apply—
                 " Wer die Wahrheit kennet und saget sie frei,
                   Der kommt in Berlin auf die Stadt Vogtei " * —
that the Neue Kreuz Zeitung was able to make the theory of evolu
tion responsible for the crimes of Hodel and Nobiling.                    Forsooth
the danger is not that socialism may love, but rather that it will
hate, science.     Of all anti-socialist forces science is perhaps one of
the strongest.
     It is easier to dispose of the relations of socialism with evolu
tion than of the harmony on some important points of socialists
and of such men as the late Bishop von Ketteler, Moufang, and
Joerg, of the German centre party ; Rudolf Meyer, of the conserva
tive party ; and of the school represented by Pastor Todt, who has
a weekly paper, called " Der Staats Socialist (von einem Pietisten, einem
Schulzzollner und einem Agrarier gestiftet)," and in which he writes :
" The present struggle of competition is nothing but a system of
expropriation veiled by illusions with regard to property."
     The practical side of social democracy is represented by the
Gotha programme of 1875, which adopts the following principles as
those of the various sections of the party : —
     I. Labour is the origin of all wealth and of all culture. The pro
duce of the labour of society belongs to society ; labour is universal ;
none are exempted ; compensation is given to all concerned according
to their merits.     The emancipation of labour must be the task of the
working classes, compared with whom all other classes are only a
reactionary multitude.
     II. Starting from these premises, the socialistic labour party of
Germany works towards a free State and a socialistic community.
     The socialistic labour party of Germany, though they at present
work in a national spirit, are aware of the international character of
the working class movement, and are determined to fulfil all the
duties which it imposes on the working men to make the fraternity of
all men a reality.^
    * " Who knows and proclaims the truth at Berlin is sure to get into prison."
    t Lately  the Leipziger Volks Zeitung published the following declaration
addressed to it by some of the socialist leaders : " You publish : ' the Paris paper
Patrie has received from one of its friends at Berlin who is in a position to be
well informed, a communication, according to which the socialists in Berlin,
Breslau, Leipzig, Hamburg, Munich, and Stuttgardt held meetings, to come to an
exchange of ideas regarding the present situation in France.       The socialists in
Leipzig, Brcslau, and Munich found the progress of socialism in France so re
markable, that an address was decided upon to the French brethren, of which

     The party demands the institution of socialistic productive associa
tions aided by the State under the democratic control of the working
people. The associations are to be started so extensively for manu
facturing and farming, that out of them will grow the socialistic
organisation of collective labour.
     The socialistic labour party of Germany claims as the essential
conditions of the State : —
     1. Universal direct compulsory suffrage.
     2. Legislation directly by the people, decisions respecting              peace
           and war by the people.
     3. Duty to share in the general defence of the country.                  Army
           of the people, instead of a standing army.
     4. Abolition of all exceptional laws, especially respecting the
           press, public meetings and associations.
     5. Jurisdiction by the people.          Unpaid.
     6. General compulsory education by the State.                 Free in all its
          grades. Beligion declared to be a private interest.
     The immediate demands of the socialistic labour party of Germany,
within the limits of society as at present constituted, are as follows :—
     1. Extension of political rights and liberties in the direction of
           the preceding claims.
     2. Only a progressive income-tax for the State and the parish,
          instead of all existing indirect taxes, especially of those
           which press on the people.
     3. Unlimited right of coalition.
     4. A normal day's labour in reference to the wants of society.
          Prohibition of Sunday labour.
     5. Prohibition of children's labour and of all labour of women
           hurtful to their health and morality.
     6. Laws protecting the life and health of labourers, sanitary
           inspection of labourers' dwellings.             Control of mines, of
           factories, of workshops, of home industry by officials elected
            by the working men.
     7. Regulation     of prison labour.
the fundamental idea was as follows : The German democrats can, alas ! only
utter good wishes for the final triumph of the social republic in France, but hope,
that the French democracy after its victory will give active help to its foreign
brethren who still sigh under the yoke, especially to the German proletariat; as
 soon as the social republic is constituted in France, it can only last if the whole
of Europe is speedily rejoicing over the same blessings as France.' As Leipzig
is also mentioned in this passage, we are compelled to declare in the name of the
Leipzig socialists, that tlie whole report, as far as we know, is completely without
foundation. We feel ourselves powerful enough to settle matters with our
opponents, and do not want any extraneous assistance.        And we do not believe
that German social democracy counts a single member who is of a different
opinion.— Leipzig, October the 22nd, 1879. A. Bebel, W. Liebknecht, F. W.

     8. Complete self-government        for all savings banks, relief associa
          tions, friendly societies, and clubs.
     These were the resolutions of the Congress of Gotha of May the
 27th, 1875, where 25,000 working men were represented. Liebknecht
and Geib represented one section, Hasenclever and Hasselmann an
other, in the previous meeting which had settled the terms of the
compromise.
     This manifesto contains the principles advocated by Marx, and
evidently assumes that the history of the world is simply the history
 of a struggle between various classes, and that you have to upset the
economic structure of society to get a better society and a different
body politic. It may be well to note that Marx expressly declares
 that " the arm of criticism docs not stand in the place of the criticism
 by arms. Material power must be upset by material power, but
 theories also become material power, when they sway the multitude.
 Theories are capable of getting hold of the multitude when they are
 demonstrated ad hominem, and they are demonstrated ad hominem
 when they become radical.       To be radical is to get at the root of a
matter.     The root of man is man himself.           The clear evidence in
favour of the radicalism of the German theory, and therefore of its prac
tical vitality, is that it starts from a distinct positive superior view of
religion. The criticism of religion ends with the doctrine, that man
is the highest being for man, and therefore with the categorical order
to overthrow all relations in which man is a humbled, servile, aban
doned, despicable being : relations which cannot be better described
than by the exclamation of a Frenchman on hearing of a proposed tax
                                                                    "
on dogs : ' Poor dogs, you are going to bo treated like men.'
     The best proof of the influence of socialism is in the fact that in
Germany there are about twelve socialist members in Parliament,
whereas in the American Congress, in the Danish, Dutch, and
Belgian Parliaments, there is not a single professed socialist.
     On the 6th of March, 188.0, Dr. Freiherr von Hertling said in the
Reichstag : " We were certainly surprised by the great results obtained
at the late elections by social democrats, but            I believe that we
should go too far, if we took it for granted that all those who voted
for social democrats were conscious adherents of all their doctrines."
This does not mend matters. The return at the late election in
Hamburg of an insignificant           shoemaker, Hartmann, without any
organisation of the party, without committee, without funds, by an
overwhelming majority, can only be attributed to the fact, that at
Hamburg, as at Frankfort-am- Main, social democracy has wealthy
friends generously disposed towards it.

contain the greater number of socialists ; in Italy, of the Italians who
understand German some are socialists.              Why is this? The chief
reason is, perhaps, the extraordinary development of learning                in
Germany and the onesidedness of German learning.                 Germany owes
a great deal to its Universities, but its gratitude is assuming rather
alarming proportions.          Some Germans seem to think that all social
evils can be cured by systems.              When, therefore, notwithstanding
intellectual superiority, Germany seemed to remain in a comparative
condition of material inferiority, it was natural that the mass of
Germans should begin to say : It is all very well that every provision
is made for our brains, but what is the provision for our stomachs ?
What is the provision made for the weak against the oppression of
the mighty capitalist — whether he be an individual promoter or a
shareholder in a limited liability company ? Here, of course, was
a great opening for young men with generous dispositions.                  The
question certainly       was    not  a  very easy  one,  but that  made it  all
the more attractive.          Instead of writing profound treatises for a
very limited circle of learned readers, the temptation to write for
a very large public was great.
    The apotheosis of the State became the favourite theme.                The
English principle, that the individual should reap the full benefit of
his own individual actions, work on his own responsibility, and not
be hindered, but also not assisted in any way except by cheap educa
tion, is the exact counterpart of this apotheosis of the State, which
may be called militarism.            Whether the State absorbs the whole
strength of the nation in the army, as in Germany, or absorbs it in
water, as in Maine, by the liquor law, the principle is the same.            It
is a military mode of propagating opinions, and therefore an outrage
on a fundamental principle of liberty, which is the toleration of
error, or rather of what the majority for the time being entitles
error.    Socialism is the most logical application of these principles,
which are not as uncongenial to the German mind as they are to
ours.
     Socialism would crush individual volition. It assumes, that indi
viduals being left to their own devices, must come to grief, but acting
collectively will escape from the miseries of this present life. This
theory is tempting both to a privileged class afraid of losing its
                             "
privileges, and to the residuum," which sees in it the shortest cut
to power.       It ought    to be resisted by the enlightened liberty-loving
members      of  all classes.    Unfortunately the German middle class is
not enlightened politically.          It has not yet realised the advantages
of independence.         It  cannot    grasp the fact, that it is the merit of
representative     institutions    to  keep the various interests in balance,
allowing    them    to protect   themselves   from State interference instead
of courting it. Tho parliamentary system is quite as hateful to the
socialists as it is to oligarchs, because it is a check on supremacy and
an inducement to controversy.
     Oligarchy and socialism both enslave the human mind. Demo

cracy introduced, where tbo Government is more or less confined to
police duties, will not find a large scope for its powers of doing mis
chief, but, where it succeeds to a paternal Government, it is apt to
assume parental authority on a dangerous scale, forgetting that it is
the parent of children, a good number of whom are wiser than itself.
Communities tending to democracy should therefore be extremely
careful with what duties they charge the State. The smaller the

inheritance, in this case, the less " damnosa         it will prove in the
future.    The great difficulty in making laws is to prevent these laws
from going beyond their intended object.
     The questions of Sieyes — What is the middle class ? Nothing ;
What should it be? Everything; — are exaggerations, but certainly in
a less dangerous direction than Lassalle's advice given in these words:
" Take, friends, this pledge : if ever it comes to a struggle between
the monarchy by divine right on the one side, and this miserable
middle class on the other, then take your oath, that you will stand
on the side of monarchy against the middle class. . . . from my youth
I  have been a republican, and notwithstanding, or perhaps exactly on
that account,   I have come to the conclusion, that nothing can have a
greater future and a more blissful influence than royalty, if it can
                                                      "
only decide to become ' Sociales Konigthum.'             Bismarck said of
Lassalle, of whom he had a very high opinion :      " Whether the German
empire would exactly culminate in the dynasty of Hohenzollern or in
that of Lassalle was probably doubtful, but Lassalle's tendencies were
certainly monarchical."
     Napoleon expressed the idea very forcibly : " Given a triangle,"
he said ; " one side represents the Church, the second side the anny,
the third side the people, and in the centre you have the middle
class well fenced in."
     In Germany the whole political system has been so framed as to
check political independence and vigour, either in the higher or
in the middle class. The ruling power in Germany is an exceedingly
well-trained, highly organised bureaucracy (bureaucratismus). Self-
government is hardly in its infancy ; everything is done for the
people. Bureaucratic initiative supersedes all parliamentary initia
tive. The socialists naturally, therefore, wish to lay hold of this
bureaucracy ; they must take possession for their own purposes of the
existing machinery.      Instead of increasing the power of Parliament,
the extreme parties on either side in Germany weaken its control :
the executive by its demands of arbitrary power, the social democrats
 by their dislike to joint action with the liberal party. Meanwhile the
increase of activity of the Government, its assumption of more respon
 sibility — as in the management of railways — constitutes a concession
 to the principles of social democracy and stimulates the revolutionary
                                          "
 appetites. Of this " socialisme d'etat there are symptoms in France,
 where bills have been introduced by private members securing to the
 working classes cither a pension at the close of life or a small capital  .
 to start with.    Instead of abandoning protection and reducing all

  taxation which interferes with the first necessities of the working
  classes, the circuitous process is maintained of taking with one hand
  and giving back with the other, the net result of which can only be
  the salary of a certain number of superfluous officials, besides the
  obvious damage done to trade.
       These principles are found in the programme of May the 30th,
  1873, of Das Verein fur Social Politik, composed of the most
  learned political economists of Germany.           They wish to avoid the
  stern individualism of the Manchester scheol, as well as the social
  revolution which would result from the monopoly of capital by
  the State. " We are of opinion," they say, " that the unlimited
  freedom of action of individual interests which are partly opposed
  to each other and are not of equal strength, does not guarantee the
  well-being of the whole community!; that the exigencies of a common
  feeling of humanity must also influence economic conditions much
  more, and that the well-considered intervention of the State must be
  admitted in time to protect the just interests of all concerned. . . .
  In bringing this intervention to a serious issue, the egotism of the
 individual and the selfish wants of the various classes of the com
  munity will be made subject to the permanent and higher calling of
 the whole community."       The first sentence is a protest against the
 Manchester school, the second against socialism.
      Wagner's theory goes beyond this ; he wants a compromise with
 socialism, the increase of collective at the expense of individual
 property.     He would vest all property in land and houses of a town
 in some public authority.     It is said that he went to Varzin, Prince
 Bismarck's seat, to expound a scheme by which the whole insurance
 business of the country would be undertaken by the State. Even
 von Sybel, who is a decided opponent of socialism, writes about
 wealth : " As such it has no value, it obtains it only by satisfying
human wants ; acquisition of property should only be an object in so
far as it is the means of attaining higher ends, such as health and
capacity for labour, enjoyment and power, intelligence            and bene
volence.      Where the pursuit of wealth is in antagonism with these
objects, there economic laws remain true, but they have to bow to
higher laws, and human society, the State, is not only justified, but
obliged to require this submission from each of its citizens, and in
case of need, to use compulsion."               Here we have von Sybel
throwing     on the  State the  duty   of  adjusting  human society, and of
drawing     the line  between  thrift,  a virtue,  and niggardly shabbiness,
a vice.
     In what an absurdity this would land us. It is not the State which
can or must enjoin the submission of human society to higher laws.
This can only be done by the dictates of conscience and by the
voluntary effort of each individual. That socialism considers the
acquisition of wealth as the highest law is one of its most grievous
errors, and must have a demoralising influence on its votaries.        How
is social democracy to be combated? By exceptional laws? By

 establishing what the Germans call a state of dry siege ? By com
 promise ? Certainly not. Socialism is a fallacy.
     The attitude of a Government towards tiny movement arising in
 the nation against its wishes, should always be guided by the thought
that it is not brought face to face with an extraneous and a hostile
force, but with its own fellow-citizens.             Whatever measures are
taken, evidently are taken by one part of the nation against another
part.    From the nature of things that part, however small a minority,
is strengthened by any measures which savour of persecution. In
the long run the family instinct which exists in nations will assert
itself.   A statesman who does not think of his own ends, but of the
continuity and the ultimate good of the nation, will therefore do all
he can to remain neutral in all social and religious struggles, unless
they constitute a real peril to the very existence of society.             The
worst thing that can happen to an author or an artist is not violent
criticism, but that his work should be ignored. This applies to parties
and the action of Government towards them as well. Whatever it
notices it magnifies.      The licensed victualler unnoticed is nowhere,
legislated upon or against he becomes an important factor ; the clergy
in the Rhenish provinces left alone were not very influential, but
under the control of the authorities, they become popular heroes.
     The socialist leaders are quite aware of this. They know that
every term of imprisonment adds to the numbers of their followers,
whatever disagreeable results this may have for themselves. They
want a struggle, not victory.           Victorious, they would quarrel over
the spoils and immediately meet with resistance too strong for them.
One of the best speeches in favour of the Repression Act, introduced
in 1878 in the German Parliament, was delivered by the socialist, M.
N. Hasselmann, though of course he voted against the bill. The
socialists afford a great opportunity to any statesman who wishes to
keep the nation in a feverish condition.          All he has to do is to point
to their nefarious    doctrines.     This  is the result of what the socialists
                                 "              "
are pleased    to call   their     Idealismus      which, however, does not
shrink    from   calling   the   execution    of  Hodel   " murder," and the
murder of General Mesensow an "irregular execution."                 The Act
against   the socialists  which     has just  been  renewed   is to quell " die
Untergrabung dor bestehenden Staats- und Gesellschafts-Ordnung,"
and gives exceptional power to the police.
     The Austrian Government is not placed in the same difficulty as
the German Government, because Austrians do not care for theories
unless they see pecuniary results.             If  in Saxony, where social
democracy is strongest, those results were to follow, it is probable
that social democracy would get a following in Austria. At present
no special measures are enacted by the Austrian Government.                   It
relies on the efficacy of a strict law for the expulsion of foreigners
by the police, and the control of the right of public meeting.             The
police, who are always represented at these meetings, would at
once close them in case anything revolutionary were taught.                 No

association can be formed which does not previously submit its rules
for approval to the Government. The Austrian Government does not
consider that there is any need for strengthening their hands by new
laws.
     In Germany intense alarm was created by the spread of a new
creed which certainly did not scorn to adopt abstract tenets, which
 took good care to start from entirely new premises, which proclaimed
everybody to have been deceived by everybody else, and which
was hailed with a cordial welcome. The question it really opens is
this : Oan the German people be made prosperous at home without
resorting to emigration?      Can the resources of the country be de
veloped ? Can the fear be removed that, unless revolutionary means
are used, Germany must remain a poor and unhappy country ?            The
                               I
solution we should propose, think, would be the same we gave to a
similar crisis after Waterloo.     Let trade, manufactures, and agricul
ture bestir themselves; — remove everything, in whatever shape or
form, which hampers their development ;•— see how your taxation can
bo reduced.    If  this cannot be done without a European under
standing or disarmament, then why not come to this understanding,
why not depart from what Mirabeau called " 1'industrie nationale de
la Prusso la guerre."
     The same burden which presses on Germany, presses on other
States.   Education is going on in these other States, and will sooner
or later produce the same craving for comfort which it has produced
in Germany. This result is inevitable.       Education generates greater
requirements. State demands made a century ago, and then appearing
plausible, will now be severely criticised by those on whom they are
made, and by whom they must be approved.        If they are not approved,
and yet continued all the same, they will prepare a soil on which any
weeds may grow.      The social democrats know this, and rejoice over
all the mistakes which are made by their opponents, and, quite
naturally, fear most of all real reformers. Enemies of individual
capital, they cannot endure those who would make it possible for
everybody to become more or less of a capitalist.      Their propaganda
thrives on the antagonism between wealth and the proletariat.           A
society composed   of thrifty  men,  contented because  they could  enjoy
quietly their savings ; a society in which all dishonesty was rigorously
ostracised, whenever it could not be treated as a criminal offence ; a
society where a certain amount of well-being was within the reach of
all, would not yield them a considerable return of converts.
     As long as the average wages of a German mechanic are not much
more than half those of an English one, with a heavy income-tax
affecting oven the smallest incomes, house rent in the great cities
enormously high, and the bread winner called away for three years'
service at the age of twenty, you may annihilate the liberty of speech
of social democracy, but you cannot prevent it from spreading.       Pro
cessions will attend funerals of leaders : 12,000 persons at Breslau of
Keinders ; 20,000 to 40,000 persons at Hamburg of Geib ; though it is

 remarkable that no illegal outrage has been committed since the
 passing of the anti-socialistic Act. Five years ago half of the in
 habitants of Germany were too poor to pay any direct tax ; of those
 that remained, more than 400,000 had to be prosecuted, and of these
 160,000 were simply found to be completely destitute of means.
     It is not wonderful, then, that even young Government clerks fresh
 from the University are unconsciously using in State documents the
jargon of State socialism, and that they inveigh against the spoils of
 private enterprise and individual egotism as if they were writing for
 the socialist press, and not inditing documents intended to suppress
 socialism.    The German Government is placed in a delicate position.
 Their   actions are scrutinised by minds filled with chimeras.       From
 professorial  chairs,  from low platforms, the restoration of society is
 the never-ceasing theme.       Practical ideas fall flat, and hard work,
 which must inevitably be the first duty of the greater part of man
 kind, becomes unattractive.      A German workman forfeits his wages,
 convinced that eventually the " Volksstaat
                                                 "
                                                    will give him unpre
 cedented comforts.       Meanwhile he is dismissed by his employer and
 becomes cynically covetous.       He does not want reform, which is
the more just application of an existing principle, but revolution,
which is the substitution of a new principle for an old one. He is
not satisfied with the same privileges which the other citizens enjoy.
     Germans have been accustomed to centuries of patriarchal govern
ment.     That patriarch cannot suddenly abdicate. He should, however,
surrender gradually his functions.      The question of State interference
is the great political question of the day. Where the State under
takes everything, as in the socialist State, society ceases to live, and
becomes like a corpse.        The rout of the Manchester school (" das
Manchesterthum "), on which the Nord Deutsche Zeitung throws
the blame of socialism, would be, on the contrary, the defeat of its
bitterest enemy.      In Germany, faith in organisation has superseded
faith in liberty. Bismarck himself gave the explanation in his speech
of May the 8th, 1880, when he said: "Thirty years            I have fought
for German unity" — mark: not liberty — though ho also made the
                                        I
following remarkable statement : " deem it necessary to state, that
the enthusiasm for the principle of German unity is slightly weakened.
Yes, gentlemen, weakened.         Particularism has increased, the an
tagonism between parties is fiercer, the struggle of passions more
violent.    I am fully entitled to appear on this subject as a competent
witness."     Nobody here    I suppose will dispute the gravity of these
words.
     We owe too much to German learning, to German science, to
German literature, not to wish that united Germany should prosper.
A regular action of the heart of Europe is all-important.          But the
unity of Germany must be accompanied by the free development of all
German internal forces, to be safe from disruption.       Let us hope that,
after having travelled through the wilderness of protection and re
pression, Germany may enter on a smooth course of real liberty.

Rightly interpreted, this only means a higher efficiency of all the
constituents of a people in their various functions, not of some only.
Less activity in the Government means an increased activity of all
citizens cooperating to further prosperity and culture.          Lassalle
said the great question of the day was simply " eine Magenfrage," a
question of food supply, which the English free-traders —according to
others — reduced to "eine Beutelfrage," a purse question.      Germany
is not suffering merely from either the one or the other ; the whole
condition of Germany is one of moral debility and intellectual
nervousness.     Common sense is the tonic required above all others;
without it moral and intellectual remedies arc of no use.

to speak English and to be imbued with English ideas — is probably
that of a more luxuriant political vegetation than Thiers seemed
willing to admit, if they adopt or hold to the present faith of English
men, that socialism is only another form of what Englishmen have
always abhorred and will always repudiate : despotism.

  THE subject which     I have proposed for this evening's discourse does
  not offer the wide perspective of modern investigation opened out by
 that of Professor Huxley, nor can it claim the manifold and varied
 sympathies evoked by-the lectures which have followed on the suc
 ceeding Fridays. It belongs rather to the region of minuto philo
 sophy, and will on that account perhaps require more than usual
 patience and attention.       Following the lines of a research on which
 Mr. Moulton and myself have been for some time engaged,               I hope to
extend by one or two steps our knowledge of the internal mechanism
of that complicated, and still somewhat mysterious subject, the Elec
 tric Discharge.     And in so doing      I must leave aside, or at least only
incidentally    touch upon, many      collateral  points of interest which have
 presented    themselves   in   our   inquiry ;   because  my main object will
be ultimately to bring ourselves face to face with those important
elements which we have called the small time-quantities of the phe
nomenon ; that is, the times during which the different parts of the
discharge are effected.        These quantities are, however, so transient
 in duration, so evanescent in magnitude, that they elude all direct
observation even with our most delicate instruments ; and therefore,
abandoning all attempts at absolute measurement,                we have endea
voured, as it were, to lay wait for them as they pass, and, catching up
any waif or stray indication that they may leave behind in transitu, to
form such relative estimate of the quantities in question as may prove
possible.
     It is well known that when an electrical discharge is effected in
air or other gas at atmospheric pressure, it passes in an irregular
bright line or spark.      If  the discharge be made in a closed tube, and
the tube be gradually exhausted, the discharge becomes thicker as the
exhaustion proceeds, until it completely fills the tubo with light.
During the process of exhaustion, the discharge, when effected in a
suitable manner, exhibits the phenomena of stratification in its various
phases ; while at the same time a very marked dissymmetry between

428                                 Mr.   Spotliswoode                               [May 21,
the positive and the negative ends of the discharge displays                             itself.
This dissymmetry increases with the progress of the exhaustion.
    But passing over, for the present, these features of our subject,                         I
wish to draw your attention to a peculiar condition of the discharge
which, having studied with much care, we have turned to account as
our special method of research. It is as follows: If a continuous source
of electricity, such as a Holtz machine, be used, and the terminals of
the tube be connected with the main conductors, or poles, in the usual
way, the discharge will pass through the tube in a condition which to
all direct observation appears to be continuous in respect of time ;
although the researches of Mr. De La Bue, and of others, alike point
to the conclusion that the discharge is in every case discontinuous
and disruptive.    In this condition the discharge is indifferent to the
presence of a conductor, or even to that of a charged body, such as an
electrophorous, or a Leyden jar. If the latter be brought near enough
to discharge itself on to the tube, the luminous column will, it is
true, exhibit a momentary flutter, but will shew no other sign of
susceptibility.    This momentary flutter                    is,
                                                 nevertheless, worthy of
being noticed, as    will reappear at later stage of our investigation.

    If, however, one of the connections between the machine and the
tube be broken by      small interval of air, over which the discharge
                           a
must always leap in the form of spark, the luminous column imme
                                           a
diately becomes sensitive to the approach of           conductor.    This
                                                                       a
break in connection, or air-spark, may be made either in the wire
leading from the positive, or in that leading from the negative pole
of the machine — in other words, in that leading to the positive or to
the negative terminal of the tube and        will be convenient to speak
                                              ;         it
of these two dispositions as the positive air-spark and the negative
air-spark arrangement respectively.     When an air-spark is used the
discharge will be described as intermittent        when        not used
                                                                   ;       it   is           it
will be called continuous, although, having reference to           remark            a
made above, the latter term can strictly be used only in         qualified       a
sense.
      This condition of sensitiveness             is   that which was mentioned above
as having been the subject of our special study.  The general fact of
sensitiveness in an electrical discharge had been noticed by previous
observers but its connection with intermittence, and the laws which
           ;
regulate   it,
             do not appear hitherto to havo attracted the attention
which they deserve.
    In order to examine this condition of the discharge, let us begin
with tube of moderate exhaustion, which presents column of light
       a                                                                   a
from the positive terminal through the greater part of its length                             ;
then   ablank space and lastly halo of light enveloping the negative

terminal.      an air-spark be now introduced into the positive part
of the circuit, the column will lengthen and approach the negative
terminal, and     will at the same time contract laterally, and become
                    it
narrower.        If
                 conductor, such as the finger, be now made to approach
                      a

                               is  and    the conductor be brought still
                                          ;        if

nearer, the column is severed into two, while from the point under that
where the finger rests there issues a halo similar to that which sur
rounded the negative terminal before the air-spark was introduced.
The explanation of this phenomenon is to be sought in the fact that the
positive electricity coming from the machine accumulates at the air-
spark interval until it has acquired sufficient tension to make the
leap. It then passes per saltum into the tube, giving to the latter an
instantaneous charge of the same name as that appertaining to the
air-spark terminal.     The conductor outside, through a redistribution
of the electricity on its surface, is able to supply to the tube by
induction the electricity which it needs, and forms a quasi terminal
immediately within the point of contact. In the case in question,
the quasi terminal is a negative one ; the repulsion is the equivalent
of the blank space, and the blue discharge that of the negative halo.
 On account of the fact that this inductive supply of electricity from
 the outside relieves the charge upon the tube due to the impulse from
 the air-spark terminal, we have called the effects in question the
 relief effects. They are by their very nature intermittent and co-
periodic with the discharge whose needs are thus supplied.
      The same is the case, mutatis mutandis, with a negative air-spark.
 The relief consists in a series of positive discharges, which are
 characterized by an attraction of the luminous column within the
 tube, and by the commencement of similar luminosity immediately
 within the point of contact.       The effects with a negative air-spark
 are not so marked as those with a positive, for reasons to be men
 tioned hereafter.
      It is further to be noticed that the completeness of these effects
 depends upon the capacity of the conductor.         In the case of an earth
 connection, the capacity is infinite and the relief complete.    If instead
 of the earth we take simply a reel of wire insulated bodily, then,
 when the wire is coiled up close to the tube, the relief which it
 affords is very small, viz. we find only moderate repulsion ; but as
 the wire is uncoiled and led away at right angles to the tube, the
 capacity of the system increases, and the relief becomes more and
 more complete, viz. we have stronger repulsion, and when the relief
 is sufficient we have the blue discharge also.
      If contact with the outside be made with a ring of tinfoil wrapped
 round the tube the effect will be more striking. In the case of negative
 relief, the positive impulses will start in the form of a hollow cone in
 the direction of the negative terminal, while the negative electricity
 left free beneath the tinfoil goes to meet and to satisfy the positive
 impulses arriving from the positive terminal ; and in so doing, it
 truncates the positive column.
      It will doubtless have occurred to some of my audience that, if the
 explanation of these effects be correct, it ought to be possible to
 imitate them by connecting a point on the outside of the tube with the
 opposite or non air-spark terminal, because wo should then be sup
 plying exactly what was wanted, viz. impulses of electricity of the

430                              Mr.  Spottisuioode                      [May 21,
opposite name and coperiodic with those projected into the interior
from the air-spark terminal.         And this proves to be the case.
      It may then be fairly asked, what will be the effect of leading to
the outside of the tube impulses from the air-spark terminal itself ;
i. e. impulses coperiodic with those inside, but of the same name.
These effects, which to distinguish them from the relief effects we have
called special, are really what might have been anticipated ; viz.
special effects with a positive air-spark, or more briefly positive special
effects are like relief effects with a negative air-spark, or negative
relief effects, and vice versa. This then completes the four possible
combinations of air-spark with coperiodic inductive impulses, ab
extra.
     In all the cases of special effects it will be observed that the
impulses conveyed by the wire outside have always arrived at the
point of contact in time to produce their effect on the electricity
advancing within the tube ; in other words, that electricity, whether
positive or negative, is conveyed along a conductor at least as quickly
as along the gas.       We shall in the sequel show reasons for thinking
that it travels more quickly along a conductor.
      Having exhausted the effects due to. a single air-spark, we are
naturally entitled to inquire what will be the effect if two air-sparks
be used, the one positive the other negative.            The experiment can be
made with the same apparatus as that hitherto used, viz. a Holtz
machine and an air-spark interval in each wire leading to the tube ;
but it is more easily effected with a small induction coil giving small
but rapid impulses, which are equivalent to an air-spark at oach ter
minal.      In this case it will be found, on testing the tube by means
of its relief or its special effects, that one half of the tube is
charged positively, the other half negatively ; and that between the
two there is a neutral zone, showing no signs of charge whatever.
By attaching a little condenser, e. g. a thunderplate, to one terminal
or to the other, the impulses at that terminal become so toned down
that the neutral zone is brought nearer to the attached terminal, in
proportion to the capacity of the condensor.           If either of the terminals
be   connected   to earth,   the neutral  zone   is  brought   close to the con
nected    terminal  ;  i. e. the tube is charged    throughout    with electricity
of  the  opposite  name.
     It will have been noticed that through these processes, whether
relief or special, whether positivo or negative, when sufficiently
energetic, the discharge is severed into two ; although the exact con
figuration near the point of severance differs in the various cases.
In other words, the tube has been dividod into two parts, each of
which presents the features of a complete discharge.                 Now, if this
process    be repeated    at several points   on   the  tube, the  discharge  will
be subdivided into as many smaller but complete discharges as there
are points of contact or of relief, the negative terminal itself being
counted as one.       These being sufficiently. numerous, or at all events
sufficiently noar together, we have a complete artificial production of

1880.]                  on Electricity  in Transitu.                     431
the phenomena of striation.        By this, as well as by many other ex
periments, we have been led to the conclusion that a stria with its
attendant blank space is the physical unit of a striated discharge, and
that a striated column is an aggregate of such unities formed by a
step-by-step process, the general character of which is indicated in our
intermittent discharges.     To complete this view of the case, it would
not bo difficult to show, for wo have made many experiments on the
subject, that the so-called negative glow is merely a stria localized in
position and modified in form by the solid terminal to which it is
appended. We have on this account called it an anchored stria.
    One of the most important consequences            following from these
experiments    is that   the   discharges   at the   two   terminals are. in
general independent    of  one  another,  excepting   as  regards the source
from whence they come* and that each is primarily determined by
the conditions at its own terminal, and only in a secondary degree, if
at all, by the conditions which subsist at the opposite terminal.       And
since the discharges are not, at all stages of their entire duration
(brief though it be), necessarily identical at both terminals, the tube
will contain charges of free electricity at different times. A tube,
therefore, during the passage of a discharge, is in no respect like a
conductor, but is an independent electrical system, having an action
very similar to that of an air vessel in a forcing pump.
    This independence of action at each terminal may be illustrated
by connecting only one of the conductors of the machine with one of
the terminals of the tube, in which case a unipolar discharge will be
seen to enter the tube ; and unless it be strong enough of itself to
reach the opposite terminal, or at all events within a range of it
equal to a blank space, it will return and find exit by the way
by which it came. By connecting the two terminals of the tube with
one conductor of the machine, a double unipolar discharge will be
produced, the two extremities of which will be found to be mutually
repulsive.    We have not now time to enter into the differences
between positive and negative unipolar discharges; but it will bo
sufficient at present to remark that they each have, and maintain
throughout their existence, the characteristics which belong to them
respectively when they form portions of the complete discharge.
     Thus far our attention has been mainly directed to the phenomena
displayed by the column of luminosity connected with the positive
terminal.    The phenomena appertaining to the negative terminal
are, however, not less important, as the beautiful experiments of
Mr. Crookes have abundantly shown. But in order to study these
negative phenomena with advantage we must carry onr exhaustion, as
he has done, to a much higher degree than in the tubes hitherto used.
As the exhaustion proceeds, the positive column gradually shortens,
and ultimately shrinks into insignificance, while the discharge from
the negative, itself non-luminous, causes a continual projection of
gaseous particles from the surface of the terminal, which impinge upon
the glass with sufficient violence to cause phosphorescence.          These,

432                            Mr.   Spottiswoode                        [May 21,
although apparently no part of the discharge proper, as Mr. Crookes'
experiments with a magnet, and others, seem clearly to show, are in
variable accompaniments of it ; and by means of them we may hope
to learn something of the circumstances of the discharge in higher
vacua.    Now, although these molecular streams become more pro
minent as the exhaustion proceeds,          and as the positive column
sinks into insignificance, it is important to show that, in one form or
another, they may be present in discharges at all pressures ; and for
this purpose it is necessary only to increase the violence of the dis
charge, by increasing the length of the air-spark employed. The effect
is at once shown by the appearance of phosphorescence in the neigh
bourhood of the negative terminal, and by the relief discharge from
the finger with a positive air-spark.      But not only so, the phenomena
of material streams issuing from the negative terminal are not confined
to the molecules of gas, but are also exhibited by particles of finely-
divided solid matter, such as lamp-black, when heaped over that
terminal.     With these, relief and special effects, analogous to those
found in gaseous streams, may be shown.
     Having thus launched ourselves into the region of high vacua, it
is necessary to show that, notwithstanding the absence of the positive
column, positive and negative air-sparks give rise to positive and
negative charges on the tube, exactly as in lower vacua.
     For this purpose, it will be best to make use of a second tube
carrying a current, as a test, or, as we have called           it,
                                                              standard tube.
                                                                     a
By connecting the outside of the tube to be tried with that of the
standard tube, and by observing the effect of the one upon the other,
we can immediately determine the nature of the discharge passing
through the tube under examination.          It then found that, with
                                                      is                       a
positive air-spark  a   positive discharge, and with     negative air-spark
                                                           a
a  negative discharge, passes from one end of the tube to the other, in
high exactly as in low vacua.
     In order to bo quite clear as to the source of the molecular
streams which cause the phosphorescence in the relief effects with             a
positive air-spark, the following should bo mentioned — If any solid :
object, such as a   piece of wire, should be present in the tube below
the point of contact,     it will cast  ashadow on the phosphorescence,
precisely as in Crookes' experiments with the streams from the nega
tive terminal.   If   there be two points of relief contact, the same object
will throw two shadows, in directions conformable with radiations
from each.     To these, other experiments might be added.
     A determination of the precise directions in which these molecular
streams issue from    a  relieving surface    not
                                             is      very simple problem

and we must here content ourselves with showing that, in the case of
intermittent discharges at least, the streams do not issue normally.           If
a  strip of tinfoil placed along the tube be used as relieving surface,

  with the finger over a finite surface, or by a ring of wire laid close upon
  the tube, the phosphorescence takes the form, approximately, of the
  evolute of an ellipse.   In all these cases the illumination is somewhat
  irregular ;  but  the geometrical elements of which the phosphorescent
  figure  is composed, and the stripes or striations of more intense light,
  are always formed at right angles to the longer dimension of the
  contact piece.    This being so, suppose that we place on the tube a
  strip in such a curve that the normal planes to the curve will pass
  through the tangent at the corresponding point of the image of the
  curve, i. e. the curve on the opposite side of the tube, each point of
  which is exactly opposite to a point on the tinfoil. In such a case,
  all the striations will lie along the curve formed by the locus of
  the central patches of phosphorescence, and the result will be a
  single bright curved line of phosphorescence without any spreading
  out or striated margin.     The curve fulfilling these conditions will be
  a helix, whose pitch is half a right angle.      Experiment confirms the
 anticipation.
      One more step in the study of these molecular streams is necessary
 for our present purpose, namely, an application to them of the same
 method which we have used with the electrical discharges them
 selves; viz. we must examine the effect of an inductive stream pro
 duced ab extra upon a direct stream due to the discharge inside the
 tube. These effects may be described generally as the interference
 of molecular streams.
      If the finger be placed upon a highly exhausted tube through
 which a discharge with a positive air-spark is passing, the phospho
 rescence due to the molecular streams from the negative terminal is
 seen to fade away from the place where the finger rests, and from a
 region lying thenco in the direction of the positive terminal.          The
 effect is that of a shadow over that part of the tube ; and as this is
 produced not by any real intervening object, but by an action from
 outside, wo have termed it a virtual shadow.       The phenomenon is due
 to a beating down of the streams of molecules coming from the
negative terminal, by the transverse streams from the side of the tube
immediately within the part touched.
      The interference of two molecular streams may be further illus
trated by a variety of experiments ; and in particular by arranging
within the tube a conductor of some recognizable form — say skeleton
tetrahedron.       If the tube be touched at a place opposite to this
object,   a  shadow of the latter will be formed in the relief phospho
rescence; but if the tube be touched also at a point on which the
conductor rests, the shadow will be splayed out in a striking manner.
This splaying or bulging of the shadow is duo to the interference
of the molecular streams issuing from the surface of the conductor,
which then acts as a quasi negative terminal, with the original relief
streams issuing from the first point of contact.
     A still more striking instance of the interference of the molecular
streams will occur if the tube be furnished with an intermediate

terminal in the form of a cone set transversely to the axis.            If  the
tube be then touched at a point opposite to the cone, a patch of relief
phosphorescence will be formed round the root of the terminal in
question ; but the patch will have a dark circular centre, due to the
action of the cone as a shield against the molecular streams. If,
however, the terminal itself be at the same time touched by a con
ductor, it also will shed molecular relief streams, which will interfere
with those first mentioned, and will greatly increase the size of the
circular dark patch.
     We now come to the ultimate question that we have proposed for
this evening, viz. the small time-quantities involved in the discharge.
And, in the first place, it must be understood that the whole duration
of the visible discharge is comprised within a period of which the
most rapidly revolving mirror has been incompetent to give any
account. It may be in the recollection of some of my audience that
when the discharge from my great Induction coil was exhibited in
this theatre with tubes on a revolving disk, the discharge showed a
durational character as long as the coil alone was used ; but as soon
as a Leydcn jar was introduced, which was in the main equivalent to
an air-spark in a continuous current, the durational character dis
appeared, and nothing was visible but a bright line, the width of
which depended, not upon the duration of the discharge, for no velo
city of rotation in any way affected       it,but only on the width of the
slit through which the discharge in the tube was seen.         But, notwith
standing the extreme rapidity with which the discharge             is effected,
our experiments have already shown that the spark or discharge               isa
complicated phenomenon, the various parts of which take place in a
certain order or sequence of time     ;  and that in virtue of this sequence
we have succeeded, at the various pressures comprised within our
range, in affecting and modifying          in transitu.
                                       is it             This suggested the
idea that, although the subject            surrounded with difficulties,      it
might still be possible to form some relative estimate, at all events,
of the time occupied by the various parts of which the whole pheno
menon      iscomposed.     And in fulfilment of this, the following are
some of the conclusions to which we have been led.
     The time occu]iied in the passage    of          of
                                            electricity either name along the
tube   greater than that occupied in its passage along an equal length
      is                                                                ofwire.
     This may be shown by connecting metallically a piece of tinfoil
near the air-spark terminal with another near the distant terminal                ;
for   itis then seen that the former derives as much relief as if the
latter were not on the tube.       This shows (1) that at the time when
the electric disturbance reached the nearer piece of tinfoil, the more
distant piece was unaffected, and (2) that the disturbance propagated
along the wire reached the second piece before the arrival of the same
disturbance propagated within the tube.
     The negative discharge occupies a period greater than that required          by
the particles composing the molecular streams to traverse the length     of  the
tube, but comparable with it.

     Proofs of this proposition are to be found in the phenomena of vir
tual shadows, and in other instances of the interference of molecular
streams ; but, omitting detailed experiments, the general argument on
which the above conclusion is based, is as follows : If two molecular
streams, one issuing with positive relief from the side of the tube, the
other coming from the negative terminal, show signs of interference,
it is clear that the former of these, which certainly started first, must
have continued to flow, at all events, until the arrival of the latter.
     The time occupied by the passage of electricity of either name along
the tube is incomparably shorter than that occupied by the emission of the
molecular streams, or (what is the same thing} the time occupied by the
negative discharge.
    In support of this conclusion, we have time only for a single
experiment ; and, although it is hardly adapted for lecture pur
poses, it is so curious and important that                   I
                                                         will venture upon        in        it,

negative, the other near the positive end of                 tube through which

                                                                     is
will show relief (positive) effects, the latter special (negative) effects                        ;
but no phosphorescence will be caused at the latter, however long the
air-spark used. When the second patch                     lifted off the tube and
                                                             is
placed upon another through which no current                          is
                                                                 passing, phospho
rescence      is
               immediately produced.          The explanation of this appears
to be as follows        The negative electricity, bursting into the tube,
                        :
summons all the positive which               can draw from the tinfoil. This
                                               it
is answered so promptly, that the second patch gives up to the first
through the medium of the wire all the positive that                   can yield, or,
                                                                           it
which     is the same thing, draws off from the first all the negative
that it    can obtain and this
                            ;             done before the advancing negative
                                          is
reaches the distant patch.         But so rapidly does the negative advance,
that it   reaches the distant patch before the molecular streams have
had time to flow from the latter in                sufficient stream to produce
                                                     a
phosphorescence        and
                        ;      reaches
                                it           in time to revoke the supply of

positive to the nearer, and to draw back the supply of negative which
would have come to, and with               the molecular streams which would
                                          it
otherwise have flowed from the further patch.                    When the second
patch    is  placed on an independent tube, where no such revocation
is possible, phosphorescence actually appears, showing that the revo
cation   is no mere supposition, but         real phenomenon.

    These remarks will give, at all events, some idea of the conclusions
to which the present method has led, and of the reasoning upon which
those conclusions are based.          But the issues of these time-quantities

luminosity, or stria, and of a blank space — not necessarily identical,

light, with so little attendant heat, may be due not only to the
slight density of the medium, but also to its brevity of duration;
they suggest that, for action of such rapidity as that of individual
discharges, the mobility of the medium may count as nothing, and
that for these infinitesimal periods of time gas may itself be as rigid
and as brittle as glass. Time is an element in all mechanical action ;
and the converse of such brittleness is not unknown in experiments

                              Musical Criticism.
THE lecturer presumed his audience were in a certain sense musical
critics, but he would not say they were good critics, for if they were,
there would be no need for those persons who made musical criticism
a profession, and undertook to tell the public what they should and
what they should not like. There were many functions of criticism
which they were infinitely better able to fulfil than any writer. In
deed, if the public only had courage to show what they thought of a
singer, player, or composer, in spite of the reputation he might have
established in foreign parts, a great many things would be impossible
which now might bo witnessed every day.
     However much weight a criticism might have, judicious applause,
or hissing, or significant silence was much more felt by performers.
But in our moderate clime both censure and enthusiasm seldom ex
ceeded certain limits.     Foreign singers coming to this country never
failed to' praise our kindness, and from a sentimental point of view
there was nothing more satisfactory. But audiences ought to remember
that every time they applauded incompetency or mediocrity they in
sulted true merit.     When foreign singers praised our kindness they
perhaps   often  meant  our ignorance.
     Culpable leniency had led to the establishment of fixed customs,
one of which was the Encore nuisance.            At a ballad concert this
mattered little, apart from the fact that most entertainments of that
class were much too long without such repetitions.        It was much less
excusable to repeat a single movement of a sonata or a symphony, for
that implied a want of reverence towards the composer.          A sonata or
symphony     was  an organism   the component    parts of which   were care
fully balanced by the writer to produce a harmonious impression.          If
one of the movements was repeated, this was naturally disturbed. The
encore nuisance was even more insufferable in an opera. Mr. Hueffer
mentioned striking instances of the impropriety            of scenes being
repeated and artists being recalled to the stage.      Repetitions, he said,
were unfair towards the performers, and if they know their interest
they would never comply with the request. It was well known that

438                         Mr. Francis Hue/er                    [May  28,
singers had to study beforehand every gesture and every movement.
Yet these had to appear as the spontaneous action of the moment
called up by the inspiration of the moment, and without this illusion
the dramatic effect was destroyed. All this ceased, however, with
repetition, and we were let into the secret.       The actors appeared no
longer   as free agents,  but as marionettes pulled  by strings.
     The lecturer then proceeded to speak of the Professional Critic,
saying that his task was that of an Interpreter as well as a Censor.
In the former capacity ho was the connecting link between the
aspiration of the artist and the receptivity of the public. It might be
supposed that the original inherent force of art would strike any one
of itself.   No doubt in its simplest form art would do so, but it was
also a growth of ages and the result of many minds.                Musical
compositions, as well as literary, belonged to different periods, and
contemporaries frequently failed to recognize genius. In all ages
great composers met with exactly the same objections — one touch of
Philistinism made the whole world kin. Here the sphere of the critic
came in to herald genius and pave its way.
     After referring to the musical critic's difficulty in making his ideas
known, music not being reducible to words, Mr. Hueffer said a critic
must not be too technical or too poetical.        Schumann was instanced
as one who hit a happy medium in his criticisms, and it was mentioned
that he was one of the first to recognize the merits of Chopin, Berlioz,
and William Sterndale Bennett. Writers of music were not, however,
the best critics, and when Schumann became a great composer, and
the head of a school, he lost much of his catholicity of judgment.
     Many musicians spoke of their predecessors with scorn. A great
original creator was necessarily a man of very marked stamp, and
strongly impressed with his own idea, and therefore he had little
sympathy with others of equally strong individuality.
     The other office of the musical critic was that of Censor and
General Monitor.       That was a very disagreeable one, because the
irritable race of musicians did not like to be censured. Critics, in
fact, were held responsible not only for their own sins, but for the
sins of their predecessors for five generations before them. Abuse
levelled at Beethoven seventy years ago by some obscure scribe at
Vienna or Leipsic was continually cited by dissatisfied young com
posers to show what musical criticism in general was worth.          There
were, of course, good and bad musical critics ; those guilty of the abuse
alluded to were no doubt bad ones, either intentionally perverse or
hopelessly stupid.       So at least one would think but for the curious
fact that one of the most violent critics was Weber, the composer of
'
  Der Freischiitz,' who bitterly attacked Beethoven. Weber, however,
was a very young man at the time, and subsequently was ashamed of
his own folly.     Those who had judgment to discern and courage to
declare new genius were almost as rare as that genius itself. But that
there had been such men at all times was proved by the fact that the
great composers became famous frequently during life, or at least

shortly afterwards, and not only in their own land, but far away,
where only the press could carry their fame.
    English critics were not ill-natured, but, on the contrary, like the
non-professional, were much too lenient.        One writer longed for
synonyms for the word "charming," so often did he use            it, and
another prided himself on being able to write an entire column
without committing himself to any opinion whatsoever. But critics
should not speak like the connoisseur in Goldsmith, who said that a
picture was good, but would have been better had the painter taken
more pains.     The critic, at all hazards, should speak decidedly.      If
artists thought themselves ill-used they could appeal to the supreme
tribunal, the public.    The public could, and should, applaud in spite
of  what  they read in  the newspapers if they thought there was unjust
treatment.
     Mr. Hueffer concluded by saying that there had been   a  great rise
in musical taste of late in this country, caused, perhaps, by the efforts
of conscientious writers who treated musical matters in the press. To
improve matters further, and eradicate evils which still existed, lay
with the public.     They must study earnestly, and insist that those
who spoke to them in print should speak competently and con
 scientiously.   In that case English musical criticism would soon be
 what political criticism in English journals now was — the first in the
 world.

                                   Ornament.
Ornament    may be defined as including all artistic design which is not
of sufficient interest or expressive power to have independent value
in itself, but which is added to some object to give to that object an
interest or beauty which it would not otherwise possess.            Thus the
conventional foliage design      which  covers   the Greek  vase  (Fig. 14 in
illustrations)   is ornament   ;  but  the  delineations  of  human     figures
arranged in a continuous composition, which are often found on the
body of such a Greek vase, cannot be classed as ornament ; they are
figure drawings upon a vase, but they possess sufficiently high artistic
power and expressiveness to be of independent interest, upon whatever
surface they might be drawn.        Japanese trays and other objects often
display beautiful drawings of birds and fishes, or grotesque attempts
at landscape ; but neither the birds, however beautiful, nor the land
scapes, however preposterous, are ornament ; they are pictures, for
which the tray forms the groundwork and the frame.
      Ornament, therefore, is not an independent, but a relative art ; it
is always an appendage to something else, something which could
exist and could be of equal practical value without            it,
                                                              but to which         it
imparts an added grace and value. It            ismost important to bear in
 mind this relative condition of ornament in forming           true criticism
                                                                 a
 of the art, since       evident that, in accordance with this definition,
                  it
                  is
 ornament cannot be rightly judged of except in relation to the cir
 cumstances in which     it   used, and its suitability to its position and
                              is
 to the uses of the object in connection with which            itfound.
                                                                     is    And
if   we consider the nature of this relation of ornament to its circum
 stances, we shall find that we may broadly divide all ornament, in
 this respect, into two classes, which wo may call respectively surface
 ornament, the object of which        is to give interest to and diversify
 surfaces that would otherwise appear blank, and functional ornament,
 the object of which     is  to emphasize special features and assist in
 expressing their function or their relation to the whole. Thus the
 Arabic fret (Fig.  9)   is   specimen of mere surface ornament, which
                              a
 might be carried over any extent of surface, merely to break            up and
                                                                          it
 relieve it; while the vertical and horizontal flutings of the Ionic column

                               on Ornament.                               441

and its base (Fig. 13) are functional ornament, intended to emphasize
respectively the vertically of the column and the horizontality of the
base or bed-plate on which it rests, and to give a greater appearance
of strength in each direction ; and the flutings have no meaning, and
hardly any beauty, except in connection with this functional expres
siveness. The true office and value of functional ornament of this
class may be illustrated by comparing this figure with the sketch of a
fragment of a column (Fig. 18) preserved in Rome, where the column
has been ornamented with carved foliage irregularly disposed over
the surface, and not only adding nothing to the expression of strength
in the column, but positively injuring this expression by producing
an irregular and ragged outline in place of the strong clean line of
the pure classic column.        The man who did this probably thought
he was doing a very picturesque and piquant thing, but in reality he
 was destroying all the sinew and muscle of the architecture, by
 placing ornament on it in such a way as to be only a falsity and
an impertinence.
      In regard to surface ornament, there is not so severe a logic to be
 observed ; what is required is, that it should not in any way con
 tradict or falsify the real nature of the surface to which it is applied,
 that it should be suitable to the material in which it is executed, and
 in most cases that it should have an obvious relation to the shape and
 extent of the surface which it occupies, and appear as if designed on
 purpose to fill that space. This latter demand may indeed be ignored
 in the case of simple repetition or diaper ornaments, which have little
 or no expressiveness in themselves, and merely serve to prevent the
  surface looking quite blank: such an ornament as Fig. 11, for
 instance, if used on a small scale, might reasonably be treated as a
  mere diversification of surface, and cut off by the bounding lines of
  the space without any special reference to its own configuration.      But
  with surface ornament of a higher and more elaborate nature it is
  necessary to its satisfactory effect that it should appear to be designed
  for the place it occupies.    In most Greek ornament this is the case :
  in the vase, Fig. 14, the repeated ornaments round the rim and the
  upper and lower part of the bowl may bo regarded as to some extent
  functional, emphasizing the important parts of the construction of
  the object, but the foliage ornament is purely superficial, and while
  freely handled, it is at the same time carefully arranged so as to fill
  the space evenly, and the central line of the ornament is made co
  incident with tho position of the handle, the space enclosed beneath
  the handle being specially filled by a leaf arranged to suit it. A
  Japanese artist would havo drawn the foliage without any regard to
  the handle, and carried some of the leaves irregularly over       it, as  if
  by accident and this sort of rule-of-thumb ornament
             ;                                                 is  very much
  admired at present, its novelty and apparent piquancy having made
it a   fashion
             ;   butit   iscertainly inferior in logical and lasting interest
  to the Greek principle of ornamenting with direct and obvious
  reference to the space to be filled, or to the construction of the object

442                         Mr. H. H. Statham                     [June 4,
ornamented. The treatment of a Japanese plate indicated in Fig. 23,
where the surface is irregularly divided into blue and white, and some
sprigs are thrown on at one side, may rather be described as splashing
a thing than ornamenting it ; and still worse is the framework for a
screen (Fig. 24), where foliage ornament is carried irregularly along
the bars and over their angles from one face to another, straggling
about quite independently of the form and construction of the object.
And even our Greek friend seems to have missed a point in his vase,
for the strongest as well as the most important point on the body of
the vase is that where the handle springs from the surface, and this
he has ignored in his ornament.        If he had applied the same style of
ornament somewhat as in Fig. 15, emphasizing the base of the handle
by two or three strong lines, and causing the rest of the ornament to
arise and develop from that point (leaving bare the part of the handle
that is to be grasped, for there ornament would be misplaced), he
would then have produced the same decorative effect in a manner that
would at the same time have emphasized the most important feature
on the surface of the vase, and would have caused the ornament to
appear as manifestly intended for that special place and for no other.
As it is, the base of the handle is the weak point in the design,
whereas it ought to be the strong one.
    When we pass from the question of the application of ornament to the
consideration of the actual forms of ornament and their various charac
teristics, we shall find that all the immense variety of forms which have
been used as ornament may be classified under two heads : what we
may call abstract ornament, which is not an imitation of any object
in art or nature, but which deals only with proportions and relations
of lines and spaces, and natural ornament, which includes the use of
forms more or less imitated from Nature.           All ornament which is
good may be classed under one or other of these heads ; there is a
third class, to be mentioned just now, but which is radically bad and
 may be left out of the question for the moment.        Abstract ornament
 appeals mainly to what may be called our geometrical sense ; to the
 pleasure which the eye derives from equal spacing and repetition,
just as the ear derives pleasure from that equal spacing in time which
 we call " rhythm," and to the pleasure which both eye and mind
 derive from the play of line and the opposition of forms or spaces in
 compliance with geometrical proportion.        A typical specimen of this
 class of ornament is the Greek fret, or, as it is sometimes called, " key-
          "
 pattern (Fig. 7), of which there are many varieties, from simple to
 exceedingly complicated forms.         This is an example of the way in
 which interest may be given to surface ornament by a treatment
 which breaks up and evades the really simple basis of the ornament.
 This fret pattern is merely based upon squares drawn one within
 another, but the lines are broken off and reunited in such a way as to
 mask the real basis of the design, and cheat the eye by a kind of
 labyrinthine puzzle.     The same kind of interest, that of presenting a
 certain puzzle to the eye and giving it a problem to trace out, belongs

to the moro elaborate       Arabic fret (Fig. 9), the basis of which is three
hexagons drawn one within another, with an arrangement of squares
one within another, connecting the faces of the hexagons. But the
lines of the hexagons are so broken up that the inner line on one face
runs into the second line on the next face, and the outer line on the
next, and finally runs out of the hexagon and becomes part of the
square design, thus producing an appearance of complication out of
what is really a very simple decorative idea. This is the characteristic
of all this class of Moorish decoration, which has perhaps been a little
over-praised j it all consists in breaking up an essentially simple
combination of lines in such a way as to present a puzzle to the eye ;
but when the trick of it is once mastered it rather loses its effect.
 Another type of ornament of which the interest is similar is the
 Celtic school of interlacing band ornament, of which Fig. 10 is a
 specimen ; some of these are carried to an almost bewildering degree
 of elaboration.     The Greek fret pattern has pervaded a great part of
 the  world   in one form or another : something like it is seen in the
 Egyptian specimen, Fig. 8 ; and in the British Museum is an old pieco
 of Peruvian cloth in which the principle of the Greek fret is very well
 and rather elaborately carried out in a slightly different form.
     These forms of ornament have obviously no relation whatever to
 nature in her outward aspect.            Among the large class of ornamental
 forms which consist in the repetition of an object at equal distances,
 or the alternate repetition of two forms, we find a great many
 specimens which are equally artificial, and also a good many which,
 witheut imitating nature, seem to be taken from hints furnished by
 nature.    We may perhaps trace in imagination the process by which
 such forms may possibly have been eliminated from a semi-natural
 origin. We might imagine, for example, that in a primitive stage of
 civilization the hut or wigwam might have been ornamented by some
 such natural objects as fir-cones, easily procurable, strung round the
 outside (A, Fig. 1).         This would become a recognized and indis
 pensable feature of a respectable wigwam, and would have so much
 impressed itself on the popular taste, that in a period of higher
 culture a conventional imitation of it (B) would be carved or painted
 round the dwelling, still preserving the general form of the natural
 object. The conventionalism of precise repetition and equal spacing
 might to some extent arise merely out of the fact that this mechanical
 repetition was easier of execution than the imitation of the variety of
 nature,* though the inherent love of rhythmical repetition would no
 doubt contribute to it. It would be an easy step to observe that greater
     • There is probably    a great deal of ancient art-work which wo now call
 " conventionalized,"   nnd which we imitate, the so-called conventionalism of
 which arose from the imperfect attempt at realism. The figure drawing of
 mediaeval stained glass is an example.       It was probably the attempt on the part
 of the original artists to be as life-like as they possibly could, but in the modern
 medueval revival its stiffness and imperfection have been regarded as positive
 beauties to be reproduced.

effect  was gained by introducing         a subordinate feature alternating
with the principal one (0). A greater variety might next be aimed
at by forming alternating groups instead of single forms, and the
grouping of these would almost inevitably lead to a system of
branching off on either side of a centre (D). This brings us to some
thing not very far from the well-known Greek ornament shown in
Fig. 2, which is sometimes called the honeysuckle ornament, but
which in reality is probably no imitation of nature at all, but merely
the natural principle of growth from a central stem systematically
carried out in ornament. If we compare this painted ornament with the
carved antefixa ornament of the cornice of a Greek temple (Fig. 3), it
will be evident that both are designed on the same motive, but no one
would think of calling the latter an imitation of nature. The principle
of alternation of a principal and subordinate member, or of a long
and round form, is met with everywhere in ornaments of repetition ;
Fig. 5 is an Egyptian specimen, Fig. 6 shows two forms of Greek
ornament which have been employed perhaps more than any other
ornamental detail, over the whole face of the civilized world, and of
which the origin of the lower one at least is almost certainly artificial,
and taken from personal ornament.            Below it is a sketch of a bit of
necklace from the Pelew Islands, which shows almost the exact form
                                             "
in little of the Greek " bead and reel ornament.*
     The Greeks, however, so completely conventionalized this and
other ornaments, drawn originally, perhaps, from very prosaic
sources, as to raise them to the rank of intellectually designed and
studied ornament.        There has been, however, a frequent use of arti
ficial objects, merely copied and strung together to produce what is
called ornament, and this is the third class of ornament referred to
above, which is neither natural nor abstract, and which is always felt
by a truly cultured taste to be bad and vulgar. For all true ornament
is the application of thought and invention in the adaptation of natural
form or natural law to the purposes of the decorator.                     But the
imitation of mere artificial objects of use is the confession that the
decorator who so uses them has no thought and no invention, and
that natural law aud natural form have less charm for him than the
vulgar surroundings of his daily practical life. Accordingly, among
the Greeks, who in their art were nothing if not critical, we hardly
ever find the gross imitation of artificial objects ; it only occurs in
some subordinate work not of the best period.            The Romans imposed
upon the world, more than any other people, the vulgarity of what
may be called furniture ornament.             Their temples being places for
the performance of sacrificial ritual, they thought it appropriate to
ornament them externally with carvings of the head or skull of the
    * Some of tlie coincidences, it may be observed, between Greek ornament of
the best school, and the productions of nearly barbarous people in far remote
islands, are most curious, and would furnish in themselves a significant chapter in
the history of ornament.

 animal that was sacrificed, and of the garlands with which he was
 decorated (Fig. 26), or even with the representation of the sacrificial
 implements themselves (Fig. 25). Such ornament represented the same
 thing to the Roman mind of the day which would be represented
 to our mind if the Law Courts were decorated with carvings of
 barristers' wigs spaced at equal distances and gowns festooned from
 one to another, or if the Board schools were decorated with a frieze
 of pens, inkstands, and spelling-books.*            Such a decoration would at
 all events have    a  practical meaning       to  us, just as the representation
 of the garlands   and  the  sacrificial   implements had a practical meaning
 to the Soman public ;     so  that  if  we  adopted such suggestive ornaments
 on our buildings,     we  should    at  least  be on the same ground as the
 Romans.      But we have in fact fallen below them, for we imitate
 their bulls' heads and garlands without their having even any
 practical meaning for us : we reproduce the garland in stone, plaster,
 and terra cotta (Fig. 27 : the modern builder calls it a "swag"), and
 place it all over our buildings witheut sense or meaning, because it
 had a meaning to the Romans.            Vulgarity and absurdity could hardly
 be carried further.
     It may be useful to note some other instances of misapplication of
 ornament in its relation to material and position.              In surface orna
 ment no design can be suitable which makes the surface look like
 what it is not. A flagrant instance of this is Fig. 12, from a
 Pompeiian mosaic floor, where the Greek fret is applied with a per
 spective treatment which causes it to appear as if in relief, and gives
 the impression that the visitor has to walk over a kind of gridiron.
 This sort of deception is bad in any position, but worst of all in
a floor surface.      Fig. 11 shows, by contrast, an Arabio design for
brick pavement, not only in perfectly good taste for its position, but
 exactly suited to the material, and arising merely out of the studied
arrangement of bricks of two or three different shapes and sizes.
 Figs. 19 and 20 are vases from the collection found by General
Cisnola in Cyprus, of which Fig. 19 is suitably ornamented by
circular rings following the natural movement of the vessel on its
axis in the process of turning, while Fig. 20 shews an ornamentation
by circles placed the other way merely for the sake of change, and in
a manner which, instead of growing out of the process of manufacture,
contradicts it. Fig. 21 is an examplo of the artistic effect that may
be produced by merely fashioning an r tiole in the most convenient
method for its use and for the treatment of the material.             It is one of
the Hissarlik cups, intended to be held by both handles when used

for decorating the tombstone of the " head-waiter at the Cock "—

door, now so much in fashion, by painting on the panels              tree-form,    a
which disappears under the framing and re-appears in the next panel
(Fig. 30). This      is   an absolute contradiction      of the facts of the
construction of the door, in which each panel                         is
                                                               separate piece

makes the framing appear as something laid over the whole and
hiding part of the drawing.        If     it
                                          is considered piquant to treat the
panels irregularly, at least each one should appear as                 separate        a
design (Fig. 29), and then they may be kept in their place ^decora-
tively) by a simple treatment of the framing in lines following and
emphasizing the linos of construction.        In this case the line ornament
is  arranged   so  as  exactly to denote  the   method of framing and the
length   of each  piece, the side rails going right through to the top and
the cross one being fixed between them but this may be carrying

the centre of the panel (Fig. 31), rather than when treated irregularly                                ;
but fashion decides otherwise at present. Another example of the
conflict of fashion and true taste               in the Chippendale chair
                                                  is

as design  is  concerned we may add that          worse one was never made.

The festoons of ribbons in the back are utterly weak and unmeaning,
and unsuited to the material and the position, and the scrolls which
touch each other in the top rail and the legs present points of mani

The chair by Sheraton (Fig. 32) is, though simple, thoroughly well-       a
designed one    ;  the ornament       all applied so as to emphasize the

in giving the chair broader and firmer base. But both these chairs,

accepted indiscriminately as good furniture, merely because they both
belong to  a  period the productions of which are in fashion at present.
Lastly,   it may be observed that no ornament ought to appear to
contradict or ignore the laws of nature.           We have      common style  a
of ceiling ornament in the Queen Anne period, which               being much      is
copied now, in which festoons seem to hang all round from                central           a
ornament (Fig. 28).        Now, as the festoon form          produced by the

action of gravitation, which, as far as we are concerned, operates

vertically only, it is difficult to understand how flowers can hang
horizontally in festoons every way, unless we suppose either that
the centre ornament of the ceiling exercises a centrifugal force, or
that the cornice of the room has powers of attraction.      Such are the
absurdities which follow the neglect of natural laws in the designing
of ornament.
      When we come to consider natural ornament, we are met by the
further question, in addition to those which have been previously
glanced at, what should be the relation of ornament founded on
natural forms to nature herself ; what degree of closeness of imitation
of nature is possible or desirable in such ornament. If we look at
the practice of former times, we find the Greeks usually treated
 natural forms in a highly conventionalized manner ; if we compare
 the acanthus leaf of naturo with that of the Corinthian capital
(which is Greek in origin, theugh all the existing specimens of its
complete form are probably Koman), we find the treatment of the leaf
in marble so symmetrical and so sculpturesque that it almost becomes
an invention of art rather than an imitation of nature. And in the use
of natural leaves in other forms of ornament, as in the scroll (Fig. 16),
 the Greeks seem to have aimed not so much at imitating nature as at
 bringing natural forms into harmony with a very refined system of
 curves, such as are never found in natural growths: they thus to
some extent combined the beauty of nature and that of geometric and
mathematical proportion.       Their curves are also constructed so as
 to proceed from one another in a strictly logical and harmonious
 manner, with which no vagary or variety of the natural foliage is
 ever allowed to interfere.    This was far too refined a procedure for
 the Romans.      The character of their scroll foliage work is indicated
 in such a fragment as Fig. 17 : they adopted the Greek acanthus-leaf
 with great elaboration of surface and detail, and arranged great
 branches of it in irregular and broken curves, which somewhat
 resemble the form a real branch might take if we bent it into a scroll.
 At the same time the foliage is completely artificial, so that we have
 a confusion of principle, an artificial bough of foliage which is treated
 in a naturalistic manner, and which seems to demand in its nature a
 much severer treatment. The result is something which, in compari
 son with the purity of line and severity of style of the Greek foliage
 ornament, is heavy and cabbage-like in appearance.       When we come
  to Gothic foliage ornament, we find a great deal, in early Gothic, that
  has strong affinity with Greek ornament : something approaching to,
  though not equalling, the Greek purity of line in scroll patterns, and
  something entirely equal to Greek work in the method of convention
  alizing natural foliage and adapting it to ornamental design ; the very
  difference between the two, the comparative roundness and massive-
  ness of character in the Gothic ornamental foliage, being partly an
 illustration of its excellent adaptation to circumstances and material,
 since it is executed in coarse stone and in a dull climate, while the
 more refined Greek ornament was executed in marble and in a bright

 climate.    And this brings us to the considerations which seem really
 to govern and determine the relationship of natural ornament to the
 natural models from which it is derived, and which arise either from
 the position in which the ornament is applied or from the materials
 in which it is executed.
      A fc\v illustrations will elucidate this better than many words.
 Take, on the second page of illustrations, Fig. 34, a sketch of a sprig
 of a flower exactly as it grow (in the corner is represented the top view
 of the blossom the size of the original), and let us see how we shall
 have to shape that if we apply it in various different materials and
 methods. If we wish to paint it by hand in a panel (Fig. 35), there
 is then nothing to prevent us from making as good an imitation of
  the details and variety of nature as we can, only taking care to arrange
  the blossoms and leaves so as to be well distributed over the space,
 and to appear naturally to fill it. It is true that in some cases a
 better decorative effect might be produced by more conventionalism,
  but this depends upon other circumstances, and at all events the
  method of execution by hand leaves us perfectly free and unfettered
 in our treatment of our model, if we elect so to be : we are not
 restricted by any mechanical difficulties, nor by any inadequacy of
 material to produce precise imitation.      But if we have to treat the
 same flower in a wall-paper, which is mechanically repeated in small
 sections, the attempt to give to the design the appearance of natural
 variety, as in Fig. 36, though it may look effective at a first glance, is
 liable to lose its effectiveness in our eyes when we find on closer
examination that the same leaf is turned down, the same group of
blossoms recurs at every 20 or 30 inches distance ; it seems better in
such a case to treat the flower more conventionally (Fig. 37), and to
disavow any pretext of a naturalism which cannot be really sustained.
If, on the other hand, we have to apply the flower as a border in
needlework (Fig. 38), though we are obliged in this case to ignore some
of the more delicate detail and gradation of tone, which this method
cannot reproduce, we have again the freedom of handwork, and we
may be at liberty to arrange the flowers and leaves along the border
with all the irregularity of nature : since they must all be separately
worked, and repetition is no economy in any way. But even in this
case it is best to give some continuity to the ornament by continuous
lines, and even by the symmetrical spacing of a smaller detail, in this
                                                           "
case derived from the top view, or, as wo may say, the plan," of the
blossom.     If we have to treat it in inlay (Fig. 39), we are again free
to employ any degree of variety, as far as convenience and economy
of work are concerned, as each cutting is separately made ; but here
the effect of the process is so far removed from that of nature, the
materials are so hard and unyielding in appearance, that it is best on
other grounds to avoid any appearance of imitating nature, and to give
to the work the symmetry and regularity of a completely artificial
production.     In doing this, however, we should keep in mind any
slight peculiarity in the original model, and preserve a hint of     it, in

 the adaptation ; thus the characteristic little break in the stalk, at A,
 Pig. 34, is preserved in the inlay at A, and so is the fact that the two
 sides of the leaf do not spring from the base of its rib quite opposite
each other, but one a little higher than the other.        It is the preserva
 tion of such little incidents, even in highly conventionalized work,
 which gives character to an ornament derived from nature. But the
 attempt, sometimes made in very costly work, to imitate in inlaid
 stones and other such material the colours and natural irregularity
 and fragile appearance of flowers and other vegetation, is a mere tour de
force, never really successful, only causing surprise that it can be
 accomplished in any degree.         In such a material as needlework, how
 ever,  even  if symmetrical repetition be adopted, it is best to avoid
 bi-lateral repetition, because in such a material this can never bo
 accomplished with entire success, and it leads to an impression that
 something has been attempted which is only imperfectly done.              Such
 a pattern as that in Fig. 40 may be repeated with good effect, with
 alternate leaves and flowers of the same grouping ; but there is no
 bi-lateral symmetry in         and even the repetition of the groups will
                                it,
 inevitably have      certain variety from the mere variations of the hand
                        a
in working them.
      The relation of conventionalism to nature may be further illus
 trated by another example. Take the nasturtium (Fig. 41),              aflower
 which for some reason has been little used in ornament, though              it   is
a very suggestive one.       Part of the character of the blossom consists
in the manner in which, when seen in front, each petal overlaps its
 neighbour on one side and            in turn overlapped on the other side,
                                      is
thus producing      apartially spiral effect; and part of the character of
 the leaf consists in the radiation of the ribs from       a point within tho
 surface of the leaf, but not in its centre. In Fig. 42, which we may
 suppose     design for tiles, these characteristics are ignored, tho flower
             a
is  shown on one tile without the spiral growth, the leaf on the other
 with the ribs radiating from the centre and the feature
                                                ;                  B (Fig. 41),
 which gives so much of the character to the side view of the flower,

 independent feature in the interstices of tho circles.* All this           bad
                                                                            is
 conventionalism, because        ignores the character and construction of
                                 it
 the flower. In Fig. 43 these spiral and eccentric characteristics of
 blossom and leaf are preserved, and the appearance of the leaves
 collectively in nature, as discs overlapping each other,         issuggested.
 The dark band round the blossom would be necessary to throw out its
 colour and give       the requisite force for tile design. The side view of
                        it
 the blossom balanced on its stalk        too light and fragile in appearance
                                           is
 for tiles, but    introduced
                   is           in  the needlework   border (Fig. 44); and in

       This   no exaggeration of the kind of system pursued by some conventional
             is
designers, who seem to think the way to use flowers in ornament   is  to pull them
to pieces and re-arrange them on    sort of Chinese puzzle principle.

 leaf when viewed edgeways (C, Fig. 41) is introduced.                      In lace
 alone, perhaps, of all forms of decorative design, we may, as in
 Fig. 45, ignore symmetry and arrangement altogether, and admit all
 the irregularity of nature, the fragile material hardly bearing any
 thing like precision or formality of design, which would seem to
 weight it too much.
     Fig. 46 is a sketch of a spray of a foreign fern, Adianlum trapezi-
forme (the real character and beauty of which, however, cannot be
 shown on so small a scale and in mere outline).                In its application
 as a wood inlay (Fig. 47), the trapeziform character of the leaves is
 an essential point, and also the zigzag of the stalk between the
                                                                                   "
 springing of each leaf, arising from the special form of " dichotomy
 of growth in the plant ; this is emphasized in the inlay by the addi
 tional lines on either side of          which serve to fill in and give solidity
                                            it,
 to the ornament.           This looks very stiff in comparison with the
 elegance of the natural spray, yet when applied as              border ornament,
                                                                              a
 say to a   table top,      itwould   be  much   more  effective  as    whole than    a
 any   realistic    imitation   of  the   spray.  Nature    sometimes,     however,
 supplies us with geometrical ornament ready made, as in the blossom
                    a
 of kalmia (Fig. 48), which            almost as precise in its symmetry as if
                                           is
 set out with   a   pair of  compasses.     The eccentricities of nature furnish
 us with material for character also, as in the leaf of begonia, which                              is
 set so oddly sideways on the end of the stalk, and on which the leaf
is  based in Fig. 50, an ornament which            made from contiguous circles
                                                            is
from each of which one segment                 cut out and the tangent of the
                                                       is
circle produced to meet the next circle               the same kind of way of
                                                                 ;
 evading the simple basis of the ornament which is found in the Greek
 fret before mentioned.         Fig. 51 represents       bit of humorous design
                                                                     a
 in nature, in which each leaf starts from the opposite side of the stem
from that which          ultimately tends to, and each         torn off irregularly
                                                                         is
 at the end ;    butif itthis were adapted for inlay (Fig. 52),          would not     it
 do to imitate the irregular termination of the leaf, we could only give
a  reminiscence of    it   in   regularly serrated border. The leaf Fig. 53
                                 a
 belongs to the same class as the last named, and                  peculiar in its
                                                                              is
 shape and character        ;    it shown as applied in Fig. 54 to
                                      is                                      diaper        a
 pattern for stained glass, formed also on contiguous circles intercepted
 in various ways so as to give an appearance of intricacy, though
 following  a     fixed plan.     This       an example of the same way of
                                                  is
 producing interest which              found in Arabic ornament — combining
                                       is
 very simple elements of design so as to produce an appearance of
 elaboration and present         kind of problem to the -eye.

     These simple specimens may be taken as affording, of course, only
 some slight typical illustration of the philosophy of ornament and
the relation in which              stands to natural forms,
                                  it                                 subject whicha
 would offer almost endless variations for illustration               gone into inif
detail.    One aspect of the subject may be touched upon in conclusion,
which seems to connect              with the great modern all-pervading idea
                                      it
of evolution.        For though we cannot historically trace back all the

forms of ornament to their origin, we can see enough to leave no
doubt that if we had all the connecting links before us, we should
find that many of the most admirable, widely used, and characteristic
forms of ornament originated not so much in any sense of beauty, as
in mere superstition and grossness ; and that ornaments are habitually
used in our churches, and public buildings, and habitations, the
actual though remote origin of which, were it hinted at, would very
much astonish those who execute and those who admire them ; and it
may perhaps be accepted as one more illustration of the upward
tendency of human development, that even the very knowledge of
this uncomely side of the subject has fallen away from all except
those who have had special reason to study its history, and that from
these clods of earthiness and superstition there has sprung this bright
and innocent flower of ornament.

The Phenomena                   of   the Electric         Discharge          with 14,400 Chloride             of
                                                     Silver Cells.
For        last six years
         the                                I
                              have, in conjunction with my friend Dr.
Hugo Muller,      been engaged with experiments on the electric dis
charge, using as the source of electricity a constant voltaic battery
which we devised.*      It is in principle the same as that invented by
Daniell, but in our battery a solid electrolyte, insoluble in water or a
weak saline solution, namely, chloride of silver, replaces the soluble
sulphate of copper, so that no porous cell is needed in the chloride of
silver battery. The results of our experiments my colleagues think
of sufficient interest to be brought under the notice of the Members of
the Royal Institution, and                       I
                                 will endeavour to make them as clear as
possible in the limited time at our disposal.             must, however, ask       I

your kind indulgence if fail, as have not the practice of lecturing.
It is true that it is not the first time that have had the honour to     I
occupy this chair, which                     I
                               did upwards of forty years ago.')'
     I  may as well commence by describing the tool which           am about                    I
to use in the experiments : the diagram will help you to understand
it. The chloride of silver battery is made up as follows : A glass
tube 1J inch in diameter,             inches long, and containing about
                                                      5.]

holes perforated through         through one of these
                                             it  ;          zinc rod '^ inch           a
diameter and        inches long
                          5.J        inserted, and fastened by melting
                                                      is
little of the paraffin around it; the other element             formed of                  is                  a a
flattened silver wire, which passes between the stopper and the glass                                          ;
so that the metallic elements are zinc and silver.          On the flattened
silver wire     cast the electrolyte — namely,
                     is                             rod of chloride of silver

2^ inches long and T8^ diameter, and the cell          charged through the    is
second perforation in the stopper with              solution of chloride of
                                                                         a

is not closed — that                 is,
                          when the silver element is not connected by
means of       conductor to the zinc, no action whatever takes place

motive force of a volt,* nearly (1-03 volt).
     A Volt is that electromotive force which, working through a
resistance of one Ohm, would deposit 0' 001 1363 gramme of silver
from a salt of silver ; or decompose 0 • 0000947 gramme (0 • 00146

     A column of mercury at 0" Cent., one square millimetre in section
 and 1 • 05 metre high, offers a resistance of 1 ohm ; a pure copper
 wire f'jj inch diameter and 129 yards long offers a resistance of an
 ohm.
     These cells are grouped together in trays containing twenty or
 more, and the trays are placed in cabinets containing in some
 instances 1200 cells, in others 2160 cells ; a cabinet of 1200 cells is
 shown in Fig. 2. The total number of elements               I  am about to use is
 14,400, and these possess a potential of 14,832 volts, which is con-

siderably greater than that of any battery hitherto united in series.
The illustrious Sir Humphry Davy used in 1808, in this theatre, a
battery of 2000 plates 4 inches square, with double plates of copper,
the battery being charged with a dilute mixture of sulphuric and
nitric acids. With this magnificent instrument, placed at his disposal
by the subscriptions of a few patrons of science, he obtained a spark

other (a striking distance of   ,\y of an inch would accord with our
experiments with the chloride of silver battery,   if the difference of
potential of the two batteries   is   taken into account).   When the
discharge had once taken place, then the terminals might be separated
4  inches without causing its discontinuance.
     My friend the late Mr. Gassiot constructed several batteries of
                                                             2   K   2

464                       Mr. Warren De La Rue                         [Jan.      21,
high    potential, and at the time of his death there were 3000
Leclanchd cells in action at his laboratory; on January 26th, 1875,
I  measured the length of the spark between points and found it to be
0'025 inch ; 3000 of our colls produced a spark of more than twice
this length, namely 0'0564 inch, on account of its bettor insulation.
      I propose, in order to show the power we have at command, in
the   first  instance to accumulate, by means of a condenser, the
electricity from 3210 colls, and to send its charge through a platinum
wire ^ of an inch thick.                                          I
                               In charging the condenser will pass the
current through a voltameter, in order that you may judge of the
very small chemical force concerned in the production of the enor
mous mechanical effect of the electric discharge.             I  may as well at
once toll you that the current necessary to charge the condenser            amI
employing     would  decompose   merely    3-55-0" of a grain of water.    I
                                                                           will
first of all pass the current from twenty cells through the voltameter ;
you will see that there is a rapid evolution of mixed gases (oxygen
and hydrogen) into which the water is resolved.               The evolution of
gas, you will at once perceive, is very much slower when the current
is charging the condenser ; also it is more rapid at first and then
gradually lessens, and would entirely cease if there were no leakage
of the charge.
     When 1 send the charge of the condenser, which has the enormous
                                 *
capacity of 42 8 microfarads       (or equal to 6485 Leyden jars, like that
                  •
I  have before me, which has coatings of 442 square inches), through
2J inches of gold wire B'ff inch diam. strained on a glass plate, it will be
violently deflagrated with a loud report, and the metal will be scattered
into dust, which the microscope shows to be composed of minute metallic
globules, and not an oxide resulting from combustion. Faraday proved
that the quantity of electricity necessary to produce a powerful flash
of lightning would result from the decomposition of a single grain of
water. This can be realised when it is remembered that it would be
6000 times as great as the charge of the 42 '8 m.f. condenser just
 shown you.     If   we place the glass plate on which the wire was
strained before the microscope, then it will be perceived that the
distribution of particles of gold is not uniform along the space which
the wire occupied, but on the contrary, they present a stratified
appearance, indicating a series of pulsations during the apparently
instantaneous discharge.        I hope to show you shortly that the most
steady discharge through     a  vacuum    tube is in reality intermittent.
          I
     As shall for this purpose cause the current passing through the
 tube to pass at the same time through an induction coil, so as to
 induce a secondary current,        I
                                   will render evident to you, in a striking
 manner, that when electricity is caused to pass through a wire, it
induces another or secondary current in an adjacent wire.                 Ihave
    * A condenser,    which holds tho clmrgo of a current produced by 1 volt
working for 1 sncond through a resistance of 1 ohm to a potential of 1 volt, has
the capacity of 1 farad.  The farad is too large a quantity for practical purposes,
therefore the millionth part of it,
                                  or the microfarad,  is  employed as the unit of
capacity.

on a reel ; to the extremities of one coil is attached a platinum wire
six inches long and 5^ff inch diameter ; through the other coil                 will              I
send the charge of electricity from a condenser of seven microfarads
capacity (about the sixth of that just used) charged with 10,800 cells.
You perceive that the platinum wire is violently deflagrated with a
loud report by the induced current.

ns the square of the number of cells used to charge                            it,

 a globular form) the stream as               descends breaks up into

 of drops, one following the other in rapid succession. It                  not my       is
 purpose here to refer to the cause of the phenomenon, which has been
 explained to you by Dr. Tyndall in his lectures on Sound, but only
  to recall this elegant experiment in order to present              mental picture
                                                                               a
 of what may occur in the aggregation of the molecules of gases
 conveying electricity.
      Now I    will cause        adischarge of electricity to pass through                              a
 vacuum tube containing residual carbonic acid at                  pressure of 0-5

 millim. (Fig. 4), and you will at once perceive that the residual gas
 groups itself into a series of luminous strata, the molecules which
 compose then being held together by the balance of electric forces,
  whereas in the case of the water stream the particles composing the
  globules are held together by cohesive attraction.
       The strata do not flow on like the drops of water, but remain
  stationary    they are, as

     If  we examine the electric arc passing between the terminals of
 a battery, either at ordinary atmospheric pressure or at other less
 pressures, it is seen that there is a resemblance to the discharge in
 vacuum tubes, the light emitted by different parts of it not having
 the same intensity throughout, and that under most circumstances
 there is a tendency to break up into distinct entities of the nature of
 strata and ultimately to take a stratified appearance like the discharge
 in vacuum tubes ; from this we may infer that the discharge in a
 vacuum tube is in reality a magnified arc.

     I  can let you see the arc, although         I am unable to show the
details of its structure;    thus, when      I  move the discharging key
the arc passes between the two points 0'7 inch apart fixed in
 the micrometer-discharger (Fig. 6), in which, however, the terminals
 shown consist of a point and disc, instead of two points, which      I  am
 now using.      And   I may mention that before the discharge       takes
 place there is neithor condensation nor dilatation of a gaseous medium
 in contiguity witli the charged terminals, as has been suggested,
                                   FIG.  6.
 whatever may be their form.      The length of the arc varies with the
potential of the battery, and with the form of the terminals; between
points, the length of the striking distance increases as the square of
the number of cells employed.       Thus, with 1000 cells the striking
distance is 0-0051 inch ; with 11,000 cells it is 0-62 inch, as shown
in the diagram (Fig. 7). The potential of 11,000 cells put our
means of insulation to a severe test, and 14,400 cells overcomes it to
such an extent as to interfere so seriously with the striking distance
that I only obtain n spurk 0'7 inch long.

470                      Mr. Warren De La        Bme            [Jan. 21,
    On the supposition that a cloud would act very much as a mere
point at the great distance at which a lightning discharge occurs
between clouds or a cloud and the earth, we may from these data
                                   Ftc. 7.
calculate the potential necessary to produce a lightning flash a mile,
or 63,360 inches, long.     It would require nearly 243 units of 14,400
cells united  in series, or say 3,500,000 cells about.
     The striking distance may be increased by an arrangement of
condensers to form what is called a cascade,* and in this way      I shall
 be able to produce a spark an inch long with only 1200 cells.     Such a
battery  I now use to charge twenty-five plates of a small condenser, and
 by means of a rotating commutator, connect, so to speak, the outside
 of one plate to the inside of the next, and thus multiply the potential
                       • The battery itself is a cascade.

twenty-five times ; 1200 cells have, as you see, a very short striking
distance ; it is only 0' 00608 inch, so that the spark obtained with the
cascade is 164 times as long as with the battery alone.         If there were
no loss in converting quantity into potential, it would be 625 times
or the square of 25. The apparatus            I  am using is the so-called
Eheostat of Gaston-Plante.        Franklin, it will be remembered, was
the inventor of the cascade.     It is not impossible that the effects of
lightning may at times be increased by a kind of cascade arrange
ment formed by the charged layers of cloud floating one over the
other.
    Between discs the law of the electric discharge is not the same as
between points ; its length does not increase nearly so rapidly, as
                                    Fio.  8.
will  be seen by a reference to the diagram (Fig. 7), which represents
the discharge between two points, a point and disc, between spherical
surfaces, and between concentric cylinders.            But the increment of
 potential necessary  to produce  a discharge   for a given distance between

discs, say a centimetre, becomes less ns the distance between discs, and
consequently the potential, are increased. Thus the electrostatic force
per centimetre with 1000 volts and a striking distance of 0*0205
centimetre, is 163 electrostatic units, while it is only 113 units with
11,000 volts and a striking distance of 0 -32-15 centimetre.
    Wo have found, moreover, that the discharge between discs in air,
hydrogen, carbonic acid, and probably also in other gases, may be
represented by a hyperbolic curve, and this is the case whether we
send the discharge through the gas at a constant pressure and increase
                                 FIG. 9.
tho distances between the terminals and also the number of cells, or
send the discharge at a constant distance and vary the pressure and
 number of cells ; the obstacle in the way of a discharge being as the
 number of molecules between the terminals up to a certain point, as
 will bo seen in the diagrams (Figs. 8 and 9), in which the cross marks
represent the actual observations.    For although the potcutial neces
sary to produce a discharge diminishes as the pressure decreases, yet

this is true only up to a certain limit ; after this has been reached it
rapidly increases, and ultimately the resistance becomes so great, as
the exhaustion is carried further, that it is easier for a spark to pass
between terminals placed at the same distance outside the tube in air
at atmospheric pressure. The diagram, Fig. 10, in which the abscissas
are the cube roots of the pressures in milliouths of an atmosphere,
and the ordinates the number of cells necessary to produce a dis
charge in a hydrogen tube 30 inches between the terminals, shows the
results of experiment.     The pressure of minimum resistance varies
for different gases. We have determined it to be 0-642 mm. = 845
millionth* of an atmosphere for hydrogen, at which pressure the
potential necessary to produce a discharge through a tube with
terminals 30 inches apart was found to be only 430 cells.                At a
pressure   of  0-0065   mm.,   8' 6  millionths,    it  requires  as   high a
potential, 8937 cells, as at a pressure of 21 • 7 mm., 28,553 millionths,
to cause the discharge to take pluce.        At 0-00137 mm., 1-8 millionth,
11,000 cells will not pass.     The greatest exhaust we have obtained
in a hydrogen vacuum and an absorption by spongy palladium was
0-000055 mm., 0 07 millionth, which offered so great a resistance
that a 1-inch spark from an induction coil could not traverse the
tube.   I                              I
           will now exemplify what have said by showing you a tubo
with an absorption chamber (Fig. 11).            I  expect that the vacuum
will prove to be so good that the whole of the battery, 1 4,400 cells,
                                   Fio.  11.
                       2200    n-h       Volumes
 will not cause a current to pass : you see there is no illumination of
the tube ; if   I now heat the absorbing material so as to cause gas to
 enter the tube, then the discharge of a much smaller number of cells,
namely 3600, illuminates the tube, and if        I allow it to cool again the
 discharge ceases.
     It has been suggested that there is a polarisation of the terminals
 of a vacuum tube during the passage of electricity just like that
 which occurs in a voltameter, and that this increases the obstacle to
the discharge ; but by an elaborate series of experiments we have
 proved that such is not the case under the conditions of the experi
 ment. It is quite true that, after the connection between the battery
and the terminals of the tube has been broken, there is a deflection of
 the needle when they are connected with a galvanometer, but we have
shown that this is entirely due to a minute static charge proportionate
 to the capacity of the terminals.*

      Our experiments * enable us to throw               some light on another
atmospheric electrical phenomenon — namely, the probable height of
the aurora borealis, which the accompanying figure (Fig. 12) of a
discharge roughly resembles.              I  will now pass the current of the
whole 14,400 cells through the large tube
                                                                  Fig. 12.

 spheric air at a pressure of 1 millimetre,
 and you will perceive a carmine luminosity
 touching the positive pole and reaching half
way down the tube.            This reminds one of
those ruddy glows frequently seen in auroral
displays.      Fig. 12 in the plate is copied
from a photograph since taken in my labo
ratory of this appearance.             Around tho
bright luminosity is a dark band which
 shuts off a portion of the fluorescence of the
glass tube, a blue fluorescence produced by
 the ruddy light of the luminosity, shewing
 that around the luminosity there is an ab
 sorbent zone of less elevated temperature.
 Many estimates have been made from time
to time of the height of auroroe, founded
upon observations made by persons at a
distance from each other, and supposed to be
observing the same feature in the display ;
 but it must be remarked that there is always
much uncertainty in these estimates, from
the difficulty of knowing whether the dif
ferent observers have noticed tho self-same
streamer. Frequently very considerable altitudes have boen assigned
to these displays; for example, as much as 281 miles.                   We shall
presently see that it is very improbable that any electrical discharge
could occur at such a height.            We have calculated from experiment
that the pressure of least resistance for air is 0-397 millimetre,
4 98 '6 millionths, and therefore in air it results that a maximum
electric discharge, and consequent brilliancy, of the aurora, would
occur at an elevation where the atmosphere has that pressure —
namely, 37 ¦67 miles.          The greatest exhaust we have produced — and
this has not been surpassed — is 0-000055 millimetre, 0'07 millionth,
which is the pressure tho atmosphere would havo at 81-47 miles;
and as 11,000 cells failed to produce a discharge even in hydrogen at
this low pressure, it may be assumed that at this height tho discharge
would be considerably less brilliant than at 37 • 67 miles, should such
occur.f

     There are some phenomena connected with the discharge from
the voltaic battery which             I will bring under notice before wo
proceed to the study of the discharge in vacuum tubes.                             I have
already spoken of the difference in the length of the discharge
between points and discs ; and 1 have now to call your attention to
the influence of the form of the point on the length of the spark.                     At
                            first it would naturally be supposed that the
            FIG. 13.
                            longest discharge would occur with the sharpest
                           point, but this is not the case ; a great number
                            of experiments with various forms of points have
                           shown that a point in the form of a paraboloid
                            gives the longest spark ; and longer in the pro
                            portion 1 • 29 to 1 than one in the form of a cone
                           of the same length and diameter at the base.
                            It is difficult to account for this difference in
                            the length of the spark, but it is evident the
                            potential must be greater at the extremity of a
                           paraboloidal point than it is at the extremity
                            of a conical one (Fig. 13).
                                 If a point and a disc be used together as
terminals and the point be made alternately positive and negative,
the spark is longest when the point is negative for low tensions up
to 3000 cells, and longest when the point is positive beyond that
numbor.

platinum,   magnesium, and graphite, all give, under similar circum
stances,   precisely the same length of spark : aluminium, however,
gives  a spark  longer in the proportion of five to four.
     Before the spark jumps and the arc forms it is preceded by what
we have called the streamer discharge.     This is different in appearance
at the positive and negative terminals.     You are not able to see the
characteristics now that   I produce the streamer discharge before yon,
but they are represented enlarged on the diagram ; the terminals being
 supposed to be a point and a disc, and the point being made alter
nately positive and negative. When the point is positive the discharge
takes the form of a scries of twisted streamers (Fig. 14), -when
negative it is in the form of a brush (Fig. 15). The current which
                                  FIG. 15.
  takes place in the form of streamers at a distance but a very little
  beyond the true striking distance, namely, that at which the arc is
 formed, is only the j^Vir Par* °f the current which passes with the arc,
  and this is only one-half of that of the battery when short-circuited.
  When the streamer discharge is examined in a rotating mirror with a
  microscope suitably constructed, it is seen that the negative current is
  much the more continuous, for with the same velocity of the rotating
  mirror the positive discharge breaks up into a series of distinct images,
  whilst the light of the negative is spread out into a sheet, as you will

8000 cells, but with 11,000 colls wo obtained a further confirmation
of them, the  effects being shown in another figure on the diagram (Fig.
17), which   represents   a streamer discharge between two points.    The
negative  discharge   is a brush which  is seen continuously on the lower
terminal, while the positive consists of a series of intermittent, ever-

changing spiral streamers which envelop the negative brush discharge
 without in the least disturbing its form.        They go past the negative
point and then curl upwards towards it.
    If   I insert a very high resistance between the battery and the
terminals the streamer discharge ceases, and a static spark passes
from time to time which is exactly like that from an ordinary
frictional machine ; it pierces a thin strip of paper just as a static
charge would do. The battery gathers up at intervals a charge at
 the terminals, and the discharge occurs as soon as the potential is
sufficient to force its way across the obstacle opposed by the inter
vening air.

     The same thing occurs if attach a condenser to the terminals of
 the battery : it takes a longer time for the battery to charge          and          it,
 consequently the discharge occurs at longer intervals, shorter or
 longer according as the terminals arc 'adjusted to          less or greater

 mally small like that of the points in the discharging micrometer,
 there   isalways an interval of time which elapses between successive
discharges    ; the interval may be so extremely minute that thousands
of millions of discharges may occur in second, but the flow

 to the right we know that the current is a direct or break contact one,

     If the terminals of a telephone are placed in the circuit between
the battery and a vacuum tube, the pulsations              are sometimes suffi
ciently slow to produce audible sounds when the telephone is placed
to the ear.   But the telephone is not adapted to render evident inter-
mittences of a very high order.
     There is a remarkable phenomenon which occurs when a charge
is sent through a closed vessel containing air or gas, within certain
limits of pressure, -which     I  will endeavour to show you. As soon as
the connection is made between the battery and the terminals a
sudden expansion of gas takes place, as you will see (Fig. 19) by the
depression of the mercury in the gauge connected with the bell jar,
and as soon as the connection with the battery is broken the gas
returns suddenly almost exactly to its original volume, showing only
a small increase due to a slight elevation of temperature ; the
mercury in the gauge rises, therefore, nearly to its original position.
The effect is similar to that which would bo produced if an empty

the temperature of different parts of the arc, and      was found that

attributed to    sudden increase of temperature, but must be caused
                     a
by the scattering of the gas molecules away from the terminals, and
their projection by electrification against the walls of the containing
 vessel.
     Wo have proved experimentally that the discharge in                     a    vacuum
                              from that in air and other

 conduction through metals, and must consequently be of the nature of
a  disruptive discharge, the particles acting as carriers of electrification.
 For example, wire having given difference of potential between its
                     a              a
 ends, can permit one, and only one current to pass; whereas, we
 have found by accurate measurements that with             given difference of

 the distance between the terminals the resistance was found to bo
 only twice as great. Moreover the fall of potential               not uniform

vacuum tube, as you will see when             I  connect the first ring to one pole
of the battery and the other to earth.
      We will now take up the phenomena exhibited by vacuum tubes.
It will be seen that the strata have their origin at the positive pole.
Thus in a given tube, with a certain gas, there is produced at a
certain pressure, in the first instance, only one luminosity,* which
forms at the positive terminal ; then, as the exhaustion is gradually
carried further, it detaches itself, moving towards the negative, and
being followed by other luminosities, which gradually increase in
                                              I
number up to a certain point. This will show you, with Mr. Cottrell's
aid, by projecting copies of photographs, made in my laboratory, from
tubes containing hydrogen at gradually decreasing pressures.
     If I   now connect the fixed terminal of the Spottiswoode tube, con
taining residual carbonic acid at a pressure of 1 millimetre, with the
positive pole of a battery of 2400 cells, having first caused the movable
terminal (which       I have connected previously to the negative pole) to
approach quite close to the positive wire, you will see only one stratum.
I  incline the tube and allow the negative terminal to recede.                  Now
there are three strata (Fig. 10 in the plate), and as the negative recedes
further and further fresh strata pour in one by one from the positive
until the whole tube is filled to within a constant distance from the
negative with our electric drops (Fig. 9 in the plate).
     I  may here pause to draw attention to the resemblance of the strata
produced by an electrical discharge in a vacuum tube to the lyco-
podium records of sound-pulsations in air which are given in Tyndall's
work on ' Sound' (Fig. 22).
                                         Fio.  22.
     With the same potential the phenomena vary with the amount of
current which is allowed to pass through the tube, and this amount we
can easily regulate by inserting resistances between the battery and the
tube.     As the current is increased the number of strata in some tubes
increases, but with other tubes the number decreases.
     A change in the amount of current frequently produces an entire
change in the colour of the strata. For example, in a hydrogen tube
from a cobalt blue to a pink (Figs. 4 and 3 in the plate). It also
changes the spectra of the strata. Moreover, the spectra of the illu
minated terminals and those of the strata differ; usually the most
brilliant spectra are obtained from the negative terminal.
    *  It ia not improbable tliat ball-lightnini; may be of the nature of this single
luminosity or stratum, charged like it as a Leyden jar, and projected by an electric
discharge taking place behind it ; in the same way that a mechanical impulse
sends forth a vortex ring.

                           dual hydrogen.       It consists of two
                           portions, one 18 inches long and 1-15
                           internal diameter, the other 17 -5
                           inches long and 0 • 975 inch diameter.
                           The battery      I am using consists of
                           4800 cells, and you perceive that
                           whether the terminal in the small
                           tube is positive or negative there is
                           a marked difference in the form and
                           closeness of the strata in the two tubes.
                                The greatest heat is developed in
                           the vicinity of the strnta. This fact
                           we established most easily when the
                           tube contained only one stratum, or
                           a small number separated by a broad
                           interval.    There is reason to believe
                           that even in the dark discharge like
                           that in the neighbourhood of the ne
                           gative terminal there may be a kind
                           of stratified formation, for we have
                           found a development of heat in part
                           of a tube in which there was no illu
                           mination except on the terminals.
                               There are vacuum tubes made which
                           are not open from end to end, and
                           which consist of a number of separate
                           chambers, some inserted into the others.
                            The induction coil illuminates these
                            very beautifully, but the battery will
                            not do so, as no discharge can take
place through them. On the other hand, the alternating currents of

1881.]           on the Phenomena    of the Electric Discharge.               487
an induction coil charge up such a tube first with positive, then with
negative, electricity, and produce an illumination in consequence of
the alternating charge and discharge of the walls of it. When             I  turn
on the battery current you will perceive a flash, then if         I reverse the
current another flash, and if      I  do this quickly    I   make the illumi
nation a little more persistent.              I
                                       But have a rapidly reversed com
mutator by which      I  can reverse the current 350 times in a second,
and you see that with its help       I can illuminate the tube very beau
tifully.
     In almost every case there is a dark interval near the negative
terminal, but occasionally we have met with tubes in which the strata
completely fill the tube, the last ones threading themselves on the wire
 used for the negative terminal (Fig.
                                              21). Unfortunately    I have not
 one which   I can show you, as these tubes which have shown this phase
 completely change after the current had passed a very short time.
                                    Fio.  24.
                                                TUBE 123.
     I   now propose to show, with the aid of my two assistants,
Messrs. James Fram and Ernest Davis, some tubes with various
gases at different degrees of exhaust, in order that you may see the
strata in all their beauty and witness the changes of which             I   have
spoken.
     I will in the first place show a tube in which there are produced
a series of luminosities like those in one of the photographs which
were projected on the screen. It is No. 148, with residual hydrogen
at a pressure of 4 millimetres, and connected with 7920 cells.           Fig. 8
in the plate shows the phenomenon ; it is from a photograph obtained
in four seconds.
    Tube 201, shown by Fig. 7 in the plate, is a hydrogen vacuum
at a pressure of 0-8 millimetre; with 3600 cells and an interposed
resistance of 1,500,000 ohms a perfectly steady close stratification is
produced.      The figure is copied from a photograph obtained in three
seconds.
    Tube    139, shown   in the  plate by Fig. 4, is a hydrogen vacuum,
pressure 0'8 millimetre, with     3GOO cells and an interposed resistance
of 200,000 ohms. A series of beautiful blue double strata are pro
duced, with a carmine line between the double strata.            The figure is
copied   from  a photograph   obtained   in   one and a half second.
    Tube 139. — On interposing 500,000 ohms resistance in the circuit,

 488                        Mr. Warren De La Rue                 [Jan.  21,
 instead of 200,000, the strata are reduced in number and turn pink.
 The phenomenon, except as regards colour, is shown in the plate
 ( Fig. 6), copied from a photograph obtained in three seconds.
      Tube 130, a hydrogen vacuum 0•8 millimetre, with 2400 cells
and an interposed resistance of 60,000 ohms. A series of tongue-
shaped strata are produced, which cross each other like the com
ponents of the letter X and remain perfectly steady. The phenomenon
is precisely like that shown by another tube, the photograph of which
you saw projected on the screen.          Tube 130 is represented in the
plate (Fig. 6) ; it is copied from a photograph obtained in two and
a  half seconds.
      Tube 333 is     a hydrogen vacuum, pressure 0•8 millimetre, with
3600 cells and an interposed resistance of 1,500,000 ohms. There
are produced a series of double tongue-shaped strata, united at their
narrowest parts. This phenomenon is represented in Fig. 5 in the
plate, which is copied from a photograph obtained in three seconds.
      Before showing the next tube,    I will exhibit one (No. 51) with a
carbonic acid vacuum, in which the negative terminal consists of
            a wire nineteen inches long formed into a helix, the positive
 Fig. 25.
           being a ring. On passing the current from a battery of
            1200 cells through the tube, first interposing a resistance
           of 500,000 ohms, about two inches only of the negative is
           illuminated ; on gradually, however, removing the resist
           ance, more and more of the spiral negative glows until at
           last the whole of it is brilliantly illuminated.    It will be
           seen by this that the negative discharge requires a greater
           outlet than the positive.
                I will now exhibit a tube (No. 163), Fig. 25, consisting
           of two branches united at the top and bottom. In each of
            these is a series of funnels, the broad end of which fills the
            branch ; in one branch the mouths of the funnels are placed
            in a contrary direction to that in the other. On connecting
            the terminals with the battery of 3600 cells, the current is
           free to pass either in both branches, or through one or the
           other, but it invariably passes down that branch in which
            the wide mouth of the funnol is towards the negative. It
           traverses alternately the right or left hand branch, according
           as  I  make the top or bottom terminal negative ; thus again
            exemplifying the necessity for a greater space for the nega
            tive discharge to pass than is required for the positive.
           The phenomenon is shown in Figs. 11 and 12 in the plate.
                The photographs from which the figures in the plate are
           copied were taken in my laboratory, by Mr. H. Reynolds,
            on dry plates.
                Very frequently, when the exhaust is very great, the
discharge     becomes   most sensitive to the approach of the finger or
any    conductor   in  connection  with the earth, or charged by a sepa
rate source of electricity ; the same thing occurs if the current is

1881.]          on the Phenomena    of the Electric Discharge.          489
made    intermittent by an interval of air in one of the connections (an
air spark).     See Fig. 26.
    The preparations which were necessary in order that this lecture
could be given have occupied a considerable time. In the first place,
most of the tubes     I have shown you had to be specially prepared,
during the last three months, and reserved for this occasion. For all
tubes completely alter their character if a current is repeatedly passed
through them, and then they no longer present the beautiful phases of
stratification you have witnessed.        Moreover, it was not possible to
                                    Fig. 26.
remove the battery from my laboratory, as its construction would not
permit it.    I  therefore have had built up by Messrs. Tisley and Co.
an entirely new series, in such a way that the battery can be carried
away, when requisite, without injury. The construction of the battery
was commenced in June 1879, and was finished in August 1880.
The charging of the battery occupied a fortnight, and was finished in
the second week in December.
     It only remains for me to thank you for your flattering attendance
under such adverse meteorological conditions.*

                   The Teachings     of Modern   Spectroscopy.
  A  SCIENCE, like  a child, grows quickest in the first few years of its
  existence ;  and it is therefore not astonishing that, though twenty years
  only have elapsed since Spectrum Analysis first entered the world, we
  are able to speak to-day of a modern spectroscopy, with higher and
  more ambitious aims, striving to obtain results which shall surpass
  in importance any of those achieved by the old spectroscopy, to the
 astonishment of the scientific world.
      A few years ago the spectroscope was a chemical instrument. It
 was the sole object of the spectroscopist to find out the nature of a
 body by the examination of the light which that body sends out when
 it is hot. The interest which the new discovery created in scientific
 and unscientific circles was due to the apparent victory over space
 which it implied.      No matter whether a body is placed in our labora
 tory or a thousand miles away — at the distance of the sun or of the
 furthest star — as long as it is luminous and sufficiently hot, it gives
 us a safe and certain indication of the elements it is composed of.
      To-day, we are no longer satisfied to know the chemical nature
 of sun and stars ; we want to know their temperature, the pressure on
 their surface ; we want to know whether they are moving away from
 us or towards us ; and still further, we want to find out, if possible,
 what changes, in their physical and chemical properties, the elements
 with which we are acquainted have undergone under the influence
 of the altered conditions which must exist in the celestial bodies.
 Every sunspot, every solar prominence, is a study in which the un
 known quantities include not only the physical conditions of the solar
 surface, but also the possibly changed properties, under these condi
tions, of our terrestrial elements.     The spectroscope is rapidly becom
ing our thermometer and pressure gauge ; it has become a physical
instrument.
     The application of the spectroscope to the investigation of the
nature of celestial bodies has always had a great fascination to the
scientific man as well as to the amateur ; for iu stars and nebulae one
may hope to read the past and future of our own solar system.          But
it is not of this application that 1 wish to speak to-day.
     As there is no other instrument which can touch the conditions of
the most distant bodies of our universe, bodies so large that their size

surpasses our imagination, so is there no other instrument which equals
it in the information it can yield on the minute particles at the other
end of the scale, particles which in their turn are so small, that we can
form no conception of their size or number.            The range of the
spectroscope includes both stars and atoms, and it is about these
latter that   I wish to speak.
     The idea that all matter is built up of atoms, which we cannot
further divide by physical or chemical means, is an old one.          As a
scientific hypothesis, however — that is, an hypothesis which shall not
only qualitatively, but also quantitatively, account for actual phenomena
— it has only been worked out in the last thirty years. The develop
ment of molecular physics was contemporaneous with that of spectro-
scopy, but the two sciences grew up independently.             Those who
strove to advance the one paid little attention to the other, and did
not trouble to know which of their conclusions were in harmony,
which in discordance, with the results of the sister science. It is
time,  I  think, now that the bearing of one branch of inquiry on the
other should be pointed out : where they are in agreement, their con
clusions will be strengthened, while new investigations will lead to
more perfect truths where disagreement throws doubt on apparently
well-established principles.
            I
     What have ventured to call modern spectroscopy, is the union of
the old science with the modern ideas of the dynamical theory of
gases, and includes the application of the spectroscope to the experi
mental investigation of molecular phenomena, which without it might
for ever remain matters of speculation or of calculation.
     A body, then, is made up of a number of atoms. These are
hardly ever, perhaps never, found in isolation.          Two or more of
them are bound together, and do not part company as long as the
physical state of the body remains the same. Such an association of
atoms is called a molecule.     When a body is in the state of a gas or
vapour, each molecule for the greater part of the time is unaifected
by the other molecules in its neighbourhood, and therefore behaves as
if these were not present. The gaseous state, then, is the one in which
we can best study these molecules.       They move about amongst each
other, and within each molecule the atoms are in motion.              Each
atom, again, has its own internal movement.        But if the world was
made up of atoms and molecules alone, we should never know
of their existence ; and to explain the phenomena of the universe, we
must recognise the presence of a continuous universal medium pene
trating all space and all bodies. This medium, which we call the
luminiferous ether or simply the ether, serves to keep up the connec
tion between atoms or molecules.       All communications from one atom
to another and from one molecule to another are made through this
ether. The internal motions of one atom are communicated to this
medium, propagated through space, until they reach another atom ;
attraction, repulsion, or some other manifestation takes place ; and if
you examine any of the changes which you see constantly going on

around you, and follow it backwards through its various stages, you
will always find the motion of atoms or molecules at the end of the
chain.
     The importance of studying the motion of molecules is therefore
clear; and it is the special domain of the modern spectroscopy to
investigatate one kind of these motions.
     When a tuning-fork or a bell is set into vibration, its motion is
taken up by the surrounding air, waves are set up, they spread and
produce the sensation of sound in our ears.        Similarly when an atom
vibrates, its motion is taken up by the ether, waves are set up, they
spread, and if of sufficient intensity produce the sensation of light in
our eyes.     Both sound and light are wave motions. A cursory glance
at a wave in water will lead you to distinguish its two most prominent
attributes.    You notice at once that waves differ in height. So the
waves both of light and sound may differ in height, and to a difference
in height corresponds a difference in the intensity of the sound you
hear or of the light you see.        The higher the wave the greater its
energy, the louder is the sound or the brighter is the light. But in
addition to a difference in height you have noticed that in different
waves the distance from crest to crest may vary.         The distance from
crest to crest is the length of the wave, and waves not only differ in
height but also in length.      A difference in the length of a wave of
sound corresponds to a difference in the pitch of the sound ; the
longer a sound-wave is, the lower is the tune you hear. In the case
of light a difference in the length of the wave corresponds to a
difference in the colour you see.      The longest waves which affect our
eyes produce the sensation of red, then follows orange, yellow, green,
blue, and the shortest waves which we ordinarily see seem violet.         If
a molecule vibrates, it generally sends out a great number of waves
which vary in length.     These fall together on our retina, and produce
a compound sensation which does not allow us to distinguish              the
 elementary vibrations, which we want to examine. A spectroscope is
 an instrument which separates the waves of different lengths before
they reach our retina ; the elementary vibrations after having passed
 through a spectroscope no longer overlap, but produce their im
pressions side by side of each other, and their examination and
investigation is therefore rendered possible.
     The elements of spectroscopy will be familiar to most of you, but
you will forgive me if    I  briefly allude to some points, which, though
 well known, are of special importance in the considerations which         I
 wish to bring before you to-night.
     When a body is sufficiently hot it becomes luminous, or to speak
 in scientific language, the vibrations which are capable of pro
 ducing a luminous sensation on our retina, are increased in intensity
 as the temperature is raised, until they produce such a sensation.
 By means of a strong electric current     I  can in the electric lamp raise
 a piece of carbon to a high temperature.        When looked at with the
 unaided eye it seems white hot, but when         I  send the rays through
                                                               2 M 2

a prism and project them, as       I do now, on a screen, yon see a con
tinuous band of light. This fact we express by saying that the
spectrum of the carbon poles in the electric lamp is a continuous one.
You see side by side the different colours known to you by the familiar
                                                   "
but incorrect name of " the rainbow colours ; and the experiment
teaches you that the carbon pole of the electric lamp sends out rays
in which all wave lengths which produce a luminous sensation are
represented.
    But if now     I introduce into the electric arc a small piece of a
volatile metal you see no longer a continuous band of light. The band
is broken up into different parts. Narrow bands or lines of different
colours are separated by a space sometimes black, sometimes slightly
luminous.     The metal has been converted into vapour by the great
heat of the electric current, and the vibrations of its molecules take
place in distinct periods, so that the waves emanating from it have
certain definite lengths.     If  the molecule could only send out one
particular kind of waves,    I should in its spectrum only see one single
line. We know of no body which does so, theugh we know of several in
which the possible periods of vibration are comparatively few ; the
spectrum of these will therefore contain a few lines only.       Thus we
have two different kinds of spectra, continuous spectra and line'spectra.
But there is a certain kind intermediate in appearance between these
two. The spectra of " fluted bands," as they are called, appear, when
seen in spectroscopes of small dispersive powers, as made up of bands,
which have a sharp boundary on one side and gradually fade away
on the other. When seen with more powerful instruments each band
seems to be made up of a number of lines of nearly equal intensity
which gradually come nearer and nearer together as the sharp edge
is approached. This sharp edgo is generally only the place where
the lines are ruled so closely that we can no longer distinguish the
individual components.        The edge is sometimes towards the red,
sometimes towards      the  violet   end of the spectrum.   Occasionally,
however, the fluted bands do not shew any sharp edgo whatever, but
are simply made up of a series of lines which are, roughly speaking,
equidistant.    No one who has seen a spectrum of fluted bands can
ever fail to distinguish it from the other types of spectra which   I have
described.
    What, then, is the cause for the existence of these different types ?
The first editions of text-books in which our science was discussed
stated that a solid or liquid body gave a continuous spectrum, while a
gaseous body had a spectrum of lines ; the spectra of bands were not
mentioned. The more recent editions give a few exceptions to this
                                                               I
rule, and the editions which have not appeared yet, will — so hope, at
least — tell you that the state of aggregation of a body does not
directly affect the nature of the spectrum. The important point is
not whether a body is solid, liquid, and gaseous, but how many'
atoms are bound together in a molecule, and how they are bound
together.    This is one of the teachings of modern spectroscopy. A

 1881.]                 on the Teachings   of Modern    Spectroscopy.                497
 molecule containing a few atoms only gives a spectrum of lines.
 Increase the number of atoms and you will obtain a spectrum of
  fluted bands ; increase it once more, and you will obtain a continuous
 spectrum.      The scientific evidence for the statements have made is I
 unimpeachable.                                 I
                       In the first place, may examine spectra of bodies
 which    Iknow to be compound.         Special precautions often are neces
 sary to accomplish this purpose, for too high a temperature would
 invariably break up the compound molecule into its more elementary
 constituents.     For some bodies          I
                                           may employ the low temperature
 of an ordinary Bunsen burner. With others, a weak electric spark
 taken from their liquid solutions will supply a sufficient quantity of
 luminous undecomposed matter to allow the light to be analysed by a
 spectroscope of good power.          The spectrum of a compound body is
 never a line spectrum. It is either a spectrum of bands or a con
 tinuous spectrum. The spectra of the oxides, chlorides, bromides, or
 iodides of the alkaline earths, for instance, are spectra of fluted bands.
 All these bodies are known to contain atoms of different kinds, the
 metallic atoms of calcium, barium, or strontium, and the atoms of
 chlorine, bromine, iodine, or oxygen.
      But to obtain these spectra of bands we need not have necessarily
 recourse to molecules containing different kinds of atoms. Elementary
 bodies show these spectra, and we must conclude therefore that the
 dissimilarity of the atoms in the molecule has nothing to do with the
 appearance     of the fluted bands.       Similarity in the spectrum must
 necessarily be due to a similarity in the forces which bind the atoms
together, and this at once suggests that it is the compound nature of
the molecule which is the true cause of the bands, but that the
molecule neod not be necessarily a compound of an atom with an atom
of different kind, for it may be a compound of an element with itself.
We have ample proof that this is the true explanation of the different
types of spectra.            I
                            shall presently give you a fow examples in
support of the view which is now nearly unanimously adopted by
spectroscopists.
    I   have hitherto left unmentioned           one important method of
investigating the periods of molecular vibrations, a method which
is applicable to low temperatures.                  I
                                           If have a transparent body and
allow light sent out by a body giving a continuous spectrum to fall
through       it,
              I  often observe that the transparent body sifts out of the
light falling through           certain kind of rays.
                                 it                         Spectra are thus
produced     which     are called   absorption spectra,    because   the body
which   is under examination does not send out any light, but absorbs
some vibrations        which are made to pass through it.             It    an
important     fact  that    molecule
                             a          absorbs  just  the  rays  which      is  it is
capable    itself   of  sending   out.      Ican  therefore   investigate  the
spectrum of body just as well by means of the absorption
                    a                                                 produces
                                                                            it
as by means of the light which          st'nds out.

      Vapours like bromine or iodine examined in this way give us
a   spectrum of fluted bands.         Apowerful Rpark in these gases gives,

                                                                 [Jan.
however, a line-spectrum.       Here, then, a change of spectrum has
taken place. The same body at different temperatures gives us a
different spectrum, and the change which takes place is the same as
that observed in the spectrum of a compound body the moment the
temperature has risen sufficiently to decompose that body.          I  con
clude from spectroscopic observations, therefore, that the molecules
of bromine and iodine just above their boiling-point are complex
molecules, which are broken up at the temperature of the electric
spark. At high temperatures the molecules of these bodies contain a
smaller number of atoms, and it follows from this that the gases must
be lighter or that their density must be smaller.     These conclusions,
which on spectroscopic grounds have been definite and clear for some
years, have recently, by independent methods, been confirmed by
Victor Meyer and others. It has been directly proved that at high
temperatures the molecules of iodine and bromine contain a smaller
number of atoms than they do just above their boiling-point. In other
 cases the change of density has not been directly proved, only because
 these .necessary measurements are difficult or even impossible at very
 high temperatures, but we may be perfectly sure that chlorine, as
 well as the metallic vapours of silver, sodium, potassium, &c., which
 shew an analogous change of their spectra, will ultimately be proved
 to undergo a change of density at high temperatures.
      As we can trace the change from a line-spectrum to a band-
 spectrum taking place simultaneously with an increase of density,
 so may we follow the change from a band-spectrum to a continuous
 spectrum indicating the formation of a molecule still more complex.
      Sulphur vapour, at a temperature just above its boiling-point, con
 tains three times the number of atoms iu one moleculo that it does at
  a temperature of a thousand degrees.   The spectrum of sulphur vapour
  observed by absorption is continuous when the heavier molecule only
  is present. At the higher temperatures, when each molecule is decom
  posed into three, the spectrum belongs to the type of fluted band-
  spectra. From the cases in which we can thus prove the change m
  the spectra and in the densities to go on simultaneously, we are justi
  fied in concluding that also in other cases, where no such change of
  density has yet been observed, it yet takes place ; and it is not a very
  daring generalisation to believe that a change in spectra is always
  due to a change in molecular arrangement, and generally, perhaps
  always, accompanied by a change in the number of atoms which are
  bound together into one molecule.
       With regard to the well-known statement, that solids and liquids
  give continuous spectra, while gases give line-spectra, it must be
  remarked that metallic vapours show in nearly all cases a continuous
  spectrum before they condense.     Oxygen gives a continuous spectrum
  at the lowest temperature at which it is luminous. Examining liquids
   and solids by the method of absorption, we find that many of them
  show discontinuous spectra, presenting fairly narrow bands.      It is not
   denied that the nearness of molecules does not affect the spectrum. It

may render the bands more wide and indistinct at their edges, but its
influence is more of a nature which in gas spectra is sometimes
observed at high pressures when the lines widen, and does not con
sist of an alteration in type. Though in a solid or liquid body the
molecules are much nearer together, they are less mobile ; and hence
the number of actual collisions need not be necessarily much in
creased.    The fact that a crystal may show a difference in the absorp
tion spectrum according as the vibrations of the transmitted light take
place along or across the axis, shows,        I think, that mutual impacts
cannot much affect the vibrations, but that each molecule, at least in
a crystal, must be kept pretty well in its place.
     We have divided spectra into three types, but in all attempts at
classification we are met by the same difficulty.             The boundaries
between the different types are not in all cases very well marked.
Every one will be able to distinguish a well-defined band- spectrum
from a line-spectrum, but there are spectra taking up intermediate
positions both between the line- and band-spectra and between band-
spectra and continuous spectra.         With regard to these it may be
difficult to tell to which type the spectrum really belongs.            It may
happen that a change of spectrum takes place, the spectrum retaining
its type ; but in these cases, as a rule, the more complex molecule
will have a spectrum approaching the lower type, although it may
not actually belong to that lower type. To be perfectly general,
we may say that a combination of atoms always produces an alteration
in the spectrum in the direction of the change from the liiie-spectruin,
through the baud-spectrum to the discontinuous spectrum.
     If we accept the now generally received opinion as to the cause of
the different types of spectra, we may obtain information on molecular
arrangement and complexity where our ordinary methods fail. At
high temperatures, or under much diminished pressure, measures of
density become difficult or impossible ; and it is just in these cases
that the spectroscope furnishes us with the most valuable information.
If  we find three spectra of nitrogen and the same number for oxygen,
we must accept the verdict, and conclude that these gases can exist in
three different allotropic states.
     Amongst the remarkable phenomena observed in vacuum tubes,
perhaps not the least curious is the spectrum observed at the negative
pole, which in several cases is only observed there, and under ordinary
circumstances in no other part of the tube.        Both oxygen and nitrogen
have a spectrum which is generally confined to the negative glow.
Some years ago     I  tried to prove that also in these cases we have only
to deal with a special modification of the gases which, curiously
enough, only exists near the negative pole, and is broken up and
decomposed in every other part of the tube.          The experiments      I then
made seem to me to prove the point conclusively.           After  a  current   of
electricity  had  passed through    the tube for  some  time  in one  direction,
 the current was suddenly reversed ; the negative polo now became
 positive, but the spectrum still was visible for some time in its neigh

bourhood, and only gradually disappeared. This experiment shows that
the spectrum may exist in other parts of the tube, and that it is there
fore due to a peculiar kind of molecule, and not to anything specially
related to electric phenomena taking place in the neighbourhood of
the negative pole. Other experiments supported this view.
     The classification of spectra, according to the complexity of the
vibrating molecule, is of great theoretical importance ; for by its
means we may hope to obtain some information on the nature of the
forces which bind together the atoms into one molecule. Our whole
life is a chemical process, and a great part of the mysteries of nature
would be cleared up if we could gain a deeper insight into the
nature of chemical forces.      I believe no otlier lino of investigation to
be as hopeful in this respect as the one which examines directly the
vibrations of the molecules which take place under the influence of
these chemical forces.     If   we could find a connection between the
vibrations  of  a compound    molecule   and the vibrations of the simpler
elements which it contains, we should have made a very decided step
in the desired direction.     I  need not say that various attempts have
been made to clear up so important a point ; but we have to deal
with complicated forces, and the attempts have as a rule not been
crowned with much success.
     There are, however, a few exceptions, a few cases of greater
simplicity than the rest, where we are able to trace to their mechanical
causes, the spectroscopic changes which take place on chemical com
bination.   These few and simple cases may serve as the fingerposts
which show us the way to further research, and we may hope, to
further success.     To make the spectroscopic changes of which         I am
speaking clear to you,   I  must have recourse to the analogy between
sound and light, and remind you of the fact that when the prongs of
a tuning-fork are weighted its tone is lowered, which means that the
period of vibration is increased, and consequently that the length of
the wave of sound sent out is lengthened. Now, suppose a molecule
or atom, the spectrum of which         I am acquainted with, enters into
combination with another. And suppose that the vibrations of the
second molecule are weak or lie outside the visible range of the
spectrum, then the most simple assumption which         I could make would
be that the addition of the new molecule is equivalent to an increase of
the mass of the other. An increase of mass without alteration of the
force of the molecule, will, as in the case of the tuning-fork, lengthen
the period of vibration, and increase the wave length.          If a case of
that kind were actually to happen,           I  should observe the whole
 spectrum shifting towards the red ; and this is what is observed in
the few simple cases to which      I have referred.    The first observation
to that effect is due to Professor Bunsen, of Heidelberg.        Examining
the absorption spectra of different didymium salts, he found such a
close resemblance between them, that no difference could be detected
with instruments of small powers ; but with larger instruments it
was found that the bands varied slightly in position, that in the

 chloride they were placed most towards the blue end of the spectrum,
 that when the sulphate was substituted for the chloride, a slight
 shift towards the less refrangible end took place, and that a greater
 shift in the same direction
 occurred on examining the
 acetate.   Professor Bunsen
 remarks that the molecular
 weight of the acetate is
 larger than that of the sul
 phate, and that the molecule
 of the sulphate again is
heavier than that of the
 chloride. He adds : " These
 differences in the absorption
 spectra of different didy-
mium compounds cannot in
our present complete state
of ignorance of any general
 theory for the absorption of
light in absorptive media,
be connected with other
phenomena. They remind
one of the slight gradual
alterations in pitch which
the notes from a vibrating
elastic rod undergo when
the rod is weighted, or of
the change of tone which an
organ pipe exhibits when
the tube is lengthened."
The accompanying wood
cut, copied from Professor
Bunsen's paper, may serve
to   illustrate  the shift ob
served in one of the absorp
tion bands.
     Similar changes take
place when some substances
like cyanin and chlorophyll
are dissolved in different
liquids. Absorption bands
characteristic of these vari
ous substances appear, but
they slightly vary in posi
tion. Professor Kundt, who
has carefully examined this displacement of absorption bands, has
come to the conclusion that as a rule the liquids of high dispersive
powers were these which shifted the bands most towards the red end

of the spectrum.     But though there is an apparent tendency in this
direction, no rule  can be given which         shall be absolutely true what
ever the substance which is dissolved.            Fig. 2 shows the absorption
spectrum of cyanin when dissolved in different liquids. The measure

proof that a solution is sometimes much more of a chemical compound
than is generally supposed.        The solvent and the substance must,
indeed, be closely connected in order to produce a shifting of the
absorption band. On the other hand, it is not astonishing that no
general law can be given which connects the displacement with the
physical properties of the solvent, for the closeness of connection
depending on the special chemical affinity for each solvent has as
much to do with the amount of shifting observed, as the molecular
weight or the dispersion or refractive power may have. The shifting
of the absorption bands in different solutions of the same substances
is only one of many applications of spectroscopes to the examination
of molecular phenomena in liquids. Into the interesting researches
of Professor Russell, who has greatly extended this field of inquiry,
we have no time to enter.

     The changes of spectra due to molecular combinations and re
 arrangements have in addition to their theoretical importance a great
 practical interest, for they will afford us some day a means of answer
ing approximately a great many questions relating to the temperature
of sun and stars. The gases and vapours in the solar atmosphere
 are for the greater part in the molecular condition in which they
 give a line-spectrum, and we know of stars the spectra of which
resemble our solar spectrum very nearly.        We shall not be far wrong
in ascribing to such stars a temperature similar to that of our sun.
Other stars have absorbing envelopes showing spectra of fluted bands.
We know that fluted bands belong to a more complex molecular
condition, which only can exist at lower temperatures. These stars,
therefore, must have a lower temperature than our snn. Dr. Hoggins,
 who has succeeded in obtaining most valuable photographs of star-
 spectra, has been able to classify and arrange star-spectra; and k is
 more than likely that in the series of stars arranged in order by
 means of their spectra, we have at one end those of the highest, at
 the other those of the lowest temperature.       We are as yet far from
being able to assign any particular temperature to a star, but the
question by means of the spectroscope has been reduced to one which
can be decided in our laboratories, and however difficult it may be, we
may rest assured thut it will ultimately be solved.          As to our sun,
its temperature has been the subject of many investigations. Attempts
have been made to deduce it (at least approximately) from the amount
of heat it sends out. Different experimental laws have been proposed
to connect together the heat radiation of a body, and the temperature
of that body. The first law which was thus proposed gives ten million
degrees Centigrade as a lower limit ; the second law reduces that
lower limit to a little over 1500 degrees.       Both these laws we now
know to be wrong.       More accurate laws give something like ten or
twenty thousand degrees, but the whole method employed is one which
is open to a great many objections.
     We measure the combined heat radiation of different layers on the
solar surfaces, all of which are at different temperatures, and we
observe only an average effect which is much influenced by the
absorption in the outer layers of the solar atmosphere and in the
corona, and does not admit of easy interpretation.       The spectroscopic
method, which is yet in its infancy, has the advantage that we can
observe separately each layer of the sun, and we thus examine the
temperature not as an average, but for every part of the solar body.
Our way to proceed would consist in carefully observing the spectra
in different layers of the sun. Supposing we observe a change at one
point, we may investigate at what temperature that change takes
place, and we may then ascribe the same temperature to that particular
place at the solar surface, if no other cause has interfered which may
have affected our result.    This last conditional limitation leads us to
the discussion of the important but difficult question, whether we can
determine any such interfering cause, which, not being temperature,

504                           Dr. Arthur   Schuster                   [Jan. 28,
yet produces the same change in a spectrum which we have hitherto
only ascribed to changes of temperature.
     I must here remark that a change in type is not the only spectro-
scopic change in the spectrum which is observed to take place on
varying the temperature. Line spectra especially are subject to
curious variations in the relative intensities of their lines.           These
variations follow no general rule, and must be investigated separately
for each element. The cause of this variation is a subject on which
there exists a great difference of opinion ; but, whatever this cause may
 be, if the changes always take place at one fixed temperature, we can
turn them into account in measuring that temperature. However strong
our wish that such a spectroscopio measurement of temperature may
ultimately be obtained, a remarkable complication of facts has delayed
the realisation of this hope for at least a considerable period of time.
     We have to enter partly into a theoretical question, and           I must
necessarily   allude  to  some   of the  facts recognised by  all who   believe
in the molecular theory of gases. Each molecule, which, as we have
seen, sends out rays of light and heat on account of its internal
motion, is surrounded by other molecules.           These are, indeed, very
closely packed, and continually moving about with enormous velocities.
Generally they move in straight lines, but it must necessarily happen
that often they come very near, and then affect and deflect each other.
Perhaps they come into actual contact, perhaps they repel each other
so strongly when near, that contact never takes place.               The time
elapsing between two such collisions is very small.               If   you can
imagine one second of time to be magnified to the length of a
hundred years, it would only take about a second, on the average,
from the time a molecule has encountered one other molecule until it
encounters the second.         During the greatest part of this very short
time, it moves in a straight line, for the forces between molecules are
BO small that they do not affect each other, unless their distance is
exceedingly small.       It is, therefore, only during a very small fraction
of time that one molecule is under the influence of another, and it is
one of the greatest problems of molecular physics to find out what
happens during that short element of time.           I should like to explain
to you how    I  believe the spectroscope may contribute its share to the
settlement of that question. In his first great paper on the molecular
theory of gases, the late Professor Clerk Maxwell assumed that two
molecules may actually come into contact, that they may strike each
other, as two billiard balls do, and then separate, according to the
laws of elastic bodies. This theory is difficult of application when a
molecule contains more than one atom, and especially as it did not in
the case of conduction of heat give results ratified by the experimental
test, Maxwell abandoned it in favour of the idea that molecules repel
each other according to the inverse fifth power of the distance.          This
second theory not only gave what at the time was believed to be the
correct law for the dependence of the coefficient of conduction on
temperature, but it also helped its author over a considerable inathc

1881.]             on the Teachings     of Modern   Spectroscopy.             605
matical difficulty.      Further experiments bave shaken our faith in the
first of these two reasons, and the second is not sufficient to induce us
to adopt without further inquiry the new law of action between two
molecules.
     It is exceedingly likely that the forces acting between two mole
cules when they are in close proximity to each other are partly due to,
or at least modified by the vibrations of the molecules themselves.
Such vibrations must, as in the case of sound, produce attractive and
repulsive forces, and vibrating molecules will affect each other in a
similar way as two tuning-forks would. Now, if the forces due to
vibrations play any important part in a molecular encounter, the
spectroscope will,     I  fancy, give us some information.          If two mole
cules of the same kind encounter, the periods of vibration are the same,
and the forces due to vibration will remain the same during, perhaps,
the whele encounter.          If two dissimilar molecules encounter, the
relative phase of the vibrations, and hence the forces, will constantly
change. Attraction will rapidly follow repulsion, and the whole
average effect will be much smaller than in the case of two atoms of
the same kind.       We have no clear notion how such differences may
act, and we must have recourse to experiment to decide whether any
change in the effect of an encounter is observed when a molecule of
a different kind is substituted for a molecule having the same periods
of vibration.
     When a body loses energy by radiation, that energy is restored
during an encounter ; the way in which this energy is restored will
profoundly affect the vibrations of the molecule, and hence the
observed spectrum.          I  have endeavoured by means of theoretical
considerations, or speculations, as you may perhaps feel inclined to call
them, to lead you on to an experimental law which              I  believe to be of
very great importance.           The spectrum of a molecule is in fact
variable at any given temperature, and changes if the molecule is
surrounded by others of different nature.
     Placing a molecule in an atmosphere of different nature without
change of temperature produces the same effect as would be observed on
lowering of temperature.
     Let me give you one example. Lithium at the temperature of the
Bnnsen flame has almost exclusively one red line in its spectrum.
At the high temperature of the arc or spark the red line becomes
weak, and almost entirely disappears.               It is replaced by a strong
 orange    line, which   is  already   slightly  visible,  though weak, at low
temperatures,     and  by   additional   green  and  blue lines.
     But even at the high temperature of the spark we may obtain
again a spectrum containing the red line only if we mix a small
 quantity of lithium with a large quantity of other material.                 The
 same spark, for instance, will give us the low temperature spec
 trum of lithium when taken from a dilute solution of a lithium salt,
 and the high temperature spectrum when that solution is concen
 trated.

     The spectra of zinc and tin furnish us other examples in the
same direction, but the spectra of nearly all bodies show the same law
in a more or less striking way.
     If  this law which     I have given you is a true one,* and          I believe
it will stand any test to which no doubt it will be subjected, we
shall be able to draw some important conclusions from it. In the
first place, it will be proved that the forces between atoms do depend
on their vibrations.        If this is true, any change in the vibrations
of  the spectrum, however small, will entail a corresponding change in
all the other properties of the body. On the other hand, any change
in the affinities of the element observed by other means will be
represented by a change in the spectrum.
     It is also possible that the introduction of forces due to vibratory
motion will help us over a considerable difficulty in the molecular
theory of gases.         Some of the conclusions of that theory are at
present absolutely contrary to fact. A spectroscopist, for instance,
who is acquainted with the mercury spectrum and all the changes in
that spectrum which can take place, feels more than sceptical when he
is told that the molecule of mercury contains only one atom, which
neither rotates nor vibrates.
     Nor can it be of advantage to science to pass silently over this
difficulty, or to neglect it as unessential, as is often done by modern
writers.     The late Professor Maxwell, at least, was well aware of its
importance, and has often expressed in private conversation how
serious a check he considered the molecular theory of gases to have
received. This is not the place to enter more fully into this point
and to consider how the vibratory forces may affect some of the
suppositions on which the theoretical consequences are founded.
     However important the effects of concentration or dilution on the
spectra may be, they render the spectroscope less trustworthy as a
thermometric instrument ; for if the company in which a molecule is
placed changes the spectrum in the same way as temperature would,
it will be difficult to interpret our results.             But although the dis
cussion of our observations may be rendered more arduous and
complicated, wo need not on that account despair.               It is one of the
problems     of  spectroscopy   to  find  out  the composition      of bodies, not
only qualitatively, but also quantitatively, and when we shall know
in what proportion different bodies are distributed in the sun, we may
    * Lookyer, 'Studies in Spectrum Analysis," p. 140, draws attention to the
fact that an admixture of a second element dims the spectrum of the first, and be
expresses this fact by saying: "In encounters of dissimilar molecules the vibra
tions of each are damped." Later he has shown that the lines of oxygen and
nitrogen, which are wide at atmospheric pressure, thin out when the gases are
only present in small quantities.     Lecoq de Boisbaudran in his 'Atlas' gives
several examples of the differences in the relative brilliancy of linea produced by
concentrating or diluting the solution from which the spark is taken.      The com
plete parallelism of this change to the changes produced by increased temperature
has, however, never received sufficient attention.

      I hope that the few facts which  I have been able to bring before
  you to-night have given you some idea of the important questions
  which have been brought under the range of spectroscopic research.
  Many of these questions still await an answer, some have only been
  brought into the preliminary stage of speculative discussion, but the
  questions have been raised, and the student of the history of science
  knows that this is an important step in its development and
  progress. The spectrum of a molecule is the language which that
  molecule speaks to us. This language we are endeavouring to under
  stand.   The unexperienced in a new tongue which he is trying to
  learn does not distinguish small differences of intonation or expres
  sion.   The power over these is only gradually and slowly acquired.
  So it is in our science. We have passed by, and no doubt still are
  passing by, unnoticed differences which appear slight and unimportant,
  but which when properly understood will give us more information than
  the rough and crude distinctions which have struck us at first.     We
  have extended our methods of research ; we have extended our power
  over the physical agents ; we can work with the temperature of sun
  and stars almost as we can with those in our laboratories.      No one
  can foretell the result, and perhaps in twenty years' time another
  lecturer will speak to you of a spectroscopy still more modern in
  which some questions will have received their definite answer, and
  by which new roads will have been opened to a further extension of
  science.

 Every animal develops, directly or indirectly, from an " ovum " or
 egg, and the plant springs, directly or indirectly, from the germ or
 seed.    One chief difference between low and high forms of life con
 sists in the fact that the development of the former ceases at a stage
 when the development of the latter has barely begun.            The Gre-
 garina is a microscopic speck of protoplasm living parasitically within
 the bodies of earthworms and other Articulated animals.              When
 development takes place, the body becomes oval, develops a wall or
 cyst, and the internal protoplasm breaks up into small spindle-shaped
 masses.    The body then ruptures, and the small segments escape,
 each to become a Gregarina, without further change, save the develop
 ment of a nucleus.       Each Gregarina at first appears as a single
animal or persona, which converts itself by segmentation into an
aggregation of such beings. There is thus a temporary development
of a compound or colonial state. Similarly the Amcebce (which are
low protozoa, living in stagnant water and infusions, and moving as
do the white corpuscles of our blood by emitting pseudopodia, or
processes of their protoplasmic substance), when undergoing develop
ment, exhibit segmentation or internal division of their substance,
and thus exhibit a compound state as a transitory feature of their
reproductive phases.
     It is noteworthy that in developing from the ogg the embryos of
all higher animals exhibit a like process of segmentation or division,
as a preliminary phase of their reproduction.      There are also forms of
protozoa   — Myxodictyum  —  which  are  truly " colonial

since the shells of these minute protozoa exhibit, as a rule, a division
into chambers, each occupied by a distinct protoplasmic unit, organic
ally connected to its neighbours from which it was produced by
budding.

of distinct units, each provided with two cilia, and resembling a
Chlamydomonas.      Volvox is, in fact, a colony of monads. A Sponge is
                            "
a compound or " colonial      organism, in that it consists of an aggre

  gation of protoplasmic units, some of which resemble Amoebre in
  nature, whilst others resemble Chlamydomonads.           The protoplasmic
  units of a sponge-colony are, as a rule, united together by a common
  skeleton they have helped to elaborate. Each sponge grows from an
  egg, the process of reproduction by "budding" being also represented
  in the group. Two Spongillce, or common fresh-water sponges, will
  unite if placed in contact, or may separate spontaneously.            The
  sponge arising from an egg, like a higher animal, thus exhibits seg
  mentation and segregation of its parts, and comes to retain this segre
  gate and colonial nature as a permanent feature of their race.
       The Hydwe of the fresh-water pools, lead us to a type of animals
  nearly related to the sponges.        Each is a tubular animal which may
  be artificially divided, and which throws off gemmae, or buds naturally.
  Each Hydra-bud grows into the exact likeness of its parent, and
  ultimately detaches itself from the parent body.
       The zoophytes are simply Hydrce which have budded, but whose
 buds remain permanent to form a veritable tree, whose growth is ever
 increasing, and through whose branches a continual store of nutri
 ment is continually circulating. Many zoophytes produce eggs which
 simply and directly develop into the compound adults by budding.
 Others develop eggs through the media of jelly-fish or medusoid-
 buds, which break away from the parent tree and live an independent
 existence in the sea. In some zoophytes there may be seven different
 kinds of units in the colony, all referable, however, to one type.
      A Fluetra, or " sea mat," grows upon shells and resembles a piece
 of pale brown seaweed.         Each organism is an animal colony, but its
 units, which may number several thousands in one organism, are not
 structurally connected together like those of the zoophytes, but are
 contained each in a separate cell.
       The Tceniada or tapeworms consist each of a linear series of similar
 "joints."      Each "joint" is in reality comparable to the unit of
 zoophyte or
                 " sea mat," for it is essentially a distinct member of a
 colony, and possesses a complete set of generative and other organs,
 and is produced from the head and neck by budding.              According
 to Haeckel, starfishes and sea urchins are each compound or " colonial "
 animals.     Structurally, it is provable that each ray of a starfish
 corresponds with worm-structure in broad details.           The Na'is and
other fresh-water worms produce young forms by a new head being
budded out amongst their joints.          There is here seen a tendency to
                              "
become doubly " colonial        ; inasmuch as the single worm is typically
    " colonial " animal, and the new
a                                            head-development causes this
compound body to detach a new colony.
      Amongst insects, the Aphides, or plant-lice, produce by veritable
"budding" new generations, and the queen bee does not fertilize
                                                         "

                                 "     "
homology of an egg with a bud appears demonstrable.
      It is the business of philosophy to correlate and arrange facts to
form a harmonious and scientific system.         The philosophy of biology

leads us firstly to define an "individual" structurally as a being
whose parts and organs are so closely and intimately connected, that
separation of even a limited structural area means disintegration "
of the individual as a whole. Physiologically, an " individual
animal or plant is the total development of a single egg or seed. As
the whole zoophyte, sea mat, and tapeworm arise, each from a single
                          " individual."   The separate units of each are
egg, each, in toto, is an
         "
named zooids."       A new personality does not enter into the life
cycle of any animal or plant, until a new egg or seed has been pro
duced.     Even in the case of the Hydra, although the buds become
detached and to all appearances are each as truly an " individual
                                                                           "
as their parent, they possess        nevertheless no true personality.
They are merely units or zooids of a colony ; they were produced
by budding, and as such are not "individuals" but parts of an
" individual."     Ifwe assumed that the buds of a zoophyte or tape
worm were " individuals," we might with equal correctness speak of
the joints of a lobster or worm as " individuals" likewise.         Even in
human structure itself, there are to be seen traces of a fundamentally
" colonial " nature. The tissues of the highest animals are but
aggregations of cells.     As such, they have a semi-independent con
stitution ; and there are certain protoplasmic cells        (e.
                                                             g.   the white
or amoeboid corpuscles of the blood) which roam independently at
will through the body, and possess powers of movement exactly
resembling those of the Amoeba and its kind.
     A progressive tendency according to the theory of evolution marks
the organic series. The conversion of the " colony
                                                           " into the " in
dividual," in other words the concentration of originally separate
and independent "units" or "zooids,"        is    the chief developmental
cause of the differences between high and low organisms.                The
primitive condition of all organisms       is   the "colonial" condition.
Egg-segmentation (or in Protozoa body-division)        is  universal in the
animal world   ;  and cell-multiplication begins the development of
plant life likewise.     Arrest of development at an early stage dis
tributes the separate units thus formed (as in Gregarina)        arrest at
                                                                 ;         a
later stage gives us the sponge colony    (a  series of similar aggregated
cells), or the tapeworm colony      (a   collection of essentially similar
"joints  ").  Physiologically, the higher organism devotes less time to
pure reproduction and becomes more explicitly busied with individual
interests.   Hence the increased concentration of energy which results
in the formation of the highest " individuals," that yet retain, in the
" colonial " and cellular structure of their tissues, the evidence of an
originally compound nature.
     In the plant world, such " individualization "         is   seen as   a
secondary tendency in the close aggregation of flowers in Composite,
and in the transformation of uniform composites (e.         g. thistle) into
individualized forms    (e.
                         g.    daisy) through such intermediate steps as
the centauries.
     The conclusions of our study of "colonial" organisms are as

1881.]               on the Origin of Colonial Organitmi.            611
follo W8:    1. The original condition of organisms is colonial; the
universal segmentation of the egg is a proof of this inference, and the
development of new forms by this so-called process in low forms like
gregarinae, &c., supports this conclusion.     2. The lower we proceed
in the scale of being the more marked is the tendency to form
" colonial " organisms. 3. Arrest of development, by causing an
organism to cease progressing at a segregated stage, will tend to pro
duce a " compound
                        " and " colonial " constitution. 4. The plant
world is "colonial" in its highest types. Plant development has
not proceeded towards any marked increase of " individuality
                                                                  "
                                                                    over
the colonial nature of lower forms.        A tree is in many respects as
markedly " colonial
                       "
                         as a volvox.    5. The highest animals exhibit
lingering traces of an originally "colonial" nature in their histo
logical composition.     6. The tendency of life-development is towards
concentration, and the conversion of the "colony" into the true
" individual."
    It  is suggested by way of final inference, and by way of incursion
into  a  biological byepath, that the theory and idea of an originally
" colonial " constitution may explain the existence in man and higher
animals generally of those tribal and family associations which mark
the upper strata of existence. The semi-independent action of many
parts of the higher brain, for instance, receives an explanatory hint as
to causation, from the idea of an originally independent and colonial
constitution.

                        The Distances of the Stars,
EVERY one who is acquainted with the rudiments of astronomy knows
that the sun with its attendant planets is merely an island group in
the vast realms of space.
    An island the size of this room in the middle of the Atlantic
would be over a thousand miles from the coasts of Europe and
America on either side. Yet that island would not be more remotely
apart from the surrounding shores than is our solar system from the
bodies which surround it in space.     To determine the distance from
                                                        it,
this solar island to the stars which surround       the problem for our
                                                        is
consideration to-night.
                        Recent Researches     on 61 Cygni.
      It  now almost exactly forty years (February 12, 1841) since the
           is
 gold medal of the Royal Astronomical Society was awarded to Bessel
 for his discovery of the annual parallax of 61 Cygni.             On that
 occasion Sir John Herschel delivered an address, in which he glanced
 at the labours of Struve and Henderson as well as Bessel.             The
 discovery  of the distances  of the stars was alluded to as " the greatest
 and most glorious triumph which practical astronomy has ever
 witnessed."    From this date the history of our accurate knowledge
 of the subject may be said to commence.         Each succeeding race of
astronomers takes occasion to investigate the parallax of 61 Cygni
anew, with the view of confirming or of correcting the results arrived
at by Bessel.
     [The parallactic ellipse which the stars appear to describe, having
been briefly explained, the method of deducing the distances of the
stars was pointed out.]
     The attention of Bessel was directed to 61 Cygni by its proper
motion of five seconds per annum. When Bessel was at his labours in
1838, the pair of stars forming the double were in the position
indicated on Fig.  1.   When 0. Struve undertook his labours in 1853
the pair of stars forming 61 Cygni had moved considerably, as           is
shown on the figure.         Finally, when the star was observed at
Dunsink in 1878,   it  had made another advance in the same direction
as before.   In forty years this object had moved over an arc of the
heavens upwards of three minutes in length.

61 Cygni. These are but small telescopic objects, they do not parti-

comparison stars tho two objects marked with his name.                      He
measured the distance from the central point of 61 Cygni to each of
the two comparison stars. From a series of such measures he dis
covered the parallactic ellipse of 61 Cygni. He was led to the same
ellipse by each of the two comparison stars.
     Fifteen years latter (1853) Strove undertook a new determination.
He chose a comparison star different from either of those Bessel had
used.     Strove's method of observing was also quite different from
Bessel's.     Struve made a series of measures of the distance and
position of the comparison star from 61 (B) Cygni.           Struve succeeded
also in measuring the parallactic ellipse.
     There was, however, an important difference between their results.
The distance, according to Bessel, was half as much again as Struve
found.      Bessel said the distance was sixty billions of miles ; Struve
said it could not be more than forty billions.
     The discrepancy may be due to the comparison stars.            If Bessel's
comparison     stars   were   only  about  three  times as  far  as 61  Cygni,
while Struve's star was about eight or ten times as far, the difference
between Struve's result and Bessel's would be accounted for.
     To settle the question, observations were subsequently made by
Auwers and others ; the latest of these investigations is one which has
recently been completed at Dunsink Observatory.
     Dr. Briinnow commenced a series of measures of the difference in
declination between 61 Cygni and a fourth comparison star. The
carrying out of this work devolved on the lecturer, as Dr. Briinno w's
successor.     Two series of observations have been made, one with each
of the components of 61 Cygni. The results agree very nearly with
those of Struve.
     On a review of the whole question, there seems no doubt that the
annual parallax of 61 Cygni is nearer to the half second found by
Struve, than to the third of a second found by Bessel.
     To exhibit the nature of the evidence which is available for the
solution of such a problem, a diagram showing the observations has
been prepared.        In the accompanying Fig. 2 the abscissae are the
dates of the second series of observations made at Dunsink.                The
ordinates indicate the observed effect of parallax on the difference of
declinations between 61 (B) Cygni and the comparison star. Each
dot represents the result of the observations made on the corre
sponding night.        The curve indicates where the observations should
have been with a parallax of 0"•47.          The discordances seem in many
cases very considerable.        They  are not, however, intrinsically so great
as might perhaps be at first theught.          The distance from the top of
the curve to the horizontal line represents an angle of four-tenths of
a second.     This is about the apparent diameter of a penny-piece at
the distance of ten miles.        The discordance between the observations
and   the  curve  is in  no  case  much more than half so great. It there
fore appears    that  the greatost error wo have made in these observations
amounts to but      two  or three tenths of a second. This is equivalent to

1881.]                 on the Distances   of the Stars.                 517
the error of pointing the telescope to tho top edge of a penny-piece
instead of to the bottom edge when the penny-piece was fifteen or
twenty miles off.

                         Ordinatcs indicate parallax.
                         Dots indicate observations.
    Still, however, the entire quantity to be measured is so small that
the errors, minute as they are, bear a large proportion to the parallax.
In this lies the weakness of such work. By sufficiently multiplying
the numbers of the observations, and by discussing them with the aid
of the method of least squares, considerable confidence may bo
attached to the results.
                             Oroombridge 1830.
    This star has   been the subject of much parallax work.        It has a
proper   motion of seven seconds annually.            Mr. Huggins or Mr.
Christie could perhaps ascertain by the spectroscope what its motion
may be in the line of sight.     From the theory of probabilities it may
not improbably be nine seconds.        We shall, however, take it at seven
seconds.   The parallax has been determined by Struve and by Briinnow.
It is very small, being one-tenth of a second. The actual velocity of
1830 Groombridge must therefore be 70 radii of the earth's orbit per
annum, or 200 miles per second.
     Newcomb has employed this result to throw light on the question

618                          Dr. Robert S. Ball                     [Feb. 11,
as to whether all our stars form one system.      If an isolated body in our
system is to remain there for ever, the theory    of gravitation imposes
the imperative condition, that the velocity of the body must not exceed
a certain amount. Assuming that the stars are 100,000,000 in number,
and that each star is five times as largo as the sun, assuming also that
they are spread out in a thin layer of such dimensions that a ray of
light takes 30,000 years to pass    it,Newcomb shows that the critical
velocity is 25 miles  per second.
    As this   isonly the eighth-part of the velocity of Groombridge
1830, we are thus led to the dilemma that either the masses of the
bodies in our system must be much greater than we have supposed, or
Groombridge 1830    is   arunaway star, which can never be controlled
and brought back.
                     Search for Stars with Parallax.
    The lecturer has been engaged for some years at Dunsink Obser
vatory in a   systematic search for stars which have an appreciable
parallax.   Up to the present about three hundred stars have been
examined. In the majority of cases each of these stars has been
observed only twice.    The dates of the observations have been chosen
so as to render the effects of parallax as manifest as possible.   It      is
not of course expected that small parallax of few tenths of second
                              a                   a                 a
could be detected by this means.
    The errors of the observations would mask any parallax of this
kind. It seems, however, certain that no parallax could have escaped
detectionifit  at all approached to that of a Centauri.
    The stars examined have been chosen on various grounds. It had
been supposed that some of the red stars were possibly among the
sun's neighbours, and consequently many of the principal red stars
were included in our list. No appreciable parallax has, however,
been detected in any of the red stars up to the present. Many of the
principal double stars are also included in the list. Other stars have
been added on very various grounds, among them may be mentioned
the Nova, which some time ago burst out in the constellation Cygnus,
and dwindled down again to a minute point.      The earth's orbit, how
ever, does not appear any larger when seen from Nova Cygni than
from any of the other stars on our list,
                             Groombridge 1618.
    We have, however, found one star which seems to have some claim
to attention as one of the sun's neighbours.    The star in question       is
Groombridge 1618. It lies in the constellation Leo, and      6' mag
                                                               is    5
nitude.    Groombridge 1618 has     aproper motion of l"-4 annually.
From a series of measurements of its distance made on fifty-five
nights from   asuitable comparison star, the parallax of Groombridge
1618 appeared to be about one-third of     second.
                                           a         As this seemed to
be a  result of considerable interest, measures were renewed for           a
second series of forty nights.   The result of the second series con

firms the first.      Measurements of the position angle were also made
at the same time. Some difficulties not yet fully explained have
arisen, but on the whole the measurements of the positive angle seem
to confirm the supposition that the parallax of Groombridge 1618 is
about one-third of a second.           No doubt this is but a small quantity.
The orbit    of   the  earth  viewed     from Groombridge 1618 is about the
same size   as  a  penny-piece    at  the  distance of seven miles.
                          Proper Motions of the Stars.
     Geologists have made us acquainted with the enormous intervals of
time which have elapsed since the earth first became the abode of
living animals. Regarding a period of 50,000,000 of years as com
parable with geologic time, some considerations were adduced as to the
effect of proper motions during such an interval.              It was pointed out
that in all probability none of the stars now visible to the unaided eye
can have then been visible from the earth.
                              The Nature      of Space.
     The possible connection of parallax work with the problems of the
nature of space was then alluded to. It was shown that if space be
hyperbolic the observed parallax is smaller than the true parallax, while
the converse must be the case if space be elliptic.           The largest triangle
accessible to our measurements has for base a diameter of the earth's
orbit, and for vertex a star.        If the defect of such a triangle be in any
case a measurable quantity, it would seem that it can only be elicited
by observations of the same kind as those which are made use of in
parallax investigations.

                  WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                          Friday, March   4, 1881.
      WILLIAM   BOWMAN,   Esq. F.E.S. Vice-President, in the Chair.
                Sir WILLIAM   THOMSON,   LL.D. F.E.S.    ETC.
              Elasticity mewed as possibly a Mode    of Motion.
WITH reference to the title of his discourse the speaker said : " The
                                               '
mere title of Dr. Tyndall's beautiful book, Heat, a Mode of Motion,'
is a lesson of truth which has manifested far and wide through
the world one of the greatest discoveries of modern philosophy.
I   have always admired it;     I have long coveted it for Elasticity;
and now, by kind permission of its inventor,       I  have borrowed it for
this evening's discourse.
     " A century and a half ago Daniel Bernouilli shadowed forth the
kinetic theory of the elasticity of gases, which has been accepted as
truth by Joule, splendidly developed by Clausius and Maxwell, raised
from statistics of the swayings of a crowd to observation and measure
ment of the free path of an individual atom in Tait and Dewar's
explanation of Crookes' grand discovery of the radiometer, and in the
vivid realisation of the old Lucretian torrents with which Crookes
himself has followed up their explanation of his own earlier experi
ments ; by which, less than two hundred years after its first discovery
by Eobert Boyle, 'the Spring of Air' is ascertained to be a mere
statistical resultant of myriads of molecular collisions.
     " But the molecules or atoms must have elasticity, and this elasti
city must be explained by motion before the uncertain sound given
forth in the title of the discourse, ' Elasticity viewed as possibly a
Mode of Motion,' can be raised to the glorious certainty of ' Heat, a
                    "
Mode of Motion.'
     The speaker referred to spinning-tops, the child's rolling hoop,
 and the bicycle in rapid motion as cases of stiff, elastic-like firmness
 produced by motion ; and showed experiments with gyrostats in which
 upright positions, utterly unstable without rotation, were maintained
 with a firmness and strength and elasticity as might be by bands of
 steel. A flexible endless chain seemed rigid when caused to run
 rapidly round a pulley, and when caused to jump off the pulley, and
 let fall to the floor, stood stiffly upright for a time till its motion
 was lost by impact and friction of its links on the floor.     A limp disc
 of indiarubber caused to rotate rapidly seemed to acquire the stiffness
 of a gigantic Eubens' hat-brim.      A little wooden ball which when
 thrust down under still water jumped up again in a moment, remained
 down as if embedded in jelly when the water was caused to rotate

1881.]       on Elasticity  viewed as possibly a Mode  of Motion.         521
rapidly, and sprung back        as if the water had elasticity like that of
jelly, when it was struck by       a  stiff wire pushed down through the
centre of the cork by which the glass vessel containing the water was
filled.   Lastly, large smoke rings discharged from a circular or
 elliptic aperture in a box were shown, by aid of the electric light, in
their progress through the air of the theatre when undisturbed.         Each
ring was circular, and its motion was steady when the aperture from
which it proceeded was circular, and when it was not disturbed by
another ring.       When one ring was sent obliquely after another the
collision or approach to collision sent the two away in greatly changed
directions, and each vibrating seemingly like an indiarubber band.
When the aperture was elliptic each undisturbed ring was seen to be
in a state of regular vibration from the beginning, and to continue so
throughout its course across the lecture-room.         Here, then, in water
and air was elasticity as of an elastic solid, developed by mere motion.
May not the elasticity of every ultimate atom of matter be thus
explained?      But this kinetic theory of matter is a dream, and can
be nothing else, until it can explain chemical affinity, electricity,
magnetism, gravitation, and the inertia of masses (that is, crowds of
vortices).
     Le Sage's theory might easily give an explanation of gravity and
of its relation to inertia of masses, on the vortex theory, were it not
for the essential aeolotropy of crystals, and the seemingly perfect
isotropy of gravity.       No finger-post pointing towards a way that can
possibly   lead  to a surmounting of this difficulty, or a turning of its
flank, has been discovered, or imagined as discoverable.          Belief that
no other theory of matter is possible is the only ground for antici
pating that there is in store for the world another beautiful book to
be called " Elasticity, a Mode of Motion."

 have the honour of addressing you here this evening;              the time
 which   I have had for preparation has, therefore, been exceedingly
limited.    In the second place, it is my desire (in accordance with
the traditions of this Institution) not merely to give a description
of the experiments in which         I  have for the last few months been
engaged,   but, as  far as possible,  to  reproduce them before you.   Now
these experiments are mostly of a very delicate nature.        In the quiet
of a laboratory — where time is practically unlimited, and where an
operation, if it should fail at first, may be repeated an indefinite
number of times — success is tolerably certain to be finally obtained ;
but in exhibiting delicate experiments before an audience, one is
working under the most unfavourable conditions, and, in case of
failure in the first instance, the attempt cannot generally be repeated.
Moreover, the substance with which we are chiefly concerned, sele
nium, is apparently extremely capricious in its behaviour.             This
appearance is, of course, really due to our present ignorance of its
properties ; but the fact remains that, on account of the great uncer
tainty of its action, it is a very difficult substance to deal with.
     Selenium is a rare chemical element which was discovered in the
beginning of the present century. In many of its properties it closely
resembles sulphur, and, like sulphur and some other substances, it is
capable of existing in more than one form.
     The ordinary form is that called vitreous. Selenium in this con
dition is as absolutely structureless as glass, and in appearance
resembles nothing so much as bright black sealing-wax,                with,
perhaps, somewhat of a metallic lustre; its real colour, however,
when seen in thin films, is ruby red. Its melting-point is a little
higher than 100° C. In its second modification selenium is crystal
line. When in this form its surface is dull, its fracture is metallic
(not unlike that of cast iron), its colour is grey or leaden, and it is

1881.]    on Selenium and its applications to the Photophone,                       dc.       525
quite opaque to light ; its melting-point also is considerably higher,
being 217° C.
     Vitreous selenium, if melted and kept for a certain length of time
at a temperature between its own fusing-point and that of crystalline
selenium, will crystallise; and        think     I            I
                                                 am right in saying, from
casual observation, though              I
                                 have made no experiments to verify the
point, that the length of time necessary for crystallisation depends
upon the degree of temperature, being proportionately shorter as the
temperature approaches 217° C.
     Vitreous selenium is an exceedingly bad conductor of electricity ;
it  is,indeed, an almost perfect insulator.       Crystalline selenium                        is
                                                                                               a

and exhibited by Mr. Willoughby Smith in 1873. But the effects

are small, and very delicate instruments are required for their
observation.
     Since that date several devices have been proposed for exaggerating
the effect, but they all depend upon the fact that the amount of
the variation increases with the extent of the selenium surface acted
upon.     It has lately been the fashion to call these arrangements
" cells," which, in most cases at all events, seems to be very inap             a

" rheostats,"     name which well expresses

 advantage until they were 10 or 12 feet long or more, every addi

 is called. But a cell of this length would be cumbersome and un
wieldy to use, and in fact could hardly be lifted without being
destroyed.        Dr. Werner Siemens therefore adopted the device
(among others) of coiling up the wires so as to form a double spiral,
and thus made a convenient and portable cell of great sensitiveness.
But it is very difficult indeed, as        Iknow by experience, to produce
these double wire spirals of any considerable size without the two
wires touching one another at some point.              After many attempts             I
succeeded in producing spiral cells about          f inch in diameter, but             I
found it impossible to exceed this size, and as it was not large enough
I  adopted a simple and very effective variation of Siemens's method,
which   I  believe has not been previously suggested. A copper wire
is wound after the fashion of a flat screw around a narrow slip of
mica, the threads of the screw being about -jSj- inch apart. Beside
this wire, and at a distance of j$ inch from                 it,second wire is
                                                                   a

between two consecutive turns of the first.           Care      taken that the
                                                                   is
two wires do not touch each other at any point.             Over one surface of
the mica    afilm of melted selenium       isspread, and after being worked
smooth and uniform      it is crystallised.     By this means the two wires
are connected with each other through half their entire length, by
a  series of very narrow strips of crystalline selenium.
    I   have here   a  tiny selenium cell which has been constructed in
this manner. Each wire makes about six turns, and the area of the
selenium upon its surface      is about half that of     athreepenny piece, its
thickness not much exceeding that of           sheet of ordinary note-paper.

   According to Professor Graham Bell, nothing more is necessary for
  obtaining the greatest degree of sensitiveness.             The old-fashioned
  process of long heating and slow cooling may, he says, be altogether
  dispensed with.         In this matter my experience differs entirely from
  his, for    I  find that cells which have been kept for some hours at a
  temperature just below the point of fusion, and then allowed to cool
  very gradually, are vastly more sensitive to light than those which
  have not been thus annealed.

      It is an interesting question, which of the coloured components of
 white light has the greatest power in effecting these changes in the
 resistance of selenium ; or, again, whether the effect is produced by
 light at all, or is due simply to heat.         Captain Sale came to the con
clusion, on moving a piece of selenium through the solar spectrum,
that the maximum effect was produced at or just outside the extreme
end of the red, at a point nearly coinciding with the maximum of the
heat rays.         Professor Adams performed the same experiment with
the spectrum both of the sun and of the electric light, and found that
the action on the selenium was greatest " in the greenish -yellow and
in the red portions of the spectrum." The greenish-yellow is the
point of maximum illumination, which is a remarkable fact ; but his
words seem to imply that there was a second maximum in the red.
The violet and the ultra-violet rays, he says, produced very little,
if any, effect. In consequence of the discrepancies in these results,               I
determined to repeat the experiment for myself.            The source of light

1881.]     on Selenium and its applications to the Photophone,  &c.    529
 which   I used in the first instance was an oxy-hydrogen lime-light, and
 the spectrum was formed with a bisulphide of carbon prism.            The
 experiment was repeated six times, and three different selenium cells
 were used.     The results were precisely the same in every case, and
 proved in the most marked manner that the greatest influence
 occurred in the boundary-line between the red and the orange ; thus
 differing completely from the results obtained both by Captain Sale
 and by Professor Adams. Moreover, the resistance when the selenium
 cells were placed in the ultra-red, two inches beyond the limits of the
visible spectrum, was in every case lower than when it was in the
 blue, indigo, and violet      But even in the ultra-violet the resistance
 of the cells was lower than when they were quite removed from the
spectrum.
      My friends Mr. Preece and Mr. W. H. Coffin, who were present
 during these experiments, suggested that it would be desirable to vary
 them by making use of different sources of light, and different methods
 of dispersion ; and a few days afterwards, by the great kindness of
 Mr. Norman Lockyer, they were repeated in Mr. Lockyer's laboratory
 by Mr. Preece and myself with the electric light and a magnificent
 diffraction grating.    Nine experiments were made with three cells,
and the results were as absolutely concordant as those which we had
previously obtained ; but they all concurred in placing the maximum
at the extreme edge of the red, thus agreeing with Captain Sale's
observations.     One other remarkable effect must be noticed. In the
case of a single cell — that which    I distinguish as No. 6 — with which
three experiments were made, a second maximum was observed in
every case in the greenish yellow, though the effect was about 20 per
cent, smaller than at the extreme red. The electric light, however,
is from its great unsteadiness most unsuitable for experiments of this
nature, and since no such exceptional phenomenon was ever observed
before or since,   I am inclined to believe that, by a coincidence which
however remarkable is by no means impossible, the light happened to
be unusually intense just on the three occasions when this particular
cell was in the greenish yellow.       A third series of experiments made
with a gas flame and a bisulphide of carbon prism, agreed with the
first in placing the maximum at the orange end of the red. Many
more combinations of sources of light and dispersion remain to be
tried, but time for these and for innumerable other experiments which
have suggested themselves has hitherto been wanting : for an opera
tion which may be described in a dozen words not uufrequently
requires as many hours for its performance.
                                                    I
     By the help of a reflecting galvanometer now propose to show
you the various effects produced by different parts of the spectrum of
the electric light formed by a bisulphide prism upon the resistance of
a selenium cell.      The maximum deflection is seen to occur when the
selenium is at the extreme outer edge of the red.
      The effect of interposing various coloured glasses between a gas
flame and the selenium cell was also tried.        The greatest effect was

630                         Mr. Shelford Bidwell                  [March 11,
produced by orange glass, the smallest by green.                It was, too,
observed as a remarkable fact that the light transmitted by a dark-
blue glass produced a greater effect than that which had been passed
through a blue glass of much lighter tint. But on a spectroscopic
examination the darker one was found to transmit a certain portion of
red light.    I also tried the effect of radiation from a black-hot poker
held at a distance of about 6 inches from the selenium, and upon the
first trial found that the resistance, instead of being diminished, was
increased by several thousand ohms.         I imagined this to be due to a
rise of temperature in the selenium, and was thus led to experiment
upon the effect of temperature. In this matter, too, there is a remark
able discrepancy between the authorities.        Professor Adams says that
an increase of temperature increases the resistance of selenium, and
even suggests that a selenium bar should be used for the construction
of a very delicate thermometer. Dr. Guthrie, Messrs. Draper and
Moss, and others, make the directly opposite assertion that the
resistance of selenium diminishes with heat.          I repeated my poker
experiment, which had in the former case apparently corroborated
Professor Adams, and now to my utter astonishment           I  found that the
resistance was greatly diminished.         This second experiment, there
fore, seemed to support Dr. Guthrie's statement.           A great number
of experiments were now undertaken for the purpose of arriving
at the truth of the matter, with the details of which             I will not
weary you. Solutions of alum in water, of iodine in bisulphide of
carbon, plates of glass and of ebonite were interposed between the
selenium and the sources of light and heat.          The selenium was now
fried, now frozen ; and the most contradictory results were obtained.
                   I
At one moment felt convinced that Professor Adams was right, at
the next there appeared to be no shadow of doubt that Dr. Guthrie's
was the true theory.       In fact, it seemed as if the selenium was pos
sessed by a demon which produced the variations in accordance with
the caprices of its own unaccountable will.           At length, when the
confusion was at its height and the demon most bewildering, the true
explanation was suddenly revealed, and so exceedingly simple is it
 that now the only marvel is that it should have so long eluded dis
covery.     The secret of the matter is this : and it discloses one of tho
 most remarkable properties of this most remarkable substance. There
 is a certain degree of temperature at which a piece of crystalline
selenium has a maximum resistance. If a piece of selenium at this
 temperature is exposed to either heat or cold — it matters not which —
 its resistance will at once be diminished ; and extremes of either pro
 duce a far greater variation than is ever effected by the action of light.
 A selenium cell which at the ordinary temperature measured in a dim
 light 110,000 ohms, was reduced by immersing it in oil at 115° C. to
 18,000 ohms. The resistance of the same cell was reduced by im
 mersing it in turpentine at — 6° C. to 49,000 ohms.          In the case of
 the single cell with which    I  have hitherto made the experiment, the
temperature on each side of which the resistance is diminished is

 1881.]    on Selenium and its applications to the Photophone,        dec.     531
 24° C*       Let this piece of solenium be gradually raised from a tem
 pera tore of zero to a temperature of 100° C. While passing from zero
 to 24°, its resistance will rapidly increase. Passing from 24° to 100°
 its resistance will again rapidly diminish.           (This experiment was
 successfully shown.)
     Until Professor Bell directed his attention to selenium, all observa
 tions concerning the effect of light upon its conductivity had been
 made by means of the galvanometer.           But it occurred to him that the
 marvellously sensitive telephene which he has invented might with
 advantage be used for the purpose, and on the 17th May, 1878, he
 announced in this theatre " the possibility," to use his own words, " of
 hearing a shadow by interrupting the action of light upon selenium."
 A few days afterwards Mr. Willoughby Smith informed the Society of
 Telegraph Engineers that he had carried this idea into effect, and had
 heard the action of a ray of light upon a piece of crystalline selenium.
     When a selenium cell, a telephone, and a battery are connected in
 circuit, a uniform current of electricity will, under ordinary circum
 stances, flow through the telephone, and a person listening would hear
 nothing.      Suppose now that a series of flashes of light were allowed
 to fall upon the selenium.       In the intervals of darkness the selenium
 cell would offer a greater resistance to the passage of the electric
 current than during the intervals of light. The strength of the
 current would be constantly varying ; and if the flashes succeeded one
 another quickly enough and with sufficient regularity, a musical note
 would now be heard by a person listening at the telephone.                   The
 exact pitch of this note would of course depend upon the rate at
 which the flashes succeeded one another, being high when the succes
 sion is rapid, low when it is slow.        The nature of this sound is very
 peculiar, reminding one of the moaning of a syren or the rising and
falling of the wind.        With a sufficiently sensitive cell, powerful
battery, and delicate telephone, the sound may be heard at a distance
of many feet.
     I   shall interrupt the steady beam of light which is now falling
upon the cell by causing a zinc disk with radial slits cut in it to
rotate in the path of the beam, and the sound produced by the rapid
succession of light and shade upon the selenium cell will be heard in
the telephone. When the cell is screened from the light, the sound at
once ceases.       When the screen is removed, the sound is again heard
as before.      By using a system analogous to that of dots and dashes,
an intermittent beam of light might be employed to convey photo-
phonic messages to a distance.
     But Professor Bell has gone further than this. He was not satisfied
with merely interrupting a steady beam of light, producing alternately
strong light and total darkness, but he aimed at graduating its
       1                                                                      ——-

                                        repeated with five other cells, and their
temperatures    of maximum resistance were found to be 23°, 14°, 30°, 25°, and 22°
respectively.

intensity in correspondence with the varying phases of the complex
sound-waves produced by the human voice. It is evident that if a
beam so regulated were allowed to fall upon the selenium cell, the
exact words spoken, with their articulation unimpaired, would be re
produced in the telephone.     Professor Bell adopted a device which is
equally marvellous for its extraordinary simplicity and for its perfect
efficiency.  The beam of light is made to fall upon the face of a small
flexible mirror, whence it is reflected to the distant selenium cell,
lenses being used for the purpose of rendering the rays parallel and
condensing them where required. The speaker directs his voice upon
the back of the mirror, which takes up the sound-waves and is thrown
into a state of vibration, thus becoming alternately concave and
convex. Now, when it is concave the light reflected by it is more
concentrated, and the selenium cell more brightly illuminated.       On
the other hand, when it is convex, the opposite effect is produced : the
rays are more dispersed and the illumination of the cell less intense.
And since the movements of the mirror are in exact correspondence
with the sound-waves of the voice, so also will be the intensity of the
illumination of the selenium cell. The strength of the current pass
ing through it will vary in the same proportion, and will cause the
telephone plate to vibrate in consonance with the mirror, and thus to
reproduce the exact sounds by which the mirror was sot in motion.
     In the small experimental photophone which is before you, the
receiving station is within 20 feet of the transmitter, and any sounds
heard in the telephone would of course be utterly drowned by the
actual voice of the speaker at the mirror. It is necessary, therefore,
to prolong the telephone wires, and carry them to a distant room,
where the sounds that have travelled along the beam of light can bo
heard without interruption.      Professor Bell, using instead of a lens
a large reflector for receiving the beam of light, has heard words
which were spoken when the mirror was 700 feet away from the
 selenium cell.
     It is impossible to exhibit the photophone in action to an
audience, because the effects can only be heard by a single person
at a time. But      I may mention, that in the course of some experi
 ments with this little instrument which Professor Tyndall very
kindly permitted me to make here on the 7th of December last, every
word transmitted by it was perfectly understood.
     I propose now to say a few words upon another and very different
application of selenium.      In point of interest and importance it
cannot be compared with the photophone : but since it is a child of
my own    I naturally regard it with a certain amount of affection. It
occurred to me a few months ago that the wonderful property of
 selenium, which we have been discussing this evening, might be
applied in the construction of an instrument for transmitting pictures
 of natural objects to a distance along a telegraph wire.        I have
 constructed a rough experimental apparatus in order to ascertain
 whether my ideas could be carried out in practice, and it is so far

1881.]       on Selenium and its applications to the Photophone, dc.          533
successful, that although the pictures hitherto transmitted are of a
very rudimentary character,              I
                                 think there can be little doubt that
further elaboration of the instrument would render it far more
effective.

having sixty-four threads to the inch.    This works in two bearings
4 inches apart, one of which has an inside screw corresponding to
that upon the spindle.   At a point midway between the two ends of
the cylinder a pin-hole H is drilled, and behind the hole a selenium
cell S is fixed.   One terminal of the selenium cell is connected
(through the spindle and stand of the instrument) with the negative
pole of a battery B', the other with the line wire M to the distant
station. The receiving instrument X contains a similar brass cylinder,
similarly mounted. A platinum point F presses gently upon its sur
face, and is connected both to the line wire and, through a variable
resistance K, with the positive pole of a local battery B, the negative
pole of which is connected through the galvanometer G with the
cylinder. A wire or earth connection N, between the negative pole of
the local battery and the positive pole of the other, completes the
arrangement.
    To prepare the instruments for work the cylinder of the trans
mitting instrument is brought to its middle position and a picture not
more than 2 inches square is focuesed upon its surface by means of

a photographic    lens L. The hole H in the cylinder is then brought
 to the brightest point of the focussed picture, and a scrap of sensitised
paper being placed under the platinum point of- the receiver, the
 variable resistance is adjusted so that the two opposite currents
through the paper neutralise each other.      When this is accomplished
the two cylinders are screwed back as far as they will go, the
cylinder of the receiver is covered with sensitised paper, and all is
ready to commence operations.
     The two cylinders are caused to rotate slowly and synchronously.
The little hole in the transmitting cylinder will in the course of its
spiral path cover successively every point of the focussed picture, and
the amount of light falling at any moment upon the selenium cell
will be proportional to the illumination of that particular spot of
the picture which, for the time being, is occupied by the pin-hole.
During the greater part of each revolution the platinum point will
trace a uniform brown line upon the prepared paper, but when the
pin-hole happens to be passing over a bright part of the picture, this
line is enfeebled or broken. The spiral traced by the point is so
close as to produce, at a little distance, the appearance of a uniformly
coloured surface, and the breaks in the continuity of the line constitute
a picture which, if the instrument were perfect, would be a counter
part of that projected upon the transmitter.

THE Lecturer began by observing that the subject he had chosen,
though at first sight technical, was one which should be taken up by
the general public, not only on account of its scientific interest, but
also since the special musicians were inclined to neglect it.     Indeed,
music itself had in this country, until quite lately, fallen into the
hands of a limited class, and that not always highly educated or largo
in their views. It was as though England had characteristically
handed over music-making to private contractors, as a monopoly,
taking contentedly whatever was offered, and making no effort for
larger and better supplies. Whereas music is really the most cosmo
politan of arts, springing up even where it might least be expected.
      It was probably from this delegation to a few of what was the
common property of all, that England had come to bo regarded as an
unmusical country, and that the remark made by a German on Sterndale
Bennett, Englischer componist, nicht componist, had originated.       The
 disesteem in which music had been held in this country was, doubtless,
in part the inheritance of our Puritan ancestors, and in part the out
                                                    "
flow of what might be termed " Chesterfieldism        ; the tone adopted
by would-be fine gentlemen, that it was undignified to bo mixed up
 with " fiddles and fiddlers."
      He affirmed, on the other hand, most strongly, that the nation
 possessed abundance of love for music ; much talent also, which only
needed fostering and cultivation ; indeed, it might be severely but
 not untruly said, that all England was musical except the musicians.
 He admitted that this state of affairs had improved, and was improving.
 Music was no longer regarded only as a means of gaining a scanty
 livelihood, but as a branch of liberal education ; the sense the word
 itself bore in the classical ages of Greece. It was the plain duty of
 such an audience as that he had the honour of addressing to assist in
 the revival.
      Turning to the special subject of his discourse, he noticed that of
 the three fundamental elements of a musical note, pitch, intensity, and

1881.]             on Musical  Pitch and   its determination.             537
quality, pitch    was the most susceptible of accurate measurement, and
that the recent great advances in physical science were mainly due to
the substitution of quantitative for qualitative methods ; of weighing
and measuring for mere demonstration.               He showed that absolute
pitch did not exist in nature ; a fact not negatived by the remarkable
power exceptionally possessed by some ears of recognising a note by
hearing.      This so-called gift was really an acquirement, depending in
some cases on the " muscular sense," as in the case of singers ; or on
a development of memory in others who, like organists, had sat for
half a lifetime before a particular instrument, until its tones had
penetrated into their inmost and instinctive consciousness. It was
not dissimilar to the acquired habit of counting " beats," which was
the foundation of piano- and organ-tuning, and which once established
interfered seriously with the pleasure of listening to ordinary music.
Examples of these beats and their causes were shewn.
     He proposed, after defining pitch as rapidity of vibration, to take
three questions in succession : (1) the chief causes, and amount of
variation in pitch in different sound producers ; (2) scientific modes
of measuring pitch ; (3) the musical application of such methods,
carried a stage farther in an artistic direction than was usual in
treatises on acoustics.
     It was shown experimentally that a metallic string through which
a powerful current of electricity passes sinks more than an octave in
pitch; that a tuning-fork heated over a lamp also sinks in pitch,
though to a far less degree ; that organ pipes vary greatly with heat,
and also with watery or other vapour, rising rapidly with increased
temperature.       An instrument for measuring this phenomenon, made
by the Lecturer, was shown.          In it air from the same wind-chest was
passed through two coils of metal pipe, one maintained at the tempe
rature of melting ice, the other at that of boiling water. Rapid and
distinct beating was thus produced in two pipes previously tuned to
 unison.     Harmonium reeds moved in the same direction as tuning-
forks, though in a greater degree ; the former sinking about one
vibration in 10,000 for each rise of a degree Fahrenheit, the latter
about 1 in 16,000.
     Both these quantities being small relatively to the changes under
gone by other sources of sound, the tuning-fork furnished the best,
and the free reed nearly as good a standard of pitch.         The reed, how
ever, depended      somewhat   on  its material   ; a brass and steel reed on
 the same wind-chest, and in unison, beating distinctly when the air
supply was raised to 212° Fahrenheit.
     In orchestral wind-instruments a double action took place, the
metal expanding with heat tending to flatten the note, whereas the hot
and moist breath of the performer caused it to sharpen, the latter
action greatly predominating in this climate at least.
     (2) The scientific determination of pitch had been attacked by five
principal methods.         (1) mechanical, (2) optical, (3) photographic,
(4)   electrical, and  (5) computative.

    Under the first heading, an exact copy of Colonel Perronet
Thompson's monochord, and the siren ; under the second, Lissajous'
figures, and McLeod's ingenious modification of these in the cycloscope
were demonstrated, the latter having proved one of the most accurate
and satisfactory instruments hitherto employed for this purpose.
Considerable stress was laid on the fifth or computative method, on
account of its extreme simplicity and accuracy, and also on the fact
that by    it,
             Absolute had first been obtained from Relative pitch.
     The three instruments mainly adverted to were Scheibler's
Tonmesser,    Appunn's   reed tonometer, and Koenig's tuning-fork
clock.    The first and second of these were exhibited        of the third;
a  photograph was projected on the screen. Scheibler was              silk       a
manufacturer, of Crefeld, in Germany, who as early as 1834 pub
lished his system of pitch-measurement.         In its simplest form,                  it
consists of sixty-five tuning-forks, each beating with its two neigh
bours four times per second, the first and last producing together                      a
true octave free from beats.    It can easily be shown mathematically
that  if the product of 64         which = 256, and
                                          X   4           the sum total of
                                                                     is
beats, be   correct,   mustit equal the vibration-number of the deeper
and half that of 612 the acuter fork. Thus absolute will have been
deduced from relative vibrations, and the problem of pitch-determina
tion will have been solved.         Scheibler's   excellent observations,
however, seem to have failed to meet with the recognition they
deserved, until they were disinterred by Helmholtz and his English
translator, Mr. Alex. J. Ellis.

 1881.]            on Musical   Pitch and  its determination.               539
      Appunn's reed tonometer proceeds on exactly the same principle
 as that   of Schoibler, free reeds being substituted for forks.           It is
 somewhat inferior in accuracy to the latter, for reasons named above,
 and also from the mutual influence of the reeds on one another,
 which has been shown to be considerable.              On the other hand, its
 strident and coercive tone renders its indications more appreciable.
      The third instrument, recently made by Koenig, of Paris, and
                                                     '
 fully described in ' Wiedemann's Annalen in 1880, has not yet
 reached this country.      It consists essentially of Helmholtz's vibra
tion-microscope, combined with a small clock of which the pendulum
is a tuning-fork, causing the escapement                to make 128 single
vibrations per second.
      It might be now considered that the problem of absolute pitch
had been satisfactorily determined, and, a standard having been ob
 tained, its artistic application was matter only of time and patience.
      That it had not been so applied was a discredit to England, duo
chiefly to the rank and file of unmusical musicians named above.              It
was perfectly certain that since the time of Handel a rise of orchestral
pitch amounting to about a semitone had occurred.               The causes of
this rise, in the Lecturer's opinion, were at least four : (1) the excess of
true fifths, as tuned to by violins, over corresponding octaves ; (2) the
rise by heat of the increased number of modern wind-instruments ;
(3) the difficulty of appreciating slow beats, leading players, for the
Bake of prominence, to tune slightly above absolute unison ; (4) the
predominant effect on the ear of a sharper over a flatter note, causing
a steady rise of the instruments which are susceptible of tuning.
     It was obvious to any thoughtful man that the Voice, God's
instrument, should be consulted in preference to man's less perfect
contrivances of wood and brass. At the same time, the difference
between the high orchestral pitch now in use to the detriment of
singers' voices, and the French normal diapason, which had been
proved by Kcenig to be an accurate as well as convenient standard,
was really far less than would be thought.         This fact was illustrated
by playing alternately on clarinets tuned to the one pitch and the
other ; the ear, unassisted by beats, being all but nnable to detect the
difference between the two. In conclusion, the main need of modern
English music was stated to be a greater familiarity with the physical
principles upon which it rests.                                 [W. H. 8.]

                    WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                            Friday, April  1, 1881.

                The King in his Relation to Early Civil Justice.
 Wherever, in the records of very ancient societies belonging to races
 with which wo have some affinity, we come upon the personage whom
 we call the king, he is almost always associated with the administra
 tion of justice.   He is much more than a judge.       He is all but inva
 riably  a  military chief, and constantly a priest. But he rarely fails
 to be a judge, though his relation to justice is not exactly that with
 which we are familiar.
      The law books claiming the highest antiquity are those of the
 Hindoos, of which one, and not the oldest, has long been known
 vaguely to Europeans as the code of Manu.             These books only
 became law books by a process of specialisation, having at first dealt
 with all things human and divine ; but they always assume a king to
 administer justice, who sits with learned Brahmans for assessors.
 This order cf ideas may be traced in the westerly wing of the Aryan
 race, where the great Brehons whe declared the ancient Irish law are
 kings or kings' sons, and where it is expressly laid down that a king,
 though of right a judge, may have an assessor to advise him.         Still
 older is the conception of the king's relation to justice found in the
 poems attributed to Homer.        There the king, as judge, pronounces
judgments     or " dooms," but though they are doubtless based on      pre
 existing usage, they are supposed to be divinely and directly dictated
 to the king from on high.
      The judges of the Hebrews represent an old form of kingship,
 but independently of the etymology of the name, they are clearly
 exponents of the law and administrators of justice.      Deborah, who is
 counted among them, judged Israel in Mount Ephraim ; Eli, the last
 but one of them, had judged Israel forty years; and Samuel, the
 last, expressly claims credit in his old age for the purity of his
judgments.       The decline of the system is marked by the misconduct
of their children.     Under the later hereditary kingship, the judicial
function scarcely appears in Saul and David, but revives in Solomon.
     By the side of the king there was another fountain of law and
justice, the popular assembly.      It is not necessary to enter on the

 1881.]         on the King in his relation to Early Civil Justice.     541
question, now much disputed, which was the older of the two, but it is
to bo observed that, however much a system of tribunals independent
of the king might be organised, there was always supposed to be a
residuary and complementary jurisdiction in the king.            The Roman
law, which supplies the law of the civilised world wherever English
law does not prevail, is descended from this residuary jurisdiction.
What we know as the Roman jurisprudence is not the primitive
Roman law, but it is that law distilled through the jurisdiction of
the Roman prretor, which jurisdiction had descended to him from the
ancient half-fabulous kings of Rome.
     In the ancient Teutonic administration of justice, which is specially
interesting to us as a Teutonic people, we find the king and the
popular tribunal side by side.         The relations of the two are very
difficult to trace in our own island, much as modern learning has
done for the inquiry, but they are tolerably clear in the law of the
 Salian Franks, which has descended to us as the Salic law, and which
is erroneously supposed to have something to do with the descent of
crowns.     The Salic law is really a manual of law and procedure for
 the ancient German Court of the Hundred.            The king first appears
merely as claiming a share of the fines ; but as the history of law
 proceeds,   it is his authority which gives to the administration of
justice most of the characteristics which now belong to it. The
ancient Court of the Hundred had no power to enforce a large class
 of its own decisions, the man who disobeyed them being at most
outlawed.       But if the litigants agree beforehand that the king's
representative shall enforce the award of the court, he will do it ;
and so will the king himself if the litigant goes to him in person.
 As the Prankish kings become more powerful, they intervene more
and more in the business of the Hundred Court.                The Court, or
 King's Deputy, takes the place of the elective President, or Thing-
man ; but then, on the other hand, all the judgments of the court are
enforced.      Finally, even popular justice comes to be administered in
the king's name.
     Except in communities living within walled towns, whose institu
tions followed a peculiar course of development, royal justice steadily
 grew at the expense of popular justice.         What were the causes of
this ? First of all, the multitudinousness of the popular courts, and
the great burden which the duty of attending them threw on the free
cultivator.      In England, the Reeve and four men attended the
Hundred and Shire Courts, and an even larger number of freemen
attended in the courts of the Continent.           Even now a summons to
serve on a jury is not received with complacency, but what must the
duty of going to the Shire Court have been when most of England was
forest or fen, and when there were few roads but the old Roman
roads?     Nor was the onerousness of the duty to be discharged in
court very slight, since the judges had sometimes to fight on behalf
of their own verdicts.        There are councils of the Church which
protest against the burden thrown on poor men.           The feudal courts

descended    from the popular courts were equally numerous at first
and equally oppressive in consequence.
      Meantime the justice which the king administered to all whe
applied to him was purer, more efficient, and more skilfully adapted
to the facts, since he alone had the command of expert advice.           But
still, in order to understand the accessibility of royal justice, we must
bring home to ourselves what the ancient Teutonic king was. He did
not live at home in a distant castle or palace.           He was, above all
things,   an  ambulatory,     itinerant   personage, moving ever about his
 territory with surprising rapidity. The ancient Celtic king followed
 +vc same practice.      Tho ancient Irish records shew the Irish king
perambulating     the  territory     of his subordinate chiefs, making them
presents,   and feasting   at  their  expense.   By the end of the sixteenth
                                                     "
century this had become a great abuse, and the cutting and coshering
                                                                             "
of the Irish chiefs is especially stigmatised as one of the curses of
Ireland. The itinerancy of the English kings continued to a sur
prisingly late period, and was much more constant than is popularly
known.      One object, no doubt, was to live on the produce of their
widely separated lands, but another was to administer justice and
collect judicial fines and fees.
      The Lecturer then referred to the Itineraries of King Henry n.
and King John drawn up by Mr. Eyton and Sir T. Duffus Hardy.
He gave as an example the movements of King John .in May 1207,
and showed that the king, in the course of that month, travelled over
half of England. And though John passes as an effeminate sovereign,
the same extraordinary activity went on through every month of
nearly every year of his reign.            Gradually, however, the itinerant
king became a monarch of the modern type, the early stages of the
change being traceable through the growth of the system of missi, of
itinerant deputies or "justices in eyre," which was considerably older
in England than King John's reign, but was much enlarged by its
great event.
      The rapid movements of the early Teutonic king probably left
him time enough at each point for the settlement of primitive
 litigation. But as the law and men's affairs became more compli
 cated, a new set of abuses arose.         The litigant who desired the royal
judgment had to hurry after the king over all parts of his dominions.
The Lecturer referred to the efforts of Bichard de Anersley to get
                                      "
Henry II. to " give him a day : the story of his trouble and expenses
is printed in the second volume of Falgrave's ' Bise of the English
Commonwealth.'        It is easy for the reader of this paper to understand
the importance of the provision of Magna Charta that " the Common
Pleas are no longer to follow the king."
      The struggle between royal and popular justice has determined
the judicial and legal history of many different European countries.
The judicial system of England is of royal origin. Except so far as
it has been changed by the modern county courts, it is the most
centralised system of judicial administration in the world.              The

1881.]       on the King in his relation to Early Civil Justice.       543
popular courts have practically perished.        On the other hand, the
law itself has been less changed than in France or Germany.           It is
still a modernised version of Teutonic usage.
     In France, these characteristics are reversed, mainly owing to the
authority obtained by the Eoman law. The civil code is little more
than a version of Roman jurisprudence.         But the same cause which
changed the law preserved the form of the judicial system, and hence
superficially the French judicial system has much of the form of the
old popular judicature.     You find very little judicial centralisation,
a large number of local courts, a multitude of judges.
     The residuary authority of the king produced in England the
Court of Chancery, which became a recognised portion of our system.
It also produced the Star Chamber, whose jurisdiction became a
proverb of oppression.      The Star Chamber marks the exhaustion of
what was once the most valuable of all sources of justice.            The
reforming authority of the king has descended to legislatures, now
almost everywhere the children of the British Parliament.

          The Language and Literature        of the Scottish Higlilands.
SOME   fifty years    ago Colonel Vane Kennedy, in a book of no vulgar
speculation   and   research,  could make the assertion before the scholars
of Great Britain that the Celtic languages constitute a special family,
having no connection with any other known languages, specially
altogether distinct from Sanscrit, Latin, Greek, Teutonic, and other
members of the great Aryan class. At the present day there is not a
fairly instructed schoolboy in an ordinary English classical school
who is not familiar with the exact contrary of this proposition.          That
such an assertion should have been made at all, admits of explanation
only from the general neglect of the Celtic languages by well-
educated British scholars, together with the crude state of arbitrary
divination, in the limbo of which even good philologers were in those
days blindly tossed about. Against this system of would-be scientific
conjecture as applied to the Celtic languages, Colonel Kennedy stoutly
and wisely protested ; but his own knowledge of Celtic, picked up
mainly from the dictionary, without any living knowledge either of
its habits or its anatomy, was altogether insufficient to enable him to
make a diagnosis of the language, that might furnish reliable materials
for a scientifically conducted induction.           Such a diagnosis, thanks
                                                     "
to the labours of those " intellectual moles           and intellectual eagles,
the Germans, we are now in a condition, with the most perfect ease
and with the most sure-footed safety, to conduct.            My own acquaint
ance with the Celtic languages is confined to that member of the family
spoken in the Highlands of Scotland, commonly called Gaelic ; and
as it was an acquaintance which         I  made accidentally from sympathy
with the people among whom for a succession of summer seasons                 I
had pitched my tent, and followed out as a pleasant recreation rather
than a serious business,     I  cannot pretend, in addressing you, to speak
with the full weight of authority that would belong to the words of a
ZEUSS, an EBEL, or a WINDISCH.                I
                                          But know enough of the general
principles   of   comparative philology, and enough also both of the
grammar     and  the  living genius of the language as now spoken in the
Highlands,    to  keep me from falling into any serious blunder ; and         I
appear   here  before   you to-night,  I  presume, on the very practical and
profitable assumption     that  in a domain  where everybody knows nothing,

a man who knows        something may pass for a pundit.                    I
                                                                 shall there
fore proceed to tell you what          I
                                     know of the matter, on John Locke's
famous supposition that your metropolitan minds are, in reference to
the subject of my lecture, as a eheet of blank paper, on which an
unkempt uncovenanted Scot may for once be allowed to stamp any
scripture he pleases.
      Colonel Kennedy was perfectly aware that there existed not a few
words in Welsh and Irish manifestly cognate with the same words
in Latin ; but he had a ready theory that all savage or semi-civilised
tribes borrow largely and greedily from their civilised superiors, and
he thought that this theory was sufficient to explain all the similarities
which he had noted.         Now, it is quite true, however some stiff
Galicians may kick against        it,
                                   that not only ecclesiastical words, but
other words not     few, may be either certainly set down as borrowed
                     a
from Latin, or labouring under         strong suspicion of such importa
                                           a
 tion.   But
           it   isequally true that words for the most common objects
 and necessary relations of life, and where no suspicion of borrowing
 can intrude, appear in Gaelic with         distinctly Latin physiognomy
                                                a                                      ;
 and       truly surprising   to     how       bad luck could have happened
      it
      is                         mo       the
to any ransacker of dictionaries, to march out two long columns of
 Celtic roots of familiar objects without stumbling upon single Latin      a
or Teutonic equivalent.       If the Celts borrowed fion from the Latin
vinum, which    is  possible enough, though anything but certain,                      it
certainly  cannot  be   said that the words mathair, mother, rrathair,
brother, each, horse, and ou, dog, fall under             the same foreign
category. And what shall we say to the numerals              It should have
                                                                    ?
 seemed to Colonel Kennedy that            was as irrational to suppose that
                                               it
 the Celts borrowed the names of the simple numerals from the
 Bomans, as with the scholars of last century to believe that Sanscrit is
a   language borrowed from Greek as           consequence of the conquests
                                                    a
 of Alexander the Great. The lowest savages count by fives and tens
and scores ;   and the Celts in Julius Cesar's time were confessedly
 far above that level.    Let us commence therefore with the numerals
 as at once the most striking proof of the original identity of the
language, and as presenting examples of some of the most character
istic mutations of consonants, which regulate the passage of an
 original Indo-European root from the Latin to the Celtic form.

     Now the three first of these numerals require- no observation.
In   the fourth we see an illustration of a law very common in Gaelic,
as compared with Latin, and as one would expect also in French —
viz. dropping a consonant in the middle of a word, when preceded
and followed by a vowel. Thus the French from pater make pere,
and from mater, mere ; and so the Latin quatuor is smoothed down to
ceithir (pronounced Cd-ur), by the omission of the aspirated t. In
coig another law is exemplified, which leads to the omission of the
nasal n before a consonant, exactly as in Ionic Greek we have irvflooro
vocalised into irvOoia.™,     So in Gaelic we have mioa, a month, for
mentis.   The number sex is softened down by the common .practice
of shaving off a final consonant. So in septem, novem, and decem, the
final m falls, as we know neither was it pronounced by the Romans,
and as the modern Greeks treat the final v of the second declension
of nouns, saying KoXd for (caXoV. In seachd and ochd we further see
the preference given by the Celts to the aspirated guttural ch, while
as an initial of roots c remains as in cridhe KapSia and creadh
creta; and in deach compared with decem we have further to note
that the hard c or k in Latin at the end of a word is softened into ch,
as in each for equus ; naoidh vocalises the medial » of the Latin. Ficlwat
exemplifies the change of v into /, as in vinum, and in fios for the
German wissen ; and again, the throwing out of the » before the final
t, as when the Greeks changed the original Doric Acyorn, into Aeyouo-i.
Centum becomes ceud on the same principle.
     And now, summing up all these special differences between the
Gaelic language and its nearest relative,* we may say at once that the
Gaelic language bears on its face the impress of a curtailed, smoothed
over, and somewhat emasculated Latin — a language which has dealt
consistently with the original stock of Latin which it brought with
it from the East, exactly in the same fashion that French has
dealt with its imported Latin.      This curtailment in both languages,
French and Gaelic, has gone to such an extreme that it is not seldom
difficult for an inexperienced eye to recognise the identity.         Thus
between gour, a goat (I write here as pronounced), and caper, gawl,
and capere, aar and pater, on a superficial view there seems no
connection ; but spell these words as they appear in the books, gabhar,
gabhail, athair, and a philological eye discerns at a glance the original
identity of the divergent terms.        For the spelling of these worda
clearly  indicates that  the medial consonant  before being dropped was
aspirated, that    is,
                    softened down by breathing which renders
                                         a                             more
                                                                      it
easy  of  pronunciation,   and prepares  the way  for its  final disappear
ance.    Restore this medial consonant, with all the sharpness of its
natural features, and there    is not the slightest difficulty, even to an
  *   Ebel says that the Gaelic roots which can be proved to be modified forma
of the same roots in the Aryan family belong in pretty nearly equal groups to
the Latin and Teutonic stock. I     deal only with the Latin here, as being the
more familiar to the general audience.

550                    Professor   J. Stuart   Blackie               [April   29,
unscientific eye, in perceiving that gabar and caper, gabail and capere
are identical, the change of the sharp into the blunt consonant in
both cases, and the rejection of the final vowel, with the familiar
change of r into I in capere, being all that is required to effect the
passage from the Latin to the Celtic form of the word.          In athair a
further change takes place, the dropping of the initial consonant ; but
this is quite in order, as the Homeric forms aTa for yaia, €i/3w for
libo, and cuvos for 8«vos sufficiently prove.   The Gaels seem to have
had a peculiar antipathy to p at the commencement of a word ; so
that not only in athair from pater, but in leac from irXax-, in leana from
planug and in Zan from plenus, and in uchdt from pectus, this unoffend
ing letter has been rudely thrown out. The system of aspiration here
noted as a preparatory step for the evasion of the medial consonant,
and taking the BONKS, so to speak, out of the word, extends in Gaelic
and all the Celtic languages far beyond the case of the medial con
sonant.    It is a regular habit of the language to modify by aspirates
the initial consonant of any word, when it is preceded by certain words,
most of which are distinguished by a long final vowel, a modification
which in not a few cases amounts to a total deletion of the consonant,
and in certain cases to a sweeping erasure of both consonant and
aspirate from the field of hearing ; a result which not only emas
 culates the word, but renders it difficult to be recognised by those
 whose ear has been trained to the primary and unmodified form.
 Thus the word TIOH, a house (in which as spelt the Latin tego, the
 Greek oreyos, the German dach, and the English deck are plainly
 recognised), when preceded by mo or do, my or thy, forthwith becomes
 high.   A similar modification takes place regularly in the flexion of
 nouns and verbs, and specially when an adjective is joined to a
 feminine noun.      Thus, as Sen, a mountain, is feminine in Gaelic,
 instead of Ben More, or big mount, the natives say Benvdre, or, as they
 spell it,  Benmhor, changing the m into         vby the addition of the
 aspiration. I  remember how much was puzzled with the signification
                                     I

 the noun, which necessitated the aspiration of the initial      / and this,

 of the case contrasts wonderfully with the common opinion enter
 tained of Gaelic by the English people, who are accustomed to talk of
it  as harsh and guttural but this opinion arises partly from the fact
                          ;
  that tourists in the Highlands seldom hear the language spoken
  except by the most unrefined persons, and partly from the notion that

the final cli, in which Gaelic, like German, abounds, is a harsh sound.
It is quite the reverse. The German milch is the soft form of the
harsh and sharp English milk. It is nothing singular that men
attempt to fasten a fault on an object perceived, when the real flaw
lies in the defective organ of the percipient.
     So much for the language. The literature in its main stream
consists of popular ballads and songs — those xAt'a avSpwv with which
Achilles is represented as solacing his solitary grudge when Agamem
non sends the embassy to request him to rejoin the Greek army. Of
these songs and ballads a collection was made by a certain Dean
Macgrigor, of Lismore, in Argyll, about the time of. the Reformation ;
for a long time preserved in the Advocates' Library in Edinburgh,
and some years ago published and translated under the able editor
ship of Skene and MacLauchlan.                Another most extensive and
valuable collection    has  recently  been  made   by John Campbell of Islay,
taken down     from  the  mouths  of  the  people  and preserving many of the
old Fenian traditions in a form which, without his work, must very
soon have disappeared.        I myself have heard some of these ballads
recited by an old man in Tobermory, the descendant no doubt of a
race of ballad-singers and story-tellers, who formed a regular pro
fession in the Highlands, but which now, like other good things in
that quarter, is rapidly dying out.              As in ancient Greece, the
original musical form in which the popular traditions were embodied
soon gave rise to a prose version of cognate matter in a kindred
tone; so beside the ballads and songs of which we have spoken,
there existed in the Highlands a rich collection of prose stories
or tales, which were told by accomplished story-tellers to lighten
the heaviness of the winter evenings at the smoky fireside.                To
the patriotic diligence of Mr. Campbell in this case also we are in
debted for the preservation of a body of prose Highland tales of
primary importance in the history of early Aryan and European
civilisation. The contents of these stories, though often fanciful and
childish, like our fairy tales, are seldom without a subtle moral sig
nificance ; and their style is masterly, with a certain natural quaint-
ness and grace, for which we shall find no parallel except in some of
the most attractive pages of Herodotus.           Some of these ample ballad
materials, about the middle of the last century, as all the world knows,
fell into the hands of a literary gentleman named MacPherson, be
longing to the district of Badenoch, between Braemar and Kingussie ;
and manipulated by his hands and a few friends well skilled in
Celtic lore, they were sent forth to the world under the name of the
poems of OSSIAN.       That these famous poems — whose originality was
recognised with fervour by Goethe, Herder, and others of the most
notable names in European literature — are a genuine Celtic produc
tion, both in respect of the materials from which they were composed,
and the manipulators who put the materials together, there can be no
doubt.     The only doubt is how much or how little these gentlemen
did to put the materials which they unquestionably possessed into

their published shape ; and this is a doubt which, like many points
connected with the Homeric poems of early Greece, must,              fear,     I
remain for ever unremoved. The Greek Homer, that                      is,

poet who usually passes for the author of the Iliad, and the Celtic
Homer, that        not Ossian, but MacPherson, equally founded their
                 is,
fame on the working up of the floating materials of popular ballads
into  a   more elevated form as they both equally, no doubt, left im
                                    ;
printed on the materials which they used the stamp of their own
peculiar genius only with this difference, that Homer lived in an age
                  ;
when the minstrel world to which he belonged was still in its vigour,
while MacPherson appeared late in          literary age in the character
                                                       a
 rather of an antiquarian refurbisher than of an active contemporary
 bard. The consequence is, that between Homer and the times of
 which he sings, the most complete and pleasant harmony everywhere
is  felt whereas MacPherson's work can never altogether be cleared
         ;
 from the suspicion of having quitted the healthy simplicity of the old
 traditions to indulge in the superfine sentiment and a certain tragic
 attitudinising, characteristic of the somewhat flat and feeble century
 to which he belonged.
     Though the Highlanders were never reading people, and are not

 least. Man liveth not by books alone, but by every word that floweth
 out of the living soul of    brother. Professional bards always existed
                                a
 amongst them, learned in all the traditions of their clan, and with
 senses well exercised to discern all the beauty and sublimity of the
 picturesque country which they inhabited.       Of the intellectual fer
 tility of this race   a notion may be had from the study of the Sar
 olair or book of the classical Highland poets,       collection made by
                                                                  a

      It would be impossible for me, in the bird's-eye view am here       I
  presenting, to enumerate even the names of those who have merited
  an honourable place in this Pantheon of the Celtic bards for not only
                                                                      ;

Dunoan MaoIntyre, of Inveroran in Argyleshire, all belonging to
the middle or the latter half of the last century.           MacDonald, nnlike
his brethren of the Celtic lyre, had received a university education, and
had more of the character of a modern literary man than of a genuine
Highland minstrel.      Possessed of a bold Byronic genius, he was the
author of several poems of undeniable power, and a man altogether
who, under more favourable circumstances, might have ripened into a
great British poetic notability.        He lived in the country of the Clan
Banald, and his launch      of   the  Biorlinn,   or Barge of Clan Ranald, is
unquestionably one of       the    most    spirited and powerful poems in
 the Gaelic language.
     Dugald Buchanan, the Bunyan of the religious world in the
 Highlands, had a genuine poetic vein, as his poem on Hamlet's
 suggestive theme — a human skull — places beyond donbt ; but that
classical production, and his other poems, are marred to heterodox
 readers, by their want of sympathy with the peculiar theology of
 terrors and tortures with which the natural gay temperament of
 the Highland Celts, since the Evangelical revival of last century, in
 its most narrow and repulsive form, has been largely infected.
     MaoIntyrk, or Duncan Ban, fair Duncan, as ho is more familiarly
 called, like a genuine old Celtic bard, knew nothing of reading or
 writing, but spun his musical musings into shape as he wandered up
 and down the glens in the vicinity of Tyndrum and Loch Tulloch. His
 poems breathe the finest appreciation of Nature and the most genuine
 human kindness ; health and joy and beauty are the atmosphere which
 he constantly carries about with him ; he borrows his colour from the
 purple heather, and his music from the mountain brook ; while the stag
 on the brae is his familiar friend, and the most distinctive living
 figure in his landscape.       As a picture of mountain scenery, and a

     As   a whole, Gaelic literature is a literature which is likely to die,
as it   has  lived, without going largely into what we call more distinc
tively   literature.     The genuine Highlander still sings. He does not
 write.     An admirable, and to a certain extent successful, attempt at
 creating a prose literature was made by Dr. Norman Macleod, father
 of his better-known son, the Queen's favourite clergyman, in the early
 part of the present century.              He published a magazine full of
 graphic     sketches    of   Highland     life and character, set forth with
 a grace and seasoned           with a humour, enough to give a classical
 position to any writer.           But admirable as these tracts were, and
 forming, as they do at the present hour, the unequalled model of
 classical Gaelic prose, the reading element in Highland society was too
 weak to encourage any further adventure in this style.             It is in vain
 to write for a people who either do not read at all, or are led by
 irresistible seduction to seek for what books can give in the full-
 flowing streams of English, rather than in the thin rivulets of Gaelic
 prose. Next to sketches of character, given in the lively style of
 popular dialogue, the staple of Macleod, one would expect from the
 Highlander, being as he is notably a very serious and religious
 person, a large display of sermon or pulpit literature; but here
 expectation finds itself hugely disappointed.             The fervour of Celtic
 apostleship is well known ; and the very numerous adherence of the
  Presbyterians north of the Grampians, to the Free Church, whatever
 other value it may have, is certainly a remarkable proof of the
 efficiency and the popularity of the clergy in those parts ; but how
 ever fervid in pulpit demonstration, and zealous in points of traditional
 orthodoxy, the trans-Grampian Evangelists may be, they have wisely
 confined their ministrations         to the electric effect of the living word,
 and not endeavoured to gain a position for Gaelic in the printed

556                      Professor J. Stuart BlacTcie            [April 29,
eloquence of the pulpit which few could appreciate and everybody
could spare.      Among contemporary attempts to use Gaelic for the
currency of the hour, the Gaelic articles in that sturdy organ of
Eadicalism the Inverness Highlander, are deserving of special praise ;
but the very small proportion of the columns of that journal in which
the native language appears, affords the most satisfactory proof that
the great mass of Highland readers prefer the English tongue, and
are in fact for the most part unable to read the works of their best
poets, by whose names they are yet proud to swear.          The only other
production of Gaelic prose that seems to call for special mention is
their body of wise saws and popular apophthegms, originally collected
by an Episcopal clergyman of the name of Macintosh, who lived in
 the early part of the present century, and now republished with large
 additions and valuable comments by that genial and accomplished
 Celt, Sheriff Nicolson, of Kirkcudbright.
      Should  I  be expected to say, in conclusion, what is the present
 state and future prospects of the Celtic population in the Highlands,
 the answer may be short, but sad.                   I
                                        Personally am one of those who
 like to see Highlanders in the Highlands ; but where Nature, and
 unnatural landlords, and partial land laws, and a one-eyed political
 economy divorced from all moral considerations and social ties, have
 now for more than a century conspired to drain away the native popu
 lation of the glens, my wishes are a mere breath that will pass the
 weighted scales innocuously, and leave the balance where it was. Our
 noble Highlanders, the best-conditioned peasantry morally and physi
 cally in Europe, and the best constituent of our once famous armies,
 that knew no defeat, have been lost to us,       I fear, for ever, by land
 laws which, while they strengthened by artificial enactments the
 natural strength of the lords of the soil, left the mass of the people at
 the mercy of pleasure-hunting lords — not seldom absentees — and omni
 potent factors inflated by economical crotchets or spurred by commercial
 greed. Laws were made and maintained with jealous severity to pre
 serve the game ; but no one dreamt of preserving the people. The
.consequence     has been that the people, receiving no encouragement
 from their natural protectors, who rather seemed anxious in not a few
 cases to get rid of people, poachers, and poor laws at a stroke, retreated
 year after year from their dear old homes, which were homes now only
 for gamekeepers and game, and Titanic dealers in Highland wool and
 hill-mutton, and sought for higher wages, more kindly treatment, and
  far less healthy moral and physical surroundings in the hot-beds and
  back slums of our great manufacturing towns. In these circumstances it
 is in vain to expect that the Gaelic language and the Gaelic literature
 should be at present in a very vigorous condition. It is no doubt wonder
 ful to observe what flashes of the genuine old spirit occasionally shoot
 forth in fervid verse, and in sagacious prose; but they are only
 FLASHES.     Genuine Celtic sentiment, and loving appreciation of Celtic
 culture, appear only in a few exceptional individuals ; the best part of the
 people have left the country in despair ; and those who remain behind,

feeble, dejected, and dispirited, slaves to the urgent necessities of tho
hour, are more anxious to catch greedily at any bait which the purse-
proud Saxon may fling before them than to retain the honourable
heritage of manhood and self-reliance which they received from their
sires. With the great mass of Highlanders,                      I  fear, patriotic sentiment
does not go     much   beyond       a sentiment;      men    in  their    depressed condition,
in fact,  cannot    afford    to   feed   on   the  savour     of   old    traditions, however
ennobling ; they       stand     face   to  face   with    the  hard     facts  of a world that
knows nothing about Duncan Ban, and to whom the spirit-stirring
strains of the national pipe can be looked on only as an ill-timed
interruption to the whirling of their gigantic wheels, and the whirring
of their multitudinous power-looms. A special blow of discourage
ment has recently been given to the maintenance of a genuine Celtic
spirit in the Highlands by the recent Education Act. In the code

ing out what is in people, rather than by injecting them with what is
foreign, seems utterly unknown to those who in London are entrusted
with the important function of teaching the young mind how to shoot
in the world benorth of the Grampians.                         But red tape and central
ization, however, naturally narrow and unsympathetic, are not in this
case altogether to blame.              It is the indifference of the people them
selves that lies at      the   root    of this neglect of the best popular culture
for a Celtic people         in   a   Celtic     country, and the wholesale adoption
of what is strange          and      artificial.     Much of tho best soul and the
stoutest brawn      of  the     country     has,   we   have already said, been driven
by partial    laws,  and   commercial         selfishness,    and inconsiderate pleasure-
hunting,    into   a  voluntary        expatriation      ;  while     tho few that remain,
often  the   feeblest   and     most    spiritless,     must   be    content     to look up to
their  Saxon     masters     to   feed    them    and    to  clothe     them,    rather     than to
their  Celtic    ancestors     to   inspire    them   ;  and,   so   far   as  this   is  the  case,
there  is small   hope    for   them.      Where     the   Celtic   soul,    by an   unfortunate
conspiracy of external circumstances and selfish agencies, has been
pumped out of them, it cannot be the business of the School Boards to
pump it in again. Where sparks of the grand old fire still remain, their
only resource seems to be that they should form voluntary districtual
associations for the preservation of patriotic culture and sentiment and
music, after the example of what has recently been done in Eogart,
Sutherland, by that most intelligent and manly Celt, John Mackay,
Swansea.      No small people, under the daily influence of strong currents
of denationalising electricity from a people on a higher social plat
form, can hope to rescue its individuality without a manly determi
nation to do so. Here SELF-HELP is the only help ; and UNION under
courageous leaders the only form that efficient help can assume.

                  The Land Systems      of England and of Ireland.
  I  HAVB undertaken      to address    you to-night on the land-systems of
   England and of Ireland, that is,     on the distinctive and typical features
  which characterise them among the land systems of the world.                Such
  a study is especially interesting at the present moment, when radical
  changes in the Irish land system are actually under the consideration
  of Parliament, and the English land-system itself may be said to be
  on its trial.    But the rules of this Institution do not permit me to
  discuss English or Irish land questions in the political or controversial
  sense.    We are mainly concerned to-night with the past and present
  aspects   of the English and Irish land systems ; the future develop
  ment of those land systems rests with the Legislature, and the mem
  bers of this Institution have little reason to envy their responsibility.
      I. The land systems of England and of Ireland have a common
 historical    origin.    Modern researches have shown that in both
 countries the earliest form of agrarian constitution was a tribal
 settlement, or village community, representing a clan or group of
 kindred families.      It is needless here to dwell upon the peculiar and
 minute rules which governed the division and cultivation of land in
 this primitive society, which are still preserved in the so-called
 " Brehon Laws " of Ireland. What is important to note is
                                                                           that it
 left no room for that threefold division of burdens and profits
 between landlords, tenant-farmers, and farm-labourers, which is the
 special mark of the English rural economy.             Every freeman was, in
theory, his own landlord, his own farmer, and his own labourer, and,
except serfs or slaves, there were very few persons who did not form
members of the landed democracy, as it might be properly called.
But the landowners of that day were not peasant proprietors, for
though each was entitled to a lot of his own, he could not be sure of
holding the same piece of ground two years together ; and there were
few, if any, separate enclosures for cattle. By slow degrees, however,
the principle of individual ownership asserted itself.             The chief, or
strongest member, of a clan would obtain larger allotments than
others, and at last get them severed from the common fields ; at the
same time he would claim the lion's share of the waste, and at last
came to treat it as his own property, only subject to rights of
                                                                  2  Q 2

pasturage and turf-cutting.      Meanwhile, other causes were at work
to undermine the landed democracy, and transform it into a landed
aristocracy, under which the village community became the manor,
the greater freeholders became tenants, and the lesser freeholders
sank into the class of villeins or mere labourers.     We must not stop
to investigate the steps by which this remarkable transition was
effected.    Suffice it to say, that it seems to have been completely
effected in most parts of England before the Norman Conquest, and
had been partially, if not completely, effected in Ireland, when it
passed under the rule of Henry II. a century later.
     During the Middle Ages, the land systems of both countries were
profoundly modified by the introduction of feudal tenures. Not that
feudal tenures, with all their well-known incidents, were substituted
all at once for the old national customs by a single act of the
sovereign power. Even in England more than a century elapsed
before feudalism was fully established, and even then it was subject
to important exceptions in Kent and elsewhere. As for Ireland, the
greater part of the island remained outside the dominion of English
law until the reign of Henry VIII. Tor some little time after the
Conquest, an attempt was made to extend the new institution of
judicial assizes over the whole country, and Magna Charta was pro
claimed there as promptly as if Ireland had already formed part of
an United Kingdom.         But, in fact, both English law and English
authority were confined within the boundaries of a few counties,
thence called the English Pale.        These counties at last dwindled
down to four, and even here the old Irish customs of land tenure, as
well as the old Irish manners, had encroached more and more upon
English customs and land tenures. The King of England was not
king, but only " Lord," of Ireland ; but one English army (under
Richard II.) crossed the Irish Channel in the course of three or four
centuries ; and we know, from the works of Edmund Spenser and
Sir John Lavics, that all the strange anomalies of tribal ownership
survived in vast tracts of Ireland up to the end of Elizabeth's reign,
and the beginning of James I.'s reign.
     Still, the feudal system is the real basis of the English and Irish
land laws, as they exist at this moment.        I  must assume that my
audience is sufficiently acquainted with the broad outlines of that
system, which ceased to govern the whole structure of society after
the Reformation, but which continued to regulate the land tenures of
most European countries until after the French Ecvolution.            In
England, it is true, it was otherwise. " Feudal tenures," in the strict
legal sense, were abolished here in the reign of Charles II., but,
perhaps for that very reason, the principles and rules of feudal law
escaped revision here, when they were swept away elsewhere, and
have left an indelible stamp on the distinctive features of the Anglo-
Irish land-system.
     II. These features are five in number :— (1) The law and custom
of Primogeniture, governing the descent and ownership of land.

 1881.]          on the   Land   Systems   of England and of Ireland.       661
    (2) The peculiar nature of family settlements, which convert the
   nominal owner of land into a tenant for life, with very limited powers
   over the estate.     (3) The consequent distribution of landed property
   among    a   comparatively small and constantly decreasing number
   of families.     (4) The direction of cultivation by a class of tenant-
   farmers, usually holding from year to year without the security of a
   lease.  And (5) the dependent condition of the agricultural labourers,
   who are mostly hired by the day or the week, and have seldom any
   interest in the soil.      It is the combination of these features which
   makes the rural economy of England so entirely unique, unlike that
   of any other European country, and still more unlike that of the
  United States or our own colonies. They are often represented as
   the spontaneous growth of our national character and history, coupled
   with the peculiarities of our soil and climate.                I
                                                               think    I
                                                                        shall be
   able to show that such is not the fact — that, in reality, they are
  mainly the result of artificial causes, and that it is quite within the
  province and the power of law to remodel —of course gradually —
  the land systems of England and of Ireland.
       1. Let us first glance at the institution of Primogeniture.          The
  right of the eldest son to inherit all the land, in case of intestacy,
  was not recognised by Roman law, or by any of the primitive codes
  known to us, such as those of the ancient Hindoos, the ancient
  Germans, the Irish, or the Anglo-Saxon.          The Saxon rule of descent,
  as is well known, was that of gavelkind, or equal division ; nor was
  it superseded by the Norman rule of Primogeniture until about the
 year 1200.       It has often been observed that under a charter of
  Henry   I., which seems to have continued in force only five years, the
  eldest son did not succeed to all his father's land, but only to his
  " principal fee," or the chief of several estates. A very similar rule
  still prevails in the Channel Islands, which are virtually fragment  a
 of that Normandy from which England was conquered. This was, in
 fact, the old Norman law, and              was only for military reasons that
                                           it
 William the Conqueror and his successors adopted the strict, and
 absolute law of Primogeniture which has now been firmly established
 in England for nearly seven centuries. After             careful study of the
                                                            a
 subject, am convinced that             this law of Primogeniture which has
       I                            it
                                    is
 produced and kept alive the custom, and that                it not the custom
                                                                  is
 which has perpetuated the law.            Before the law was introduced in
 England, there      is  no reason to believe that any general custom of
 Primogeniture existed in English families.          After the law was swept
 away in America, an equal partition of land became the almost uni
 versal custom, although American testators enjoy almost the same
liberty of making wills that          isallowed in England. Moreover, in
 the case of personal property, where the law           different in England,
                                                        is
the custom      isalso different, and hardly any one thinks of accumulating
all his personalty on one son. Nor must we suppose that because the
law seldom operates directly,         il lias not   avery wide and powerful
operation indirectly.        When    a man    makes    will, or settlement, ho
                                                        a

562                     Hon. George 0. Brodrick                   [May   6,
knows very well, or if ho does not his solicitor tolls him, that all his
land would naturally go by law to his oldest son, and this knowledge,
transmitted from one generation to another for seven hundred years,
creates a sentiment or prejudice in favour of Primogeniture which
nothing but a reversal of the law will effectually counteract. No doubt
 there is much to be said for, as well as against, Primogeniture ; but
for our present purpose the important fact is that Primogeniture,
founded on law and consecrated by custom, is the chief corner-stone
of the English land system.
       2. But the custom of Primogeniture is far more stringent than the
law.      When land descends to an oldest son, on intestacy, it belongs
 to him absolutely, and ho is free to deal with it as he pleases.       On
 the other hand, when it comes to him under a will or a settlement, it
 usually comes to him for life only, and must afterwards go to his
 eldest son, whether ho pleases or not.         This is the consequence of
 certain legal refinements devised in the seventeenth century, whereby
 it is possible for a grandfather to ordain beforehand that his eldest
 grandson, as yet nuborn, arid who may turn out the most worthless
 or the most exemplary of mankind, shall inherit a particular estate,
 making his son only a life tenant or
                                              " limited owner." Under the
  older entails of the Middle Ages this was impossible, and though
  similar powers of tying up land wore acquired by the landed aristo
  cracy in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, means were found to
  defeat them, so that in the sixteenth and first half of the seventeenth
  centuries the ownership of land was far more free than it now is.
  At present, the great mass of land in this country is under settle
  ment, and land under settlement is land which has not, and perhaps
  never may have, a real owner.           The apparent owner of a great
  family   estate is nothing  but  a trustee, and though of late something
  has been done to give him more liberty of action, he is hampered at
  every turn by the necessity of obtaining consents from a number of
  different parties, or perhaps from the Court of Chancery.         Suppose
  all these consents to be obtained, he may doubtless improve or even
  sell the property ; but what motive has he to do so, when he cannot
  reap the fruit of the improvements or become master of the purchaso-
  money?        Indeed, the evils of limited ownership are so obvious,
  especially from an economical point of view, that no one would venture
  to defend it,    but that
                         it   is   supposed to keep old family properties
  from being broken up.        But then the question arises whether this is
   altogether an advantage.      The character of the English gentry and
   aristocracy was formed before limited ownership was known, and
   when estates descended from father to son either in fee simple, or
   under the old rule of entail, which allowed of their being instantly
   converted into fee simple estates.       In those days, family properties
   were placed under the guardianship, not of conveyancers, but of the
   families themselves, and the nation was content that      if   they came
   into, the possession     of degenerate heirs they should bo sold and
 "purchased by worthier competitors.           Even now such cases occur,

1881.]      on the  Land  Systemt  of England and of Ireland.              563
where a family property is ruined by one or two spendthrift limited
owners in succession.      Experience amply shows that, in such cases,
it generally changes hands for the better, notwithstanding the loss of
ancestral connection. .The new purchaser may be comparatively
ignorant of country life, but he is not encumbered by rent-charges of
indefinite duration, by mortgages contracted to pay off his father's
debts, by dynastic traditions       of estate-management,      by the silly
family pride    which   must   needs  emulate   the   state of   some richer
predecessor, by   the passion for political dictation   to which   the refusal
of leases is so frequently due, or by the supposed necessity of satis
fying the supposed expectations of the neighbourhood.                 Ho can
provide for his widow and younger children by selling off portions of
the property, if he pleases, instead of charging the estate, and in the
meantime he can develope the resources of the property, without
feeling that ho is either compromising or unjustly enriching an
eldest son.   These advantages make themselves felt even when the
new purchaser is surrounded with great settled estates and influenced
by (lie example of their possessors.      But they might be expected to
make themselves far more conspicuously            felt if all landowners
enjoyed the same freedom of disposition.
    3. The inevitable tendency of a land system thus founded on
Primogeniture, and guarded by family settlements, is to prevent the
dispersion of land, and to promote its concentration in a few hands.
Settled estates seldom como into the market, and, when they do, the
money has generally to be reinvested in laud ; but there is nothing
to prevent a rich life-tenant from increasing the size of his property,
and this is constantly happening.        A very large number of farm
houses in England are really ancient manor houses, formerly the
residence of squires and yeomen, whose little freeholds have been
gradually absorbed into the princely territories of the landed aris
tocracy, and whose descendants are settled in the neighbouring towns.
Of course, we must not forget the opposite movement, or counter-
migration of retired tradespeople into the country ; but they seldom
take root there ; they do not look upon their villas as homes, they
count for nothing in a county, and their children are usually re-
absorbed into the town population.
    Upon the whole, it may be stated with certainty that the number
of agricultural landowners in England was never so small, as the
population was never so large, as it now is. It would appear from
Domesday Book that in the reign of William the Conqueror the soil
of England was divided among about 170,000 landowners, including
more than 100,000 villeins, as well as above 50,000 freeholders.
There is no direct mode of estimating the number of landowners
between that age and our own, but there is a vast body of indirect
evidence pointing to the conclusion that in the reign of Elizabeth, for
instance, petty squires, yeomen, and small freeholders occupied a
much larger space in the community than they do at present. Even
since the compilation of the ' New Domesday Book,' in 1876, there is

 564                      Hon. George C. Brodrick                [May 6,
great difficulty in ascertaining the exact actual number of English
landowners ; but, after devoting much attention to the subject, with the
able assistance of Mr. John Bateman,      I have arrived at an approxi
mate result.     I believe that, excluding the holders of less than one
acre, there are now about 150,000 landowners in England and Wales,
while about 2250 persons own together nearly half the enclosed land
in England and Wales.        Considering that England and Wales now
contain a population of more than 20,000,000, and did not contain
above 2,000,000 in the reign of William the Conqueror, the proportion
of landowners to population is now less than one-tenth of what it
then was, and, what is still more striking, nearly half of all the land
belongs to a mere fraction — about 1£ per cent. — of all the existing
landowners, even excluding those below one acre.
     It would be superfluous to point out the political danger involved
in this distribution of landed property, which contrasts most strongly
with that which exists in foreign countries. For instance, in Trance,
before the loss of Alsace and Lorraine, there were about 5,000,000
proprietors owning about 1\ acres each, on the average ; about
500,000 proprietors owning 75 acres each, on the average ; and about
60,000 proprietors owning 750 acres each, on the average.             In
Wurtemberg, there are some 280,000 peasant owners, with less than
five acres each, and about 160,000 proprietors of estates above five
acres.    No doubt, this extreme subdivision is, to a great extent, the
result of the Code Napoleon, under which at the death of a proprietor
all his land is divided equally among his children, except one child's
portion, which is left at his own disposal.     On the other hand, the
extreme aggregation of land in England is no less the result, and the
foreseen result, of Primogeniture and settlement.       It is not merely
that, under the law of Primogeniture, a great estate which may have
been formed out of many small estates goes to one child, instead of
being subdivided among several ; nor is it only that settlements
prevent family estates from being diminished, while they do not
prevent them being increased. It is also that Primogeniture and
family settlements have created a landed aristocracy under the cold
shadow of which a true yeomanry, like the old English, cannot
flourish.   It is too much to say that the old yeomen have been
crushed out by powerful neighbours.        Many have sold their patri
monies because they were in debt, or because they found that by
getting a fancy price from some great nobleman or millionaire they
could improve their incomes and the expectations of their families.
But it is still more delusive to regard the disappearance of the old
English yeomanry as the result of natural causes beyond the control
of law. When it is said that land in this country has now become
the luxury of the rich, and that a poor man would bo very foolish to
retain a few hundred acres when he could make a profit by selling
them, it is forgotten that in Northern France, Belgium, Holland, and
elsewhere, land fetches a higher prico than in England, but that small
proprietors do not die out ; on the contrary, that they are the highest

1881.]        on the Land  Systems   of England and of Ireland.           665
bidders in the land-market.          We must, therefore, look beyond the
fancy price of land for the explanation of the fact that in England
the body of landowners is getting smaller and smaller.                The ex
planation is not far to seek.          The vast preponderance of great
landowners has left the yeoman class no place in county government
or county society. As one yeoman vanishes after another, those who
survive, feeling themselves more and more isolated, and missing the
neighbourly fellowship of past generations, are drawn insensibly into
country towns, until at last the rural population of English counties
may be said to consist of three elements, and three only, landlords,
tenant-farmers, and labourers.
      <t. This leads us to consider the fourth distinctive     feature of the
English land system — the direction of cultivation by a class of tenant-
farmers usually holding from year to year, without the security of a
lease.     For the great bulk of the land in these islands, as is well
known, is cultivated, not by the owners, but by this intermediate class,
numbering between 500,000 and 600,000 farmers in Great Britain,
who hold on the average 56 acres each.          It is not thus in other coun
tries, especially in the most civilised.        There, on the contrary, the
great bulk of the land is cultivated by the owners themselves, most of
whom may be classed with our agricultural labourers rather than with
our tenant-fanners, but form a real peasantry of a class well nigh
extinct in England. For it was not always thus in England itself.
Lord Macaulay believes the small freeholders, whom he estimates at
 160,000, to have greatly outnumbered the tenant-farmers in the reign
of Charles II., and there is good reason to believe that English farms
 were commonly held under lease until the period of the French war
 at the end of the last century.         The history of yearly tenancy is
 difficult to trace, but it is certain that it was very much encouraged
                                "             "
 by the long continuance of war prices           which made landlords very
 nnwilling to part with the immediate control of their properties, and
 by their desire to maintain political influence over their tenants. The
late agricultural depression has operated in the same direction, inclin
 ing landlords to keep farms at their disposal until rents improve, and
 inclining tenants to rely on the forbearance of landlords under
 yearly tenancy, rather than
                                  " hang a lease round their necks," as they
 say.     On the other hand, the want of security incident to a mere
 yearly tenancy, and especially the want of security for a farmer's
 improvements, have been very much felt and discussed of late. Un
 happily, it has not led to a revival of leases, but to attempts to bolster
 up the unstable system of yearly tenancy. One of these attempts was
 embodied in the Agricultural Holdings Act of 1875, to extend which
 is the object of two Bills introduced this year. Such measures may be
 described as tending to establish a national system of tenant-right,
 and this would certainly be a great advance on mere yearly tenancy,
 but it would be a very poor substitute for leases, and no substitute at
 all for ownership.
      5. We now come to the fifth distinctive feature of the English land

566                      Hon. George C. Brodrick                [May  6,
system — the dependent condition of the agricultural labourer. During
the Middle Ages, English labourers, whether freemen or serfs, had
always been essentially peasants, that is, occupiers of land which they
cultivated in spare hours for their own benefit, and from which they
could not be displaced, so long as they rendered certain customary
services or paid their rent.     With the growth of the commercial
spirit, the suppression of monasteries, the general rise of prices, and
the progress of enclosure, a new era set in, and the poor-law of
Elizabeth finally transformed the old English peasant into the modern
English agricultural labourer, who lives on weekly wages, never owns
land, and seldom holds any beyond a small garden or allotment, look
ing upon the workhouse as his natural refuge in old age. Probably
he is better housed and clothed than his mediaeval ancestor, though it
is doubtful whether he is better fed, if we take into account the exor
bitant price of meat in these days. But he is certainly less inde
pendent, and, notwithstanding the spread of education, he must still be
ranked below a great part of the continental peasantry — not to speak
of American farmers — in the scale of civilisation.
     III.  Let us now consider how far these distinctive features of tho
English land system apply to Ireland.
     1, 2. Of course, the law of succession to land and the practico of
family settlements are the same in both countries, though Primogeni
ture was not established in the Celtic parts of Ireland until after the
great confiscations of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.    Even
now, it is not so deeply rooted in Irish as in English popular senti
ment. The yeomen and small proprietors who still survive in somo
English counties generally " make eldest sons," but Irish tenant-
farmers, who have long been wont to deal with their farms as if they
were their own, often leave them by will to their widows, and usually
make a liberal provision out of them for younger sons and daughters.
     3. But, however this may be, the landowning class, under the
operation of Primogeniture and entail, has become even smaller in
Ireland than in England — smaller, not only absolutely, but relatively.
Speaking broadly, we may say that all Ireland is divided among
about 20,000 proprietors, and that by far the greater part is owned by
about 10,000 proprietors, of whom most are Protestant and of English
descent, while many of the largest are absentees.      This contrast be
tween 20,000 or 10,000 owners and more than half a million occu
piers, must never be forgotten in a survey of Irish rural economy. It
is of course partly the result of conquest and confiscation — great
 tracts of land having been allotted to any soldier or adventurer wil
ling to settle in the country. It partly arises also from the want of
trade and manufactures in Ireland, which reduces the number of
people able and willing to purchase land, for the purpose of improving
 their social position.  But there can be no doubt that it mainly arises
from the operation of Primogeniture and entail, keeping the Owner
 ship of Irish land in the hands of men unconnected with Ireland,
many of whem, if free trade in land had been established, would have

1881.]      mi the   Land   Systems   of England and of Ireland.          567
 sold their estates long ago to the occupying tenants.         This has actu
 ally been done under the Irish Church Act, and to a less extent under
 the Irish Land Act of 1870, which have added about 5000 to the
 number of small Irish proprietors.       Probably more occupiers would
 have availed themselves of the facilities granted by these Acts, if they
 had not been taught by agitators that, by waiting a little while, they
would get the land for nothing.
      4. But the greatest distinction between the Irish and English land
 system is in the relation between landlord and tenant,— partly in the
 laws which regulate    it, but mainly in the customs and ideas which
 influence it. Let us briefly notice some of the circumstances which
 have brought about this great difference in customs and ideas.
      The greater part of Ireland never adopted feudal institutions as a
 whole, and, where they were adopted, the feudal lord was not the
 friend and protector of his tenant, as in England, but was constantly
 regarded as an alien intruder.        Again, though the feudal law of
 landlord and tenant was ultimately established in Ireland,          it  was
 more favourable to the landlord and less favourable to the tenant,
 than in England.      Nevertheless, for two centuries and     a   half after
 the English poor-law was established, there was no poor-law in
 Ireland, so that small tenants naturally held on to the laud for bare
 life, having no other means of subsistence.
      Meanwhile the respect for property, that            for the landlord's
                                                         is,
 rights, as distinct from the tenant's, was very much weakened by the
 differences of religion, and by the demoralising effect of the penal
 laws. It was further weakened by the fact that so many Irish laud-
 lords entirely neglected their duties, and left all improvements,
 including the erection of farm-buildings, to be executed by their
 tenants, while they contented themselves with receiving their rents.
Of course, the case was aggravated where the landlord, as often
happened, was an absentee.         No liberality on the part of an agent
can supply the want of that kindly intercourse between the hall and
the cottage, which binds classes together in an English village, but
of which Irish farmers and labourers have little experience. No
wonder that Irish tenants should thus grow up in the belief that the
soil was theirs, and the rent only the landlord's.
      We cannot do justice to the agrarian movement in Ireland, or
appreciate the deeper causes to which            owes its origin, without
                                                it
placing ourselves in the position of        a  representative Irish tenant
before the Act of 1870, and striving to interpret the feelings which
underlay his fierce hatred of landlordism,          hatred which even the
                                                     a
remedial legislation of that year has failed to appease.            We shall
afterwards be far better able to appreciate the still more sweeping
reforms which are now in contemplation.

twenty acres of land, including several acres of rough pasturage for
the cows; of which the poorest Irish family generally manages to keep

one or two, with very humble pretension to breed, yet frequently
yielding a large supply of milk. Ho was born upon the land which
he cultivates, if not in the cabin which he inhabits.        Sometimes the
little farm lies compactly round its steading ; more often it is scattered
about in irregular patches, or stretches in a long narrow strip from a
hillside down towards a stream or marshy bottom. It is tilled by the
farmer himself, with the aid of his son or nephews, and occasionally
of an obliging neighbour, but in most cases, without recourse to hired
labour.    Perhaps his ancestors, in far-off times, were entered on the
sept-roll as possessors of this very plot, which has been tenanted ever
since by his family, though repeated confiscations may have effaced
the memory of its superior lords before the last century, and its last
purchaser may have acquired it under a sale in the Encumbered
Estates Court.      Perhaps it was painfully won from the adjoining
waste by    his  father  or himself, either in the capacity of a mere
squatter,  or under  a  verbal arrangement with the agent that no rent
should bo exacted for a certain number of years. However this may
be, and whether its present occupant inherited k or reclaimed it by
his own industry, all that has made it a home for him was created by
himself or his kindred, nor is it possible for him to regard it as the
sole property of a stranger.        Every piece of stonework upon                it,

collector of rent.    His rent is  not high,  it   true, being little above
                                                   is
the Government valuation, and far less than some insolvent and reck
less neighbour would undertake to pay if the farm were put up for
competition.     His landlord, too, is   akind-hearted man, in his way,
never raising  a   tenant's rent twice in one lifetime, and willing to
make abatements in hard seasons, but seldom resident, and cut off
from his sympathy by the iron barriers of race and religion.            The
genial influence of  a    good English squire, who devotes himself to
county business, takes an interest in the parish school, directs his
own improvements, and visits his labourers' cottages,         something of
                                                             is
which he cannot even conceive. No one ever threatened him with
eviction, or informed him directly that in such         acase he must not
look for compensation. The idea of eviction and its consequences,
however, is   always present to his mind.      He remembers that, after
the great famine, scores of little cabins disappeared from the moun
tain-side opposite, and that nothing was ever heard again of their
former inmates. It has been reported to him that in the next
county vast grazing-farms have been formed out of holdings like
his own, and that the experiment has been financially successful. He
read only the other day    a   paragraph in the newspapers advertising
for sale just such an estate as his landlord's, and describing            asit
greatly under-rented and suitable for pasture. Ho           is
                                                             aware, indeed,

 that here and there a good landlord compelled to part with a portion
 of his property, has granted leases beforehand to old tenants, and
 thereby protected their equitable rights against the purchaser.              But
 be believes such magnanimity to be very rare, and dares not count
 upon it himself, especially as he is told that since tenant-right has
 come to mean downright confiscation, proprietors must get their
 estates so far as possible into their own hands.          He lives, therefore,
 from hand to mouth, as his fathers lived before him, tilling no more
  land than he can till with one horse and without machinery, never
  laying out a penny that he can help, studiously keeping up the
 appearance of poverty, and hoarding the little profits of his scanty
 crops and butter in an old stocking, till he can lodge them clandes
  tinely in a bank, not too near, for the marriage portions of his
  daughters.     It is vain to assure him that he may safely rely on the
  honour of an individual who may die to-morrow, or sell to a Dublin
 speculator, or be driven into a system of rack-renting by the pressure
 of his creditors.      Why, he asks, should not the law secure to me an
 indefeasible right of possession, so long as      I pay a fair rent, if this is
 what    I may fairly expect from my landlord's sense of justice ? Why
 should    I  be left absolutely at his mercy, and my children at the
  mercy of those who may succeed him, if it be admitted that it would
 be an abuse of power to confiscate my improvments, or even to
 disturb my occupancy ? *
      Such was the actual position of a representative Irish tenant
 before the Act of 1870, and such, in spite of the Act, is still the
 sentiment of a representative Irish tenant.       For while the Act placed
 a heavy penalty on " disturbance," it laid no effectual restriction on
 the increase of rent. Moreover, as we are reminded, in the report of
 Lord Bessborough's Commission, " what the aggrieved tenant wants,
 in nearly all cases, is not to be compensated for the loss of his farm,
 but to be continued in its occupancy at a fair rent."
      5. The case of the Irish labourer has received less attention than
 it deserves. He is somewhat roughly defined, in the Report of Lord
 Bessborough's Commission, as
                                        " a farmer who is without a
                                                                           farm."
 In other words, there is hardly such a thing in Ireland as an
 independent class of agricultural labourers.             Most of those so
 described in the Census are small farmers working in spare hours, or
 sons of tenant-farmers, or perhaps men who have been turned out of
 farms for non-payment of rent. In the west of Ireland, however, and
 especially in Connanght, there are thousands of cottier tenants living
 on patches of land incapable of supporting a family, even if they were
 held rent-free, who eke out a livelihood by going over to England or
 Scotland for harvest, and returning with their wages, on which they
 mainly subsist during the winter. The misery of these poor creatures

     * This description of the Irish farmer has been extracted, with little varia
tion, from an Essay on the Irish Land question in 1870, published in Brodrick's
' Political Studies,' 1879.

onlyto find their own potato crops destroyed by               the blight, was
among the main causes of the late agrarian agitation         in Ireland. The
leaders of the Land League seized eagerly upon         it,
                                                         and the crusade

over all Ireland.

land, they do not enjoy the same privilege of receiving outdoor relief
as in most English counties.      Now, although    a" liberal " system of
outdoor relief is   a very doubtful boon to labourers, since      tends to

only given to able-bodied men in the workhouse, such ideas have
actually propagated themselves with fearful rapidity.             For the
evicted cottier in Ireland can seldom find work in towns his only   ;
resource, except the workhouse,        emigration — which he considers

banishment — to England or the United States.
     IV. We have now passed in review, however briefly, the distinctive
and typical features of the English and Irish land systems.           have
                                                                        I

expected   to follow.
     Speaking first of England,      desire to express my earnest con
                                      I
viction that no reforms of the English land system are likely to be
permanent or beneficial which arc not in harmony with the organic
and apparently indestructible elements of our national character.
The new rural economy of England must, above all, be essentially
and thoroughly English. It cannot be modelled upon that of France,
or Germany, or Russia, or Switzerland, or Italy, or Belgium, or the
United States.      On the other hand, we must beware, once more, of
imagining that all the distinctive features of the English land system
must needs be the spontaneous growth of the national character and
history.    We know, on the contrary, that in Saxon times the agrarian
constitution of England was essentially democratic      ; that in Norman
times ecclesiastics rather than barons were the pioneers of agricultural
improvement, and the models of territorial benevolence that in the

indigenous product of the soil, but an artificial creation of feudal

lawyers, matured by their successors in the evil days after the
Restoration, largely modified by such temporary causes as the high
prices current during the Great War, and afterwards strengthened by
a constant flow of population towards great towns, partly consequent
on the operation of the land system itself.
      I will not conceal my belief that, before another generation has
elapsed, the law of Primogeniture will have been abolished, that the
power of entail will have been largely restricted, that by these means
and by simpler methods of land transfer land will come to be divided
among a larger number of owners, that, by degrees, more landlords
 will farm their own land, and more farmers will own the land which
 they cultivate, that leases will more and more be substituted for
yearly tenancy, and that labourers, no longer divorced from the soil,
but enabled to rise by industry into the class of farmers, will regain
the self-respect and providence which are the special virtues of a truo
peasantry.
      I will venture to read you a passage in which          I endeavoured, a
few years ago, to group together some of the effects likely to result
from such a movement, and especially from the extension of the
territorial aristocracy.*
      " We may rest assured that no sudden or startling change would
be wrought by so moderate a reform of the land system in the charac
teristic features of English country life.       There would still be a squire
 occupying    the    great  house  in most  of  our villages, and this squire
 would generally be the eldest son of the last squire, though he would
 sometimes be a younger son of superior merit or capacity, and some
 times a wealthy and enterprising purchaser from the manufacturing
districts.    Only here and there would a noble park be deserted or
 neglected for want of means to keep it up and want of resolution to
 part with it ; but it is not impossible that deer might often be replaced
 by equally picturesque herds of cattle; that landscape gardening
 and ornamental building might be carried on with less contempt for
 expense ; that hunting and shooting might be reduced within the
 limits which satisfied our sporting forefathers; that some country
 gentlemen would be compelled to contract their speculations on the
turf, and that others would have less to spare for yachting or for
amusement at Continental watering-places.            Indeed, it would not be
 surprising if greater simplicity of manners, and less exclusive notions
 of their own dignity, should come to prevail even among the higher
 landed gentry, leading to a revival of that free and kindly social
intercourse which made rural neighbourhoods what they were in the
 olden times. The peculiar agricultural system of England might
 remain, with its threefold division of labour, between the landlord
 charged with the public duties attaching to property, the farmer con
 tributing most of the capital and all the skill, and the labourer
relieved by the assurance of continuous wages from all risks except

that of illness.   But the landlords would be a larger body, containing
fewer grandees and more practical agriculturists, living at their
country homes all the year round, and putting their savings into land,
instead of wasting them in the social competition of the metropolis.
The majority of them would still be eldest sons, many of whom, hew
ever, would have learned to work hard till middle life for the support
of their families ; and besides these there would be not a few younger
sons who had retired to pass the evening of their days on little pro
perties near the place of their birth, either left them by will or bought
out of their own acquisitions.     With these would be numbered other
elements in far larger measure and greater variety than at present —
 wealthy capitalists eager to enter the ranks of the landed gentry ;
merchants, traders, and professional men content with a country villa
and a hundred freehold acres around it ; yeomen farmers, who had pur
chased the fee simple of their holdings from embarrassed landlords,
and even labourers who had worked their way upwards and seized
favourable chances of investing in land.        Under such conditions, it is
 not too much to expect that some links, now missing, between rich
and poor, gentle and simple, might be supplied in country districts ;
                                           "
 that " plain living and high thinking might again find a home in
 somo of our ancient manor houses, once the abode of landowners, but
now tenanted by mere occupiers ; that with less of dependence and
subordination to a dominant will, there would be more of true neigh
bourly feeling, and even of clanship ; and that posterity, reaping the
happy fruits of greater social equality, would marvel, and not without
cause, how the main obstacle to greater soci.il equality — the law and
custom of Primogeniture — escaped revision for more than two centuries
after the final abolition of feudal tenures."
      V. Let us lastly turn our eyes, once more, to the Irish land system,
 if that can be called a land system, which is a patchwork of antique
customs and modern enactments, plastered one upon another, with little
 regard to consistency or symmetry.       It is not my purpose to criticise
the policy of the new Irish Land Bill ; it may or may not be a necessary
sequel to the Act of 1870 ; it may be framed in a spirit of justice, or it
may have been dictated by political expediency.      With all this we have
nothing to do. What mainly concerns us is its self-evident tendency to
establish a new form of double ownership, or agrarian partnership
between landlord and tenant. We sometimes hear the great reforms
carried out by Stein and Hardenberg in Prussia cited as a precedent
for such legislation. Exactly the reverse is the fact. The reforms of
Stein and Hardenberg were directed, and successfully directed, to sub
stitute unity of ownership for double ownership —to give the peasant
the greater part of his former holding as his own absolute property,
relieved of all vexatious services ; and to compensate the landlord for
the loss of those services by a fixed allotment of land or by a fixed
rent.    In other words, these reforms substituted proprietorship for
landlordism and tenancy, but left freedom of contract untouched. The
reforms now proposed for Ireland assume the maintenance of the

1881.]        on the Land  Systems  of England and of Ireland.          573
relation between landlord and tenant, but place the regulation of it in
tbo bauds of a Court, and virtually abolish freedom of contract. There
is no rashness in predicting that, under such circumstances, the rela
tion will be found intolerable, and that in the end the same result
at which Stein and Hardenberg deliberately aimed will be produced by
the very opposite process.      Either by the aid of facilities provided in
the Bill itself, or by private agreements, Irish landlords will part
•with their estates in largo numbers, and Irish tenants will be the
nominal purchasers.      Whether, having purchased, they will cultivate
the laud themselves, or convert themselves into squireens, whether
they will keep out of the hands of money-lenders, and whether money
lenders may not become the worst of landlords, and whether those who
chance to be without land just now will tamely acquiesce in their
exclusion from the privileged caste of irremovable tenants — these
are questions into which       I must not wander. What is certain is
that, come what may, the experiment of peasant ownership or
farmer ownership will be tried in Ireland as it has never been tried
before.
     It may be said, with too much reason, that Irish tenants as a class
have never yet exhibited the far-sighted industry which has become
traditional and hereditary among French or Belgian peasants, and upon
which peasant ownership in France or Belgium depends for its success.
It may be said, on the other hand, that Irish tenants are already
their own masters for most purposes, and that the civilising influence
 of country gentlemen with their families is already little felt in the
 great majority of Irish parishes.     The transition from landlordism to
farmer proprietorship would, therefore, be far gentler, and attended
by much less of social change, in Ireland than in England. Nor must
 it bo forgotten that French peasants, as described by Arthur Young a
 hundred years ago, did not differ widely from small Irish farmers in
                                                  "
 the present day.     The " magic of property       has assuredly worked
 miracles in making them what they now are, and the magic of pro
 perty is likely to be more potent in Ireland than in Franco, because it
 would place the now proprietor entirely above the influence of those
 agitators who now trade upon his wrongs, real or imaginary, and
 would give him a direct interest in the maintenance of law and
 order.
      And thus it may come to pass that under the operation of different
 causes — some of them natural and some artificial, some in themselves
 pernicious, and some beneficent — the Irish land system may gravitate
 in the same direction as the English land system, and assume a more
democratic aspect.     Considering the history and national character of
the Irish people, we are not warranted in forecasting with confidence
the result of such a development.       The utmost that we can affirm is
that it affords a better prospect of a stable equilibrium in Ireland than
the modern English form of rural economy. There is a fine passage
in Edmund Spenser's ' View of Ireland,' written in the reign of Queen
 Elizabeth, where he supposes one of two friends to suggest various

remedies for the improvement of Ireland, and puts into the mouth of
the other the following reply :—
     " Marry, so there have been divers good plots devised, and wise
counsels cast already about reformation of that realm ; but they
say it is the fatal destiny of that land, that no purposes, whatsoever
are meant for her good, will prosper or take good effect ; which
whether it proceed from the very genius of the soil, or influence of the
stars, or that Almighty God hath not yet appointed the time of her
reformation, or that He reserveth her in this unquiet state still for
some secret scourge which shall by her come into England, it is hard
to be known but yet much to be feared."
    It would be difficult to express in language more pathetic or appro
priate the anxieties and misgivings which still oppress the most hope
ful minds in legislating for Ireland, after the lapse of three hundred
years. But despair can havo no place in the counsels of statesmen.
It cannot be that Ireland is eternally doomed either by the genius of
her soil, or by the influence of the stars, or by the decrees of an in
exorable Providence, to brood helplessly over her ancient wrongs, an
unprofitable and irreconcilable member of the European family.
There must surely be a happier and better future reserved for her too
in the fulness of time, and this future may be expected to date from
the day on which Parliament shall accomplish, — not a provisional and
one-sided adjustment, but a comprehensive, just, and permanent
settlement, — of the Irish land system.

                            Shakspeare Criticism.
THE speaker began by noticing        some  of  the absurd theories respecting
Shakspeare's life and works.
      Home the historian said : "    If Shakspeare be considered as a man
born in a rude age and educated in the lowest manner, without any
instruction from books or from the world, he may be regarded as a
 prodigy.     If represented as a poet capable of furnishing a proper
 entertainment to a refined or an intelligent audience, we must abate
 much of this eulogy.      A striking peculiarity of sentiment adapted to
a single character he frequently hits, as it were, by inspiration ; but
a reasonable propriety of thought he cannot for any time uphold.
Nervous and picturesque expressions, as well as descriptions, abound
in him ; but it is in vain we look for purity or simplicity of diction."
                                                     "         " Can the present
Goldsmith makes " The Vicar of Wakefield                say,
age be pleased with that antiquated dialect, that obsolete humour,
 those over-charged characters?" Voltaire said 'Hamlet' was "the
 dream of a drunken savage with some flashes of beautiful thoughts."
             *         *          *           *            *          »
      Gervinus truly says that, after two hundred and fifty years of
 commentators' digging, as in a mine, Shakspeare has remained an
 enigma to the literary world.        This is due to a great error. Shak
 speare did not write for studious reading in the closet, but for
 representation on the stage for ordinary understanding.                He often
 wrote carelessly; not at all as if every word and line were to be
 critically discussed. In fact, his plays were at first surreptitiously
 printed, which was considered injurious to his reputation.
             *         »          *           *            *          *
      After reading some of Mr. Pepys's amusing comments on the
renewed performance of Shakspeare at the Eestoration in 1660, Mr.
 Pollock gave specimens of the sacrilegious manner in which the
              ******
 plays had been dealt with by Davonant, Dryden, and others in the
seventeenth century.       He referred especially to ' liomeo and Juliet,'
as dealt with by Otway, in which are striking examples of the " art
of sinking," and also to the Duke of Buckingham's alterations of
 '
   Julius  Caesar.'
                                                        '           '
      Mr. Pollock then read the story on which            Hamlet was founded,
from Saxo-Grammaticus,         the Danish       historian, to show the way

678                           Mr. Walter H. Pollock                  [May 20,
in which Shakspeare's genius ennobled his crude materials, after
which he discussed some of the criticisms and comments on ' Hamlet,"
as an example of the way in which the poet had been dealt with.
     "In Warburton," writes Gervinus, "in Johnson, and in Steevens
(the most intelligent of all) there are excellent explanations of certain
passages, traits, and characters which burst forth amid prejudices and
false judgment, as proofs of how the greatness of the poet prevailed
more and more even over the narrow minds of their criticisera.             In
accordance with this partial investigation and with these passing
flashes of perception, alternating           with greater darkness, was the
treatment of Shakspeare on the stage both in Germany and England.
The jubilee, two hundred years after Shakspeare's birth, celebrated in
Stratford-on-Avon       in 1764, denotes about the time when the poet's
works were revived by Garrick on the English stage." It may be
well to remark, what Gervinus merely alludes to at this point, that
           representations were very far from being, — apart from his
own acting, — what would satisfy any critical audience nowadays. The
alterations to which Gervinus presently alludes were often of a most
disastrous kind, notably in the case of the complete excision of the
gravediggers in ' Hamlet.'        It is a minor point that Garrick played
Shakspeare's      characters   in the  costume of his own (Garrick's) time,
according   to    the then   universal  custom.   The German critic goes on
to assert, and it might be difficult to quarrel with the assertion, that
"the man who first valued Shakspeare according to his full desert
was indisputably Lessing.           With all the force of a true taste, he
pointed to Wieland's translation of the English dramatist when
scarcely any one in Germany knew him."            Lessing, it will be remem
bered, was born in 1729 and died in 1781, and it can hardly be
doubted that, as Gorvinus says, his influence in Germany caused a
reaction in England, until " when Nathan Drake in 1817 published
his ample work upon ' Shakspeare and his Times' the idolatry of the
poet had passed already to his native land." It is a pity that Gervinus,
who goes on to dwell with pleasure on the wide-spread interest in
Shakspeare again excited of late years in England, could not see the
artistic homage now paid to him on the stage of what has become our
leading theatre.

     The only modern version of 'Hamlet' which has obtained any
real success on the stage in France was the one written by the great
Dumas, who had a keen appreciation of the genius of Shakspeare,
and who, indeed, was first fired to write for the stage by seeing
Shakspeare's plays represented in Paris by an English company in
English. Upon the arrival of this company, "              I had never read,"
he writes in his memoirs, " one play of the foreign drama. They
put up ' Hamltt.'      I                   '        '
                           only knew the Hamlet of Ducis.       I went to see

the traditions of the stage, it was the imaginary life that art made

stilted heroes with the unfeeling and conventional declamation of
the stage.     I saw Romeo, Virginias, William Tell, Shylock, Othello ;

              ******
library of the foreign stage, and           I   saw that in the world of the
drama all springs from Shakspeare, as in the greater world all springs
from the sun.       I  saw that no writer could be compared with him.
He was as dramatic as Corneille, as comic as Moliere, as daring as
 Caldoron, as thoughtful as Goethe, as passionate as Schiller."
      After commenting on various foreign translations of Shakspeare,
 Mr. Pollock cited the following         as a specimen of some of the very
 strange annotations and translations.            Moratin, the Spanish trans
 lator, in a note says : " They paint now the Omnipotent in the
 act of hurling thunderbolts at man ; indeed it is quite common.
 But to imagine the Almighty discharging a park of artillery at him,
 is certainly something very new ; whilst it should be noted that in
 the time of Hamlet there were neither cannons nor gunpowder."
 This amazing note is explained by the fact that he translates :
                    " Or that the Everlasting had not fixed
                      His canon 'gainst self-slaughter,"
 as  follows :
                    "O  I el  Todopoderoso no asestara
                      El cation contra el homicida de si mismo."
 Later translators substitute fusil (gun) for canon.
      In  conclusion, Mr. Pollock read the beautiful               version of the
  Willow Bong by the elder Dumas.

                          PRESIDENT OP THE CHEMICAL SOOIETT.
                      Indigo, and its Artificial Production.
MORE than eleven years ago the speaker had the pleasure of bringing
before this audience a discovery in synthetic chemistry of great interest
and importance, viz. that of the artificial production of alizarin, the
colouring substance of madder.         To-day it is his privilege to point
out the attainment of another equally striking case of synthesis, viz.
the artificial formation of indigo.       In this last instance, as in the
former case, the world is indebted to German science, although
to different individuals, for these interesting results, the synthesis of
indigo having been achieved by Professor Adolf Baeyer, the worthy
successor of the illustrious Liebig in the University of Munich. Here
then we have another proof of the fact that the study of the most
intricate problems of organic chemistry, and those which appear to
many to be furthest removed from any practical application, are in
reality capable of yielding results having an absolute value measured
by hundreds of thousands of pounds.
     In proof of this assertion, it is only necessary to mention that the
value of the indigo imported into this country in the year 1879
reached the enormous sum of close on two millions sterling, whilst
the total production of the world is assessed at twice that amount ; so
that  if,as iscertainly not impossible, artificial indigo can bo prepared
ata   price which will compete with the native product,       wide field
                                                                     a         is
indeed open to its manufacturers.
     Indigo, as  iswell known,      iscolouring matter which has attracted
                                      a
attention from very early times. Cloth dyed with indigo has been
found in the old Egyptian tombs.           The method of preparing and
using this colour         isaccurately described by both Pliny and
Dioscorides, and the early inhabitants of these islands were well
acquainted with indigo, which they obtained from the European indigo
plant, Isatis tinctoria, the woad plant, or pastel. With this they dyed
their garments and painted their skins. After the discovery of the
passage to India by the Cape of Good Hope, the eastern indigo,
derived from various species of Indigofera, gradually displaced woad,
as containing     more of the colouring matter. But this was not
accomplished without great opposition from the European growers of

wood   ; and severe enactments were promulgated against the introduc
tion of   the foreign colouring matter, an edict condemning to death
                                                                    "
persons " who used that pernicious drug called devil's food being
issued by Henry the Fourth of France.           The chief source of Indian
indigo is the Indigofera tinctoria, an herbaceous plant raised from
seed which is sown in either spring or autumn.             The plant grows
with a single stalk to a height of about three feet six inches, and
about the thickness of a finger. It is usually cut for the first time in
June or July, and a second or even a third cutting obtained later in
the year.      The value of the crop depends on the number of leaves
which the plant puts forth, as it is in the leaves that the colouring
principle is chiefly contained. Both the preparation of the colouring
matter from the plant, and its employment as a dye or as a paint, are
carried on at the present day exactly as they have been for ages past.
 The description of the processes given by Dioscorides and Pliny
tally exactly with the crude mode of manufacture carried on in
 Bengal at the present day as follows :—
     " The Bengal indigo factories usually contain two rows of vats,
 the bottom of one row being level with the top of the other. Each
 series numbers from fifteen to twenty, and each vat is about 7 yards
 square and 3 feet deep ; they are built of brickwork lined with stone
 or cement.     About a hundred bundles of the cut indigo plants are
 placed  in  each  vat in rows, and pressed down with heavy pieces of
 wood; this is essential to the success of the operation.         Water is
 then run in so as to completely submerge the plants, when a fer
 mentation quickly ensues, which lasts from nine to fourteen hours,
 according to the temperature of the atmosphere.         From time to time
 a small quantity of the liquor is taken from the bottom of the vat to
 see how the operation is proceeding.       If the liquor has a pale-yellow
 hue the product obtained from it will be far richer in quality, but not
 so abundant as if it had a golden-yellow appearance.         The liquor is
 then run off into the lower vats, into which men enter and agitate it
 by means of bats or oars, or else mechanically by means of a dash-
 wheel, each vat requiring seventeen or eighteen workpeople, who are
 kept employed for three or four hours. During the operation, the
 yellow liquor assumes a greenish hue, and the indigo separates in
 flakes. The liquor is then allowed to stand for an hour, and the blue
 pulpy indigo is run into a separate vessel, after which it is pumped
 up into a pan and boiled, in order to prevent a second fermentation,
 which would spoil the product by giving rise to a brown matter.
 The whole is then left to stand for twenty hours, when it is again
 boiled for three or four hours, after which it is run on to largo filters,
 which are placed over vats of stonework about 7 yards long, 2 yards
 wide, and 1 yard deep.       The filters are made by placing bamboo
 canes across the vats, covering these with bass mats, and over all
 stretching strong canvas.     The greater part of the indigo remains
 under the form of a dark blue or nearly black paste, which is intro
 duced into small wooden frames having holes at the bottom and

lined with strong canvas.    A piece of canvas is then placed on the
top of the frame, a perforated wooden cover, which fits into the box,
put over      and the whole submitted to
            it,                              gradual pressure. When
                                                 a
as much of the water as possible has been squeezed out the covers
are removed, and the indigo allowed to dry slowly in large drying
sheds, from which light     carefully excluded. When dry,
                           is                                     ready       it   is
for the market. Each vat yields from 36 to 50 Ihs. of indigo." *
    The same process carried out in the times of the Greeks                              is
thus described by Dioscorides    " Indigo used in dyeing
                                    :                            purple       is   a
coloured froth formed at the top of the boiler this      collected and
                                                                    is
dried by the manufacturer      that possessing
                                ;                        u ;
                                                  blue tint and being
brittleis esteemed the most."
    The identity of the blue colouring matter of woad and that of the
Bengal plant was proved by Hellot, and by Planer and Trommsdorff
at the end of the last century.     These latter chemists showed that
the blue colour   of the woad  can be sublimed, and thus obtained in
the pure state,   fact which was first mentioned in the case of indigo
                   a
by O'Brien, in 1789, in his treatise on calico printing. Indigo thus
purified  is   termed indigotin.      It has been analysed by various
chemists, who ascertained that its composition may bo most simply
expressed by the formula C8H5NO.
     Indigo   is   blue powder, insoluble in water, alkalis, alcohol, and
                   a
most common liquids.        In order to employ       it
                                                      as    dyeing agent
                                                               a                         it
must be obtained in    a  form in which    itcan be fixed or firmly held on
to the fibres of the cloth.      This    isalways effected by virtue of a
property possessed by indigo-blue of combining with hydrogen to
form  a   colourless body, soluble in alkalis, known as indigo-white, or
reduced indigo, of which the simplest formula                  is
                                                           C8H6NO.     This
substance rapidly absorbs oxygen from the air and passes into the
blue insoluble indigo, which, being held in the fibre of the cloth,
imparts to   it   permanent blue dye. This reduction to white indigo
                  a
may be effected in various ways.        The old cold vat, or blue-dip vats
as they are termed, consist of      amixture of indigo, slacked lime, and
green vitriol.     The latter salt reduces the indigo, and the white
indigo dissolves in the lime water.       This process of indigo dyeing                  is
both expensive and troublesome, owing to loss of indigo and formation
 of gypsum, so that many plans have been proposed to remedy these
evils.
     Concerning the origin of indigo in the leaves of the Indigofera,
various and contradictory views have been held. Some have supposed
 that blue indigo exists ready formed in the plant        others, that white
                                                               ;
indigo is   present, which   on exposure  to  air   converted into indigo-
                                                     is
 blue.    Schunck     has, however, proved beyond doubt that the
woad plant (Isatis tinctoria), the Indigofera tinctoria of India, and the
 Chinese and Japanese indigo plant (Polygonum tinctorium) contain
neither indigo-blue or white indigo ready formed. It             now known
                                                                         is

1881.]           on Indigo, and its   Artificial Production.             583
that by careful treatment the leaves of all these indigo-yielding
plants can be shown to contain a colourless principle termed iudican,
and that this easily decomposes, yielding a sugar-like body and
indigo-blue.    That white indigo is not present in the leaves is
proved by the fact that this compound requires an alkali to
be present in order to bring it into solution, whereas the sap of
plants is always acid. The decomposition is represented by Schunck
as follows : —
              C26H31N017   + 2H20 =     C8H5NO       +   3C6H1006.
                Indican.                Indigotin.        Indiglucin.
      So readily does this change from indican to indigo take place,
 that bruising the leaf or exposing it to great cold is sufficient to
 produce a blue stain. Even after mere immersion in cold alcohol or
 ether, when the chlorophyll has been removed, the leaves appear
 blue, and this has been taken to show the pre-existence of indigo in
 the plant.    But these appearances are deceptive, for Schunck has
 proved that if boiling alcohol or ether be used, the whole of the
 colour-producing   body as well as the chlorophyll is removed, the
 leaves retaining only a faint yellow tinge, whilst the alcoholic
 extract contains no indigo-blue, but on adding an acid to this liquid
 the indican is decomposed and indigo-blue is formed.
     Passing now to the more immediate subject of his discourse, the
 speaker again reminded his hearers that indigo was the second
natural colouring matter which has been             artificialy prepared ;
 alizarin the colouring matter of the madder-root being the first. As
 a rule, the simpler problems of synthetic chemistry are those to
 which solutions are the soonest found, and these instances form no
exception to the rule.    The synthetic production of indigo is a more
difficult  matter than  the  artificial formation of alizarin, and hence
the speaker did not apologise for leading up to the complex through
 the more simple phenomenon.
     When the ingenious Japanese workman who had never seen a
watch had one given to him with an order to make a duplicate, he
took the only sensible course open to him, and carefully pulled the
watch to pieces, to see how the various parts were connected to
gether.    Having once ascertained this, his task was a comparatively
easy one, for he then had only to make the separate parts, and fit
them together, and he thus succeeded so well in imitating the real
article that no one could tell the difference. So it is with the
chemist, until he knows how the compound is built up, that
until be has ascertained its constitution, any attempt at synthesis          is is,
more like groping in the dark than like shaping the course by
well-known landmarks into harbour.
     In the case of alizarin it  was comparatively easy to reduce      to
                                                                        it
its simplest terms, and to show that the backbone of this colouring
matter   isanthracene CUH10,  a   hydro-carbon found in coal-tar.   This

fact being ascertained, the next step was the further process of
clothing the hydro-carbon by adding four atoms of oxygen and sub
tracting the two atoms of hydrogen present in excess, and this was
soon successfully accomplished, so that now, as wo know, artificial
alizarin has excluded the natural colouring matter altogether.

    What now was the first step gained in our knowledge concerning
the constitution of indigo, of which the simplest formula is C8H6NO ?
    STEP No. 1. — This was made so long ago as 1840, when Fritsche
proved that aniline, C6H5NH2) can be obtained from indigo.         The
name for this now well-known substance is indeed derived from the
Portuguese "anil," a word used to designate the blue colour from
indigo.   This result of Fritsche's is of great importance, as showing
that indigo is built up from the well-known benzene ring C6H6, the
skeleton of all the aromatic compounds, and moreover that it contains
an amido-group.
    STEP No. 2 was also made by Fritsche in the following year,
when, by boiling indigo with soda and manganese dioxide, he obtained
ortho-aniido-benzoic acid, or, as he then termed    anthranilic acid.
                                                                    it,
The following  is  the reaction which hero occurs —            :
          C8H6NO         0                                     +    CH.,0.,.
           Indigo.                         Ortho-amido-benzoic            acid.
    What light does this fact shed upon the constitution of indigo It                 ?
shows (1) that one of the eight atoms of carbon in indigo can be
readily separated from the rest (2) that the carboxyl and the amido-

 1881.]            on Indigo, and its Artificial Production.           585
      STEP No. 3. — The next advance of importance in this some
 what complicated matter is the discovery by Erdmann and Laurent
 independently, that indigo on oxidation yields a crystalline body,
 which, however, possesses no colouring power, to which they gave the
 name of isatin.
                            Indigo.           Isatin.
      STEP No. 4. — The reverse of this action, viz. the reduction
 of isatin to indigo, was accomplished by Baeyer and Emmerling in
 1870 and 1878, by acting with phosphorus pentachloride on isatin,
and by the reducing action of ammonium sulphide on the chloride
 thus formed.
      Understanding now something of the structure and of the re
 lationships of the body which we wish to build up, let us see how
 this edifice has, in fact, been reared.   Three processes have been suc
cessfully employed     for carrying  out this  object. But of these three
only   one  is of practical importance.     A  synthetic process may yield
the wished-for result, but the labour incurred may be too great and
the losses during the campaign may be too severe to render it pos
sible to repeat the operation with advantage on a large scale; just
as it costs, at the usual rate of wages, more than twenty shillings to
wash a sovereign's worth of gold out of the Bhine sands, so that this
employment is only carried on when all other trades fail.
     For the sake of completeness, let us, however, consider all three
processes, although Nos. 1 and 2 are at present beyond the pale of
practical schemes.
     These three processes have certain points in common. (1) They
all proceed from some compound containing the benzene nucleus.
(2) They all start from compounds containing a nitrogen atom.          (3)
They all commence with an ortho-compound.
     They diifer from one another ; inasmuch as process No. 1 starts
from a compound containing seven atoms of carbon (instead of eight),
and to this, therefore, one more atom must be added ; process No. 2, on
the other hand, starts from a body which contains exactly the right
number (eight) of carbon atoms; whilst No. 3 commences with a
compound in which nine atoms of carbon are contained, and from
which, therefore, one atom has to be abstracted before indigo can be
reached.
     Process No. 1 (Kckiilu — Claissen and Shadwell). — So long ago as
1869 Keknle predicted the constitution of isatin, and gave to it the
formula which we now know that it possesses, viz.
                          C6H4

686                       Professor H. E. Boscoe                   [Hay 27,
     Following up this view, Claissen and Shadwell, two of Kekule's
pupils, succeeded in preparing isatin, and, therefore, now indigo, from
ortho-nitro-benzoic acid.
     The following are the steps, in the ascent : — •
     1. Ortho-nitro-benzoic    acid acted on by phosphorus pentachloride
          yields the chloride C6H4(N02)COC1.
     2. This latter heated with silver cyanide yields the nitril C6H.
          (N02)GO.CN.
     3. On heating this with caustic potash it yields ortho-nitro-phenyl-
          glyoxylicacid, C6H4(N02)CO.C02H.
     4. This is converted by nascent -hydrogen into the amido-com-
          pound C6H4(NH2)CO.C02H.
     6. And this loses water and yields isattn, C6H4NH.CO.CO.
                                                              (Q. E. D.)
     The reasons why this process will not work on a large scale are
patent to all those who have had even bowing acquaintance with such
unpleasant and costly bodies as phosphorus pentachloride or cyanogen.
     Process No. 2. — -Baeyer's (1878) synthesis from ortho-nitro-phenyl
acetic acid.
     This acid can be obtained synthetically from toluol, and it is first
converted into the amido-acid, and which, like several ortho-compounds,
loses water, and is converted into a body called oxindol, from which
isatin, and therefore indigo, can be obtained.      The precise steps to be
followed are : —
     1. Ortho-amido-phenylacetic     yields oxindol  :
                                                                     H20.
     2. This on treatment with nitrous acid yields nitrosoxindol      :
     3. This again with nascent hydrogen gives amidoxindol       :

     This process, the feasibility of which had also been foreseen by
Kekule, is however not available as a practical scheme for various
     Process No. 3. — This may be called the manufacturing process, and
•was also proposed by Baeyer.             It starts from cinnamic acid, a substance
contained in gum benzoin, balsam of Peru, and some few other
aromatic bodies. Those sources are, however, far too expensive to
render this acid thus obtained available for manufacturing purposes.
But Bertagnini, in 1856, had obtained cinnamic acid artificially from
oil of bitter almonds, and other processes for the same purpose have
since been carried out.                 Of these, that most likely to be widely
adopted      is   the  following practical modification by Dr. Caro of Mr.
Perkin's beautiful synthesis of cinnamic acid :—
1. C6HSCH3          +   4C1 = C6H6CHC12         + 2HC1.
     Toluene.                    Benzylene dichloride.
2. C«H5CHC12          +2CH3 . CO . 0 . Na = C6H6CH=CH              . CO . OH. +2Nacl.
      Benzylene            Sodium acetate.               Cinnamic  acid,
      dichloride.
     But why did Baeyer select this nine-carbon                   acid from which to
prepare     indigo    ?   For   this  he  had  several  reasons.     In the first place,
it had long been known that all indigo compounds when heated with
zinc-dust yield indol, C8H,N, a body which stands therefore to indigo
in the same relation as anthracene to alizarin, and Baeyer and
Emmerling had so long ago as 1869 prepared this indol from ortho-
nitro-cinnamic acid thus: —
                                            =   C8H,N + 02 + C02.
                     C8H6(N02)C02H
     Secondly, the ortho-nitro-cinnamic                acid required (for we must
remember that indigo is an ortho-compound                         and also contains
nitrogen) can be readily prepared from cinnamic acid, and this itself
again can be obtained on a largo scale.                   Thirdly, this acid readily
parts with one atom of carbon, and thus renders possible its conversion
into eight-carbon indigo.
      The next steps in the process are (3) the formation of ortho-
 nitro-cinnamic acid, (4) the conversion of this into its dibromide, (5)
the separation from this of the two molecules of hydrobromic

588                          Professor    H. E. Roscoe                    [May  27,
acid, giving rise to ortho-nitro-phenyl-propiolic acid, and (6), and
lastly, the conversion of this latter into indigo by heating its alkaline
 solution with grape sugar, xanthate of soda, or other reducing agent.
 These reactions are thus represented :—
     8. C6H6CH=CHCOOH                         CH^NOJCHITCH.COOH.
              Cinnamic  acid       yields      Ortho-nitro-cinnamic acid.
     In this   process the para-acid is also obtained, and as this is
nseless for the manufacture of indigo, it has to be removed.                   This
is effected by converting the acids into their ethyl ethers, which,
 possessing different degrees of solubility, can be readily separated
 from one another.
     4. This is next converted into the dibromide
                       C6H4(N02)CHBr . CHBrCOOH.
     5. And by careful treatment with caustic          soda   this yields ortho-
nitro-phenyl-propiolic acid, thus : —
        C6H4(N02)CHBrCHBrCOOH                 + 2NaOH =
                              O.H^NCgO2 . COOH + 2NaBr + 2H 20.
     6. n[C6H4(N02)C2 . COOH + H2 = C8H6NO +CO,                    + H20].
          Orthe-nitro-phenyl-propiolic acid.          Indigotin.
                                                                    (Q.E.D.)
     The last of   these reactions    is in reality not  so simple as the equa
tion indicates.      For only about       40 per cent. of indigo is obtained,
whereas according to theory 68 per cent, should result.                     Indeed,
although, as we have seen, indigo can be prepared by these three
methods, chemists are as yet in doubt as to its molecular weight, tho
probability being that the molecule of indigo contains twice 16
atoms of carbon, or has the formula 4(08H6N0) or C^Ha^O*.
Still it must   be remembered that according to Sommaruga the vapour
density of indigo is 9 45, a number corresponding to the simpler
                             •
formula C16H10N2O8.
     The artificial production of indigo may even now be said to bo
within measurable distance of commercial success, for the ortho-nitro-
phenyl-propiolic acid, the colourless substance which on treatment
with a reducing agent yields indigo-blue, is already in the hands of
the Manchester calico printers, and is furnished by the Baden
Company for alkali and anilino colours at the price of 6s. per lb. for
a paste containing 25 per cent. of the dry acid.
     With regard to the nature of the competition between the artificial
and the natural colouring matters it is necessary to say a few words.
In the first place, the present price at which the manufacturers nro
ablo to sell their propiolic acid is 50s. per kilo. But 100 parts of
this can only yield, according to theory, 68 • 58 parts of indigo-blue,

1881.]           on Indigo, and its  Artificial Production.            589
so that the price of the artificial (being 73s. per kilo.) is more than
twice that of the pure natural colour.        Hence competition with the
natural dye-stuff is not to be thought of until the makers can reduce
the price of dry propiolic acid to 20*. per kilo., and also obtain a
theoretical yield from their acid. This may, or it may not, be some
day accomplished, but at present it will not pay to produce indigo
from nitro-phenyl-propiolio acid. Nevertheless a large field lies open
in the immediate future for turning Baeyer's discovery to practical
account. It is well known that a great loss of colouring matter
occurs in all the processes now in use for either dyeing or printing
with indigo.    It has already been stated that a large percentage of
indigo is lost in the
                       " cold vats " in the sediment. Another portion
is washed off and wasted after the numerous dippings, whilst in order
to produce a pattern much indigo must bo destroyed before it has
entered into the fibre of the cloth.    Moreover, the back of the piece
is uselessly loaded with colour. In the processes of printing with
indigo the losses are as great, or even greater, and, in addition, such
considerable difficulties are met with that only a few firms (Potter,
Grafton in Manchester, and Schlieper in Elberfeld) have been suc
cessful in this process. But a still more important fact remains, that
no printing process exists in which indigo can be used in combination
with other colours in the ordinary way, or without requiring some
special mode of fixing after printing.        Hence it is clear that the
weak points of natural indigo lie in the absence of any good process
for utilising the whole of its colouring matter, and in the impossibility,
or at any rate, great difficulty of employing it in the ordinary madder
styles of calico printing.     Such were the reasons which induced the
patentees to believe that although the artificial dyo cannot be
made at a prico to compete         with natural indigo for use in the
ordinary dye-beck, it can evon now be very largely used for styles
to which the ordinary dye-stuff is inapplicable.
    To begin with, Baeyer employed (Patent 1177) grape sugar as a
reducing agent. The reduction in this case does not take place in the
cold, and even on long standing only small tracos of indigo aro
formed, but if heated to 70° or upwards the change takes place.
Unfortunately, this production of indigo-blue is rapidly followed by
its reduction to indigo-white, and it is somewhut difficult in practice
to stop the reaction at the right moment. But " necessity is the
mother of invention," and Dr. Cnro of Mannheim, to whom the speaker
is greatly indebted for much of the above information, found that
sodium xanthate is freo from many of the objections inherent to the
glucose reduction process, inasmuch as the reaction then goes on in
the cold.   Moreover, he finds that the red isomeride of indigo-blue,
Indirubin, which possesses a splendid red colour, also occurring
in natural indigo, but whose tinctorial power is less than that of
the blue, is produced in less quantity in this case than when
glucose is employed.       On this cloth, alumina and iron mordants
may be printod, and this afterwards dyed in alizarin, &c., or this

colouring matter may also           be printed on the cloth and the colour
fixed by moderate steaming without damage to the indigo-blue. Tins
process is now in actual use by printers both in England and on the
Continent, so that, thanks especially to the talent and energy of Dr.
Caro, Baeyer's discovery has been practically applied within the short
space of twelve months of its conception.               Operations on a manu
facturing scale have been successfully carried on in the Baden Soda
and Aniline Works at Ludwigshafen for the last two months, and
the directors see no reason why they should not be able to supply any
demand, however great, which may be made for ortho-nitro-phenyl-
propiolic acid.
     The proper way of looking at this question at present is, therefore,
 to consider ortho-nitro-phenyl-propiolic acid and indigo as two distinct
products not comparable with each other, inasmuch as the one can be
put to uses for which the other is unfitted, and there is surely scope
enough for both. Still, looking at the improvements which will every
day be made in the manufacturing details, he must be a bold man who
would assert the impossibility of competition with indigo in all its
applications.      For we must remember that we are only at the be
ginning of these researches in the indigo field. Baeyer and other
workers will not stay their hands, and possibly other colouring
matters of equal intensity and of equal stability to indigo may bo
obtained from other as yet unknown or unrecognised sources, and
it is not improbable that these may turn out to be more formidable
competitors in the race with natural indigo than ortho-nitro-phenyl-
propiolic acid.
     Looking at this question of the possible competition of artificial
with the natural indigo from another point of view, it must, on the
other hand, be borne in mind that the present mode of manufacturing
indigo from the plant is extremely rude and imperfect, and that by
an improved and more careful carrying out of the process, great
saving in colouring matter may be effected, so that it may prove
possible to produce a purer article at a lower price, and thus to
counterbalance the production of the artificial material.
     The following are the directions issued by the patenteos to calico
printers for using the new colour :—

borax finely powdered        ;  mix  well.     The mixture first becomes fluid
and   at last  turns  stiff.    Then   add   3  quarts white starch thickeniug

      For lighter shades reduce the above printing colour with J;he
 following: In 1 gallon white starch paste dissolve 1 lb. xanthate
of soda.
      Directions for use. — Print and dry as usual.        The pieces ought
not to    be   placed  in  immediate   contact   with  drying cylinders, or
 otherwise be subjected to heat above 100° C. The indigo-blue is best
developed by allowing the printed goods to remain in a dry atmo
sphere and at an ordinary temperature for about 48 hours. Damp air
ought to be excluded as much as possible until the colour is fully
developed.       Then the pieces may be passed through the ageing
machine, or steamed at low pressure if such treatment should be
required for fixing any other colour or mordant printed along with
the indigo-blue.
     After the blue is ready formed, the pieces are first thoroughly
washed in the washing machine and then boiled in the clean water,
or better, in a weak solution of hyposulphite of soda (1 lb. to 10
gallons), and at a full boil for half an hour in order to volatilise the
smell which would otherwise adhere to the goods.
     Clean in a soap-bath, at a temperature not above 40° C. ; wash, dry,
and finish.
      Observations. — Wheat starch gives the best results in the colour,
then follows gum tragacanth.        The colour is considerably reduced by
using gum Senegal, dark British gum, or calcined farina as thickening
materials.
     So far borax has answered best as an alkaline solvent of propiolio
acid, it may however be replaced in the above standard by acetate
of soda (from 1 to 1£ lb.) or by 6 oz. pearlash or soda. Any excess
of caustic-potash, or soda, destroys propiolic acid.
     The above standard keeps unchanged for any length of time, it is
likewise not sensibly altered by a small amount of xanthate of soda,
but when mixed with its full proportion of xanthate, as in the abovo
printing colour, it gradually loses strength after several hours.
     The xanthate ought therefore to be mixed with the standard
immediately before printing, and any colour remaining unused may
then be saved by mixing with the same a large proportion of
starch paste.
     Propiolic acid may be printed along with aniline black, catechu
brown and drabs, and with alumina and iron mordants for madder
colours.
     After the indigo-blue is fully developed, the mordants are fixed in
the ordinary manner, dyed with alizarin, padded with Turkey-red oil,
steamed, and otherwise treated as usual.
     Indigo-blue, whether natural or artificial, suffers by prolonged
                                                               2 s 2

 tho goods with the above; dry, print with standard, and after printing
 follow the above treatment. The pieces may also be first printed
 with xanthato and then covered with standard.               Alumina and iron
 mordants for madder colours may be likewise printed on cloth thus
 prepared, or printed with xanthato of soda.
      The potential importance, from a purely commercial point of view,
of   the manufacture, may be judged of by reference to the following
statistics, showing that the annual value of the world's growth of
indigo is uo less than four millions sterling.

     How far the artificial will drive out the natural colouring matter
from the market cannot, as has been said, be foreseen.              It is interest
ing, as the only instance of the kind on record, to cast a glance at
the history of the production of the first of the artificial vegetable
colouring     matters, alizarin.     In this case the increase in the
quantity produced since its discovery in 1869 has been enormous,
such indeed that the artificial colour has now entirely superseded the
natural one, to tho almost complete annihilation of the growth of
madder-root.      It appears that whilst for the ten years immediately
preceding 1869 the average value of the annual imports of madder-root
was over one million sterling, the imports of the same material during
last year (1880) amounted only to 24,OOOZ.        The whole difference being
made up by the introduction of artificial alizarin.             In 1868, no less
a quantity than GO, 000 tons of madder-root were sent into the market,
this containing 600,000 kilos, of pure natural alizarin. But in ten
years later a quantity of artificial alizarin more than equal to the above

 1881.]           on Indigo, and its Artificial Production.             593
amount was sent out from the various chemical factories.          So that in
 ten years the artificial production had overtaken the natural growth,
and the 300,000 or 400,000 acres of land which had hitherto been used
for the growth of madder, can henceforward be better employed in
growing corn or other articles of food. According to returns, for
 which the speaker had to thank Mr. Perkin, the estimated growth of
madder in the world previous to 1869 was 90,000 tons, of the average
value of 45Z. per ton, representing a total of 4,050,000Z.
     Last year (1880) the estimated production of the artificial colouring
matter was 14,000 tons, but this contains only 10 per cent. of puro
alizarin. Reckening 1 ton of the artificial colouring matter as equal
to 9 tons of madder, the whole artificial product is equivalent to
 126,000 .tons of madder. The present value of these 14,000 tons of
alizarin paste, at 122Z. per ton, is 1,568,000Z. That of 126,000 tons of
madder at 45Z. is 5,670,000Z., or a saving is effected by the use of
alizarin of considerably over four millions sterling.       In other words,
wo get our alizarin dyeing done now for less than one-third of the
price which we had to pay to have it done with madder.
     Our knowledge concerning the chemistry of alizarin has also
proportionately increased since the above date.         For whilst at that
time only one distinct body having the above composition was known,
we are now acquainted with no less than nine out of the ten di-
oxyanthraquinones whose existence is theoretically possible, according
as the positions of the two semi-molecules of hydroxyl are changed.
    Of the nine known di-oxyanthraquinones, only one, viz. alizarin,
or that in which the hydroxyls aro contained in the position 1, 2, is
actually used as a colouring agent.      Then again, three tri-oxyanthra-
quinoncs, C4H502(OH)3, are known.           One of these is contained in
madder-root, and has long been known as purpurin. The other tri-
oxyanthroquinones can be artificially prepared. One tornicd anthra-
purpuriu is an important colouring matter, especially valuable to
Turkey-red dyers, as giving a full or fiery red. The other, called
flavo-purpurin,   gives an orange dye with alumina mordants.            All
these various colouring matters can now be artificially produced, and
by mixing these in varying proportions a far greater variety of tints
can be obtained than was possible with madder alone, and thus the
powor of diversifying the colour at will is placed in the hands of tho
dyer and calico printer.

594                     Prof.  Roscoe on Indigo, dc,       [May 27, 1881.
     It is quite possible that in an analogous way a variety of shades of
blue may be ultimately obtained from substituted indigos, and thus
our catalogue of coal-tar colours may be still further increased.
     To Englishmen it is a somewhat mortifying reflection, that whilst
the raw materials from which all these coal-tar colours are made are
produced in our country, the finished and valuable colours are nearly
all manufactured in Germany. The crude and inexpensive materials
are, therefore, exported by us abroad, to be converted into colours
having many hundred times the value, and these expensive colours
have again to be bought by English dyers and calico printers
for use in our staple industries.      The total annual value of manu
factured coal-tar colours amounts to about three and a half
millions ; and as England herself, though furnishing all the raw
material, makes only a small fraction of this quantity, but uses a
large fraction, it is clear that she loses the profit on the manufacture.
The causes of this fact, which we must acknowledge, viz. that
Germany has driven England out of the field in this important branch
of chemical manufacture, are probably various. In the first place, there
is no doubt that much of the German success is due to the long-
continued attention which their numerous Universities have paid
to the cultivation of Organic Chemistry as a pure science. For
this is carried out with a degree of completeness, and to an extent
to which we in England are as yet strangers.        Secondly, much again
is to be attributed to the far more general recognition amongst
German than amongst English men of business of the value, from
a merely mercantile point of view, of high scientific training.        In
proof of this it may be mentioned, that each of two of the largest
German colour-works employs no less a number than from twenty-
five to thirty highly educated scientific chemists, at salaries varying
from 2502. to 500Z. or 600Z. per annum. A third cause which doubtless
exerts a great influence in this matter is the English law of patents.
This, in the special case of colouring matters at least, offers no
protection to English patentees against foreign infringement, for when
these colours are once       on the goods they cannot be identified.
Foreign infringers can thus lower the price so that only the patentee,
if skilful, can compete against them, and no English licencces of the
patent can exist. This may to some extent account for the reluctance
which English capitalists feel in embarking in the manufacture of
artificial colouring matters. That England possesses both in the
scientific and in the practical direction ability equal to the occasion
none can doubt.       But be that as it may, the whole honour of the
discovery of artificial indigo belongs to Germany and to the dis
tinguished     chemist Professor Adolf Baeyer, whilst towards the
solution of the difficult problem of its economic manufacture the
first successful steps have been taken by Dr. Caro and the Baden
Aniline and Soda Works of Mannheim.

  Our eloquent countryman, Mr. Buskin, commences his work on
  Flowers by a somewhat severe criticism of his predecessors. He
  reproduces a page from a valuable but somewhat antiquated work,
  ' Curtis' Magazino,' which he alleges to be " characteristic of botanical
  books and botanical science, not to say all science," and complains
  bitterly that it is a string of names and technical tonus. No doubt
  that unfortunate page does contain a list of synonyms, and long
  words.     But in order to identify a plant you must have synonyms
  and technical terms, just as to learn a language you must have a dic
  tionary.    To complain of this would be to resemble the man who
  said that Johnson's Dictionary was dry and disjointed reading.           But
  no one would attempt to judge the literature of a country by reading
 a dictionary.     Neither can we estimate the interest of a science by
 reading    technical  descriptions.    On the other hand, it is impossible
 to give a satisfactory description of an animal or plant except in
 strict technical language.
      Let me reproduce a description which Mr. Buskin has given
 of the Swallow, and which, indeed, he says in his lecture on that
 bird, is the only true description that could be given. His lecturo
 was delivered before the University of Oxford, and is,         I need hardly
 say, most interesting.     Now, how does he describe a swallow ? You
can, he says, " only rightly describe the bird by the resemblances
and images of what it seems to have changed from, then adding the
 fantastic and beautiful contrast of the unimaginable change. It is an
owl that has been trained by the Graces. It is a bat that loves the
morning light.        It is the aerial reflection of a dolphin. It is the
tender domestication of a trout."          That is, no doubt, very poetical,
but it would be absolutely useless as a scientific description, and,         I
must confess, would never have suggested, to mo at least, the idea
of a swallow.
     But though technical terms are very necessary in science,         I shall
endeavour, as far as     I can, to avoid them here.       As, however, it will
be impossible for me to do so altogether,           I will do my best at the
commencement to make them as clear as possible, and                   I  must
therefore ask those who have already looked into the subject, to

with the flower, to which the seed owes its origin. Now if you take
such  a  flower as, say,    Geranium, you will find that
                             a                                   consists of the

colored leaves, or petals, generally forming the most conspicuous
part of the flower, and called the corolla thirdly,;           whorl of organs

anthers, of which the pollen              is
                                        produced.      These anthers are           in
reality,   as Goethe   showed,   modified   leaves   in; the so-called double
flowers, as, for instance, in our garden roses, they are developed into
colored leaves like these of the corolla, and monstrous flowers are
not unfrequently met with, in which the stamens are green leaves,
more or less resembling the ordinary leaves of the plant.             Lastly,
                                                                                   is be in
the centre of the flower        the pistil, which also

considered as constituted of one or more leaves, each of which
folded on itself, and called        carpel. Sometimes there is only one
                                      a
carpel.     Generally the carpels have so completely lost the appear
ance of leaves, that this explanation of their true nature requires                t
certain amount of faith.        The base of the pistil        the ovary, com
                                                               is
posed, as      have just mentioned, of one or more carpels, in which
               I
the seeds aro developed.           ncod hardly say that many so-called
seeds aro really fruit     that

                                   to say, they are seeds with more or leas
complex envelopes.
     Wo all know that seeds and fruits differ greatly in different
species.     Some aro large, some small        ;some are sweet, some bitter;
some are brightly colored, some are good to eat, some poisonous,
some spherical, some winged, some covered with bristles, some with
hairs, some are smooth, some very sticky and we may be sure that
                                                   ;
there are good reasons for these differences.
     In the case of flowers, much light has been thrown on their various
interesting    peculiarities by the researches of Sprengel, Darwin,
Miiller, and other naturalists.          As regards seeds also, besides
Gaertner's great work, Hildebrand,            Erause, Stcinbrinck, Kerner,
Grant Allen, Wallace, Darwin, and others, have published valuable
researches, especially with reference to the hairs and hooks wi&
which so many seeds are provided, and the other means of dispersion
they possess.      Nobbo also has contributed an important work on
seeds, principally from an agricultural point of view, but the subject
as    awhole offers a most promising field for investigation.               It    is
rather with     aview of suggesting this branch of science to you, than
of attempting to supply the want myself, that             now propose to call

your attention to it. In doing so          Imust, in the first place, express
my acknowledgments to Mr. Baker, Mr. Carruthers, Mr. Hemsley,
and specially to Mr. Thiselton Dyer and Sir Joseph Hooker, for
their kind and most valuable assistance.
    It said that one of our best botanists once observed to another
          is

that he never could understand what was the use of the teeth on the
capsules of mosses.                                 I
                       " Oh," replied his friend, " see no
                                                              difficulty in
that, because if it were not for the teeth, how could we distinguish
               "
the species ?     We may, however, no doubt, safely consider that the
peculiarities of seeds have reference to the plant itself, and not to the
convenience of botanists.
    In the first place, then, during growth, seeds in many cases
require protection.    This is especially the case with those of an
albuminous    character.   It is curious that so many of those which
are luscious when ripe, as the Peach, Strawberry, Cherry, Apple,
&c., are stringy, and almost inedible, till ripe.     Moreover, in these
cases, the fleshy portion is not the seed itself, but only the enve
lope, so that even if the sweet part is eaten the seed itself remains
uninjured.
    On the other hand, such seeds as the Hazel, Beech, Spanish Chest
nut, and innumerable others, are protected by a thick, impervious
shell, which is especially developed in many Proteaceie, the Brazil-
nut, the so-called Monkey-pot, the Cocoa-nut, and other palms.
    In other cases the envelopes protect the seeds, not only by their
thickness and toughness, but also by their bitter taste, as, for instance,
in the Walnut. The genus Mucuna, one of the LeguminosaB, is
remarkable in having the pods covered with stinging hairs.
    In many cases ripening of the seed is accompanied by important
movements of the neighbouring organs. In some, for instance, the
calyx, which is closed when the flower is in bud, opens when the flower
expands, and then, after the petals have fallen, closes again until the
seeds are ripe, when it opons for the second time.      This is the case
with the common Herb Robert (Geranium roberlianum^.          In Atractylis
cancellata, a South European plant, allied to tho thistles, the outer
envelopes form an exquisite little cage.       Another case, perhaps, is
that of Nigella, the " Devil-in-a-bush," or, as it is sometimes moro
prettily called, " Love-in-a-mist," of old English gardens.
    Again, the protection of the seed is in many cases attained by
curious movements of the plant itself. In fact, plants move much
more than is generally supposed.      So far from being motionless, they
may almost be said to be in perpetual movement, though the changes
of position are generally so slow that they do not attract attention.
This is not, however, always the case. We are all familiar with the
Sensitive Plant, which droops its leaves when touched. Another
species (Averrhoa bilimbi) has leaves like those of an Acacia, and all
day the leaflets go slowly up and down. Desmodium gyrans, a sort of
pea living in India, has trifoliate leaves, the lateral leaflets being
small and narrow ; and these leaflets, as was first observed by Lady
Monson, are perpetually moving round and round, whence the specific
name gyrans. In these two cases the object of the movement is quite
unknown to us. In Dioncea, on the other hand, the leaves form a
regular fly-trap.   Diroctly an insect alights on them they shut up
with  a snap.

 698                             Sir John Lubbock                     [Feb.    18,
       In   a groat many cases  leaves are said to sleep ; that is to say, at
  the approach of night they chango their position, and sometimes fold
  themselves up, thus presenting a smaller surfaco for radiation, and
  being in consequence loss exposed to cold. Mr. Darwin has proved
  experimentally that leaves which were prevontod from moving suffered
  more from cold than these which were allowed to assume their natural
  position.    He has also observed with reference to one plant, Maranta
  arundinacea, the Arrowroot, a West Indian species allied to Canna,
  that if the plant has had a severe shock it cannot get to sleep for the
  next two or three nights.
       The sleep of flowers is also probably a case of the same kind,
  though, as     Ihave elsewhere attempted to show, it has now,      I believe,
  special reference to the visits of insects; those flowers which are
  fertilised by bees, butterflies, and other day insects, sleep by night,
  if at all ; whilo those which aro dependent on moths ronse themselves
  towards evening, as already mentioned, and sleep by day.              These
  motions, indeed, have but an indirect reference to our present subject-
  On the other hand, in the Dandelion (Leontodon), the flower-stalk is
 upright while the flowor is expanded, a period which lasts for throe or
 four days ; it then lowers itself and lies close to the ground for about
 twelve days, while the fruits are ripening, and then rises again when
 they are mature. In the Cyclamen the stalk curls itself up into a
 beautiful spiral after the flower has faded.
      The flower of the little Linaria of our walls (L. cymbalaria) pushes
 out into the light and sunshine, but as soon as it is fertilised it turns
 round and endoavours to find some holo or cranny in which it may
 remain safely onsconced until the seed is ripe.
      In some water plants the flower expands at the surface, but after it
 is faded retreats again to the bottom. This is the case, for instance,
 with the Water Lilies, some species of Potamogeton, Trapa natans, &c.
In Valisneria, again, the female flowers (Fig. 1 a) are borne on long
 stalks, which reach to the surface of the water, on which tho flowers
 float. The male flowers (Fig. 1 6), on the contrary, have shert,
 straight stalks, from which, when mature, the pollen (Fig. 1 y
dotaches itself, rises to the surface, and, floating freely on           it,u
 wafted about, so that     it comes in contact with the female flowers.
After fertilisation, however, the long stalk coils up spirally, and tuns
carries tho ovary down to the bottom, where the seeds can ripen in
greater safoty.
      The next points to which   I  will direct your attention are the means
of dispersion possessed by many seeds. Farmers have found                      by
experience that          not desirable to grow the same crop in the same
                     it
                     is
field year after year, because the soil becomes more or less exhausted.
In this respect, therefore, the powers of dispersion possessed by many
seeds are    a great advantage to the species.     Moreover, thoy are also
advantageous in giving the seed        a   chance of germinating in new
localities suitable to the requirements of the species.             Thus   a
common European species, Xanthium gpinomm, has rapidly spread

 1881.]                          on   Fruits and      Seeds.                599
over the whole of South Africa, the seeds being carried in the wool
of sheep. From various considerations, however, it seems probable
that in most cases the provision does not contemplate a dispersion for
more than a short distance.
     I have already referred to the case of the Common Dandelion.
Here the flower-stalk stands more or less upright while the flower is
expanded, a period which generally lasts for three or four days. It

then lowers itself, and lies more or less horizontally and concealed
during the time the seeds are maturing, which in our .Bummers
occupies about twelve days. It then again rises, and, becoming almost
erect, facilitates the dispersion of the seeds, or, speaking botanically,
the fruits, by the wind.         Some plants, as wo shall see, even sow their
seeds in the ground, but those cases will bo referred to Inter on.

    In other cases the plant throws its own seeds to some little distance.
This is the case with the common Cardamine hirsuta, a little plant —I
do not like to call'it a weed — six or eight inches high, which comes up
of itself abundantly on any vacant spot in our kitchen-gardens or
shrubberies, and which much resembles that represented in Fig. 17,
but without the subterranean pods b. The seeds are contained in a
pod which consists of three parts, a central membrane, and two lateral
walls.   When the pod is ripe the walls are in a state of tension. The
seeds are loosely attached to the central piece by short stalks.      Now,
when the proper moment has arrived, the outer walls are kept in place
                                      Fig.    2.

by a delicate membrane, only just strong enough to resist the tension.
The least touch, for instance a puff of wind blowing the plant against
a neighbour, detaches the outer wall, which suddenly rolls itself up,
generally with such force as to fly from the plant, thus jerking the
seeds to a distance of several feet.
    In the common violets, beside the colored flowers, there are others

1881.]                             on  Fruits and       Seeds.                                601
in which the corolla is either             absent or imperfectly developed.                   The
stamens also aro small, but contain pollen, though less than in the
colored flowers. In the autumn large numbers of these curious
flowers arc produced. When very young they resemble an ordinary
flower-bud (Figs. 2 and 3 a), the central part of the flower being
entirely covered by the sepals, and the whole having a triangular form.
When older (Figs. 2 and 3 b) they look at first sight like an ordinary
seed-capsule, so that the bud seems to pass into the capsule without
the flower-stage. The pansy violets do not possess these interesting
flowers.      In the Sweet Violet ( V. odorata and V. hirta, Fig. 2) they
may easily be found, by searching among the leaves, nestling close to
the ground.          It is often said, for instance by Vaucher, that the plants

actually force these capsules into the ground, and thus sow their own
seeds.     I  have not, however, found this to be the case, though as the
stalk elongates, and the point of the capsule turns downwards, if the
earth be loose and uneven, it will no doubt sometimes so happen.
When the seeds are fully ripe, the capsule opens by three valves and
allows them to escape.

brought some into the house and placed them on my billiard-table.
They were thrown from one end completely over the other, in some
cases more than twenty feet.
    Some species of vetch, again, and the common broom, throw their
seeds, owing to the elasticity of the pods, which, when ripe, open
suddenly with      jerk. Each valve of the pod contains
                          a                                   layer of                            a

 more or less inclined to its axis (Fig. 9). Consequently, when the pod
 bursts it does not, as in the case of Cardamine, roll up like a watch-
 spring, but twists itself more or less like a corkscrew.
      I  have mentioned these species because they are some of our com
 monest wild flowers, so that during the summer and autumn we may,
 in almost any walk, observe for ourselves this innocent artillery.
 There are, however, many other more or less similar cases. Thus the
 Squirting Cucumber (Momordica elaterium), a common plant in the
 south of Europe, and one grown in some places for medicinal purposes,
 effects the same object by a totally different mechanism.                     The fruit is
 a small cucumber (Fig. 10), and when ripe it becomes so gorged with
 fluid that it is in a state of great tension.                 In this condition a very

slight touch is sufficient to detach it from the stalk, when the pressure
of the walls ejects the contents, throwing the seed some distance. In
this case of course the contents are ejected at the end by which the
encumber is attached to the stalk.                     If any one touches one of these
ripe fruits, they are often thrown with such force as to strike him in
the face.      In this the action is said to be due to endosmosis.
     In Cydanthera, a plant allied to the cucumber, the fruit is unsym-
metrical, one side being round and hairy, the other nearly flat and
smooth. The true apex of the fruit, which bears the remains of the
flower, is also somewhat eccentric, and, when the seeds are ripe, if it
is touched even lightly, the fruit explodes and the seeds are thrown to
some distance.           The mechanism by which this is effected has been

 1881.]                         on  Fruits and    Seeds.                         607
 described by Hildebrand. The interior of the fruit is occupied by loose
 cellular structure.       The central column, or placenta, to which the
 seeds are attached, lies loosely in this tissue.          Through the solution
 of its earlier attachments, when the fruit is ripe, the column adheres
 only at the apical end, under the withered remains of the flower, and
 at the swollen side. When the fruit bursts the placenta unrolls, and
 thus hurls the seeds to some distance, being even itself sometimes also
 torn away from its attachment.
      Other cases of projected seeds are afforded by Hura one of the
 Euphorbice, Collomia, Oxalis, some species allied to Acanthus, and by
 Arceuthobium, a plant allied to the mistletoe, and parasitic on Junipers,
 which ejects its seeds to a distance of several feet, throwing them thus
 from one tree to another.
      Even those species which do not eject their seeds often have them
 so placed with reference to the capsule that they only leave it if
 swung or jerked by a high wind.              In the case of trees, even seeds
 with no special adaptation for dispersion must in this manner be often
 carried to no little distance ; and to a certain,
                                                                    Fig. 11.
 though less extent, this must hold good even
 with herbaceous plants. It throws light on the,
 at first sight, curious fact that in so many plants
 with small, heavy seeds, the capsules open not at
 the bottom, as one might perhaps have been dis
 posed to expect, but at the top.         A good illus
 tration is afforded by the well-known case of the
 Common Poppy (Fig. 11), in which the upper
part of the capsule presents a series of little doors
 (Fig. 11 a), through which, when the plant is
swung by the wind, the seeds come out one by
one.     The little doors are protected from rain
by overhanging eaves, and are even said to shut
of themselves in wet weather.                The genus
 Campanula is also interesting from this point of
view, because some species have the capsules
pendent, some upright, and those which are
upright open at the top, while those which are
pendent do so at the base.
     In other cases the dispersion is mainly the
work of the seed itself.       In some of the lower
plants, as, for instance, in many seaweeds, and in
some allied fresh- water plants, such as Vaucheria,
                                                                Seed-head of Poppy

 608                            Sir John Lulbock                        [Feb. 18,
 provided with a red
                         " eye-spot " as it has been called, which, at any
 rate, seems so far to deserve the name that it appears to be sensitive to
 light. This mode of progression is, however, only suitable to water-
 plants.   One group of small, low-organised plants, Marchantia, develop
 among the spores a number of cells with spirally thickened walls,
 which, by their contractility, are supposed to disseminate the spores.
 In the common Horse Tails (Equisetum), again, the spores are pro
vided with curious filaments, terminating in expansions, and known
 as " elaters."   They move with great vigour, and probably serve the
same purpose.
     In much more numerous cases,, seeds are carried by the wind.
 For this of course it is desirable that they should be light.              Some
 times this object is attained by the character of the tissues themselves,
 sometimes by the presence of empty spaces.             Thus, in Valerianella
 auricula, the fruit contains three cells, each of which would naturally
 be expected to contain a seed.       One seed only, however, is developed,
but, as may be seen from the figure given in Mr. Bentham's excellent
 '
   Handbook of the British Flora,' the two cells which contain no seed
actually become larger than the one which alone might, at first sight,
 seem to be normally developed.         We may be sure from this that they
 must be of some use, and, from their lightness, they probably enable
the wind to carry the seed to a greater distance than would otherwise
be the   case.
     In other instances the plants themselves, or parts of them, are
rolled along the ground by the wind. An example of this is afforded,
for instance, by a kind of grass (Spinifex squarrosus), in which the
mass of inflorescence, forming a large round head, is thus driven for
miles over the dry sands of Australia until it comes to a damp place,
when it expands and soon strikes root.
     In Pumilio argyrolepis, an Australian Composite, the pappus, or
portion corresponding to the feathered crown of the Dandelion seed,
consists, as described by Mr. Darwin,* of nine scales (or sepals),
expanded like a flower ; the lower part of the fruit, which encloses the
true seed, is bent nearly at a right angle, and in form closely resembles
a human foot.       The upper side or instep is smooth, but the toe and
sole, which are about ^ inch in length, are covered with from 30 to 40
little bladders, each formed of a thin skin and containing a small
lump of gum. When the fruits are moistened these bladders burst
and the gum exudes.         As long then as the fruits remain dry, they are
easily  blown   about  by  the wind ; but as soon as they alight on a damp
spot,  the gum   exudes   and  glues  them to the ground.         If  a pinch of
these seeds be dropped on a piece of paper, the greater number fall
upright like shuttlecocks, but even if they alight on one side the
tendency of the gum is to pull them upright, so that they look as if
each had been placed upright and carefully gummed.                It is not clear
whether this position is of importance to the germination of the seed.

    So, again, the Anastatica hierochuntica, or " Rose of Jericho," a
small annual with rounded pods, which frequents sandy places in
Egypt, Syria, and Arabia, when dry, curls itself up into a ball or
round cushion, and is thus driven about by the wind until it finds a
damp place, when it uncurls, the pods open, and sow the seeds.

     These cases, however, in which seeds are rolled by the wind along
 the ground are comparatively rare. There are many more in which
 seeds are wafted through the air.                      If  you examine the fruit of a
 Sycamore you will find that it is provided with a wing-like expansion,

while in the Lime, c, the whole bunch of fruits drops together, and
the " bract," as it is called, or leaf of the flower-stalk, serves the same
purpose.
     In a groat many other plants the same result is obtained             by
flattened and expanded edges.        A beautiful example is afforded by the
genus Thysanocarpus, a North American crucifer ; T. laciniatus has           a
distinctly winged pod ; in T. curvipes the wings are considerably-
larger ; lastly, in T. elegans and T. radians the pods are still further
developed in the same direction, T. radians having the wing very
broad, while in T. elegans it has become thinner and thinner in places,
until at length it shows a series of perforations. Among our common
wild plants we find winged fruits in the Dock (Rumex) and in the
Common Parsnip (Pattinaca).           But though in these cases the object
to be obtained — namely, the dispersion of the seed — is effected in a
similar manner, there are differences which might not at first be sus
pected.    Thus in some cases, as, for instance, the Pine, it is the seed
itself which is winged ; in Thlaspi arvense it is the pod ; in Entada,
a leguminous plant, the pod breaks up into segments, each of which
is winged ; in Nissolia the extremity of the pod is expanded into a
flattened wing ; lastly, in the Lime, as already mentioned, the fruits
drop off in a bunch, and the leaf at the base of the common flower-
stalk, or " bract," as it is called, forms the wing.
     In Gouania retinaria of Eodriguez the same object is effected in
another manner ; the cellular tissue of the fruit crumbles and breaks
away, leaving only the vascular tissue, which thus forms a net
enclosing the seed.
     Another mode, which is frequently adopted, is the development of
long hairs. Sometimes, as in Clematis, Anemone, Dryas, these hairs
take the form of a long feathery awn. In others the hairs form a tuft
or crown, which botanists term a pappus. Of this the Dandelion and
John Go-to-bed-at-noon, so called from its habit of shutting its flowers
about mid-day, are well-known examples.          Tufts of hairs, which are
themselves sometimes feathered, are developed in a great many Com
posites, though some, as, for instance, the Daisy and Lapsana, are
without them ; in some very interesting species, of which the common
 Thrincia hirta of our lawns and meadows is one, there are two kinds
of fruits, as shown in Fig. 13 b, one with a pappus and one without.
The former are adapted to seek "fresh woods and pastures new,"
while the latter stay and perpetuate the race at home.
     A more or less similar pappus is found among various English
plants — in the Epilobium (Fig. 13 a), Thrincia (Fig. 13 6), Tamarix
(Fig. 13 c), Willow (Fig. 13 d), Cotton Grass (Fig. 13 e\ and
Bulrush (Fig. 13     /) ; while in exotic species    there are many other
cases — as, for instance, the beautiful Oleander.       As in the wings, so

also in that of the pappus, it is by no means always the same part of
the plant which develops into the crown of hairs.        Thus in the
Valerians and Composites it is the calyx; in the Bulrush, the
perianth ; in Epilobium, the crown of the seed ; in the Cotton-Grass
it is supposed to represent the perianth ; while in some, as, for
instance, in the Cotton plant, the whole outer surface of the seed is

very much reduced in number, as, for instance, in some species of
^schynantJius, where there are only three, one on one side and two on
the other.    In this case, moreover, the hairs are very flexible, and
wrap round the wool of any animal with which they may come in
contact, so that they form   double means of dispersion.

interesting question as to the power of distinguishing color possessed
by our ancestors in bygone times. Geiger, relying on the well-
known fact that the ancient languages are poor in words for color,
and that in the oldest books —as, for instance, in the Vedas, the
Zendavesta, the Old Testament, and the writings of Homer and
Hesiod — though, of course, the heavens are referred to over and over
again, its blue color        never dwelt on, has argued that the ancients
                              is
were very deficient in the power of distinguishing colors, and
especially blue. In our own country Mr. Gladstone has lent the
weight of his great autherity to the same conclusion.        For my part                I
cannot accept this view. There are,                     it
                                                seems to me, very strong
reasons against         it,

though  I    should rely mainly on other considerations, the colors                       of
fruits aro not,      think, without significance. If monkeys and apes
                     I
could distinguish them, surely wo may infer that even the most
savage of men could do so too.         Zeuxis would never have deceived
the birds     he had not had
                if               fair perception of color.

     In these instances of colored fruits, the fleshy edible part more or
less surrounds the true seeds in others the actual seeds themselves

as having seeds or fruits of this form.    They are all trees or climbing
shrubs, not one being a low herb.
     Let us take another case, that of the plants in which the dispersion
of the seed is effected by means of hooks. Now, if the presence of
these hooks were, so to say, accidental, and the dispersion merely a
result, we should naturally expect to find some species with hooks in
all classes of plants. They would occur, for instance, among trees and
on water-plants.     On the other hand, if they are developed that they
might adhere to the skin of quadrupeds, then, having reference to the
habits and size of our British mammals, it would be no advantage for
a tree or for a water-plant to bear hooked seeds.       Now, what are the
facts ? There are about thirty English species in which the disper
sion of the seeds is effected by means of hooks, but not one of these is
aquatic, nor is one of them more than four feet high.        Nay, I might
carry the thing farther.     We have a number of minnte plants, which
lie below the level at which seeds would be likely to be entangled in
fur.    Now none of these, again, have hooked seeds or fruits. It would
also seem, as Hildebrand has suggested, that in point of time, also,
the appearance of the families of plants in which the fruits or
seeds are provided with hooks coincided with that of the land
mammalia.
     Again, let us look at it from another point of view. Let us take
our common forest trees, shrubs, and tall climbing plants ; not, of
course, a natural or botanical group, for they belong to a number of
different orders, but a group characterised by attaining to a height of
say over eight feet.    We will in some cases only count genera ; that
is to say, we will count all the willows, for instance, as one. These
trees and shrubs are plants with which you are all familiar, and are
about thirty-three in number.      Now, of these thirty-three no less than
eighteen have edible fruits or seeds, such as the Plum, Apple, Arbutus,
Holly, Hazel, Beech, and Rose.           Three have seeds which are
provided with feathery hairs; and all the rest, namely, the Lime,
Maple, Ash, Sycamore, Elm, Hop, Birch, Hornbeam, Pine, and Fir are
provided with a wing. Moreover, as will be seen by the table on the
following page, the lower trees and shrubs, such as the Cornel, Guelder
Hose, Eose, Thorn, Privet, Elder, Yew, and Holly have generally
edible berries, much eaten by birds.        The winged seeds or fruits
 characterise the great forest trees.
     Or let us take one natural order. That of the Hoses is particularly
interesting.    In the genus Geum the fruit is provided with hooks ; in
 Dryaa it terminates in a long feathered awn, like that of Clematis.
 On the other hand, several genera have edible fruits ; but it is curious
 that the part of a plant which becomes fleshy, and thus tempting to
Animals, differs considerably in the different genera. In the Black-

berry, for instance, and in the Raspberry, the carpels constitute the
edible portion.       When we eat a Raspberry we strip them off and leave
the receptacle behind; while in the Strawberry the receptacle con
stitutes the edible portion ; the carpels are small, hard, and closely
surround the seeds. In these genera the sepals are situated below
the fruit. In the Rose, on the contrary, it is the peduncle that is
swollen and inverted, so as to form a hollow cup, in the interior of
which the carpels are situated. Here you will remember that the
sepals are situated above, not below, the fruit. Again, in the Pear
and Apple, it is the ovary which constitutes the edible part of the
fruit, and in which the pips are embedded.              At first sight, the fruit
of the Mulberry — which, however, belongs to a different family —

 618                          Sir John    Lubbock                   [Feb. 18,
 closely resembles that of the Blackberry.         In the Mulberry, however,
 it is the sepals which become fleshy and sweet.
      The next point is that seeds should be in a spot suitable for their
 growth.    In most cases, the seed lies on the ground, into which it
 then pushes its little rootlet.    In plants, however, which live on trees,
 the case is not so simple, and we meet some curious contrivances.
 Thus, the Mistletoe, as we all know, is parasitic on trees.       The fruits
 are eaten by birds, and the droppings often therefore fall on the
 boughs ; but if the seed was like that of most other plants it would
 soon fall to the ground, and consequently perish.              Almost alone
 among English plants     it is extremely sticky,    and  thus adheres to the
 bark.
      I have already alluded to an allied genus, Arceuthobium, parasitic
 on Junipers, which throws its seeds to a distance of several feet.
 These also are very viscid, or, to speak more correctly, are embedded

in  a very viscid mucilage, so that if they come in contact with the
bark of a neighbouring tree they stick to it.
     Another very interesting genus, again of the same family, is

Myzodendron (Fig. 16), a Fuegian species, described by Sir Joseph
Hooker, and parasitic on the Beech. Here the seed is not sticky, but
is proTided with four flattened flexible appendages.      These catch tho
wind, and thus carry the seed from one tree to another.           As soon,
however,    as they  touch any  little bough  the arms twist  round  it and
there anchor tho seed.
      Dr. Watt has discovered a still more curious fact in an Indian
species of Loranthus, which he considers to be L. globosus.      The fruit,
as is so common in this order, consists of a mass of viscid pulp.
Under ordinary circumstances the seeds would be most likely in the
first instance to drop upon a leaf ; but if they remained there, when
the leaves fell from the trees the seeds would drop also. They have,
however, a curious power of movement, by means of which they quit
the leaves and fasten themselves to the stem. The radicle, when it has
 elongated itself to about an inch, develops at its extremity a flattened
 disc.    It then curves about until the disc touches any object that is
 near at hand. To this it then attaches itself, and tears the berry away
 from its previous position.     The radiclo then again curves, the berry
 is again carried to another spot, whoro it adheres again. This
 curious process is repeated until the seed finds itself on a spot
 suitable for its growth.
      In many epiphytes the seeds are extremely numerous and minute.
 Their great numbers increase the chance that the wind may waft
 some of them to tho trees on which they grow ; and as they are then
 fully supplied with nourishment they do not require to carry any
 storo with them. Moreover, their minute size is an advantage, as they
 are carried into any little chink or cranny in the bark ; while a
 larger or heavier seed, even if borne against a suitable tree, would be
 more likely to drop off. In the genus Neumannia, the small seed
 is produced at each end into a long filament which must materially
 increase its chance of adhering to a suitable tree.
       Even among terrestrial specios there are not a few cases in which
  plants are not contented simply to leave their seeds on the surface of
  the soil, but actually sow them in the ground.       Thus in Trifolium
 subterraneum, one of our rarer English Clovers, only a few of the
  florets become perfect flowers, the others form a rigid pointed head
  which at first is turned upwards, and as their ends are close to
  gether, constitute a sort of spike. At first,    I say, the flower-heads
 point upwards like those of other Clovers, but as soon as the
 florets are fertilised, the flower-stalks bend over and grow down
  wards, forcing the flower-head into the ground, an operation much
 facilitated by the peculiar construction and arrangement of tho
 imperfect florets. The florets are, as Darwin has shown, no mero
 passive instruments.      So soon as the flower-head is in the ground
 they begin, commencing from the outside, to bend themselves towards
 tho peduncle, the result of which of course is to drag the flower-head
 farther and farther into the ground.        In most Clovers each floret

produces a little pod. This would in the present species be useless,
or even injurious ; many young plants growing in one place would
jostle and starve one another.                 Hence we see another obvious
advantage    in the fact  that    only  a  few    florets perfect their seeds.

the flower has faded, the young pod, which is oval, pointed, and very
minute, is carried forward by the growth of the stalk, which becomes
several inches long, and curves downwards so as generally to force
the pod into the ground.         If  it fails in this, the pod does not develop,
but soon perishes ; on the other hand, as soon as it is underground
the pod begins to grow and develops two large seeds.

remarkable that these species are by no means nearly related, but

 Commdynacece,    Violacece, and Scrophulariacece.
     Moreover, it is interesting that in L. amphicarpos, as in Vicia
amphicarpa and Cardarnine chenopodifolium, the subterranean pods
differ from the usual and aerial form in being shorter and containing
fewer seeds.                                  I
                The reason of this is, think, obvious. In the ordinary
pods  the  number   of seeds of course increases the chance that some

will find  a suitable place.    On the other hand, the subterranean ones
are carefully sown, as it were, by the plant itself.          Several seeds
together would only jostle one another, and it is
therefore better that one or two only should be pro             FIG. 20.
duced.
    In the Erodiumt, or Crane's Bills, tho fruit is a
capsule which opens elastically,        in some species
throwing the seeds to some little distance. The seeds
themselves are more or loss spindle-shaped, hairy,
and produced into a twisted hairy awn as shown in
Fig. 20, representing a seed of E. glaucophyllum.
The number of spiral turns in the awn depends upon
the amount of moisture ; and the seed may thus bo
made into a very delicate hygrometer, for if it be
fixed in an upright position, the awn twists or
 untwists according to die degree of moisture, and its
extremity thus may be so arranged as to move up and
down like a needle on a register.      It is also affected
by heat. Now if the awn were fixed instead of the
seed, it is obvious that during the process of untwist
ing, the seed itself would be pressed downwards,
and, as M. Koux has shown, this mechanism thus
serves actually to bury the seed.       His observations
were made on an       allied  species, Erodinm    ciconium,
which he chose on account of its size. He found that
if a seed of this plant is laid on the ground, it
remains quiet as long as it is dry ; but as soon as it
is moistened — i. e. as soon as tho earth becomes in a          Eroditun
condition to permit growth — the outer side of the glaucophyllum.
awn contracts, and the hairs surrounding the seed (After Sweet)
commence to move outwards, the result of which is
gradually to raise the seed into an upright position with its point on
tho soil. The awn then commences to unroll, and consequently to
elongate itself upwards, and it is obvious that as it is covered with
reversed hairs, it will probably press against some blade of grass or
other obstacle, which will prevent its moving up, and will therefore
tend to drive the seed into the ground.      If then the air becomes dryer,
tho awn will again roll up, in which action M. Roux thought it would
tend to draw np the seed, but from the position of the hairs tho
feathery awn can easily slip downwards, and would therefore not
affect the seed.    When moistened once more, it would again force the
seed further downwards, and so on until the proper depth was obtained.
A species of Anemone (A. montana) again has essentially the same
arrangement, though belonging to a widely separated order.
    A still more remarkable instance is afforded by a beautiful South
European grass, Stipa pennata (Fig. 21), tho structure of which has
been described by Vancher, and more recently, as well as more com
pletely, by Frank Darwin. Tho actual seed is small, with a sharp

being more than a foot in length.        The long feather, no doubt, facili
tates the dispersion    of the  seeds  by wind ; eventually, however, they
sink    to the  ground,   which   they tend to reach, the seed being the
heaviest portion, point downwards.          According to Darwin, the seed
remains in the same position as long as it is dry, but if a shower comes
on, or when the dew falls, the spiral unwinds, and             if,
                                                               as     most pro

bable, the surrounding herbage or any other obstacle prevents the
feather from rising, the seed itself       isforced down and so driven by
degrees into the ground.
 I      do not doubt that this seed may bury itself in the manner thus
described, but I     do doubt whether  it  always, or indeed generally, does
so.     One fine day not long ago, I    chanced to be looking at         plant of
                                                                         a

too delicate to drive the seed into the ground in the manner described
by Darwin.   I    therefore took  a  seed and placed     upright on the turf.

 hours,
     I      found that the seed had buried itself some little distance in
 the ground.  I     repeated the observation several times, always with
 the same result, and thus convinced my
 self that one method, at any rate, by                       fi0, 22.
 which these seeds bury themselves         isby
 taking advantage of the action of the
 wind, and the twisted portion of the awn
 by its corkscrew-like movement probably
 facilitates the entry of the seed into the
 ground.
  I     have already mentioned several cases
 in which plants produce two kinds of
 seeds, or at least of pods, the one being
 adapted to burying itself in the ground.
 Heterocarpism, if    I   may term    it so, or
 the power of producing two kinds of re
 productive bodies,   is  not confined to these

of such     a provision, and which probably therefore are intended to
take root at home.
     Mr. Drummond, in the volume of ' Hooker's Journal of Botany '
 for 1842, has described a species of AUsmaeece which has two sorts of
 seed-vessels ; the one produced from large floating flowers, the other
at the end of short submerged stalks.                  He does not, however, describe
either the seeds or seed-vessels in detail.
     Before concluding,        I  will say a few words as to the very curious
forms presented by certain seeds and fruits.                     The pods of Lotus, for
 instance, quaintly resemble a bird's foot, even to the toes ; whence the
 specific name of one species, ornithopodioides ; these of Hippocrepis
 remind one of a horseshoe ; those of Trapa bieornis have an absurd
 resemblanco to the skeleton of a bull's head.                   These likenesses appear
 to bo accidental, but there are some which probably are of use to the
plant.    For instance there are two species of Scorpiurus, Fig. 23, the
                                            Fio.   23.

the likeness must be of some uso to tho plant.

     The pod of Biserrula Pelecinus (Fig. 24 a) also has a striking
resemblance to a crushed centipede ; while the seeds of Abrus preca-
torius, both in size and in their very striking color, mimic a small
beetle, Artemis circumusta.
     Mr. Moore has recently called attention to other cases of this kind.
Thus the seed of Martynia diandra much resembles a beetle with long
antounse : several species of Lupins have seeds much like spiders, and
those of Dimorphochlamys, a gourdlike plant, mimic a piece of dry
twig.    In the Common Castor Oil plants (Fig. 24 6), though the
resemblance is not so close, still at first glance the seeds might readily
be taken for beetles or ticks.     In many Euphorbiaceous plants, as
for instance in Jatropha (Fig. 24              <•-),
                                           the resemblance      even more      is
striking. The seeds have central line resembling the space between
                                 a
the elytra, dividing and slightly diverging at the end, while between
them the end of the abdomen seems to peep          at the anterior end the

    These resemblances might benefit the plant in one of two ways.
If    be an advantage to the plant that the seods should be swallowed

                      The Weather and Health       of London.
To the statistician London affords materials for the prosecution of
many inquiries such as could not be obtained from the statistics of
any other city either in ancient or modern times. Among the more
important of these inquiries are those which relate to questions sug
gested by the enormous aggregation of human beings over a limited
area which London presents on a scale absolutely unparalleled in the
 world's history.     It is one of these questions we bring before you this
evening,   viz. the  influence   of the climato on the health of the people
of London.
     The relation of weather to health is a question which has engaged
 the attention of Dr. Arthur Mitchell and myself for many years. In
an early stage of the inquiry our attention was mainly directed to
 Scotland, and more particularly to the data supplied by its eight
 large towns ; but it was soon found that, owing to the sparseness and
 other conditions of the population, and to the division of time into
 months only, adopted by the Registrar-General for Scotland, the avail
 able data were not sufficiently exact to show the true relations of
 weather to the fluctuations of the death-rate through the year. In truth
it was only after not a little unsuccessful labour, and what could at
best bo characterised as no more than partially successful work, that we
resolved eight years ago to open the discussion of the whole subject
by an exhaustive examination of the meteorological and vital statistics
of London and London alono.           More specifically our reasons for the
selection of London were that it afforded data from (1) an enormous
population spread over an area so limited that it might be regarded as
having one uniform climate during each of the seasons of the year ;
(2) satisfactorily full weekly reports of weather and the deaths from
the different diseases ; and (3) returns extending over a sufficiently
long time.
     In the case of diseases such as diarrhoea and bronchitis, which seem
to be directly and immediately under the influence of temperature,
and such epidemics as scarlet fever and whooping-cough, the rate of
                                                               2x2

 mortality from which is largely determined by season and weather, a
 comparatively small number of years is required to give a satisfactory
 approximation            to their true weekly curve of mortality.                           But as
 regards     the     great  majority    of   diseases,     it  quickly     became   apparent   that
 a thirty years' average was required in the construction of curves
                                                                   "
 which could he offered as true " constants for the diseases to which
 they refer.          The thirty years beginning with 1845 were therefore
 adopted. An examination of the curves shows that some of their
 striking features, particularly those indicating the complications of
 special diseases and their connections with each other, which the
 weekly averages disclose, would entirely disappear if monthly averages
 only were employed.
      The curves of the more prominent and interesting of the diseases
 are shown on the accompanying woodcuts, the straight black line in
 each figure being drawn to represent the mean weekly death-rate on
 an average of the fifty-two weeks of the year, and the figures on the
 margin the percentages above or below the average.                                     With this
 general average the mean death-rate of each. week is compared and
 the difference above or below calculated in percentages, which, when
plus, are placed above the mean line of the figure, and when minus,
 below it. Thus as regards scarlatina (Fig. 1), the mean mortality of

above the mean, from which time it continues to fall to the annual
minimum, 35 per cent, below the mean in the middle of March ; thence
rises to the mean in the end of August ; to the annual maximum, 60
per cent, above the mean, in the end of October, and thereafter
steadily falls.          The portion of the curve above the mean line thus
shows the time of the year when, and the degree to which, the
mortality from scarlatina is above its average, and the portion below
the line when it is under it.
      Fig. 2 shows similarly the distribution of the mortality from
whooping-cough through the weeks of the year, and Fig. 3 the
distribution of the mortality from small-pox.                            It is seen at once that
the mortality curve from scarlatina is precisely the reverse of the
curve of whooping-congh, the maximum death-rate period of the one

distinct from the other two curves.
      In order to ascertain the degree of steadiness of these curves, a
curve was calculated and drawn for each of the seven epidemics of
scarlatina and for each of the eight epidemics of whooping-cough

 each     of the separate epidemics was substantially identical with the
 general curve for the whole thirty years' period, oach of tho four
 prominent phases of each curve occurring all within a week of each
 other.       As regards the small-pox curve, if the deaths during the
 epidemic of 1870-72, by far the most fatal of all the epidemics during
 the thirty years, bo deducted from the general result, we obtain a curve
 which is substantially the same curve as that for the whole thirty
 years, but only less pronounced.                 From theso results it follows, and
 the remark is of general application to all the curves, that the mortality
 curves for the different diseases arrived at in this inquiry may be
 regarded as truo constants of these diseases for London.
      The climate of London, looked at as influencing the health of tho
 people, may be divided into six typos of woathcr according to the
 season of the year.           These are respectively —
      Period 1. —Damp and cold, fourth week of October to third week
of December.
      Period      2. — Cold,     fourth week of December to third                   week of
 February.
      Period     3. — Dry and cold,       fourth week of February           to second week
 of April.

            Period 6. — Damp and warm, second week of September to third

            The outstanding features of the death-rate in its relation to the
      varying types of weather through the year are shown by the top curve
      of Pig. 4, which represents the total mortality for all ages. This
      curve shows two maxima in the course of the year : the one, by far the
      larger of the two, extending over six months from November to April,
      and the other embracing the period from about the beginning of July to
      the autumnal equinox.        It will bo also observed that the comparatively
      short-continued but strongly-pronounced summer maximum is practi
      cally restricted to mere infants, whereas the larger winter maximum

      is   a feature of the curves for all ages ; and hence of all weather
       influences the cold element in the climate of London is that which is
       most destructive to life.
            Figs. 5 to 10 are representative curves of those diseases which go
      to form the summer maximum when " heat " is the chief characteristic
      of the weather.     The direct relation of the progress of mortality from
      diarrhoea to temperature is strikingly seen in the startling suddenness
      with which the curve shoots up during the hottest months of the year,
      and the suddenness, equally startling, with which it falls on the

dysentery and Asiatic cholera begin markedly to rise considerably
later than the other two allied diseases, attain their maximum a
month later, and fall more rapidly than they rose, the annual phases
being nearly a month later than those of diarrhoea and British
cholera, which diseases are less deeply seated in the system.
      The peculiarly malignant character of summer diarrhoea among
young children under five years of age may be shown by the weekly
mortality from diarrhoea, rising from 20 in the middle of June, to 342
in the first week of August, 1880, when the mean temperature of July
and August was about the average.                  In July 1876, when the tempera-
        -*s 3° • 6 above the average, the weekly mortality from diarrhoea
          children rose to 502 on the last week of that month.                       On the

 other hand, during the cold summer of 1860, the diarrhoea mortality
 for all  ages did not in any week exceed 90.
       Of the British large towns the lowest mortality from summer
 diarrhoea is that of Aberdeen, which has the lowest summer tempera
 ture.    The diarrhoea mortality of each town is found from year to year
 to rise proportionally with the increase of temperature, but the rate of
 increase differs widely in different towns, thus pointing to other
 causes than mere weather, or the relative temperatures and humidities
 of these towns, as determining the mortality.         Fig. 1 1 shows the weekly
 death-rate from diarrhoea for six of the largest British towns, viz.
 Leicester, curvo 1 ; Liverpool, 2 ; London, 3 ; Bristol, 4 ; Portsmouth,
 5 ; and Edinburgh, 6 ; from which it is seen that though the summor
 temperature of London is higher than that of Liverpool and Leicester,
 its diarrhoea mortality is very much less. In this respect London
 contrasts very favourably with the great majority of British large

towns whose summer temperature is scarcely lower, London offers
problems in this field to the sanitary reformer for his solution.
      Figs. 6 to 10 give the curves for thrush, tabes mesenterioa,
enteritis, jaundice, and atrophy and debility, all of which have their
maximum fatality during the hottest period of the year, and all of these,
it will be noted, are bowel complaints. Indeed with the apparent
exception of ono or two nervous diseases, all those diseases which
indicato an increase in their death-rate during the summer months
are bowel complaints.
      An examination of the curvo for the whole mortality (Fig. 4)
shows that the great preponderance of deaths in London takes place
during the coldest months of tho year.              Of the diseases to which
this excessive mortality is due the first place must bo assigned to

diseases     of  the respiratory organs, the more marked of which are given
in Figs. 12 to 15. About one in eight of all deaths that occur is caused
by bronchitis, and one in sixteen by pneumonia; so that nearly one-fifth
of the deaths is occasioned by these two diseases of the respiratory
organs. Our researches appear to warrant the conclusion that the
greatest fatality from these diseases occurs when the temperature is

different degrees, a double-ridged maximum : the one ridge being in the
middle of January, when the temperature falls to the annual minimum,
and the other in March, when the combined qualities of cold and dry-

cidedly at the maximum when the weather is coldest, whereas
laryngitis has its maximum in March, when the weather is coldest
and driest, the last disease thus forming the link connecting the more
strictly throat diseases with diseases of the nervous system.

      But     an element       of weather other than mere temperature plays an
 important        part in bringing about the high death-rate from these
 diseases.        That deleterious atmospheric influence is fog ; and in cases
 where the fog is dense and persistent the mortality from diseases
 of the respiratory organs becomes truly appalling, as happened
 in London in 1880, when the mortality was nearly doubled. An
 examination of the fogs of London shows that they do not commence
 till the autumnal equinox ; and it is at this epoch that asthma (Fig.
 12), which is by far the. most sensitive of all diseases to fog, starts
 from its annual minimum ; and in the end of November and beginning

occurs in the spring months, and the curve suggests that this is more
a disease of the nervous system than of the respiratory organs, a view

 of the most distinguished of our Edinburgh physicians, upwards of
 thirty years ago. The relations of gout to diseases of the nervous

 deaths which occur being caused by consumption.                              Its mortality-
 curve (Fig. 22) shows unmistakably its intimate relations to nervous
 diseases, thus affixing greater significance to its known complications
 with hereditary insanity, scrofula, and some other mental diseases.
     Reference has been made to the influence of the heat of summer
 on certain nervous diseases.                   That influence acts fatally, both
 indirectly    through        the  bowels    in  the case of the young, and directly
 on the nervous centres. The curve for convulsions (Fig. 17) is

identical with that for teething (Fig. 23), and it may be added that the
curve for hydrocephalus is simply a reproduction of the same curves.
Now these curves show a small, but distinct, and, as revealed by each
year's figures, a constantly recurring secondary maximum in summer,
which in the case of London is almost wholly due to the bowel
complications of these diseases.             The curve (Fig. 24) for convulsions
for New York, where the summer temperature is 10° • 0 hotter than in
London, shows this feature of the curve enormously magnified, so
much so, indeed, that instead of being, as in London, an insignificant
secondary maximum, it stands out as the prominent feature of the

curve. Whilst this result is doubtless largely due to complications
with bowel complaints, it is, as an examination of the statistics shows,
in no small degree caused by the direct influence of the great summer
heat of New York on the nervous centres.                    This is impressively shown
by the mortality curve for the whole of the nervous diseases (Fig.
25), which is even more pronounced in this particular than the curve
for convulsions alone (Fig. 24). Keeping this fact in view, the
peaks showing an increased fatality in London from cephalitis
(Fig. 18) and suicides (Fig. 19) during July and August acquire, in
the eyes of the physician, a more impressive significance.

the plague, as a death-producer, obeyed the weather is striking, and

bowel complaints to be influenced by weather.          The curve of mor
tality for the plague bears no resemblance whatever to that for typhus,
or indeed to any disease except bowel complaints.           The fact that
the progress of deaths from plague in relation to weather resembles
so closely the corresponding progress of deaths from bowel complaints,
raises the question whether there may not be a closer alliance between
them than has been suspected.      If  we are correct in regarding such a
question as a fair outcome of this investigation of the relations of
weather and health, it is evident that such investigations may occasion
ally point to a seat of morbid processes which have been cloaked by
prominent phenomena, apparently of a primary, but in reality of a
secondary character.

  [Reprinted, with slight revisions, from the   Fortnightly Review," June  1881.]
IN the course of      some recent inquiries into visual memory,              I was
greatly struck by the frequency of the replies in which my informants
described themselves as subject to
                                          " visions." Those of whom speak  I
were sane and healthy, but were subject notwithstanding                  to visual
presentations, for which they could not account, and which in a few
cases reached the level of hallucinations.         This unexpected prevalence
of a visionary tendency among persons who form a part of ordinary
society seems to me suggestive and worthy of being put on record.
    Many of my facts are derived from personal friends, of whose
accuracy   I  have no doubt.       Another group comes from correspond
ents who have written at length with much painstaking, and whose
letters appear to me to bear internal marks of scrupulous truth
fulness.     A third part has been collected for me by many kind
friends in many countries, each of whom has made himself or herself
an independent centre of inquiry ; and the last, and much the most
numerous portion consists of brief replies by strangers to a series of
questions contained in a circular that          I drew up.     I  have gone over
all this matter with great care, and have cross-tested it in many ways
whilst it was accumulating, just as any conscientious statistician
would, before    I began to form conclusions.          I was soon convinced of
its substantial trustworthiness, and that conviction has in no way
been shaken by subsequent experience.             In short, the evidence of the
               I
four groups have just mentioned is quite as consistent as could have
been reasonably desired.
     In speaking of the tendency among eane and healthy persons to
see images flash unaccountably into existence, it must be recollected
that the images vary greatly in distinctness.             Some are so faint and
evanescent as to appear unworthy of serious notice ; others leave a
deep impression, and others again are so vivid as actually to deceive
the judgment.      All of these belong to the same category, and it is
the assurance of their common origin that affords the justification               I
need for directing scientific attention to what many may be inclined
to contemptuously disregard as the silly vagaries of vacant minds.

      The lowest order of phenomena that admit of being classed as
visions are the " Number forms                             I
                                        " to which have drawn attention on
more than one occasion, but to which               I
                                                must again very briefly allude.
They     are faint  and  fitful in  many  children, but are an abiding mental
peculiarity     in a certain  proportion (say   5 per cent.) of adults, who are
unable, and who have been ever unable as far back as they can recollect,
to think of any number without referring it to its own particular
habitat in their mental field of view. It there lies latent, but is
instantly evoked by the thought or mention of                      it,
                                                              or by any mental
operation      in  which    it     concerned.
                                  is              The  thought of a series of
consecutive numbers             istherefore attended by a vision of them
arranged in   a    perfectly defined and constant position, and this       have      I
called   a    " Number form." Its origin can rarely be referred to
 any nursery diagram, to the clock-face, or to any incident of child
 hood.     Nay, the form         frequently unlike anything the child could
                                 is
 possibly have seen, reaching in long vistas and perspectives, and in
curves of double curvature.            I have even had to get wire models
 made by some of my informants in explanation of what they wished to
 convey.     The only feature that all the forms have in common            their     is
 dependence in some way or other upon the methed of verbal counting.
 as shown by their angles and other divisions occurring at such points
 as those where the 'teens begin, at the twenty's, thirty's, and so on.
 The forms are in each case absolutely unchangeable, except through
a   gradual development in complexity.           Their diversity   endless, and
                                                                            is
 the Number forms of different persons are mutually unintelligible.
       These strange " visions," for Such they must be called, are
 extremely vivid in some cases but are almost incredible to the vast
 majority of mankind, who would set them down as fantastic nonsense                         ;
 nevertheless, they are familiar parts of the mental furniture of the
  rest, in whose imaginations they have been unconsciously formed and
 where they remain unmodified and unmodifiable by teaching.            have          I
 received many touching accounts of their childish experiences from
 persons who see the Number forms, and the other curious visions of
 which I    shall speak.   As    the case with the colour-blind, so with
                                       is
 these seers.   Thoy imagined at first that everybody else had the samo
 way of regarding things as themselves.       Then they betrayed their
 peculiarities by some chance remark that called forth             stare of      a
 surprise, followed by ridicule and     sharp scolding for their silliness,

of adults, but appears to be rather common, though in an ill-developed
degree, among children.     I   can here appeal not only to my own
collection of facts, but to those of others, for the subject has latterly
excited some interest in Germany.      The first widely known ease was
 that of the brothers Nussbaumer, published in 1873 by Professor
 Bruhl, of Vienna, of which the English reader will find an account in
tho last volume of Lewis's Problems of Life and Mind Yp. 280).

any one but myself.      However,     I

pamphlot a few weeks ago, just published in Leipsic by two Swiss
investigators, Messrs. Bleuler and Lchmann.           Their collection of
cases is fully as large as my own, and their results in the more im
portant matters are similar to mine.     One of the two authors had the
faculty very strongly, and the other had not ; so they worked con
jointly with advantage. As my present object is to subordinate
details to the general impression that                I

                                          will simply remark, first, that
 the persistence of the colour association with sounds is fully as re
markable as that of the Number form with numbers. Secondly, that
 the vowel sounds chiefly evoke them.       Thirdly, that the seers are
invariably most minute in their description of the precise tint and
hue of the colour.    They are never satisfied, for instance, with saying
" blue," but will take a great deal of trouble to express or to match
 the particular  blue they mean.     Lastly, no two people agree, or
hardly evor do so, as to the colour they associate with the same sound.
I  have hung upon the wall one of the most extraordinary diagrams of
these colour associations that has,       I
                                       suppose, ever been produced.     It
was drawn by Mr. J. Key, of Graham's Town, South Africa.          He sent
me in the first instance a communication on the subject, which led to
further correspondence, and eventually to the production of this
diagram of colours in connection with letters and words.      I   have no
reason to doubt its trustworthiness, and am bound to say that, strange
as it looks, and elaborate as it    is,
                                    I  havo other written accounts that
almost match it.
     A third curious and abiding fantasy of certain persons        is  in
variably to counoct visualised pictures with words, tho same picture

 1881.]                 on the Visions of Sane Persons.                   647
to the same word.        These are perceived by many in a vague, fleeting
and variable way, but to a few they appear strangely vivid and per
manent.      I  have collected many cases of this peculiarity, and am
much indebted to the authoress, Mrs. Haweis, who sees these pictures,
for her kindness in sketching some of them for me, for permitting
me to exhibit them on the screen, and to use her name in guarantee
 of their genuineness. She says : —
     " Printed words have always had faces to me ; they had definite
expressions, and certain faces made me think of certain words. The
words had no connection with these except sometimes by accident.
The instances      I give are few and ridiculous. When       I think of the
word Beast, it has a face something like a gurgoyle. The word Green
has also a gurgoyle face, with the addition of big teeth. The word
Blue blinks and looks silly, and turns to the right.              The word
Attention has the eyes greatly turned to the left. It is difficult to
                                                  '
draw them properly because, like ' Alice's ' Cheshire cat,' which at
times became a grin witheut a cat, these faces have expression without
                                            "                            " of
features.    The expression of course          [note the naive phrase
course."  —  F. G.] "depends greatly on these of the letters, which have
likewise their faces and figures. All the little a's turn their eyes to
the left, this determines the eyes of Attention.             Ant, however,
looks a littlo down.       Of course these faces are endless as words are,
and it makes my head ache to retain them long enough to draw."
     Some of the figures are very quaint.           Thus tho interrogation
" what?" always excites the idea of a fat man cracking a long whip.
They are not the capricious creations of the fancy of the moment,
but are the regular concomitants of the words, and have been so as far
back as the memory is able to recall.
     When in perfect darkness, if the field of view be carefully watched,
many persons will find a perpetual series of changes to bo going on
automatically and wastefully in it.         I have much evidence of this.
I  will give my own experience the first, which is striking to me,
because    I  am very unimpressionable in these matters.         I visualise
with effort ;    I  am peculiarly inapt to see " after-images," " phes-
phenes,"
            " light-dust," and other phenomena due to weak sight or
sonsitiveness; and, again, before       I  theught of carefully trying,     I
should have emphatically declared that my field of view in the
dark was essentially of a uniform black, subject to an occasional
light-purplo cloudiness and other small variations.         Now, howover,
after habituating myself to examine it with the same sort of strain
that one tries to decipher a sign-post in the dark,       I have found out
that this is by no means the case, but that a kaleidoscopio change of
patterns and forms is continually going on, but they are too fugitive
and elaborate for me to draw with any approach to truth.                 My
deficiencies, however, are well supplied by other drawings                 in
my possession. These are by the He v. George Henslow,                 whoso
visions are far more vivid than mine.              His experiences are not
unlike those of Goethe, who said, in an often-quoted passage, that

648                          .Mi\  F. Galton                        [May   13.
whenever he bent his head and closed his eyes and thought of a
rose, a sort of rosette ma<le its appearance, which would not keep         it
shape steady for a moment, but unfolded from within,                throwing
out a succession of petals, mostly red but sometimes green, and that
it continued to do so witheut change in brightness and without
causing him any fatigue so long as he cared to watch it.                  Mr.
 Henslow, when he shuts his eyes and waits, is sure in a short
time to see before him the clear image of some object or other, but
usually not quite natural in its shape. It then begins to change from
one object to another, in his case also for as long a time as he cares
to watch it. Mr. Henslow has zealously made repeated experiments
on himself, and has drawn what ho sees. He has also tried how far
he is ulilf to mould the visions according to his will.         In one case,
after much effort. he contrived to bring the imagery back to its
                                                            "
starting point, and thereby to form what he terms a visual cycle,"
 The following account is extracted and condensed from his very
interesting letter, and will explain the photographs from his drawings
 that  I am about to throw on the screen.
      The first imago that spontaneously presonted itself was a cross
 bow ; this was immediately provided with an arrow, remarkable for
 its pronounced barb and superabundance of feathering. Some person,
 but too indistinct to recognise much more of him than the hands,
 appeared to shoot the arrow from the bow. The single arrow was
 then accompanied by a flight of arrows from right to left, which com
 pletely occupied the field of vision. These changed into falling stars,
 then into flakes of a heavy snow-storm ; the ground gradually appeared
 as a sheet of snow where previously there had been vacant space.
 Then a well-known rectory, fish-ponds, walls, &c., all covered with
 snow, came into view most vividly and clearly defined. This somehow
 suggested another view, impressed on his mind in childhood, of a
 spring morning, brilliant sun, and a bed of red tulips : the tulips
 gradually vanished except one, which appeared now to be isolated and
 to stand in the usual point of sight.    It was a single tulip, but became
 double.    The petals  then  fell off rapidly in a continuous series until
  there was nothing left but the pistil, but (as is almost invariably the
  case with his objects) that part was greatly exaggerated.      The stigmas
  then changed into three branching brown horns; then into a knob,
  while the stalk changed into a stick. A slight bend in it seems to
  have suggested a centre-bit ; this passed into a sort of pin passing
  through a metal plate ; this again into a lock, and afterwards into a
  nondescript shape, distantly suggestive of tho original cross-bow.
  Here Mr. Henslow endeavoured to force his will upon the visions, and
  to reproduce the cross-bow, but the first attempt was an utter failure.
  The figure changed into a leather strap with loops, but while he still
  endeavoured to change it into a bow the strap broke, the two ends
  were separated, but it happened that an imaginary string connected
  them. This was the first concession of his automatic chain of thoughts
  to his will. By a continued effort the bow came, and then no difficulty

was felt in converting it into the cross-bow and thus returning to the
starting-point.
      Ihave a sufficient variety of cases to prove the continuity between
all  the forms of visualisation, beginning with an almost total absence
of    it,
        and ending with      complete hallucination.
                                  a                         The continuity is,
however, not simply that of varying degrees of intensity, but of
variations in the character of the process itself, so that                 by no
                                                                              it   is
means uncommon to find two very different forms of               concurrent in
                                                                         it
the same person. There are some who visualise well and who also
are seers of visions, who declare that the vision           not   vivid visual
                                                                    is    a
isation, but altogether     different phenomenon.
                                  a                      In short, if we please
to call all sensations due to external impressions " direct" and all
others "induced" then there are many channels through which the
" induction " may take place, and the channel of ordinary visualisation
in the persons just mentioned            different from that through which
                                              is

     The following          good instance of this condition.
                             is   a                                    A friend
writes —

tinctly impressed on the memory. The two kinds of imagery differ
also as regards voluntariness, the image being entirely subservient to
the will, the visions entirely independent of it.          They differ also in
point of suddenness, the images being formed comparatively slowly as
memory recalls each detail, and fading slowly as the mental effort to
retain them        relaxed the visions appearing and vanishing in an

650                              Mr. F. Gallon                       [May  IS,
a   bight which came whenever it was dark or darkish, in bed or other
wise. It is a flight of piuk roses floating in a mass from left to right,
and this cloud or mass of roses is presently effaced by a flight of
'          '
   sparks or gold speckles across them. The sparks totter or vibrate
from left to right, but they fly distinctly upwards : they are like tiny
blocks, half gold, half black, rather symmetrically placed behind each
other, and they are always in a hurry to efface the roses : sometime*
they have come at my call, sometimes by surprise, but they are always
equally pleasing.      What interests me most is that, when a child under
nine, the flight of roses was light, slow, soft, close to my eyes, roses so
large and brilliant and palpable that     I tried to touch thorn : the scent
was overpowering, the petals perfect, with leaves peeping here and
there, texture and motion all natural.      They would stay a long time
before the sparks came, and they occupied a large area in black space.
 Then the sparks came slowly flying, and generally, not always, effaced
the roses at once, and every effort to retain the roses failed.     Since an
early age the flight of roses has annually grown smaller, swifter, and
farther off, till by the time   I  was grown up my vision had become a
speck, so instantaneous that      I had hardly time to realise that it was
 there before the fading sparks showed that it was past.         This is how
 they still come. The pleasure of them is past, and it always depresses
me to speak of them, though         I do not now, as    I  did when a child,
 connect the vision with any elevated spiritual state. But when       I read
 Tennyson's
                '
                              I
                  Holy Grail,' wondered whether anybody else had had
 my vision, — Kose-red, with beatings in it.'
                  '
                                                      I   may add,  I  was a
 London child who never was in the country but once, and I
 connect no particular flowers with that visit.           I  may almost say
 that   I    had never seen a rose, certainly not a quantity of them
 together."
      A common form of vision is a phantasmagoria, or the appearance
  of a crowd of phantoms, sometimes hurrying past like men in a street.
  It is occasionally seen in broad daylight, much more often in the
  dark ; it may be at the instant of putting out tho candle, but it
  generally comes on when the person is in bed, preparing to sleep, but
  by no means yet asleep.       I  know no less than three men, eminent
  in the scientific world, who have these phantasmagoria in one form or
  another.     A near relotive of my own had them in a marked degree.
  Sho was eminently sane, and of such good constitution that her
  faculties were hardly impaired until near her death at ninety.
  She frequently described them to me.            It gavo her amusement
  during an idle hour to watch these faces, for their expression was
  always pleasing, though never strikingly beautiful.          No two faces
  were ever alike, and no face ever resembled that of any acquaint
  ance.      When she was not well the faces usually came nearer
  to her, sometimes almost suffocatingly close. She never mistook
  them for reality, although they were very distinct.          This is quite
  a typical case, similar in most respocts to many others that I have.
       A notublo proportion of sane persons have lind not only visions

1881.]              on the Visions   of Sane Persons.                 651
but actual hallucinations of sight, sound, or other sense, at one or
more periods of their lives.         I
                                    have a considerable packet of
instances contributed by my personal friends, besides a large number
communicated to me by other correspondents.          One lady, a distin
guished authoress, who was Rt the time a little fidgeted, but in no
way overwrought or ill, assured me that she once saw the principal
character of one of her novels glide through the door straight up to
her. It was about the sizo of a large doll, and it disappeared as
suddenly as it came.      Another lady, the daughter of an eminent
musician, often imagines she hears her father playing. The day she
told me of it the incident had again occurred. She was sitting in a
room with her maid, and she asked the maid to open the door that
she might hear the music better.       The moment the maid got up the
hallucination disappeared.       Again, anothor lady, apparently in
vigorous health, and belonging to a vigorous family, told me that
during some past months she had been plagued by voices.                The
                                                                     "
words were at first simple nonsense ; then the word " pray             was
frequently repeated ; this was followed by some more or less coherent
sentences of little import, and finally the voices left her. In short,
the familiar hallucinations of the insane are to be met with far more
frequently than is commonly supposed, among people moving in
society and in good working health.
    I  have now nearly done with my summary of facts ; it remains to
make a few comments on them.
     The wcirdness of visions lies in their sudden appearance, in their
vividness while present, and in their sudden departure.        An incident
in the Zoological Gardens struck me as a helpful simile.      I  happened
to walk to the seal-pond at a moment when a sheen rested on tho
unbroken surface of the water.         After waiting a while      Ibecame
suddenly aware of the head of a seal, black, conspicuous, and
motionless, just as though it had always been there, at a spot on
which my eye had rested a moment previously and seen nothing.
Again, after a whilo my eyo wandered, and on its returning to the
spot, the seal was gone.     The water had closed in silenco over its
head without leaving a ripple, and the sheen on the surface of the
pond was as unbroken as when     I first reached it. Where did the seal
come from, and whither did it go?          This could easily have been
answered if the glare had not obstructed the view of the movements
of the animal under water.     As it was, a solitary link in a continuous
chain of actions stood isolated from all the rest.       So it is with tho
visions ; a single stage in a series of mental processes emerges into
the domain of consciousness.        All that precedes and follows lies
outside of it, and its character can only be inferred.       We see in a
general way, that  a  condition of the presentation of visions lies in
the over-sensitiveness of certain tracks or domains of brain action,
and the uuder-sensitiveness of others    ;   certain stages in    a mental
process being vividly represented in consciousness while the other
stages arc unfclt.  It   isalso well known that   a  condition of partial

collected seem        to   show      that    it  may also coexist with all the
appearances of good health and sober judgment.
      A convenient distinction is made between hallucinations and
illusions. Hallucinations are defined as appearances wholly due to
fancy ; illusions, as misrepresentations of objects actually seen.                 There
is also a hybrid case which depends on fanciful visions fancifully
observed. The problems we have to consider are, on the one hand,
those connected with
                             " induced " vision, and, on the other hand,
                                                                                    those
connected with the interpretation of vision, whether the vision be
direct or induced.
      It is probable that much of what passes for hallucination proper
belongs in reality to the hybrid case, being an illusive interpretation
of some induced visual cloud or blur.                  I spoke of the ever-varying
 patterns    in  the  field    of  view   ; these,   under   some slight functional
 chaufie, may      become       more   consciously present, and be interpreted
 into fantasmal appearances. Many cases, if time allowed, could be
 adduced to support this view.
      I will begin, then, with illusions. What is the process by which
 they   are  established ? There is no simpler way of understanding it
 than by trying, as children often do, to see " faces in the fire," and to
 carefully watch the way in which they are first caught. Let us call
 to mind at the same time the experience of past illnesses, when the
 listless gaze wandered over the patterns on the wall-paper and the
 shadows of the bed-curtains, and slowly evoked faces and figures that
 wero not easily laid again. The process of making the faces is so
 rapid in health that it is difficult to analyse it without the recollection
 of what took place more slowly when we wore weakened by illness.

                                                               I    believe, the small-
 ness of the area covered by the glance at any instant, so that the eye
 has to travel over     a   long track before     it   has visited every part of the
 object   towards   which     the  attention is    generally directed. It  is    as with
a   plough,    that   must     travel   many    miles  before   the  whole   of
                                                                             a     sm ill
 field can be tilled, but with this important difference — the plough
 travels methodically up and down in parallel furrows, the eye
 wanders in devious curves, with abrupt bends, and the direction of its
 course at any instant depends on four causes              : on tho easiest sequence
of muscular motion, speaking in general sense, on idiosyncrasy, on
                                         a
the mood, and on the associations current at the moment. The effect
 of idiosyncrasy      is   excellently illustrated by the "Number forms,"
 where     we  saw   that  a    very special sharply defined track of mental
vision    was   preferred by each individual who sees them.                  The influ
 ence   of  the  mood     of   the  moment is     shown   in  the  curves  that  charac
 terise  the  various    emotions,     as  the  lank  drooping   lines  of grief, which
 make the weeping willow so fit an emblem of it.                       In constructing
lire'faces  it  seems to me that the eye in its wanderings tends to follow           a

  favourite course, and it especially dwells upon the marks that happen
  to coincide with that course.          It feels its way, easily diverted by
  associations based on what has just been noticed, until at last, by the
  unconscious practice of a system of " trial and error," it hits upon
  a track that will suit — one that is easily run over and that strings
  together accidental marks in a way that happens to form a naturally
  connected picture.        The fancy picture is then dwelt upon, all that is
  incongruous    with   it  becomes disregarded, while all deficiencies in it
  are supplied by the fantasy. Theso latest stages might be represented
  by a diorama.       Three lanterns would converge on the same screen.
  The first throws an image of what the imagination will discard, the
  second of that which it will retain, the third of that which it will
  supply.    Turn on the first and second, and the picture on the screen
  will be identical with that which fell on the retina. Shut off the
 first and turn on the third, and the picture will be identical with the
 illusion.
      Visions, like dreams, are often mere patchworks built up of bits of
 recollections.     The following is one of these :—
      " When passing a shop in Tottenham Court Road,              I went in to
 order a Dutch cheese, and the proprietor (a bullet-headed man whom
 I  had never seen before) rolled a cheese on the marble slab of his
 counter, asking me if that one would do.            I answered ' Yes,' left the
 shop, and theught no more of the incident.             The following evening,
 on closing my eyes,      I  saw a head detached from the body rolling about
 slightly on a white surface.          I  recognised the face, but could not
 remember where       I  had seen it, and it was only after thinking about it
                         I
 for some time that identified it as that of the cheesemonger who had
 sold me the cheese on the previous day.           I may mention that     I have
                                          I
 often seen the man since, and that found the vision         I saw was exactly
                             I
 like him, although if had been asked to describe the man before               I
saw the vision    I  should have been unable to do so."
      Recollections need not be combined like mosaic work ; they may be
blended, on the principle        I described two years ago, of making com
posite portraits.      I  showed that if two lanterns were converged upon
the same screen, and the portrait of one person was put into one, and
that of another person into the other, the portraits being taken under
similar aspects and similar lights, then on adjusting the two images
eye to eye and mouth to mouth, and so superposing them as exactly
as the conditions admit, a new face will spring into existence.          It will
have a striking appearance of individuality, and will bear a family
likeness to each of its constituents.              I  also showed that these
composite portraits admitted of being made photographically from a
large number of components.              I  suspect that the phantasmagoria
may bo due to blended memories ; the number of possible combina
tions would be practically endless, and each combination would give
a new face.     There would thus be no limit to the dies in the coinage
of the brain.
     I have found that the peculiarities of visualisation, such as the

654                            Mr. F. Gallon                          [May  13,
tendency to see Number-forms, and the still rarer tendency to asso
ciate colour with sound, are strongly hereditary, and         I  should infer,
what facts seem to confirm, that the tendency to be a seer of visions is
equally so. Under those circumstances we should expect that it wonld
Iks equally developed in different races, and that a large natural gift
of the visionary faculty might become characteristic not only of
certain families, as among the second-sight seers of Scotland, but of
certain races, as that of the Gipsies.
     It happens that the mere acts of fasting, of want of sleep, and of
solitary musing, aro severally conducive to visions.            I  have myself
been told of cases in which persons accidentally long deprived of
food became subject to them. Ono was of a pleasure-party driven
out to sea, and not being able to reach the coast till nightfall, at a
place where they got shelter but nothing to eat.        They were mentally
at ease and conscious of safety, but they were all troubled with
visions, half dreams, and half hallucinations.         The cases of visions
following protracted     wakefulness   are   well known,    and    I also have
 collected a few. As regards the maddening effoct of solitariness, it
 may be sufficiently inferred from the recognised advantages of social
 amusements in the treatment of the insane.              It follows that the
 spiritual discipline undergone for purposes of self-control and self-
 mortification has also the incidental effect of producing visions.          It
 is to be expected that these should often bear a close relation to the
 prevalent subjects of theught, and although they may be really no
 more than the products of one portion of the brain, which another
 portion of the same brain is engaged in contemplating, they often,
 through error, receive a religious sanction.      This is notably the case
 among half-civilised races.
      The number of great men who have been once, twice, or more
 frequently subject to hallucinations is considerable.        A list, to which
 it would be easy to make large additions, is given by Brierre do
 Boismont ('Hallucinations, &c.' 1802), from whom             I   translate the
 following account of the star of the first Napoleon, which he heard,
 second-hand, from General Bapp : —
      " In 1806 General
                          Bapp, on his return from the siege of Dantzic,
 having occasion to speak to the Emperor, entered his study without
 being announced.       He found him s0 absorbed that his entry was
 unperceived.     The  General,  seeing (he Emperor continue motionless,
 thought he might bo ill, and purposely made a noiso. Napoleon
 immediately roused himself, and without any preamble, seizing Bnpp
 by the arm, said to him, pointing to the sky, ' Look there, up there.'
  The General remained silent, but on being asked a second time, he
                                             '       '
 answered that he perceived nothing.           What ! replied the Emperor,
   you do not see it '? It is my star, it is before you, brilliant ; then
 '                                                                        '
                                           '
 animating by degrees, he cried out, it has never abandoned me,               I
  see it on all great occasions, it commands mo to go forward, and it is
 a constant sign of good fortune to me.' "
      It appears that stars of this kind, so frequently spoken of in

1881]                 on the   Visions of Sane Persons.                  655
history, and so woll kuowu as a metaphor in language, are a common
hallucination of the insane. Brierre de Boismont has a chapter on
the stars of great men.      I  cannot doubt that fantasies of this descrip
tion were in some      cases   the  basis of that firm belief in astrology
which not a few persons of eminence formerly entertained.
     The hallucinations of great men may be accounted for in part by
their sharing a tendency which we have seen to be not uncommon in
the human race, and which, if it happens to be natural to them, is
liable to be developed in their over-wrought brains by the isolation
of their lives. A man in the position of the first Napoleon could
have no intimate associates ; a great philosopher who explores ways of
thought far abend of his contemporaries must have an inner world in
which he passes long and solitary hours.          Great men may be even
indebted to touches of madness for thoir greatness ; the ideas by
which they are haunted, and to whose pursuit they devote themselves,
and by which they rise to eminence, having much in common with tho
monomania of insanity.        Striking instances of great visionaries may
be mentioned, who had almost beyond doubt those very nervous
seizures with which the tendency to hallucinations            is intimately
connected. To take a single instance, Socrates, whose daimon was an
audible not a visual appearance, was, as has been often pointed out,
subject to cataleptic seizure, standing all night through in a rigid
attitude.
     It is remarkable how largely the visionary temperament has mani
fested itself in certain periods of history and epochs of national life.
My interpretation of the matter, to a certain extent, is this — That
the visionary tendency is much more common among sano people
than is generally suspected.         In early life, it seems to be a hard
lesson to an imaginative child to distinguish between the real and
visionary world.      If the fantasies are habitually laughed at and
otherwise discouraged, the child soon acquires the power of dis
tinguishing them; any incongruity or nonconformity is quickly
noted, the vision is found out and discredited, and is no further
attended to.    In this way the natural tendency to see them is blunted
by repression.    Therefore, when popular opinion is of a matter-of-fact
kind, the seers of visions keep quiet ; they do not like to bo thought
 fanciful or mad, and they hide their experiences, which only come to
light through inquiries such as these that      I  have been making.    But
let the tido of opinion change and grow favourable to supornaturalism,
then the seers of visions come to the front.        It is not that a faculty
previously non-existent has been suddenly evoked, but that a faculty
long smothered in secret has been suddenly allowed freedom to
express itself, and it may be to run into extravaganco owing to the
removal of reasonable safeguards.

                   WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                           Friday, June   3, 1881.
      Thomas Boycott, M.D.        F.L.S. Vice-President, in the Chair.
                  Professor W. G. Adams, M.A. F.KS.
           Magnetic Disturbance, Aurorce, and Earth Currents.
The object of establishing      a magnetic observatory is to determine at
any instant    the  direction    and magnitude of the earth's magnetic
force.
     The direction of the magnetic force of the earth is the direction
in  which   a small magnetic needle would point when it is freely
suspended, so as to turn about an axis passing through its centre of
gravity.    But it is not easy to suspend a magnetic needle so as to
turn freely, and yet to be sure that the axis about which it turns
passes accurately through the centre of gravity of the needle ; and if
it does not so pass, then on suspending the needle wo have not only
the magnetic force, but also the gravitating force of the earth acting
 upon it to turn it about its axis, and the position which it takes up
shows us the direction of these combined forces upon the magnetic
needle.
     This direction depends upon the mass of the needle, for to that its
weight is due ; it depends upon the form of the needle, and the
 position of its centre of gravity with regard to the axis on which it is
hung ; it depends also on the magnetic properties of the substance,
so that it is not easy to determine oven the direction of the magnetic
force by a plan which, theoretically, is so very simple.
     Instead of attempting to make the required determinations by
such a method, it is necessary that a steadier mode of suspension
should be adopted, and that may be done as soon as it is discovered
 in what vertical plane the force of gravity, combined with the earth's
magnetic force, will cause such a needle to rest.
     This is usually done by loading a steel needle at one end, and
 then magnetising it with its poles so arranged that the extra weight
of the heavier end shall balance the downward pull of the magnetic
force on the other end.        In this case the needle when magnetised
 will remain at rest in a horizontal direction when suspended on a
point on which it can turn freely in a horizontal plane.
     A magnetic needle suspended in this way has been called a
declination needle.      Such a needle is employed in the mariner's
compass,   in our  galvanometers     for measuring currents of electricity,
and in magnetic observatories for determining the declination, or
what is sometimes called the variation, of the magnetic needle.       This

1881.]     on  Magnetic Disturbance, Aurorce, and Earth Currents.         657
needle determines the position of the vertical plane in which lies tho
direction of the earth's magnetic force, and which is called the plane
of the magnetic meridian.            The plane of the magnetic meridian is
usually different from the vertical plane through the north and south
poles, which is called the geographical meridian, or the meridian, and
the angle between these two planes is the declination or variation of
the magnetic needle.
     If  such a magnetic needle as       I  have just described be supported
on horizontal knife-edges        instead   of being supported on a point, the
needle when magnetised may remain at rest balanced in a horizontal
direction, one end being pulled downwards by the earth's vertical
magnetic force, and the other by the force of gravity.           Any change
in the intensity of the vertical magnetic force of the earth will be
shown by an up or down motion of the marked end of the needle.
Such an instrument, called a balance magnetometer, is specially
adapted for showing any changes in the vertical magnetic force of
the earth, and any changes or disturbances of the earth's vertical
magnetic force of which        I  may speak this evening havo been deter
mined by      means   of  such    a  balance magnetometer. We have then
our declination     or  variation    needle to determino the vertical plane
called the magnetic      meridian,    and we have our balance magnetometer
to determine any changes            which   may take placo in the vertical
magnetic     force of the earth.
     By the declination needle we can not only determino the plane of
the magnetic needle, but by making the needle oscillate to and fro
horizontally and counting the number of oscillations in a given time,
we can determine the horizontal pull upon tho poles of the needle ;
i. e. the intensity of the earth's horizontal magnetic forco upon the
 needle, just as by the swing of a simple pendulum in a vertical plano
under the action of the force of gravity we can determine the pull of
 the forco of gravity upon the bob of the pendulum.             By a similar
 method and by a properly suspended needle, either the vertical forco
 or the total magnetic force of the earth may be determined.
     In order then to determine the direction of the earth's magnetic
 force, we may make use of a declination needlo to give us the vertical
 plane, and place the dipping needle in such a position that it will
 oscillate in that plane.       When it comes to rest it will point in tho
 direction of the total magnetic force, i. e. in the direction through the
 room of Faraday's lines of magnetic force.            In order to determine
 the magnitude of that force the horizontal force may be found by
 finding the number of oscillations of the declination needle in the
 way that     I have already explained, and these three determinations
 will give us the direction and magnitude of the earth's total magnetic
 force.
      Another method of making the required determinations is to
 take a coil of copper wire, which is wound on a circular frame in such
 a way as to be capable of spinning on a diameter of the circular
 frame.

658                        Professor  W. O. Adams                [Juno  3,
     Faraday showed that on turning such a coil in a magnetic field a
current of electricity is induced in the coil, and the strength of this
current is proportional to the number of linos of force cut by the
coil.
     We may describe such an arrangement as a magneto-electric
machine, in which the magnet employed is the earth itself. By means
of this instrument we may determine either the horizontal or the
vertical magnetic force of the earth. By placing the axis vertical and
spinning the coil at a given rate we may determine the horizontal
force, and by placing the axis horizontal in the magnetic meridian
and spinning the coil at the same rate we may determine the vertical
force, the currents produced in the two cases being in the same ratio
as the numbers of the lines of force cut in the two positions.
     The greater the angle at which the axis of rotation is inclined to
the direction of the lines of force, the greater will be the number of
them included in the revolving circle and the greater the induced
current produced in the coil.
     Thus placing the axis in different positions we get currents of
different strengths, and may readily see that we get the greatest
current whon the axis is at right angles to the direction of the lines
of force, i. o. to the line of the dip.
     The curront produced in each half-turn of a coil of wire revolving
on an axis is proportional to the number of lines of force cut by the
coil during its rotation, so that the total current in the coil will be
proportional to the number of lines of force cut by the coil multiplied
by the number of turns of wire in the coil.
     When the axis of rotation is in the magnetic meridian, but per
pendicular to the lines of magnetic force of the earth, the current in
that half of the coil which is moving from west to east will be fivm
north to south, and the current in the other half of the coil which is
moving from east to west will be from south to north, so that in tho
whole coil we get during every half-turn a current in one direction
all round the coil.
     During the next half-turn we get a curront all round the coil
in the same direction as looked at from without, i. e. in the opposite
direction in the coil of wire.       The direction of the current in the
coil, as we look at it from the east, is the same as the direction of
rotation of the coil as we look at it from the north.
     A continuous current may be obtained from the coil by reversing
the connections with the ends of the coil by means of a commutator
at the same time as the currents are reversed in the coil.
     We may further make use of such a coil to find the direction of
the lines of force, for if we place the axis parallel to the lines of
force, the currents in opposite halves of the coil will balance one
another, because each line of force is cut twico by the coil, and so
no current is produced in the external circuit through the galvano
meter.
     If, then,  we place the coil so as to get no current when wo rotate

      We will suppose now that for some point of time, say June 1st at
twelve o'clock ihid-day, the three magnetic elements,   i.  e. the declina
tion, the horizontal force, and the vertical force, have been determined,
we have now to consider the changes or disturbances produced in these
magnetic elements, and the connection of these changes with other
phenomena, and especially the connection between auroras, earth
currents, and the larger and more irregular magnetic disturbances.
 I     have already drawn attention to the declination needle and the
balance magnetometer for measuring the changes of declination and
of the vertical force.
     For measurement of the changes in the horizontal force special
                                                                  a
 instrument     isemployed, called a bifilar magnetometer, in which     s
magnet     is suspended by two threads which are so placed that by
their torsion acting against the horizontal magnetic force of the
earth, the magnet       kept at rest in horizontal position in direction
                          is          a                       a
at right angles to the magnetic meridian.        This completes the list
of instruments for our magnetic observatory.         Any change or dis
turbance of the horizontal force pulls this magnet round more or less
in the horizontal plane, and its change of position     is observed as in
the other instruments.       The resultsI  have to bring before you this
evening have been derived from the photographic registrations of
similar instruments in different parts of the world, so that the motion
of the needle has recorded its own tale on the prepared paper which
is wrapped on       cylinder driven by clockwork, and so placed as to
                     a
receive the spot of light reflected by the moving magnetic needle.
     First, there are regular daily and yearly changes, showing that the
sun produces regular changes in the three magnetic elements, which
depend on the time of the day and the season of the year, so that the
change of position and apparent motion of the sun with respect to
the place of observation produce regular magnetic changes.           These
regular daily changes are accompanied by and have very generally
been supposed to be due to electric currents or electric waves
traversing the earth's crust, and a discussion by Dr. Lloyd of the
observations made by Mr. Barlow in 1847 of currents on telegraph
wires showed         very close relationship
                     a                          between the two-hourly
changes of the declination of the needle and the changes of intensity
and direction of earth currents on telegraph lines.
     Both Dr. Lamont and Dr. Lloyd conclude, from their comparisons
of earth currents and magnetic changes, that the changes of the
declination needle cannot be due to the direct action of the electric
current traversing the earth's crust, but that these currents or waves,
extending to    a considerable depth, alter by induction the magnetism
of the earth itself, and this change of magnetism causes the observed
changes in the declination needle.         Thus the magnetic changes
are the indirect effects of (not the earth current in its immediate
neighbourhood but of)        change in the magnetism of the earth itself,

 which may be due to an electric wave extending over a considerable
area of the earth's surface.    The point towards which the total earth
 current is directed follows the sun and seems to lag two or three
hours behind, but not the same distance behind at different places.
     These earth currents have been ascribed to different causes : thus
 Dr. Lamont regards them as the results of electric force emanating
 from the sun ; Oe Saussure regards them as developed by evaporation,
 the vapour being positively charged and the water being negative ;
 Dr. Lloyd regards them as effects of solar heat ; whilst M. de la Rive
ascribes them to chemical actions going on in the interior of the solid
 crust of the earth, the electricity being transported into the atmo
 sphere by evaporation. Mr. Ellis, of the Greenwich Observatory, has
shown the intimate relation between solar action and the regular
 diurnal magnetic changes of declination and horizontal force at
 Greenwich Observatory during thirty-five years, from 1841 to 1876,
 by a comparison of the observations of these elements. The results
of his observations are shown on a large diagram which has been
enlarged from his curves (published in the Phil. Trans, part ii. 1880,
p. 541), and they show what a close relationship exists between solar
activity and terrestrial magnetic changes. There are not only daily
and yearly periods of the variations of the different magnetic elements,
but there also seems to be in the horizontal intensity a period of
twenty-five or twenty-six days, which is the time of rotation of the
sun on his axis.
     Other recent investigations have shown that these regular mag
netic changes depend not only on the sun, but that they are also in
part due to the action of the moon, and these portions depend upon
the length of the lunar day and on the position of the moon with
regard to the earth. Just as there are regular earth currents whose
direction depends upon the sun, which we may call the solar earth-
currents, so there are lunar earth-currents, which go through their
changes under the action of the moon, and it has been shown that the
effects are produced not immediately under the moon, but there is a
lagging behind in the case of the lunar earth-currents just as in the
case of solar earth-currents.    In the case of the lunar earth-currents
we cannot attribute the production of the electricity either to heat or
to thermo-electric currents from one part to another of the earth's
crust, and wo must therefore look for some other source.         May we
not find it in the fact that the moon causes tides in the solid crust of
the earth just as she causes tides in the oceans ?   The earth's crust ia
made up of elastic materials and materials capable of yielding and
altering their form to a considerable nmount with the change in the
direction of the pull of the moon upon them.     This crust also contains
magnetic substances in abundance, which alter their form under the
moon's attraction, and so from the changes of position of masses of
magnetic matter changes are produced in the magnetism of the earth,
which must give rise to induced currents of electricity or earth
currents. Let us imagine a conductor of electricity outside the earth

1881.]     on Magnetic Disturbance, Aurorce,  and Earth Currents.      661
stretching from the North Pole to the equator and fixed in space, with
the earth, a magnetic body, revolving beneath it from west to east ;
then it follows, from Faraday's laws of induced currents, that the
revolution of the earth on its axis would cause a current in the fixed
conductor in a direction from the pole to the equator.
    If the conductor moved over tho surface of tho earth from west to
east, and the earth did not revolve, or revolved at a slower rate, then
the current in the conductor would be from the equator to the pole.
The current depends upon the relative motion of the earth and the
wire.
     If, then, we have an insulated wire running north and south, the
tides in the earth's crust of which    I have spoken will be equivalent
to a lagging behind of magnetic matter, and so we may expect in that
wire a current of electricity whose general direction would be from
the equator to the pole. The position of the wire with reference to
tho magnetic pole of the earth would modify the direction of these
earth currents, and it is quite conceivable that the position of England
with regard to the magnetic pole might cause these regular earth
currents to be greatest in tho south-west and north-east direction.
The lagging of the lunar earth-currents behind the position of the
moon would also be accounted for by the lagging of the tides behind
the moon.
    If   this is a true cause for some portion at least of the lunar eartlv
currents, then tho same reasoning applied to the sun may in a smaller
degreo apply to the case of tho regular solar diurnal earth currents,
and may help to account for the lagging behind of the effects due to the
sun, so that the fact that the greatest solar effect happens about
2.30 p.m. may not be entirely due to the fact that that is the hottest
part of the day, but may also in part depend upon the tides.
    We have now to consider those more sudden changes of the suspended
magnets which are distinguished by the name magnetic disturbances.
     In 1874, Dr. Lloyd said of them : — " The duration and the mag
nitude of these oscillations are as yet outside the domain of law, and
probably depend upon so many operating causes that, like the gusts
and lulls of the wind in an atmospherie storm, they will long baffle all
attempts to refer them to the actuating forces, or even to reduce them
 to order."
     Certain facts relating to these disturbances have long been known.
 From the series of observations started by Gauss in 1834, and made
 every five minutes at the same times at a variety of places at first in
 Europe, and afterwards in various parts of the world, the disturb
 ing power was found to increase in northern latitudes, also it was
 made out that the appearance of a disturbance in several places
 occurred at the same time, but thero were great differences in the
 results at different places.
     In Europe the agreement was very closo, and also in America, but
 the agreement between Europe and America was not so satisfactory.
     The force seemed to originate in a certain point in the interior of
                                                              2 z 2

 the earth, and the direction of the disturbing force seemed to be
 constant, yet sometimes there wore great differences in the deviations
 at places not far apart, and from the result of his observations Weber
 was led to believe that there was a centre of disturbances which was
 somewhere in the neighbourhood of St. Petersburg.
     However sudden and unconnected single disturbances may seem
 to be, they still follow certain laws in their occurrence ; Sabine found
 that they had daily and yearly variations from their mean values,
  and that they had an eleven-year period, which agreed with the
 eleven-year period of the appearance of spots upon the sun.
     Disturbances are more frequent in summer than in winter, and
 this applies to each hemisphere ; and it has been confirmed by
 various observers that they are also subject to the influence of the
 moon.     Lamont says of these disturbances, their cause is a force
 which is subject to certain laws, but which does not act constantly ;
 the mean direction and frequency have yet to be discovered.
     Observations have shown that the magnetic disturbances and
 electric currents on the earth are so nearly related to one another,
 that people naturally look upon the electric currents either in the
 crust of the earth, or in the atmosphere outside     it, as the cause of
 the magnetic disturbances.      These currents in the earth have usually
 been attributed to changes of temperature, because they also are found
 to be in some way governed by the sun.
     Now let us come to more recent observations of magnetic dis
 turbances, with the improved methods of recording observations by
 photography which are now available.        For some years past photo
 graphic records have been taken of the magnetic elements, but the
 curves have been laid aside, and very little use has been made of
 them so much so, that some three or four years ago

 round to those scientific men who were supposed to be interested in
 the mutter, to know whethor   it   was advisable to continue the photo
 graphic records of magnetic changes at Melbourne, which         the most

except Mauritius, where such records are taken. Mr. Ellery did not
for one moment suppose that they were of no value, but as no use was
made of them he wished to know whether the money expended might
not be better applied to another purpose.          This matter has been
taken up by the Eew Committee, of which Dr. De La Rue                 isthe
 Chairman, and recommendation was made that the directors of all
               a
observatories which possess instruments of the Eew pattern should
be invited to send to Kew their photographic records, or careful
tracings of them, for a   given period, so that a   comparison might be
made of the results.
     The period chosen was the month of March 1879, and records for
the whole month have been sent from Lisbon, Coimbra, Stonyhurst,
Vienna, St. Petersburg, and Bombay, in the northern hemisphere, and
from Melbourne and the Mauritius in the southern hemisphere.

1881.]     on Magnetic Disturbance, Aurorce, and   Earth Currents.      663
      A preliminary account of a comparison of the declination curves
from the European stations was brought before the British Associa
tion last year at Swansea, and this evening        I have to bring before
you some further points which come out of these comparisons.
      It must be remembered that at northern stations the horizontal
force is smaller in proportion to the whole force than it is at stations
nearer to the equator, so that the same disturbance will produce less
effect on the horizontal force or on the declination needle in latitudes
near the equator.
      Also the needles at different stations are by no means in the same
state of sensibility, and even at the same station they change with
time, so that they are not always equally sensitive, and when they
lose their magnetism they have to be remagnetised.
      Let us take the disturbances on March 15-16, 1879 (see Plate 1),
which will illustrate some of the points which        I wish to bring out
prominently.
      Not only do magnetic changes occur at the same time at different
stations, but there is a great similarity between them.
      We see that soon after 10 a.m., Greenwich time, on March 15,
 1879, there is a disturbance wave showing first a diminution and then
 an increase in the horizontal force at St. Petersburg, Vienna, Kew,
 and Lisbon.      At Melbourne, in Australia, there is a similar disturb
 ance at the same time both in the declination and in the horizontal
 force.
      Again between 2 and 3 p.m., and between 4 and 5, there are very
 small disturbances shewing themselves at the same absolute time in
 the horizontal force and declination curves. About 5.20 p.m. there
 is a well-marked increase in the horizontal force and eastward
 deflection of the declination needles.
       About 9 . 30 p.m., Greenwich time, a storm begins which lasts for
 about an hour.     It is felt in the northern and in the southern hemi
 spheres, near to and on both sides of the equator. At all European
 stations the horizontal force is increased during the first part of the
 storm and then diminished.          At Lisbon the vertical force is first
 increased and then diminished, and at St. Petersburg and Stonyhurst
 there is a diminution in the vertical force at the same time as at Lisbon.
 If   we regard the declination needles, we find that at St. Petersburg, Zi-
  ka-Wei and Melbourne, and at Bombay the declination westward is
  first increased and then diminished, whereas at Eew and Lisbon the
  motions are in the opposite direction.       The declination at Vienna
  seems to be intermediate between Eew and St. Petersburg, but the
  carve is incomplete.     At Bombay and the Mauritius, near to, but on
  opposite sides of the equator, the declination needles are deflected
  opposite ways. The local time at these places was from 1 to 2 o'clock
  at night.     Now in what way can we account for such magnetic
  disturbances as these ?    If we assume that by magnetic induction from
  some causo or other the earth's magnetism is altered, then the position
  of the magnet which would produce the disturbance must be such that

6G4                      Professor W. 6. Adamt                   [June  3.
its pole which attracts the marked end of our iicedle must lie at the
beginning of the disturbance to the east of Kew and Lisbon, to the
north of Vienna, and to the north-west of St. Petersburg ; the Lisbon
vertical force curve also shows it to be below the surface of the earth.
Hence an inductive action equivalent to a change of position of the
north magnetic pole towards the geographical pole would account for
these changes. The strengthening and weakening of a magnet with its
north pole to the north on the meridian of Vienna might possibly
account for the magnetic changes observed between 9 .30 and 10 .30 at
night, Greenwich time, on March 15, 1879. If we attempt to explain this
disturbance by currents of electricity or discharges of statical elec
tricity in the air above the needles, then we must imagine that at first
there is a strong current from the south-west over St. Petersburg,
from the west over Vienna, and from the north-west over Kew and
Lisbon, the vertical force needle at Lisbon showing that the current
from the north-west lies somewhat to the cast of Lisbon ; that at the
Mauritius this current is from the north, and at Bombay from the
south.
     Hence we must imagine that a current of electricity passes down
from the north-west to the south-east, going on towards the east over
Vienna and towards the north-east over St. Petersburg.         This must
be kept up very much along the same line throughout the first part of
the disturbance, and then the current or currents must be altered in
strength in the same manner at all stations.
    We will next consider what would hardly be called a magnetic
storm, but a few very small deviations of the magnetic needle, lasting
from about 5.30 to 7.30 P.M. on March 26, 1879 (see Plate 2). Only
the comparison of the originals will give the closeness of the
similarity of the curves, and the curves for Vienna and Kew are
coincident.
     When the declination needle is deflected to the west, the horizontal
force needle is deflected with its marked cud towards the south, BO
that in this disturbance the two needles are drawn towards the south-
 west at the same time with greater or less power, and twelve similar
curves are clearly traced out in the Vienna and Kew curves during
the two hours.     From the remarkable similarity in these disturbance*
and their occurrence at the same time, we should expect that the canee
of disturbance is so far removed from the places of observation that
the difference of their distances from it need not bo considered.    This
might not unreasonably be urged as an argument in support of a
theory that such disturbances are due directly to the action of the
sun regarded as a magnetic body.         These disturbances are all so
very small, that but for the comparison of photographs they would
probably be lost sight of, yet we see that the same deflections occur
ut the same instant at Eew and at Vienna, at St. Petersburg and at
Melbourne.     The numerical comparisons of observations made every
five minutes on certain days previously fixed upon would probably
never have shown the way in which these minute changes of magnetic

power of the earth at widely distant places are related to one another.
In ono or two cases Seuor Capello and Professor Balfour Stewart
had compared the Lisbon and Kew curves for a particular disturb
ance, but the photographic magnetic records have never before been
collected from other stations, and there has been no opportunity of
comparing them. From the precise similarity of the forms of the
curves in many cases we may say that the rate of change of magnetic
disturbances at widely distant stations is the same.      There is nothing
fitful or flashing in such disturbances as these of March 26th. We
might imagine a current in the crust of the earth, or a current or
transfer of electricity in the air, near to, i.e. within 20 or 30 miles of
each of these observatories, but to imagino the same current and the
same variations    of the current at so many different stations all
changing in the same way at tlie same instant is difficult, unless it
can be shown in what way all these changes are connected with the
cause of such a regular electric discharge.      It seems easier to imagine
that such changes as these are duo to a change produced by induction
in the magnetism of the earth itself by some distant body. It is easy
to show that the magnetism produced by a current in a magnetic sub
stance round which it flows is greater in its action on a small magnetic
needle than the direct action of the current itself.      Hence a current
flowing in the crust of the earth should produco its principal effect
on a magnetic needle by the magnetic induction which the current
induces in the earth itself.
     Sometimes disturbances occur where at the same instant there aro
similar deflections of the declination needles at stations wide apart,
and suddenly at ono of the stations the needle no longer goes with the
others, but is deflected for a considerable period in the opposite
direction to the others, turning- when they turn, and tracing out a
similar curve, but turned always in the opposite direction.            Such
cases occurred frequently      during March 1879, and especially on
March 23rd, about 1.30 and about 7 p.m., Kew time, and ou March
29th about 9 p.m.
     An examination of the principal disturbances at Eew and at
St. Petersburg seems to show that : —
     (1) A diminution in the horizontal forco is accompanied by greater
easterly deflections of the declination needle at St. Petersburg than at
Kew.
     (2) Increase of the horizontal forco is accompanied by greater
westerly deflections at St. Petersburg than at Kew, or is sometimes
accompanied by a westerly deflection at St. Petersburg and an
easterly deflection at Kew.
     These cases which I have taken will bo sufficient to show how
important it is that there should bo additional magnetic observations,
especially in the southern hemisphere, whero photographic records
should be taken, so that we may learn something about the magnetism
of the earth. Practically we have to rely on one excellent observatory
(Melbourne) for the wholo of the southern homisphere.            Surely the

 666                      Professor   TV'.   G. Adams              [Juno   3,
 time has arrived when there should be photographic registration of
 the magnetic elements at such an important observatory as the Cape
 of Good Hope, especially when the French Government has decided,
  within the last few weeks, to establish a magnetic observatory at Cape
 Horn. With observatories at Melbourne, at Cape Horn, and at the
  Cape of Good Hope the southern hemisphere would be well supplied ;
 and probably the Russian Government would then soon establish an
 observatory in the east of Siberia, where it is very desirable that a
 magnetic observatory should be established.
      Now we can readily show by experiment the way in which the
 magnetic instruments may be disturbed in a magnetic observatory by
 the alteration of the strength of a magnet. Taking magnetic needles
 to represent the declination needle, the inclination needle, and the
 binlar or horizontal force needle, we may placo an electro-magnet in
a given position with regard to them, and by altering the strength of
 that electro-magnet may cause these needles to trace out disturbances
 of a very decided character.
       I
       have as yet been speaking of only moderate disturbances, but now
let us come to some of the larger ones ; and        I have had the oppor
tunity through the kindness of the Kew Committee and the observers
at the various observatories mentioned, of studying the curves for tho
August magnetic storm, which began at 10 . 20 a.m., Greenwich time,
on August 11th, and for convenience may be divided into three
storms, one lasting from 10.20 on the 11th to 1 a.m. on the 12th ; a
second from 11 . 30 a.m. on the 12th to 7 . 20 on the 13th, and the third
from 11.50 a.m. on the 13th to 7 to 8 a.m. on the 14th of August.          I
have prepared a large sheet on which these curves have been copied
as accurately as possible for the first of these storms on, the 11th (see
Plate        For this storm
           3).             I    have also the curves from Toronto and
from Zi-Ka-Wei.       The first storm began on August 11th at the same
instant at all the stations. There    isa  decided similarity, especially in
the horizontal force curves, throughout the first part of this storm, and
certain points in    stand out prominently. At Kew the beginning of the
                     it
storm     not actually recorded, because the sheets of prepared paper
           is
on the time cylinders were changed precisely at 10.20 a.m., when the
storm was beginning.       The deflections are alike at Lisbon, Kew,
Vienna, St. Petersburg, and, after the very first sudden deflection, at
Toronto also. The greatest effect     is  produced at St. Petersburg;    the
similarity between the large disturbances at Vienna and at Toronto, in
Canada, places differing about 6i hours in time,          is    remarkable.
About 11.45,     1f.m, and 2.40 p.m. there are very remarkable points
of agreement.
     From about . 30 p.m. to
                     4         8   p.m., Greenwich time, i.  e. from about
11 a.m. to 2.30 p.m., Toronto time, the deflections are opposed at
Toronto and at Vienna or Kew. This would rather point to solar
action as the cause of disturbance.        In this case the Kew curve is
not so much deflected as the Vienna curve, because the horizontal
needle at Kew    is not nearly so sensitive as at Vienna, and the relative

strengths of the actual disturbing forces at the two places can only
be obtained by comparison of the scale values at the two places.
   I   will draw your attention to one other point on this day. At 9 p.m.
the disturbances are all in the same direction, but about 11 p.m.,
whilst St. Petersburg agrees in direction with the others in a very
violent phase of the storm, at Toronto the direction of the deflections
is reversed, and this reversal of curves continues until about the end
of this first of the three storms.
     The second storm, beginning about 11.30 a.m. on the 12th and
lasting until the next morning, was the roost remarkable of the three.
It not only battles the telegraph clerks, whe wish to keep out earth
currents from their lines, but it even goes beyond the powers of the
magnetic observatories which are specially designed to watch over
them. Thus at Toronto the lino goes off the edge of the paper on
which the photographic record is taken. At Melbourne the motion is
so rapid, and also at Vienna, that the plate is not sensitive enough to
receive the impressions, the motion is too quick even for photography.
At the time of greatest disturbance, about 12.20 mid-day, it is very
remarkable that at Lisbon and at Zi-k i-Woi, near Shanghai, in China,
two places nearly in the same latitude but nearly 9 hours apart in
time, the vertical force is increased in precisely the same way and to
the same amount at the same instant.
     At Zi-ka-Wei, in China, the sudden change in the horizontal force
on the needle amounted to about one hundredth part of the total
horizontal force, and at St. Petersburg the change in the horizontal
force amounted to one thirty-fifth part of the horizontal force, and the
total force was changed by about one eightieth part of its full value.
     These magnetic changes are so largo as to be quite comparable,
as we see, with the earth's total force, so that any cause which is
shown to be incompetent from the nature of things to produce the one
can hardly be held to account for the other.
     Since, as I havo shown, the large disturbances and the small
disturbances do not follow totally different laws but agree equally
well all over the earth, in so far as they agree we must attribute them
to the same cause
     During this August storm, as also during the remarkable storm of
January 31st last, great difficulties were experienced in working the
telegraph lines, and Mr. Preece has been kind enough to scud mo
particulars of these storms.
    I  am also greatly indebted to the Astronomer Royal for sending
me tracings of the earth current photographic records taken at Green
 wich Observatory during the August storm on two separate wires,
one running from the north-east and the other from the south-east to
Greenwich.       The two tracings are bent opposite ways at the same
time, so that when a current was running on one line towards Green
 wich, on the other it was running away from         it,  and comparing
these    curves with tho earth - current records from Derby and
Haverfordwest and other places,   it  appears that the general direction

668                        Professor  W. O. Adams                 [June 3,
of currents during this storm       was from south-west to north-east, or
from south-south-west to north-north-east,        with varying intensity,
the agreement being very close between the disturbances                  of
the declination needle and the Blackheath and Greenwich photo
graphic record.     From Mr. Preece's record also earth currents were
violent from 10.30 a.m. on the 11th (i.e. they were noted within ten
minutes of the beginning of the magnetic storm) to about 2 . 30 p.m.,
and again from 9 to midnight.        They were very violent on August
12th, beginning at 11.30 a.m., the beginning of the second storm,
and quieting down about 4 . 30 p.m., then beginning at 7 . 30 and
lasting until 9 . 30 p.m.
     Again on the 13th, they are strong for 1^ hour from about 5 in
the morning, i. e. just about the end of the second magnetic storm.
     The general direction of the earth currents as observed at Derby
or Haverfordwest, as well as at Greenwich, was from north-east to
south-west.
     Again on January 31st last another violent magnetic storm, in
which, Mr. Preece tells me, the currents were even more violent than
in tho August storm.
     Intimately connected with magnetic disturbances and earth
currents is the phenomenon of the aurora or polar light, which is an
electric discharge in the upper regions of the atmosphere.         During
the August and January storms the aurora was well seen in England,
it was also seen at St. Petersburg and as far east as Siberia.
It does not appear to have been seen, although it was looked for,
at Zi-ka-wei,     in China, by M. Dechevrens, the Director of the
Observatory, although the magnetic storm was so violent there that
 the horizontal force was suddenly changed by one hundredth part of
its total amount.
     Wo may arrive at some idea of the character of the aurora by
 studying electric discharges in vacuum tubes, and Dr. De La Ruo
 has already brought this subject before you in his Friday evening
lecture.
     Wo may gradually pass from electric discharges in air of ordinary
 density, in which we get the well-known electric spark between two
 surfaces, to air of loss density but better conducting power, and then to
 air of loss density still, but of such high resistance that no electricity
 will pass. Dr. De La Rue has shown that with 11.000 cells of his
 battery the striking distance between two points is about six-tenths
 of an inch in air of ordinary density of about 760 mm. pressure.
 When the pressure in a hydrogen tube is reduced to 21-7 mm., 8937
 cells will cause a discharge to take place through 30 inches. When
 the pressure is reduced to ¦642, about six-tenths of a mm., 430 cells
 will cause a discharge through the tube. When the pressure is still
 further reduced to "0065, it requires 8937 cells to cause the dis
                                                                 ¦
 charge. So that the spark passes more readily at a pressure 642 mm.
 than it does at a higher or a lower pressure.
      This is also the case with air.

1881.]     on Magnetic Dixturbance, Auroras, and   Earth     Currents.        669
     The lower regions of the earth's   atmosphere offer great resistance
to the passage of electricity, but as wo ascend the pressure diminishes,
and the electric resistance diminishes, until at last, at a height of
between    30 and 40 miles, a level   is reached where  the air offers least
resistance to the passage of electricity,    where  the   pressure is about
 •
   397 of a mm. ; and above that level     the electrical  resistance again
increases, so that at a height of  about  80  miles the   battery of 11,000
cells would not cause a spark   to pass.
     If we take a tube which has not been very highly exhausted, we
see that the light from the positive pole extends nearly through the
tube, and the dark space around the negative pole is small.           As the
exhaustion proceeds and the pressure of the air is diminished, the
electric spark passes through greater and greater lengths and changes
its character, until we get to the pressure corresponding to the least
resistance.    Beyond that the resistance increases, the dark space
around the negative pole expands, and the molecules fly about more
freely ; those on the negative pole being charged with electricity,
and being repelled from     it,proceed for a long distance in straight
lines, and possess the power of causing bodies on which they strike
to glow.     In Mr. Crookes's tubes we get very beautiful effects from
this glowing of the glass tube itself, or from the glowing of
substances in the path of the stream. We may regard this as                     a
stream of molecules of gas charged with electricity, and we see the
difference between this stream and the electric current in          avacuum
tube at lower exhaustion by the action of the magnet upon it.         In one
case the current going through the molecules from pole to pole in the
tube  is bent out of its course by the magnet, and symmetrically by
the two poles, and returns to its path, the line of least resistance
through the molecules; whereas the stream of molecules at the higher
exhaustion carrying their electricity with them, are carried away by
the electric charge upon them, aud get utterly lost and scattered on
striking the sido of the tube, yielding up great deal of energy in
                                               a
the form of heat to the tube, or to the glowing platinum or other
substance in the tube.                                    "~-~_
     The aurora, as seen in the north-eastern parts of Siberia, -where         it
is  very often very brilliant,is described as consisting of single'bright
pillars rising in the north and in the north-east, gradually covering          a
large space of the heavens.      These rush about from place to plabe,
and, reaching up to the zenith, produce an appearance as             if vast
                                                                          a
tent was spread in the heavens, glittering with gold, rubies, and
sapphires.
     More exact attempts have been made to describe the aurora, and
perhaps   I may be allowed to quote Dalton's description of an aurora
as seen by him.
     A remarkable red appearance of clouds was noticed in tho southern
horizon, which afforded light enough to read by, and            aremarkable
effect was expected.       He says: — "There was         a  large luminous
horizontal arch to the southward, and one or more concentric arches

070                       Professor W. G. Adams                  [Jnne  3,
northward.     All the arches seemed exactly bisected by the plane of
the magnetic meridian. At 10 . 30 streamers appeared in the south-east,
running to and fro from west to east. They increased in number and
approached the zonith, when all of a sudden the whole hemisphere
was covered with them, and exhibited such an appearance as baffles all
description.    The intensity of the light, the prodigious number and
volatility of the beams, the grand intermixture of all the primitive
colours in their utmost splendour, variegating the glowing canopy
with the most luxuriant and enchanting scenery, afforded an awful,
but at the same time a most pleasing and sublime, spectacle."        But
he adds : — " The uncommon grandeur of the scene only lasted one
minute ; the variety of colours disappeared, and the beams lost their
lateral motiou, and were converted, as usual, into the flashing
radiations ; but even then it surpassed all other appearances of the
aurora, in that the whole hemisphere was covered with it."
     In his address before the British Association in 1863, Sir William
Armstrong speaks of the sympathy between forces operating in the
sun and magnetic forces on the earth, and notices a remarkable
phenomenon seen by independent observers on September 1, 1859 : —
" A sudden outhurst of light, far exceeding the brightness of the sun's
surface, was seen to take place, and sweep like a drifting cloud over a
portion of the solar surface.        This was attended with magnetic
disturbances of unusual intensity and with exhibitions of aurora of
extraordinary brilliar.cy.    The identical instant at which the effusion
of light was observed was recorded by an abrupt and strongly marked
deflection in the self-registering instruments at Kew. The magnetic
storm commenced before and continued after the event."
      The daily and yearly periods of the magnetic changes, the change
 in the horizontal force depending on the sun's rotation on his axis, the
agreement of the eleven-year period of magnetic disturbances, sun-
 spots, and auroras show that the sun plays a very important part in
 causing or regulating both the regular and irregular magnetic
changes.
     The sun miiy be a very powerful magnet, and when his magnetism
 is greatly altered we may see the effects of this disturbance in the
bright faculae and in the spots in his atmosphere. Such a change of
magnetism would affoct the magnetism of the earth, altheugh the
effect could not be very large, unless the sun is magnetised to an
 intensity much greater even compared to his mass than the earth is
 magnetised.     Then, as there are tides in the seas around us, and
 probably  in  the earth's crust, so there are certainly very large tides
 in tho, >cean of air above us, and may not tho sun and moou by
dragging this air towards them as the earth revolves cause that
 friction between air and the earth, and also that evaporation, which
 togother may account for the presence of and keep up the supply of
positive electricity in the air and negative electricity in- the earth ?
 Again, these tides in the atmosphere will cause the mass of it to lag
 behind the revolving solid earth, and at a height of 30 or 40 miles we

1881.]   on Magnetic Disturbance,   Aurora, and Earth Currents.       671
have a layer of air which for air is a comparatively good conductor of
electricity ; here, then, we have not a lagging of the magnet behind
the conductor (as described in the early part of my lecture), but a
lagging of the conductor behind the magnet, and hence we may expect
a current or a gradual heaping up of electricity in the air in the
opposite direction to the current in the earth's crust. Thus whilst
the tidal wave in the earth's crust would cause a current in a telegraph
wire from the equator towards the poles, the regular tidal waves in
the atmosphere would cause the gradual transfer of positive electricity
from the poles towards the equator. This transfer may be of the
nature of a current of electricity or of a mass of air carrying a static
charge of electricity with  it,  for as Professor Rowland has shown that
the motion of a static charge will produce magnetism, so we may
expect from the principles of conservation of electricity that  a   change
in the position of a    magnet will, under such circumstances, produce
motion of the static charge of electricity.        When the air becomes
charged up     to discharging point,    then  we  may get the sudden dis
charges such as the aurora in the air and the earth currents in the
earth, and since the conducting layer of air approaches nearer to the
earth in the colder polar regions, possibly within less than 20 miles
of the earth's surface,it  may bo found that the discharge of the aurora
may   even  take  place  from   earth to air by gradual slow discharge,
aided as it  may  bo by  the state of moisture of the air and by change of
temperature   and  other  causes.

On a former occasion                I
                        detailed the results of a joint research made
in concert with my esteemed colleague Professor Liveing, on the
" Reversibility of tho Rays of Metallic Vapours."* The
                                                                present
lecture will be devoted to a record of the results of our work in rela
tion to three disputed questions in spectroscopic investigation, viz.
(1) the Carbon Spectrum, (2) the Magnesium Spectrum, and (3) tho
Identity of the Spectral Lines of different Elements.
                                Spectrum     of Carbon         Compounds.
     The spectrum of the flame of hydrocarbons burning in air has been
repeatedly described, first by Swan in 1856, and afterwards by Attfield,
Watts, Morren, Pliicker, Huggins, Boisbaudran, Piazzi Smyth, and
others. The characteristic part of this spectrum consists of four
groups of bands of fine lines in the orange, yellow, green, and blue
respectively, which are hereafter referred to as the hydrocarbon bands.
These four groups, according to Pliicker and Hittorf, also constitute
the spectrum of the discharge of an induction coil in an atmosphere of
hydrogen between carbon electrodes. They are also conspicuous in
the electric discharge in olefiant gas at the atmospheric and at reduced
pressures.
    Pliicker and Hittorf notice the entire absence in the flame of
olefinnt gas of tho two bright groups of lines (blue and violet as
described below) characteristic of the flame of cyanogen.
     Several observers have described the spectrum of the flame of
burning cyanogen.      Faraday, as long ago as 1829, called the atten
tion of Herschel and Fox Talbot to         and the latter, writing of his

air, they state that an ultra-violet group of three fluted bands appeared.
They notice also certain red bands with shading in the reverse direc
tion, which are better seen when the flame is fed with air than with
oxygen.       Other observers give similar accounts, noticing the brilliance
of the two series of bands in the blue and violet above mentioned,
and that they are seen equally well in the electric discharge through
cyanogen.
     Angstrom and Thalen, in               memoir "On the Spectra of Metal-
                                             a
 loids,"f contend that the        channelled    spectra of the hydrocarbon and
 cyanogen flames are the spectra respectively of acetylene and cyanogen,
and not of carbon itself, and that in the flame of burning cyanogen we
 sometimes see the spectrum of the hydrocarbon superposed on that of
 the cyanogen, the latter being the brighter and that in vacuum;
 tubes containing hydrocarbons the cyanogen spectrum observed                                 is
due to traces of nitrogen.
     No chemist who remembers the extreme sensibility of spectro
scopic tests, and the difficulty, reaching almost to impossibility, of
removing the last traces of air and moisture from gases, will feel any
surprise at the presence of small quantities of either hydrogen or
nitrogen in any of the gases experimented on.

fluted    bands    in  the  ultra-violet,  on  the strength of which he throws
over    the  conclusion     of  Angstrom    and   Thalen, and draws inferences
regarding      the   existence  of  carbon  vapour above the chromosphere in
 the coroual atmosphere         of the  sun,  which, if true, would be contrary
to  all  we  know     of the  properties  of  carbon.

strengthened by the results of series of observations carried out by

                     Electric Arc in different Gases.
     The experiments were made with a De Meritens dynamo-electric
machine, arranged for high tension, giving an alternating current
capable of producing an arc between carbon poles in air of from 8 to 10
millims. in length. The carbon poles used were 3 millims. in diameter,
and had been previously purified by prolonged heating in a current
of chlorine.    This treatment, though it removes a large part of the
metallic impurities present in the commercial carbons, will not remove
the whole, so that lines of calcium, iron, magnesium, and sodium may
still be recognised in the arc. Besides the traces of metallic impuri
ties, a notable quantity of hydrogen always remains unremovable by
this treatment with chlorine.
     The arc was taken in different gases inside a small glass globe (aa
in PI. I. Fig. 1) about 60 millims. in diameter, blown in the middle of
a tube.    The two ends of the tube (bb) were closed with dry corks,
through which were passed (1) the carbons (re), inserted through two
pieces of narrow glass tubing ; (2) two other glass tubes (dd) through
which currents of the different gases experimented on were passed.
     The arc in the globe filled with air gave a tolerably bright con
tinuous spectrum, on which the green and blue hydrocarbon bands
were seen, also the seven bands in the indigo (wave-lengths 4600 to
4502, Watts) as in the flame of cyanogen, and much more brightly the
six bands in the violet (wave-lengths 4220 to 4158, Watts) and five
ultra-violet. Besides these bands, lines of iron, calcium, and sodium
were visible.    The arc in this case was practically taken in a mixture
of nitrogen and carbonic oxide, for in a short time the oxygen of the
air is converted into carbonic oxide.
     On passing through the globe a current of carbonic acid gas, the
bands in the indigo, violet, and ultra-violet gradually died out until
they ceased to be visible continuously, and when momentarily seen
were only just discernible.       On the other hand, the hydrocarbon
bands, yellow, green, and blue, came out strong, and were even bril
liant. Lines of iron and calcium were still visible. On stopping
 the current of carbonic acid gas and allowing air to diffuse into the
 globe, the violet and ultra-violet bands soon began to appear, and
presently became permanent and bright, the hydrocarbon bands
remaining bright.
     When a continuous current of dry hydrogen was passed through
 the globe, the arc, contrary to what would be expected from the
 behaviour of the spark discharge in hydrogen, would not pass through
 more than a very short space, very much less than in air or carbonic
 acid gas.   There was a tolerably bright continuous spectrum, with no
 trace of bands in the indigo, violet, or ultra-violet, and no metallic
lines, with the exception of a fairly bright line in the red, which
 we identified, by comparison with the spark in a vacuum tube, with
the C line of hydrogen.       The F line, identified in like manner, was
also seen as a faint diffuse band. This last line was in general

 overpowered by the continuous spectrum, but was regularly seen when,
 from some variation in the discharge, the continuous spectrum bccamo
 less brilliant.   This was the first occasion on which we had seen the
 hydrogen lines in the arc, though Secchi * states that he had seen
 them by the use of moist carbon poles. The hydrocarbon bands in
 the green and blue were at intervals well seen.      Those in the yellow
 and orange were, owing doubtless to the smaller dispersion of the
 light in that region, overpowered by the continuous spectrum.
 Whereas when air and carbonic acid gas were used, the inside
 of the globe was quickly covered with dust from the disintegrated
 poles, scarcely any dust was thrown off when the arc was passed in
 hydrogen.
      In nitrogen a longer arc could be formed, and the indigo, violet,
 and ultra-violet bands of cyanogen all came out at intervals brilliantly.
 The green and blue hydrocarbon bands were also well developed.
     On filling the globe with chlorine, keeping a current of that gas
 passing through      it,the arc would not pass through       greater dis
                                                                    a
 tance than about 2    millims. No metallic lines were visible.    At first
 the violet bands, as well as the green and blue hydrocarbon bands,
 were visible;    but gradually, when the current of chlorine had been
passing    for  some   minutes, there was nothing to be seen but       con        a
tinuous spectrum with the green and blue hydrocarbon bands.
 Neither of these bands were strong, and at intervals the blue bands
disappeared altogether.
     The arc would not pass in         current of carbonic olide through
                                         a
any greater space than in chlorine.          There was much continuous
spectrum ;    the yellow, green, and blue hydrocarbon bands were well
seen, some of the indigo bands were just discernible, the violet had
nearly, and the ultra-violet quite, gone from sight. No trace of the
carbonic oxide bands, as seen in the spark discharge in that gas, was
visible.    This is   the more remarkable since Under similar circum
stances two of the characteristic lines of hydrogen were seen.
     In nitric oxide very long arc could be obtained. The violet and
                      a
ultra-violet cyanogen bands were well seen, the indigo bands were
seen, but weaker.      The blue and green hydrocarbon bands were also
seen well when the arc was short, not so well when the arc was long.
Many metallic lines of iron, calcium, and magnesium were seen.
     In ammonia only        ashort arc could be obtained.  All the bands
were faint, but the indigo and violet and ultra-violet cyanogen
bands were always visible.
     These experiments with different gases eliminate to a large extent
the influence of electric conductivity on the character of the spectrum.
     Apart from the relative electric conductivity of gases,         clear, it   is
from the experiments, that the length and character of alternating
electric discharges between carbon poles in different gases do
not follow the law which we should expect.         It will require    pro-       n

longed series of experiments to arrive at definite conclusions on this
matter; but, in the meantime, it is highly probable that one of the
main factors in producing these remarkable variations in the arc will
be found to be the relative facility with which the carbon of the poles
combines with the gaseous medium.
    On a review of the above series of observations, certain points
stand out plainly. In the first place, the indigo, violet, and ultra
violet bands, characteristic of the flame of cyanogen, are conspicuous
in the arc taken in an atmosphere of nitrogen, air, nitric oxide, or
ammonia, and they disappear almost, if not quite, when the arc is
taken in a non-nitrogenous atmosphere of hydrogen, carbonic oxide,
carbonic acid, or chlorine. These same "bands are seen brightly in the
flames of cyanogen and hydrocyanic acid, but are not seen in those of
hydrocarbons, carbonic oxide, or carbon disulphide.       The conclusion
seems   irresistible that they belong   to cyanogen ; and this conclusion
does not seem to us at all invalidated by the fact that they are seen
weakly, or by flashes, in the arc or spark taken in gases supposed free
from nitrogen on account of the extreme difficulty of removing the last
traces of air.    They are never, in such a case, the principal or pro
minent part of the spectrum, and in a continuous experiment they are
seen to fade out in proportion as the nitrogen is removed.      This con
clusion is strengthened by the recent discovery that cyanogen is always
generated in the electric arc in atmospheric air.
    The green and blue bands, characteristic of hydrocarbon flames,
are well seen when the arc is taken in hydrogen ; but, though less
strong when the arc is taken in nitrogen or in chlorine, they seem
to be always present in the arc, whatever the atmosphere.            This
is what we should expect, if they be due, as Angstrom and Thalen
suppose, to acetylene.; for we have found that the carbon electrodes
always contain, even when they have been long treated with chlorine
at a white heat, a notable quantity of hydrogen.
    The hydrocarbon bands are well developed in the blowpipe flame,
that is, under conditions which appear, at first sight, unfavourable to
the existence of acetylene. We have, however, satisfied ourselves, by
the use of Deville's aspirator, that acetylene may be withdrawn from
the interior of such a flame, and from that part of it which shows the
hydrocarbon bands brightly.
    The question as to whether these bands are due to carbon itself or
to a compound of carbon with hydrogen, has been somewhat simplified
by the observations of Watts and others on the spectrum of carbonic
oxide. There is, we suppose, no doubt now that that compound has
its own spectrum quite distinct from the hydrocarbon flame spectrum.
The mere presence of the latter spectrum feebly developed in the
electric discharge in compounds of carbon supposed to contain no
hydrogen, appears to us to weigh very little against the series of
observations which connect this spectrum directly with hydrocarbons.
    In the next place, it appears, from experiments, that the de
velopment of the violet bands of cyanogen, or the less refrangible

1881.]                on (he Origin and Identity          of Spectra.                     679
hydrocarbon bands, is not a matter of temperature only.                             For the
appearance of      the  hydrogen      lines    C  and   F  in  the  arc  taken    in hydro
gen indicates a temperature far higher than that of any flame.                            Yet
the violet bands disappear at that temperature, and the green bands
are well developed.          The violet bands are, nevertheless, seen equally
well at the different temperatures of the flame, arc, and spark, pro
vided cyanogen be the compound under observation in the flame, and
nitrogen and carbon are present together at the higher temperatures
of the arc and spark.
      The question of the constitution of comets, since the discovery by
Huggins* that the spectra of various comets are identical with the
hydrocarbon spectrum, naturally leads to some speculation in connec
tion with the conclusions to which our experiments point.                          Provided
we admit that the materials of the comet contain ready-formed hydro
carbons and that chemical or electrical actions may take place, gene
rating a high temperature, then the acetylene spectrum might be
produced at temperatures no higher than that of ordinary flames with
out any trace of the cyanogen spectrum, or of metallic lines.                           Such
actions might be brought about by the tidal disturbances involving
collisions and projections of the constituents of the swarms of small
masses circulating in orbits round the sun, which we have every reason
to believe constitute the cometic structure.                    If, on the other hand,
we assume only the presence of uncombined carbon and hydrogen, we
know that the acetylene spectrum can only be produced at a very high
temperature ; and if nitrogen were also present, that we should at
such a temperature have the cyanogen spectrum as well.                          Either then
the first supposition is the true one, not disproving the presence of
nitrogen ; or else the atmosphere which the comet meets is hydrogen
only and contains no nitrogen.
                               The Flame       of  Cyanogen.
      The accompanying diagram (PI. I. Fig. 2) shows the relative
position of the bands in that part of the spectrum of the flame of
cyanogen fed with a jet of oxygen which is more refrangible than the
Fraunhofer line F. Only those bauds which are less refrangible than
the solar line L have been before described, but photographs show
another set of two shaded bands slightly less refrangible than the
solar line N accompanied by a very broad diffuse baud of less in
tensity on the more refrangible side of N; also a strong shaded
band, which appears to be absolutely coincident with the remarkable
shaded band in the solar spectrum, which has been designated by the
letter P ; and near this, on the less refrangible side, a much fainter
diffuse band, which also seems to coincide with a part of the solar spec
trum sensibly less luminous than the parts on either side of it.                      Watts
found that the spectrum cyanogen of the flame did not disappear when the

flame was cooled by diluting the cyanogen with carbonic acid ; and we
have found that it retains its characters when the cyanogen is burnt in
nitric oxide. The flame in the last case must be one of the hottest
known, from the large amount of heat evolved in the decomposition of
cyanogen and nitric oxide, namely, 41,000 and 43,300 units respec
tively.    There is in the case of cyanogen, as in the case of so many
other substances, a difference in the relative intensities of the different
parts of the spectrum at different temperatures, but no other change
of character.
      On the theory that these groups of lines are the product of an
exceptional temperature in the case of the cyanogen flame, it is incon
ceivable that they could disappear by combustion in oxygen, instead of
in ordinary air.        Our observations accord with the statement of
Morren, Pliicker, Hittorf, and Thalen, that a cyanogen flame, fed
with oxygen, when it is intensely luminous, still yields these peculiar
groups.      We have found these peculiar groupings in the flame when
it had a current of oxygen in the middle, and was likewise sur
 rounded outside with oxygen. There is nothing remarkable in the
 fact that only a continuous spectrum is seen to proceed from any
 hydrocarbon or nitrocarbon burning in excess of oxygen, as we
 know from Frankland's experiments that carbonic acid and water
 vapour at the high temperature of flame under compression give in
 the visible portion a continuous spectrum. In fact, this is what we
 should anticipate, provided intermediate, and not the final, compounds
 arc the active sources of the banded spectrum.
      Each of the five sets of bands shown in the diagram is attended
 on its more refrangible side by a series of rhythmical lines ex
 tending to a considerable distance, not shown in the diagram, but
  easily seen in the photographs.
      Coal gas burning in oxygen gives no bands above that near G
  within the range of the diagram, Fig. 2 ; but beyond this our photo
 graphs show a spectrum of a character quite different from that at the
 less refrangible end. The most remarkable part of this spectrum is a
 long series of closely set strong lines, filling the region between the
 solar lines K and S, and ending abruptly with two strong lines a
 little beyond S. These are lines of various intensities, not regularly
  arranged so as to give shaded bands like those in the less refrangible
  part of the spectrum.        Beyond these lines there is another large
  group   of lines, not  so  strong or so closely set, but sharp and well
 defined.     This peculiar part of the spectrum is really due to the
 vapour of water, and shall be discussed in the sequel.

"  I  beg permission, therefore, in the meantime, to submit to the
notice of the Society an experiment with a tube containing CC10*
which, 1 think, establishes the conclusions arrived at by prior
investigators.    And    I  may add that it is the more important to
settle the question, as Messrs. Liveing and Dewar have already based
upon their conclusions theoretical views of a kind which appear to
me calculated to mislead, and which         I  consider to have long been
shown to be erroneous."       The following experiments have been made
to test the accuracy of our previous work, and to confirm or disprove
Mr. Lockyer's views.
     The form of sparking tube employed was similar to that used by
Salet.    This was attached by thick rubber tubing to a straight glass
tube of which one half, about 6 inches long, was filled with phosphoric
anhydride, and the other half with small fragments of soda-lime to
prevent any chlorine from the decomposition of the tetraehloride by
the spark from reaching the Sprengel pump. The tetrachloride used
had been prepared in our own laboratory, and fractionated until it
had a constant boiling point of 77° 0. Sufficient of it was introduced
into the sparking tube to fill nearly one quarter of the bulb at the
end, and the whole interior of the tube thoroughly wetted with it in
order to facilitate the removal of the last traces of air.
     When the tube containing the tetrachloride had been so far ex
hausted that little but condensible vapours were pumped out, the
bulb was heated so as to fill the apparatus with vapour of tetra
chloride, the pump still going, and this was repeated as long as any
incondensible gas was extracted.        Sparks were then passed through
 the tube for a short time, the pump still being kept going.        After a
 short time it was unnecessary to keep the pump going, as all the
 chlorine produced by decomposition of the tetrachloride was absorbed
 by the soda-lime.     On now examining the spectrum, no trace of any
 of the bands we ascribe to nitrocarbons could be detected, either by
 the eye or by photography, however the spark might be varied.          The
violet lines of chlorine described by Salet were more or less visible,
coming out brightly when a condenser was used.           Several tubes were
treated in this way, and many photographs taken, but always with
 the same result ; no trace appeared of either the seven blue, the six
 violet, the five ultra-violet, or of the still more refrangible bands of
 the cyanogen flame.      All the photographs showed three lines in the
 ultra-violet, but these do not at all resemble the nitrocarbon bands,
 as they are not shaded.      The least refrangible of the three is nearly
 coincident with the middle maximum in the ultra-violet set of five
 bands, but the other two do not coincide with any of these maxima.
 When a condenser is used, these three lines come out with much
 greater intensity, and two other triplets appear on the more refran
 gible side, as well as other lines.    In order to compare the positions
 of these lines with the cyanogen bands, we Lave taken several
                             * Carbon tetrachloriile.

photographs of the spark in tetrachloride simultaneously              with a
cyanogen flame,    the latter  being  thrown   in by reflection in the usual
way.
     Not one of many photographs so taken showed any traces of the
cyanogen bauds.      The general character of the violet part of the
spectrum of the spark in carbon tetrachloride taken without a con
denser (but not tlie exact position to scale of wave-lengths of all the
lines) is shown at B in Fig. 2. At C of the same diagram are
shown the brightest of the additional lines which come out with the
use of a condenser.      Photographs of sparks taken in hydrochloric
acid showed a precisely similar group of ultra-violet lines, so that the
three lines which our photographs show amongst the five ultra-violet
nitrocarbon bands are due to chlorine.
     Having satisfied ourselves by repeated trials that pure carboii
tetrachloride or trichloride, if free from nitrogen, does not give any of
the bands we ascribe to nitrocarbon compounds, our next step was to
determine whether the addition of nitrogen would bring them out, and
if so, what quantity of nitrogen would make them visible.
     For this purpose we introduced a minute fragment of bichromate
of ammonia, carefully weighed, and wrapped in platinum foil, into the
neck of one of the sparking tubes containing carbon tetrachloride,
connected the tube to the Sprengel pump, and removed the air as before.
The spark examined in the tube showed no trace of any nitrocarbon
band. A pinch-cock was now put on the rubber tube, and the bichro
mate heated by a spirit-lamp to decomposition (whereby it is resolved
into nitrogen, water, and oxide of chromium).          On now passing the
spark the six violet bands were well seen. There was no change in the
 condition of the coil or rheotome, so that the spark was of the same
character as it had been before when no nitrocarbon bands were
 visible, and the change in the spectrum cannot be attributed to any
 change in the spark.       The weight of the bichromate was between
 •0005 and '0006 grm.; and the nitrogen this would evolve would fill
just about ^g of a cubic centimetre at atmospheric pressure. The tube
 held 30 cub. centims., so that vapour of carbon tetrachloride when
              ^^ part of its volume of nitrogen, gives under the action
 mixed with
 of the electric spark the nitrocarbon bands distinctly. Other similar
 experiments confirmed this result.       It is worthy of remark that the
 nitrocarbon bands were not seen instantaneously on the admission of
 nitrogen into the tube, but were gradually developed, as if it was
 necessary that a certain quantity of nitrocarbon compound should be
 formed under the influence of the electric discharge and accumulated
 before its spectrum became visible.
      A tube, containing naphthaline, previously well washed with dilute
 sulphuric acid, dried and resublimed, was attached to the Sprengel
 pump, and treated as the tubes with tetrachloride had been.              The
spark in this tube likewise showed no nitrocarbon bands.              After a
time the tube cracked, and then the nitrocarbon bands made their
appearance, and on sotting the pump going a good deal of gas was

1881.]             on the Origin and Identity of Spectra.             683
pumped out.        When the air had again been pretty completely
 exhausted, the nitrocarbon bands were no longer visible, but gradu
ally reappeared again as air leaked through the crack.           Another
tube, containing a mixture of naphthaline and benzol, showed no trace
of the nitrocarbon bands.
     The observation of the nitrocarbon bands in the spectrum of the
spark in naphthaline was one of the reasons which led Watts at one
time to ascribe these bands to free carbon.
     In our first experiments with carbonic oxide the gas was made by
the action of sulphuric acid on dried formiate of sodium.
     At first the six violet cyanogen bands were well seen, and the
seven blue bands faintly ; but gradually, as the air became more
completely expelled, the blue bands disappeared entirely, and then
the violet bands so far died out that it was only by manipulating the
coil that they could be made visible, and then only very faintly. A
bubble of air about ?^y port of the volume of gas in the generating
flask and tube, was now introduced, when almost immediately the
bands reappeared brightly. As the stream of gas continued, they
again gradually died away until they were represented only by a
faint haze.    It was subsequently found that each introduction of fresh
acid into the flask was attended with a marked increase in the bright
ness of the nitrocarbon       bands, which died away again when the
current of gas was continued without fresh introduction of acid. On
testing the acid it was found to contain, as is frequently the case
with sulphuric acid, a very small quantity of the oxides of nitrogen.
 The difficulty of getting all the air expelled from the apparatus
and reagents led us to adopt another method of making carbonic
oxide.     Carbonic oxide was generated by heating in a tube of hard
glass   in  a combustion furnace a mixture of pure dry potassium
oxalate with one quarter of its weight of quicklime, the mixture
having been previously heated for some time to expel traces of
ammonia.       No trace whatever of the uitrocarbon bauds could be
detected in this carbonic oxide, however the spark might be varied.
The pressure of the gas was reduced to 1 inch of mercury, while
the spectrum was observed from time to time.            Still no trace of
the nitrocarbon bands could be detected.       More of the oxalato was
heated, and the observations repeated again and again, always with
the same result.        Carbonic oxide, therefore, if quite free from
nitrogen,   does  not   give, at the atmospheric or any less pressure,
the uitrocarbon spectrum.
    On passing the spark between carbon poles in nitrogen, the nitro
carbon bands are plainly seen ; and remain visible through great
variations in the character of the spark.       Photographs taken, with
and without the use of the condenser, showed the violet and ultra
violet nitrocarbon bands, including those near N and P.            If the
nitrogen was swept out by a current of carbonic acid gas, on passing
the spark the uitrocarbon bands could no longer be detected, and
photographs showed no trace of any of the ultra-violet bands.

684                          Professor Dewar                   [June 10,
      In all the foregoing experiments the bands which Angstrom and
Thalen ascribe to hydrocarbons were always more or less plainly seen.
Much more care than has generally been thought necessary is needed
if the last traces of hydrogen and its compounds are to be removed
from spectral tabes. Indeed, water cannot be completely removed
from apparatus and reagents which do not admit of being heated to
redness.
      Thus    a mixture  of carbonate of sodium and boric anhydride,
previously     to admixture heated red hot, was introduced into one end
of a piece of combustion tube, near the other end of which wires had
been sealed, and the open end drawn out; the mixture was then
heated, and when it was judged that all the air was expelled, the tube
 was sealed off at atmospheric pressure. On passing sparks through it
carbonic oxide bands and oxygen lines could be seen, but no hydrogen,
hydrocarbon, or nitrocarbon bands could be detected.         It appears,
therefore, that the application of a red heat is likely to prove a
 more effectual means of getting rid of moisture than the use of any
 desiccating agent.
       Are the groups of shaded bands seen in the more refrangible
 part of the spectrum of a cyanogen flame, of which the three which
 can be detected by the eye are defined by their wave-lengths (4600
 to 4502, 4220 to 4158, and 3883 to 3850), due to the vapour of
 uncombined carbon, or, as we conclude, to a compound of carbon with
 nitrogen ?
       The evidence that carbon can take the state of vapour at the
 temperature of the electric arc is at present very imperfect.    Carbon
 shows at such temperatures only incipient fusion, and that uncom
 bined carbon should be vaporised at the far lower temperature
 of the flame of cyanogen is so incredible an hypothesis, that it
 ought not to be accepted if the phenomena admit of any other
 probable explanation.       On the other hand, cyanogen or hydro
  cyanic acid is generated in large quantity in the electric arc taken
 in nitrogen, and Berthelot has shown that hydrocyanic acid is
  produced by the spark discharge in a mixture of acetylene and
  nitrogen, so that in the cases in which these bands shine out with the
  greatest brilliance, namely, the arc in nitrogen and the cyanogen
  flame, we know that nitrocarbon compounds are present.      Further, we
  have shown that these bands fade and disappear in proportion          as
  nitrogen is removed from the arc. Angstrom and Thaleu had previ
  ously shown the same thing with regard to the discharge between
  carbon electrodes ; and the conclusion to which they and we have
  come would probably have commanded universal assent if it had not
  been for the fact that these bands had been seen in circumstances
   where nitrogen was supposed to be absent, but where, in reality, the
   difficulty of completely eliminating nitrogen, and the extreme sensi
   bility of the spectroscopic test, had been inadequately apprehended.
        Our argument is an induction from a very long series of observa
   tions which lead to one conclusion, and hardly admit of any other

1881.]              on the Origin and Identity   of Spectra.              685
 explanation.    Mr. Lockyer, however, attempts to explain the dis
 appearance of the bauds when nitrogen is absent by the statement,
 " that the tension of the current used now brings one set of flutings
 into prominence, and now another." This is no new observation. It
 is well known that variations in the discharge produce variations in
 the relative intensities of different parts of a spectrum.     Certain lines
 of magnesium, cadmium, zinc, and other metals, very brilliant in the
 spark, are not seen, or are barely seen, at all in the arc. His remark
 might bo applied to the spectra of compounds as well as to those of
 elements.    Variation in the discharge accounts very well for some of
 the variations of intensity in the bands if they be due to a nitrocarbon ;
 it will not, however, account for the fact observed by us, that the
 bands, or those of them which have the greatest emissive power, and
 are best developed by the particular current used, come out on the
 addition of a minute quantity of nitrogen, when there is every reason
 to think that no variation of the current occurs.
      Much the same may be said with regard to the changes of the
 spectrum produced by changes of temperature.              We cannot infer
 from any of these changes that the spectrum is not due to a
 compound.
      Again, Mr. Lockyer attempts to get over the difficulties of his case
 by  the  supposition that
                            " the sets of carbon flutings represent different
 molecular groupings of carbon, in addition to that or those which give
 us the line spectrum."
      Now, until independent evidence can be adduced that carbon can
 exist in the state of uncombined vapour at the temperature of a
 cyanogen flame, and that different groupings in such vapour exist,
 the hypothesis here enunciated is a gratuitous one, so long as the
 existence of nitrocarbon compounds in the flame, arc, and spark will
 sufficiently explain the facts.
      The observation above recorded, that there is in the spectrum of
 cyanogen a strong shaded band coincident with the very characteristic
 dark shaded band P of the solar spectrum, strengthens materially the
 evidence in favour of the existence of these bands in the solar
 spectrum ; the more so, as the series of lines at P has far more of
 the distinctive character of the cyanogen spectrum than any other
 series in the ultra-violet part of the solar spectrum.
     The hypothesis that if present they are duo to vapour of carbon
uncombined in the upper cooler region of the chromosphere
seems absurd.        One object of our investigations has been to
determine the permanence of compounds of the non - metallic
elements, and the         sensitiveness of the spectroscopic         test in
regard to them. It appeared probable that if such compounds exist
in the solar atmosphere their presence would be most distinctly
revealed in the more refrangible part of the spectrum.         In the mean
time it is sufficiently clear that the presence of nitrogen in the solar
atmosphere may be recognised through cyanogen when free nitrogen
might escape detection.

686                           Professor Dewar                        [June  10,
      The series of experiments, unless proved to be wrong, are almost
conclusive proof that Mr. Lockyer's views regarding the origin and
variation of the carbon spectrum have no real experimental basis.
                           Spectrum   of Magnesium.
      The absorption spectrum of magnesium and of magnesium with
potassium and sodium, as seen in iron tubes in a hydrogen atmo
sphere, described in the former lecture, correspond to no known
emission lines of magnesium. We could only ascribe their origin to the
mixtures employed as distinct from the separate elements, and there
fore wore led to investigate the conditions under which corresponding
emission lines could be produced.
      In ' Proc. Roy. Soc.' vol. xxvii. p. 494, the emission spectrum of
sparks from an induction coil taken between magnesium points in an
atmosphere of hydrogen is described as follows : —
      " A bright line regularly appeared with a wave-length about
 5210            This line does not usually extend across the whole
 interval between the electrodes, and is sometimes seen only at the
 negative electrode.     Its presence seems to depend on the tempera
 ture, as it is not seen continuously when a large Leyden jar is
 employed, until the pressure of the hydrogen, and its resistance, is
 very much reduced. When well-dried nitrogen or carbonic oxide is
 substituted for hydrogen, this line disappears entirely ; but if any
 hydrogen or traces of moisture bo present, it comes out when the
 pressure is much reduced. In such cases the hydrogen lines C and F
 are always visible as well.        Sometimes several fine linos appear on
 the more refrangible side of this line between it and the 6 group,
 which give it the appearance of being a narrow band shaded on that
 side."    " In addition to the above-mentioned line, we observed that
 there is also produced a series of fine lines, commencing close to the
 most refrangible line of the 6 group, and extending, with gradually
 diminishing intensity, towards the blue            ....     from forty-five to
  fifty being visible, and placed at nearly equal distances from each
  other."
       In a paper entitled " A New Method of Spectrum Observation," *
  Mr. Lockyer regards this spectrum as illustrative and confirmatory
  of his views regarding the possibility of elemental dissociation at
  different heat-levels.      The view taken by Mr. Lookyer may be
  expressed in his own words :—
       " The flame spectrum of magnesium perhaps presents us best
  witli the beautiful effects produced by the passage from the lower to
  the higher heat-level, and shows the important bearing upon solar
  physics of the results obtained by this new method of work.           ...  In
  the flame the two least refrangible of the components of b are seen
  associated with a line less refrangible so as to form a triplet.            A

series of flutings and a line in tho blue are also seen.

passing    the spark       these                 components     6 are abolished.
We get the wide triplet replaced by a narrow one of the same form,
the two lines of b being common ta both.
      " May we consider the existence of these molecular states as
forming a true basis for Dalton's law of multiple proportions ? If so,
then the metals in different chemical combinations will exist in
different molecular groupings, and we shall be able, by spectrum
observations, to determine the particular heat-level to which the
molecular complexity of the solid metal, induced by chemical affinity,
corresponds. . . . Examples. — None of the lines of magnesium
special to the flame spectrum are visible in the spectrum of the
chloride either when a flame or a spark is employed."
      In order to ascertain the true cause of the variations in the mag
nesium spectrum, the following experiments and observations were
made, and they demonstrate that the views of Mr. Lockyer on this
question must also be regarded as resting on faulty experimenting : —
   1.   Observations  on the Spark between Magnesium Points in Nitrogen
                   and Carbonic Oxide at various Pressures,
      The points were pieces of magnesium wire.              Round one end of
each a platinum wire was tightly coiled and fused into the side of a
 glass tube. This tube was attached by fusion at one end to another
 tube filled with phosphoric anhydride, which in turn was connected
 with a Sprengel pump. The other end of the tube was connected
 by a thick rubber tube, capable of being closed by a pinchcock, with
 a gasholder containing nitrogen over strong sulphuric acid.                 The
 tube having been exhausted and filled with nitrogen two or three
 times, it was found that no line at 5210 was visible in the spark.
 The tube was now gradually exhausted, and the spark watched as
 the exhaustion proceeded.           No line at 5210 was seen, although the
 exhaustion was carried nearly as far as the pump would carry it ; nor
 was any hydrogen line (C or F) visible, either with or without the
 use of a jar.       The communication with the gasholder was now
 opened, and the tube refilled with nitrogen at the atmospheric
 pressure ; a communication was then made with another vessel con
 taining hydrogen, which was allowed to diffuse into the tube for a
 very short time. On now passing the spark, the line at 5210 at once
 appeared,     although the quantity of hydrogen diffused into the
 nitrogen must have been very small.            The experiments with nitrogen
 at reduced pressure         were   repeated    several  times, with the same
 result.    It was   found   necessary   to  have  the phosphoric anhydride, as
 without it traces of moisture were left or found their way through
 the pump into the tube, and then, when the exhaustion was carried
far enough, both the line at 5210 and the hydrogen lines, C and F,
 made their appearance.          We have never, however, been able to detect
the line    at  5210,  in   nitrogen, without being able to detect C or F

 either at the same time or by merely varying tho discharge by means
 of a Leyden jar.
      Experiments made in tho same way with carbonic oxide instead of
 nitrogen led to precisely the same results.
   2.  Observations    on the  Spark   between  Magnesium Points in Hydrogen
                                at reduced Pressures.
      A   tube, similar to those employed with nitrogen and carbonic
 oxido, was attached at one end to a Sprengel pump and mercury
 gauge, and at the other end to an apparatus for generating hydrogen.
 Dry hydrogen was passed through for some time, and the connection
 with   the hydrogen apparatus closed.          On sparking with tho hydrogen
 at the atmospheric pressure,         the  line at 5210 and its attendant series
 were visible, and were still visible when a small Leyden jar was used
 with the induction coil, but disappeared almost entirely when a large
 Leyden jar was used.            When the pressure of the hydrogen was
 reduced    to  half  an atmosphere, the line at 5210 was seen faintly when
 a large Leyden jar was used, but not the series of fine lines.            When
 the pressure was reduced to 180 millims., the series of fine lines began
 to show when the large jar was used.              By still further reducing tho
 pressure    the  whole   series  was  permanently visible when the large jar
 was used ; but when the exhaustion was carried still further they
 grew fainter, and almost disappeared.               On gradually readmitting
hydrogen,      the  same  phenomena      recurred  in the reverse order.
         3. Observations    on the  Arc   with Magnesium and Hydrogen.
      The line at 5210 is not seen in the arc in a lime or carbon
crucible when magnesium is dropped in without the introduction of
hydrogen.        If, however, a gentle stream of hydrogen or of coal gas
be led in through a perforation in one of the electrodes, the line at
5210 immediately makes its appearance, and, by varying the current
of gas, it may be made to appear either bright or reversed. However
small the current of hydrogen be made, the line can bo detected as
long as the current and the supply of magnesium continue, but
disappears very quickly when the current of gas ceases.
            4.   Observations  on the Flame     of Burning Magnesium.
      The line at 5210 may often be seen in the flame of magnesium
burning in air, but both it and the series of fine lines which accom
pany it come out with greatly increased brilliance if the burning
magnesium be held in a jet of hydrogen, of coal gas, or of steam.
      The experiments        above described, with nitrogen and carbonic
oxide    at reduced    pressures, are almost if not quite conclusive against
the supposition that the line at 5210 is due merely to the lower

 1881.]              on the  Origin and Identity of Spectra.               689
 temperature of the spark in hydrogen. From De La Rue and Muller's
 observations it would appear that nitrogen at a pressure of 400
 millims. should produce much the same effect on the spark as hydrogen
 at 760 millims.       Now the pressures of the nitrogen and carbonic
 oxide were reduced far below this without any trace of the line in
 question being visible. Moreover, the magnesium line at 4481, which
 is not seen in the arc, and may be reasonably ascribed to the higher
 temperature of the spark, may be seen in the spark at the same time
 as the line at 5210 when hydrogen is present.               Nevertheless tem
 perature does seem to affect the result in some degree, for when a
 large Leyden jar is used, and the gas is at the atmospheric pressure,
 the line almost disappears from the spark, to reappear when the
pressure is reduced ; but by no variation of temperature have we been
 able to see the line when hydrogen was carefully excluded.
      A line of the same wave-length has been seen by Young in the
 chromosphere once.         Its absence from the Fraunhofer lines leads to
 the inference   that  the   temperature of the sun is too high (unless at
 special  times  and   places) for its production.      If it bo not due to a
compound      of  magnesium     with  hydrogen,   at  any rate it occurs with
special facility   in the  presence  of hydrogen,   and  ought to occur in the
 sun if the temperature were not too high.
      We have thus far been careful to ascribe this line and its attendant
 series to a mixture of magnesium and hydrogen rather than to a chemical
compound, because this sufficiently expresses the facts, and we have not
yet obtained any independent evidence of the existence of any chemical
compound of those elements. We have independent evidence that
mixtures which are not probably chemical compounds favour the
production of certain vibrations which are not so strong or are not
seen at all when the elements of those mixtures are taken separately.-
The remarkable absorptions produced by mixtures of magnesium with
potassium and sodium above-mentioned belong to this class.                 We
have not been able to obtain the emission spectra corresponding
to these absorptions, but in the course of our observations on the arc
we have frequently noticed that certain lines of metals present in
the crucible are only seen, or come out with especial brilliance, when
some other metal is introduced.         This is the case with some groups of
calcium lines which are not seen, or are barely visible, in the arc in a
lime crucible, and come out with great brilliance on the introduction of
a fragment of iron, but are not developed by other metals such as tin.
       Spark Spectrum of Magnesium in Hydrogen under increased
                                    Pressures.
     In order to ascertain if this peculiar spectrum could be produced
at a high temperature in the presence of hydrogen, which we have
already shown to be essential to its production at the atmospheric
and at reduced pressures, experiments were made with hydrogen at
pressures increasing up to twenty atmospheres.

090                         Professor Dewar                     [June 10,
     On the supposition that this spectrum originates from the formation
of  some chemical compound, probably formed within certain limits of
temperature when vapour of magnesium is in presence of hydrogen,
the stability of the body ought to depend largely on the pressure of
the gaseous medium.      Like Graham's hydrogenium, this body might
be formed in hydrogen of high pressure at a temperature at which it
would under less pressure be decomposed.          In fact, it has been
shown by Troost that the hydrides of palladium, sodium, and potas
sium all follow strictly the laws of chemical dissociation enunciated
by Deville ; and increased pressure, by rendering the compound more
stable, ought, if the secondary effect of such pressure in causing
a higher temperature in the electric discharge were not overpowering,
to conduce to a more continuous and brilliant spectrum of the com
pound.    Conversely, if such a more continuous and brilliant spectrum
be found to result, in spite of the higher temperature, from increased
pressure, it can only be explained by the stability of the substance
being increased with the pressure.
     Now, what are the facts ? When the spark of an induction coil,
without a Leyden jar, is passed between magnesium electrodes in
hydrogen at atmospheric pressure, the flutings in the green are, as
before described, always seen, but they are much stronger at the poles
and do not always extend quite across the field.      As the pressure is
increased, however, they increase in brilliance and soon extend per
sistently from pole to pole, and go on increasing in intensity, until, at
fifteen and twenty atmospheres, they are fully equal in brilliance to
the 6 group, notwithstanding      the increased brightness these have
acquired by the higher temperature, due to the increased pressure.
The second set of flutings, those in the yellowish green, come out as
the pressure is increased, and, in fact, at twenty atmospheres only
the b group and the flutings are noticeable ; if the yellow magnesium
line be visible at all it is quite lost in the brilliance of the yellow
flutings.   The tail of fine lines of these flutings extend at the high
pressure quite up to the green, and those of the green flutings quite
up to the blue. On again letting down the pressure the like pheno
mena occur in the reverse order, but the brilliance of the flutings
does not diminish so rapidly as it had increased.      If, now, when the
pressure has again reached that of the atmosphere, a large Leyden jar
be interposed in the circuit, on passing the spark the flutings are
still seen quite bright, and they continue to bo seen with gradually
diminishing intensity until the sparks have been continued for a
considerable time. It appears that the compound, which had been
formed in large quantity by the spark without jar at the higher
pressures, is only gradually decomposed, and not re-formed, by the
high temperature of the spark with jar. This experiment, which was
several times repeated, is conclusive against the supposition that the
flutings are merely due to a lower temperature.       When the pressure
was increased at the same time that the jar was employed, the flutings

did not immediately disappear, but tho expansion of the magnesium lines
and the increase of the continuous spectrum seemed to overpower them.
     When nitrogen was substituted for hydrogen, the strongest lines
of the green flutings were seen when the spark without jar was first
passed at atmospheric pressure, probably from hydrogen occluded,
as it usually is, in the magnesium electrodes.       As the pressure was
increased they speedily disappeared entirely, and were not again seen
either at high or low pressures.
     With carbonic oxide the same thing occurred as with nitrogen ;
but in this gas the flutings due to the oxide of magnesium (wave
length 4930 to 5000) were, for a time, very well seen.
     Fig. 4, Plate III., shows more completely than we have given it
before tho general character of the magnesium-hydrogen spectrum,
which consists of two sets of flutings closely resembling in character
the hydrocarbon flutings, each fluting consisting of a multitude of
fine lines closely set on the less refrangible sido, and becoming
wider apart and weaker towards tho more refrangible side, but ex
tending under favourable circumstances much farther than is shown
in the figure. The set in the green is the stronger, and it was
to this that our former observations were confined.           It has two
flutings,  one  beginning   at about   wave-length   5210  and  the other
 close to 6, on its more refrangible side. The other set consists of
 three principal flutings, of which the first begins at about wave
 length 5618, the next at about wave-length 5566, and the third
 begins with three strong lines at about the wave-lengths 5513, 5512,
 5511. Both sets are very well seen when a magnesium wire is
 burnt in the edge of a hydrogen flame, and in the arc in a crucible of
magnesia when a gentle current of hydrogen is led into it. There is
 also a pair of bands in the blue beginning at about the wave-lengths
4850, 4802.
     Mr. Lockyer states (loc. cit.) that none of the lines of magnesium,
 special to the flame spectrum, are visible in the spectrum of the
 chloride, either when flame or spark is employed.       But we find that
 when the spark is taken between platinum points, from a solution of
 the chloride of magnesium, in a tube such as those used by Delachanal
 and Mermet, the line at wave-length 5210 can frequently be seen in it
 when the tube is filled with air, and that if the tube be filled with
 hydrogen tho green flutings of magnesium-hydrogen are persistent
and strong.
     Repeated observations have confirmed our previous statements as
 to the facility with which the magnesium-hydrogen spectrum can be
 produced in the arc by the help of a current of the gas.            In a
 magnesia crucible, by regulating the current of hydrogen, the flutings
 can be easily obtained either bright or reversed.
     The variations in the spectrum of magnesium, and the conditions
 under which it is observed, throw additional light on the question of
 the emissive power for radiation of short wave-lengths of substances

       Ultra-Violet    Spectrum    of tJie Flame of Burning Magnesium.
     When magnesium wire or ribbon is burnt in air, we see the three
lines of the b group, the blue line about wave-length 4570, first
noticed by us in the spark spectrum ; f and photographs show,
besides, the well-known triplet in the ultra-violet between the solar
lines K and L sharply defined, and the line for which Cornu has
found the wave-length 2850 very much expanded and strongly
reversed. These lines are all common to the flame, arc, and spark
spectra ; and the last of them (2850) seems to be by far the strongest
line both in the flame and arc, and is one of the strongest in the
spark.     But, in addition to these lines, the photographs of the flame
show a very strong, somewhat diffuse, triplet, generally resembling
the other magnesium triplets in the relative position of its com
ponents, close to the solar line M; and a group of bands below it
extending beyond the triplet near L. These bands have, for the
most part, each one sharply defined edge, but fade away on the other
side ; but the diffuse edges are not all turned towards the same side
of the spectrum. The positions of the sharp edges of these bands,
and of the strong triplet near M, are shown in PI. III., Fig. 1. It
is remarkable that the triplets near P and 8 are absent from the
flame spectrum, and that the strong triplet near M is not represented
at all either in the arc or spark.         The hydrogen-magnesium series of
lines, beginning at a wave-length about 5210, are also seen some
times, as already described by us,J in the spectrum of the flame ; but
we have never observed that the appearance of these lines, or of the
strong line with which they begin, is connected with the non-appear
ance of bt. Indeed, we can almost always see all three lines of the
b group in the flame, though as bt is the least strong of the three, it
is likely to be most easily overpowered by the continuous spectrum
of  the flame.
     Burning magnesium in oxygen instead of atmospheric air does not
bring out any additional lines ; on the contrary, the continuous spec
trum from the magnesia overpowers the line spectrum, and makes it
more difficult of observation.
     Magnesia heated in the oxyhydrogon jet does not appear to give
the lines seen in the flame, except that at 2850.

     The spectrum of magnesium, as seen in the arc, contains several
lines besides those heretofore described.                These lines come out
brightly, generally considerably expanded, when a fragment of mag
nesium is dropped into the crucible through which the arc is passing,

 but rapidly contract and gradually become very faint or disappear
 entirely.
       By examining the arc of a Siemens machine, taken in a crucible of
  dense magnesia under the dispersion of the spectrum of the fourth
  order, given by a Rutherford grating of 17,296 lines to the inch, we
  are able to separate the iron and magnesium lines which form the
  very close pair bt of the solar spectrum. Either of the two lines can
  be rendered the more prominent of the pair at will, by introducing
  iron or magnesium into the crucible.            The less refrangible line of
  the pair is thus seen to be due to iron, the more refrangible to mag
  nesium.     Comparison of the solar lino and the spark between
 magnesium points confirms this conclusion, that the magnesium line
  is the more refrangible of the two.
       In the ultra-violet part of the spectrum photographs show several
  new lines. First, a triplet of lines above U at wave-lengths about 2942,
  2938 • 5, 2937. These lines are a little below a pair of lines given
  by the spark for which Cornu has found the wave-lengths 2934 • 9,
 2926 • 7. The latter pair are not seen at all in photographs of the arc,
 nor the former three in those of the spark. The strong line, wave
 length about 2850, is always seen, very frequently reversed. Of the
 quadruple group in the spark to which Cornu has assigned the wave
 lengths 2801-3, 2797-1, 2794 '5, and 2789-9, the first and third are
 strongly developed in the arc, the other two hardly at all. Next follows
 a set of five nearly equidistant lines, well-defined and strong, but
 much less strong than the two previously mentioned, wave-lengths
 about 2782 • 2, 2780 • 7, 2779 • 5, 2778 • 2, 2776 • 9. The middle line is a
 little stronger than the others. The same lines come out in the spark.
      Beyond these follow a series of pairs and triplets ; probably they
 are triplets in every case ; but the third, most refrangible, line of tho
 triplets is the weakest, and has not in every case been noticed as yet.
 These succeed one another at decreasing intervals with diminishing
 strength, and are alternately sharp and diffuse, the diffuse triplets being
 the strongest.     The positions are shown in PL III., Fig. 2. The
 series resembles in general character the sodium and the potassium
 series described by us in a former communication, and we cannot Desist
 the inference that they must be harmonically related, though they do
not follow a simple harmonic law. The most refrangible line in the
figure at wave-length 2605 represents a faint diffuse band which is
not resolvable into lines ; it belongs, no doubt, to the diffuse members
of the series, and, to complete the series, there should be another
sharp group between it and the line at wave-length 2630.                 This
belonging to the weaker members of the series is too weak to be seen.
      It is worthy of remark that the line at wave-length 5710, described
by us in a previous communication,* is very nearly the octave of the
strong line at 2850. Moreover, the measures we have taken of

closer to the half of 5710.
     When metallic magnesium is dropped into a crucible of magnesia
or lime through which the arc is passing, the electric current seems
sometimes to be conducted chiefly or entirely by the vaporised metal,
so that the lines of other metals almost or wholly disappear ; but the
line at wave-length 3278 does not in such cases appear, though the
other magnesium lines are very strongly developed.          The line at
wave-length 2850 is often, under such circumstances, enormously
expanded and reversed, those at wave-lengths 2801, 2794, and the
alternate diffuse triplets, including those near L and near S, much
 expanded and reversed, and the group of five lines (2776-2782)
 sometimes reversed.
     When the arc of a Siemens machine is taken in a magnesia
 crucible, the strong line of the flame spectrum, wave-length 4570, is
 well seen sharply defined ; it comes out strongly and a little expanded
 on dropping in a fragment of magnesium.       When a gentle stream of
 hydrogen is led in through a hollow pole, this line is frequently
 reversed as a sharp black line on a continuous background.         From
 comparing the position of this line with those of the titanium lines
 in its neighbourhood, produced by putting some titanic oxide into the
crucible, we have little doubt that it is identical with the solar line
 4570-9 of Angstrom.
     When the arc is taken in a crucible into which the air has access,
 it may be assumed that the atmosphere about the arc is a mixture of
 nitrogen and carbonic oxide. When a stream of hydrogen is passed,
 either through a perforated pole or by a separate opening, into the
 crucible, the general effect is to shorten the length to which the arc
 can be drawn out, increase the relative intensity of the continuous
 spectrum, and diminish the intensity of the metallic lines.       Thus,
 with a very gentle stream of hydrogen in the magnesia crucible, most
 of the metallic lines, except the strongest and those of magnesium,
 disappear.    Those lines which remain are sometimes reversed ; those
 at wave-length 2850 and the triplet near L being always so.       With a
 stronger stream the lines of magnesium also disappear, the 6 triplet
 being the last in that neighbourhood to go, and b^ and 62 remaining
 after 64 had disappeared.
      Chlorine seems to have an opposite effect to hydrogen, generally
 intensifying the metallic lines, at least those of the less volatile
 metals, but it does not sensibly affect the spectrum of magnesium.
 Nitrous oxide produces no marked effect; coal-gas acts much as
 hydrogen.
    Spectrum  of tiie Magnesium Spark, in  Gases under High Pressures.
     In the  spark of an induction coil taken between magnesium points
 in air  we get  all the lines seen in the arc except two blue lines at
 wave-lengths 4350 and 4166, three lines above U, and the series of

1881.]           on the  Origin and Identity of Spectra.             695
triplets more refrangible than the quintuple group about wave-length
2780. The blue line wave-length about 4570 is best seen in the spark
without a jar when the magnesium electrodes are close together, and
the rheotome made to work slowly ; and this and the other faint lines
of the spark at about 4586 and 4808 require for their detection a
spectroscope in which the loss of light is small.
    On the other hand, some additional lines are seeu.     Of these, the
strong line at wave-length 4481 and the weaker line at 4586 are well
known.    Another faint line in the blue at wave-length 4808 has been
observed by us in the spark, and two diffuse pairs between H and the
triplet near L. Two ultra-violet lines at wave-lengths 2934 • 9, 2926 • 7
(Cornu) are near, but not identical with, two lines of the arc above
mentioned; and two more lines at wave-lengths 2797 '1, 2789-9
(Cornu) make a quadruple group with the very strong pair conspicuous
in the arc in this region. The spectrum of the spark ends, so far as
we have observed, with the quintuple group (2782-2776) already
described in the arc.
    When a Leyden jar is used with the coil, some of the lines are
reversed. This is notably the case with the triplet near L, the line at
wave-length 2850, and those at 2801 and 2794. Cornu* noticed the
reversal of the two less refrangible lines of the triplet near L under
these circumstances.    This effect is very much increased by increasing
the pressure of the gas in which the spark is taken. The Cailletet
pump is well suited for such experiments.          The gases used were
hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbonic oxide ; and the image of the spark
was thrown on to the slit of the spectroscope by a lens. In hydrogen,
when no Leyden jar was used, the brightness of the yellow and of the
blue lines of magnesium, except at first that at wave-length 4570,
diminished as the pressure increased ; while, on the other hand, the
6 group was decidedly stronger at the higher pressure.     The pressure
was carried up to 20 atmospheres, and then the magnesium lines in
the blue and below almost or entirely disappear, leaving only the Z»
group very bright, and the magnesium-hydrogen bands which are de
scribed below ; even the hydrogen lines F and C were not visible.
When a jar was used, the magnesium lines expanded as the pressure
was increased ; all three lines of the 6 group were expanded and re
versed at a pressure of 5 atmospheres ; the yellow line, wave-length
5528, was also expanded but not reversed ; and the line at 4481
became a broad, very diffuse band, hut the line at wave-length 4570
was but very little expanded.     The expansion both of the 6 group and
of the yellow line seemed to be greater on the less refrangible than on
the more refrangible side of each line, so that the black line in those
which were reversed was not in the middle.        When the jar was used,
the pressure could not be carried beyond 10 or 12^ atmospheres, as
the resistance became then BO great that the spark would not pass
across the small distance of about 1 millim. between the electrodes.

At   a pressure   2£ atmospheres, with a jar, the nltra-violet magnesium
                   of
triplet near   Lwas very well reversed, and the two pairs of lines on its
less refrangible side (shown in Plate              III.,
                                             Fig. 3) were expanded into
 two diffuse bands.
      In nitrogen and in carbonic oxide the general effects of increased
 pressure on the magnesium lines (not the magnesium-hydrogen bands)
 seemed to be much the same as in hydrogen.        Without a jar the blue
 and yellow lines were enfeebled, and at the higher pressures dis
 appeared, while the 6 group was very brilliant but not much ex
 panded. With the jar all the lines were expanded, and all three lines
 of the b group strongly reversed. The bands of the oxide (wave
 length 4930-5000) were not seen at all in hydrogen or nitrogen ;
 they were seen at first in carbonic oxide, but not after the sparking
 had been continued for some time.
      The disappearance of certain lines at increased pressure is in har
 mony with the observations of Cazin,* who noticed that the banded
 spectrum of nitrogen, and also the lines, grew fainter as the pressure
 was increased, and finally disappeared.      When a Leyden jar is em
 ployed there is a very great increase in the amount of matter
 volatilised by the spark from the electrodes, as is shown by the very
 rapid blackening of the sides of the tube with the deposited metal,
and this increase in the amount of metallic vapour may reasonably be
supposed to affect the character of the discharge, and conduce to the
widening of the lines and the reversal of some of them. Without a
jar the amount of matter carried off the electrode also doubtless
increases with the pressure and consequent resistance, and may be the
cause of the weakening, as Cazin suggests, of the lines of the gas in
 which the discharge is passed.     It is to be noted, moreover, that the
disappearance of the hydrogen lines depends, in some degree, on the
nearness of the electrodes. The lines C and F which were, as above
 stated, sometimes invisible in the spark when the electrodes were
near, became visible, under circumstances otherwise similar, when the
magnesium points had become worn away by the discharge.
                                 Comparison   of the Spectra.
     When we compare the spectra of magnesium in the flame, arc, and
spark, we observe that the most persistent line is that at wave-length
2850, which is also the strongest in the flame and arc, and one of the
strongest in the spark. The intensity of the radiation of magnesium
at this wave-length is witnessed by the fact that this line is always
reversed in the flame as well as in the arc when metallic magnesium
                        is it,
is introduced into    and in the spark between magnesium electrodes
when  a  Leyden jar    used.  It equally remarkable for its power of
                                             is

       Almost equal in persistence are the series of triplets.   Only the
  least refrangible pair of these triplets are seen in the flame, another
  pair are seen in the spark, but the complete series is only seen in the
  arc.   We regard the triplets as a series of harmonics, and to account
  for the whole series being seen only in the arc we must look to some
 other cause than the temperature. This will probably be found in
  the greater mass of the incandescent matter contained in the crucible
 in which the arc was observed.
       The blue line of the flame at wave-length 4570 is well seen in the
 arc, and is easily reversed, but is always a sharp line, increased in
 brightness but not sensibly expanded by putting magnesium into the
 crucible.    In the spark, at atmospheric pressure, it is only seen close
 to the pole or crossing the field in occasional flashes; but seems
 to come out more decidedly at rather higher pressures, at least in
 hydrogen.
       The series of bands near L, well developed in the flame, but not
 seen at all in the arc or spark, look very much like the spectrum of a
 compound, but we have not been able to trace them to any particular
 combination.      Sparks in air, nitrogen, and hydrogen have alike
 failed to produce them. The very strong, rather diffuse triplet at M,
 with which they end, so closely resembles in general character the
 other magnesium triplets, that it may well be connected with that
 constitution of the magnesiau particle which gives rise to the triple
 sets of vibrations in other cases, but, if BO, its presence in the flame
alone is not easily explained.
      The occurrence of this triplet in the ultra-violet, and of the
remarkable series of bands associated with         it,
                                                    as well as the extra
 ordinary intensity of the still more refrangible line at wave-length
 2850, which   is    strongly reversed in the spectrum of the flame,
corroborates what the discovery of the ultra-violet spectrum of water
had revealed, that at the temperature of flame substances while
 giving in the less refrangible part of the spectrum more or less
continuous radiation, may still give, in the regions of shorter wave
length, highly discontinuous spectra, such as have formerly been
deemed characteristic of the highest temperatures.        This subject we
will not discuss further at present, but simply remark that " opens
                                                                it
up questions as to the emissive power for radiation of short wave
lengths of gaseous bodies at the comparatively low temperature of
flame with regard to which we are accumulating facts."
     In the arc and spark, but not in the flame, we have next verya
striking group of two very strong lines at wave-lengths about 2801
and 2794, and   a     quintuple group of strong but sharp lines above
them. The former are usually reversed in the spark with jar, and
all are reversed in the arc when much magnesium          present. There
                                                         is
are also several single lines in the visible part of the spectrum
common to the arc and spark.         All of these may be lines developed
by the high temperature of the arc and spark. Two blue lines in the
arc have not been traced in the spark, but their non-appearance may

bo due to the Bame cause as that above suggested for the non-appear
ance  of the higher triplets, the smallness of the incandescent mass in
the spark.
    A triplet of lines in the arc near U appear to be represented in the
spark by an equally strong, or stronger, pair near but not identical
in position.    The possibility of such a shift, affecting these two
lines only in the whole spectrum and affecting them unequally, must
in the present state of our knowledge be very much a matter of
speculation.     Perhaps sufficient attention has not hitherto been
directed to the probability of vibrations being set up directly by the
electric discharge independently of the secondary action of elevation
of temperature. Some of the observations above described, and many
others well known, indicate a selective action by which an electric
discharge lights up certain kinds of matter in its path to the exclu
sion of others ; and it is possible that in the case of vibrations which
are not those most easily assumed by the particles of magnesium, the
character of the impulse may slightly affect the period of vibration.
The fact that, so far as observations go, the shift in the case of this
pair of magnesium lines is definite and constant, militates against the
supposition suggested. On the other hand, the ghost-like pairs of
lines observed in the spark below the triplet near L, suggest the
idea that some of the particles have their tones flattened by somo
such cause.
    The strong pair at wave-lengths 2801, 2794, are accompanied in
the spark, but not usually in the arc, by a much feebler, slightly more
refrangible pair, but these have not the diffuse ghost-like character
of those just alluded to.
    These lines are phenomena of the high potential discharge in
which particles are torn off the electrodes with great violence and
may well be thrown into a state of vibration which they will not
assume by more elevation of temperature.
    There are two lines in the spark besides the well-known line at
wave-length 4481 which have not been observed in the arc, but they
are feeble and would be insignificant if it were not the fact that they,
as well as wave-length 4481, all short lines seen generally only
about the poles, appear to bo present in the solar spectrum. In the
sun we seem to have all the lines common to the flame, arc, and
spark, and possibly the strong triplet of the flame at M. We have
noticed that when the spark is taken in hydrogen, the line at wave
length 4570 appears stronger than that at wave-length 4703, while
the reverse is the case when the atmosphere is nitrogen.            It is
possible then that the atmosphere may, besides the resistance it offers
to the discharge, in some degree affect the vibrations of the metallic
particles.
     The substantive result of the investigation is to prove that the
chemical atoms of magnesium are capable of taking up a great variety
of vibrations, and by mutual action on each other, or on particles
of matter of other kinds, give rise to a great variety of vibrations of

nection between the occurrence of the various vibrations and the
circumstances under which they occur, 'will require an extended
series of observations.
                       On the Spectrum        of Water.
    In our observations " On the Spectrum of the Compounds of Car
bon," we noticed that a remarkable series of lines, extending over the
region between the lines S and R of the solar spectrum, were
developed in the flame of coal-gas burning in oxygen.*    The arrange
ment of lines and bands, of which this spectrum consists, is shown
in the Pl. II., Fig. 3. It begins at the more refrangible end with
two strong bands, with wave-lengths about 3062, 3068, and extends
up to about the wave-length 8210.         It is well developed in the
flame of hydrogen as well as of hydrocarbons, burning in oxygen,
and less strongly in the flames of non-hydrogenous gases, such as
carbonic oxide and cyanogen, if burnt in moist oxygen. The same
spectrum is given by the electric spark taken, without condenser,
in moist hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbonic acid gas, but it
disappears if the gas and apparatus be thoroughly dried.       We are
led to the conclusion that the spectrum is that of water. The plate,
Fig. 3, is a general view of this spectrum. It was necessary to pass
a current of dry gas for fully an hour through the warmed sparking
apparatus before the moisture was sufficiently absorbed by the
dehydrating agents.    When this was done, photographs of the spark
showed either no trace, or only the faintest traces, of the spectrum
above described.     On introducing a drop of water, and letting it
spread over a plug of asbestos placed in the current of gas, the
spectrum above described at once imprinted itself on the photo
graphic plate.   The effect was the same, whether the gas used was
hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, or carbonic acid.         In the case of
nitrogen, some of the channelled bands due to that gas overlap the
water spectrum, and partly obscure      it,
                                        but not so much but that   canit
be still very distinctly recognised.   When     condenser

water spectrum disappears.        The same spectrum appears in the
De Meritens arc, but   isless fully developed.  The spectrum we have
figured does not by any means exhaust the ultra-violet spectra
of the flames we have observed. In writing of this and other spectra
which we have traced to compounds, we abstain from speculating
upon the particular molecular condition or stage of combination
of decomposition, which may give rise to such spectra. The fact of an
ultra-violet spectrum of water occurring in spectra of flames opens up

                               Identity   of Spectral Lines.
        In KirchhofFs       '
                              Eesearches on the Spectra of the Chemical
  Elements,'     p. 10, the following reference is made to the apparent
  identity of wave-length of some spectral lines.
        " If  we compare the spectra of the different metals with each
 other several of the bright lines appear to coincide. This is especially
 noticeable in the case of an iron aud magnesium line at 1655 • 6 (64), and
  with an iron line and calcium line at 1522-7 (E). It seems to me to
  be a question of great interest to determine, whether these and other
 similar coincidences are real or only apparent ; whether the lines in
 question actually fall one upon the other, or whether they lie very
 close together.       I   believe that my method of observation does not
 possess the requisite accuracy for the purpose of answering this
 question with any degree of probability, and                I  think that a large
 number of prisms           and    an   increased  intensity   of  light will prove
 necessary."*
       The subsequent investigations of Angstrom and Thalen increased
 the number of apparent coincidences amongst the spectral lines of
 different elements.
       The question of the identity of spectral lines exhibited by dif
 ferent elements is one of great interest, because it is very improbable
 that any single molecule should be capable of taking np all the
 immense variety of vibrations indicated by the complex spectrum of
 iron or that of titanium, and it might therefore be expected that such
 substances consist of heterogeneous molecules, and that some mole
 cules of the same kind as occur in these metals should occur in more
 than one of the supposed elements.               Further, the supposed identity
 of certain lines in the spectra of more than one element has been
made by Mr. Lockyer the ground of an argument in support of a
theory as to the dissociation of chemical elements into still simpler
constituents, and in reference to this he wrote : |
                                                                " The ' basic ' lines
recorded by Thalen will require special study, with a view to deter
mine whether their existence in different spectra can be explained or
not on the supposition that they represent the vibrations of forms,
which, at an early stage of the planet's history, entered into combina
tion with other forms, differing in proximate origin, to produce

70 lines given in Angstrom's map as common to two or more sub
 stances, has found that 56 are double or treble, 7 more doubtful, and
 only 7 appear definitely single, and he remarks : * " The complete
 investigation of the matter requires that the bright line spectra of
 the metals in question should be confronted with each other and with
 the solar spectrum under enormous dispersive power, in order that
 we may determine which of the components of each double line
belongs to one and which to the other element." It is this confronting
of the bright line spectra of some of the terrestrial elements which
we have attempted, and of which we now give an account. For the
dispersion we have used a reflecting grating similar to that used by
Young, with 17,296 lines to the inch, and a ruled surface of about 3^
square inches ; telescope and collimator, each with an aperture of
 1\ inch and focal length 18 inches, the lenses being of quartz, cut
perpendicularly to the axis and unachromatised, giving a very good
definition with monochromatic light. The chromatic aberration is in
this case an advantage, for when the telescope is in focus for lines in
the spectrum of any given order, the overlapping parts of spectra of
 different orders are out of focus, and their brightness consequently
 more or less enfeebled. We have sometimes used green or blue
 glasses to enhance this result.      The telescope and the collimator
 wore generally fixed at about 45°, the collimator being more nearly
 normal to the grating than the telescope, and the grating moved to
 bring in successive parts of the spectra. For the parts of the spectra
less refrangible than the Fraunhofer line £ the spectrum of the third
order was employed, for the more refrangible rays that of the fourth
order.    The source of light was the electric are taken in a crucible
of magnesia or lime, the image of the arc being focussed on the slit ;
and, for the examination of any supposed coincidence, first one metal
was introduced into the crucible, and the line to bo observed placed
on the pointer of the eye-piece ; the second metal was then intro
duced, and then in most cases, as detailed below, two lines wore seen
where only one was visible before, and the pointer indicated which of
the two belonged to the metal first introduced.          In some cases where
both metals were already in the crucible, we had to reinforce the
spectrum of one of the metals by the introduction of more of that
metal, which generally brought out the spectrum of that metal more
markedly than the other, and enabled us to distinguish the lines with
a high degree of probability.       Thus the crucibles of magnesia, or
the carbons, always contain sufficient lithium to show the orange line
and the calcium line heretofore supposed coincident with it (wave
length 6101•9), but we observed these lines quite distinct and
separated by a distance, estimated by the eye in comparison with the
distance of neighbouring titanium lines, at about one division of
Angstrom's scale. On dropping a minute piece of lithium carbonate
into the crucible, the less refrangible line was seen to expand and

for a short time to be reversed, the other line remaining narrow and
quite unaltered.     When the lithium had evaporated, and both lines
were again narrow, a small piece of Iceland spar was dropped into
the crucible, which immediately caused the expansion, and on one
occasion the reversal, of the more refrangible line, while now the
less refrangible line was unaffected.
    In this way we satisfied ourselves that the calcium line is the
more refrangible of the two, and is probably represented by the line
at wave-length 6101-9 in Angstrom's normal solar spectrum, while
the lithium line appears to be unrepresented.
     In the case of iron, which gives such a multitude of lines, it was
a priori probable that some lines would be coincident, or nearly so,
with lines of other elements ; and in fact we find that in five-sixths
of the supposed coincidences lines of iron are involved.      We have,
therefore, chiefly directed our attention to iron lines.    A complete
account of the separate resolutions will be found in the ' Proceedings
of the Eoyal Society,' May, 1881.
     PI. II., Fig. 5, shows the appearance of the magnesium group of
the solar spectrum as observed in spectroscopes used by different
observers. The lines marked b3 and b*, which appear to be single
lines in the maps of Angstrom and Kirchhoff, are resolved into double
lines by the greater dispersion employed by Thollon. The following
table shows the relative dispersion and number of lines seen by
different observers when powerful instruments are directed to the
same solar group :—

    The indium line 4101 '2 we found very difficult to separate from
the hydrogen line (A), as the latter had to be observed from a tube
with a spark, and it is both faint and diffuse; but several observa
tions all led to the conclusion that the indium line is very slightly
less refrangible than that of hydrogen.
    We have also directly compared the iron line at 5316' 07 with
the solar spectrum, and found that the iron line corresponds with
the less refrangible of the two solar lines at this place, so that the
chromospheric line is in all probability the other line of the pair.
    There are still a few cases of supposed coincidences which we
have not examined.     The results which we have recorded strongly
confirm Young's observations, and leave, we think, little doubt that
the few as yet unresolved coincidences either will yield to a higher
dispersion, or are merely accidental.     It would indeed be strange                if,
amongst    all the  variety of chemical  elements  and the still greater
variety  of vibrations   which  some of them   are capable of taking up,

there were no two which could take up vibrations of the same period.
We certainly should have supposed that substances like iron and
titanium, with such a large number of lines, must each consist of
more than one kind of molecule, and that not single lines, but
several lines of each, would be found repeated in the spectra of some
other chemical elements.      The fact that hardly single coincidences
can be established is a strong argument that the materials of iron
and titanium, even if they be not homogeneous, are still different
from those of other chemical elements. The supposition that the
different elements may be resolved into simple constituents, or into a
single one, has long been a favourite speculation with chemists ; but
however probable this hypothesis may appear a priori, it must be
acknowledged that the facts derived from the most powerful method
of analytical investigation yet devised give it scant support.
