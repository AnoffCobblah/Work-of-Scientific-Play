                                    HISTORICAL.
 THE sounding of a hydrogen flame when enclosed within a glass tube
 was, I believe, first noticed by Dr. Higgins, in 1777. The subject
 has been since investigated by Chladni, De la Rive, Faraday, Wheat
 stone, Rijke, Sondhauss, and Kundt. The action of unisonant sounds
 on flames enclosed in tubes has been investigated by Count Schaff
 gotsch and myself. The jumping of a naked fish-tail flame, in
 response to musical sounds, was first noticed by Professor Leconte at
a musical party in the United States. He made the important
observation that the flame did not jump until it was near flaring.
That his discovery was not further followed up by this learned investi
gator was probably due to too great a stretch of courtesy on his part
towards myself.” Last year, while preparing the experiments for one
    * The observation of Professor Leconte is thus graphically described:—“Soon
after the music commenced, I observed that the flame of the last-mentioned burner
exhibited pulsations in height which were exactly synchronous with the audible
beats. This phenomenon was very striking to every one in the room, and especially
so when the strong notes of the violoncello came in. It was exceedingly inter
esting to observe how perfectly even the trills of this instrument were reflected on
the sheet of flame. A deaf man might have seen the harmony. As the evening
advanced, and the diminished consumption of gas in the city increased the pressure,
the phenomenon became more conspicuous. The jumping of the flame gradually
increased, became somewhat irregular, and, finally it began to flare continuously,
emitting the characteristic sound indicating the escape of a greater amount of gas
than could be properly consumed. I then ascertained by experiment, that the
phenomenon did not take place unless the discharge of gas was so regulated, that
the flame approximated to the condition of flaring. I likewise determined by
experiment, that the effects were not produced by jarring or shaking the floor and

 of my “Juvenile Lectures,” my late assistant, Mr. Barrett, observed
 the effect independently; and he afterwards succeeded in illustrating
 it by some very striking experiments. With a view to the present
 discourse, and also to the requirements of a forthcoming work on
 Sound, the subject of sounding and sensitive flames has been recently
 submitted to examination in the Laboratory of the Royal Institution.
 The principal results of the inquiry are embodied in the following
 abstract.
                            ABSTRACT or LECTURE.
     Pass a steadily-burning candle rapidly through the air, you obtain
 an indented band of light, while an almost musical sound heard at the
 same time announces the rhythmic character of the motion. If, on
 the other hand, you blow against a candle-flame, the fluttering noise
 produced indicates a rhythmic action.
     When a fluttering of the air is produced at the embouchure of an
 organ-pipe, the resonance of the pipe reinforces that particular pulse
 of the flutter whose period of vibration coincides with its own, and
 raises it to a musical sound.
     When a gas-flame is introduced into an open tube of suitable
 length and width, the current of air passing over the flame produces
 such a flutter, which the resonance of the tube exalts to a musical
 sound.
     Introducing a gas-flame into this tin tube three feet long, we
 obtain a rich musical note; introducing it into a tube six feet long, we
 obtain a note an octave deeper—the pitch of the note depending on the
 length of the tube. Introducing the flame into this third tube, which
 is fifteen feet long, the sound assumes extraordinary intensity. The
 vibrations which produce it are sufficiently powerful to shake the
 pillars, floor, seats, gallery, and the five or six hundred people who
 occupy the seats and gallery. The flame is sometimes extinguished
 by its own violence, and ends its peal by an explosion as loud as a
 pistol shot.                                                    -
     The roar of a flame in a chimney is of this character: it is a rude
 attempt at music.
     By varying the size of the flame, these tubes may be caused to
 emit their harmonic sounds.
     Passing from large tubes to small ones, we obtain a series of
 musical notes, which rise in pitch as the tube diminishes in length.
walls of the room by means of repeated concussions. Hence it is obvious that the
pulsations of the flame were not owing to indirect vibrations propagated through
the medium of the walls of the room to the burning apparatus, but must have been
produced by the direct influence of aerial sonorous pulses on the burning jet.”—

Journal, Jan. 1858.

8                           Professor Tyndall                     [Jan. 18,
This flame, surrounded by a tube 17% inches long, vibrates 459 times
in a second, while that contained in this tube, 10# inches long,
vibrates 717 times in a second.        Owing to the intense heat of the
sounding column, these numbers are greater than those corresponding
to organ-pipes of the same lengths sounding in air.
     The vibrations of the flame consist of a series of partial extinctions
and revivals of the flame.
     The singing flame appears continuous; but if the head be moved to
and fro, or if an opera-glass, directed to the flame, be caused to move
to and fro; or if, after the method of Wheatstone, the flame be
regarded in a mirror which is caused to rotate, the images due to the
revivals of the flame are separated from each other, and form a chain
of flames of great beauty.
    With a longer tube and larger flame, by means of a concave mirror,
I can project this chain of flames upon a screen. I first clasp my
hand round the end of the tube so as to prevent the current of air
which causes the flutter from passing over the flame:—the image of
the flame is now steady upon the screen before you. I move the
mirror to and fro, and you have this continuous luminous band:
I withdraw my hand; the current of air passes over the flame, and
instantly the band breaks up into a chain of images.
    A position can be chosen in the tube at which the flame bursts spon
taneously into song.    A position may also be chosen where the flame
is silent, but at which, if it could only be started, it would continue to
sound. It is possible to start such a silent flame by a pitch-pipe, by
the syren, or by the human voice. It is also possible to cause one
flame to effect the musical ignition of another. .
     The sound which starts the flame must be nearly in unison with its
own. Both flames must be so near unison as to produce distinct beats.
    A flame may be employed to detect sonorous vibrations in air.
     Thus, in front of this resonant case, which supports a large and
powerful tuning-fork, I move this bright gas-flame to and fro. A
continuous band of light is produced, slightly indented through the
friction  of the air. The fork is now sounded, and instantly this band
breaks up into a series of distinct images of the flame.          e
    Approaching the same flame, towards either end of one of our tin
tubes, with the sounding flame within it, and causing it to move to
and fro, the sonorous vibrations also effect the breaking up of the band
of light into a chain of images.
    In this glass-tube, fourteen inches long, a flame is sounding: I
bring the flat flame of a fish-tail burner over the tube, the broad side
of the flame being at right angles to the axis of the tube.      The fish
tail flame instantly emits a musical note of the same pitch as that
of the singing-flame, but of different quality. Its sound is, in fact,
that of a membrane, the part of which it here plays.
    Against a broad bat's-wing flame I, allow a sheet of air, issuing
from a thin slit, to impinge. A musical note is the consequence.
The note can be produced by air or by carbonic acid; but it is pro

1867.]                 on Sounding and Sensitive Flames.                        9
duced with greater force and purity by oxygen. The pitch of the note
depends on the distance of the slit from the flame.
     Before you burns a bright candle-flame: I may shout, clap my
hands, sound this whistle, strike this anvil with a hammer, or explode
a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen. Though sonorous waves pass
in each case through the air, the candle is absolutely insensible to
the sound; there is no motion of the flame.
     I now urge from this small blow-pipe a narrow stream of air
through the flame of the candle, producing thereby an incipient flutter,
and reducing the brightness of the flame. I now sound the whistle;
the flame jumps visibly. Matters may be so arranged that when
the whistle sounds, the flame shall be either almost restored to its
pristine brightness, or that the amount of light it still possesses shall
disappear.
     Before you now burns a bright flame from a fish-tail burner. I
may, as before, shout, clap my hands, sound a whistle, or strike an
anvil; the flame remains steady and without response. I urge against
the broad face of the flame a stream of air from the blow-pipe just
employed. The flame is cut in two by the stream of air. It flutters
slightly, and now when the whistle is sounded the flame instantly
starts.    A knock on the table causes the two half-flames to unite and
form for an instant a flame of the ordinary shape. By a slight variation
of the experiment, the two side-flames disappear when the whistle
is sounded, and a central tongue of flame is thrust forth in their
stead.
     Passing from a fish-tail to a bat's-wing burner, I obtain this
broad steady flame. It is quite insensible to the loudest sound which
would be tolerable here. The flame is fed from this gas-holder,
which places a power of pressure at my disposal unattainable from
the gas-pipes of the Institution. I turn on more gas; the flame enlarges,
but it is still insensible to sound.       I enlarge it still more, and now a
slight flutter of its edge answers to the sound of the whistle. Turning
on a little more gas, and sounding again, the jumping of the flame is
still more distinct. Finally I turn on gas until the flame is on the
point of roaring, as flames do when the pressure is too great. I now
sound my whistle; the flame roars and thrusts suddenly upwards eight
long quivering tongues.
     I strike this distant anvil with a hammer, the flame instantly
responds by thrusting forth its tongues.
    Another flame is now before you. It issues from a burner, formed
of ordinary gas-tubing by my assistant. The flame is 18 inches long,
and smokes copiously. I sound the whistle; the flame falls to a
height of 9 inches, the smoke disappears, and the brilliancy of the
flame is augmented.”                                                         ->
   * Mr. Barrett also observed the increase of light on the shortening of a flame
by a musical sound; nor did the superior effect of high notes escape the attention
of this acute and skilful young experimenter.

10                    .     Professor Tyndall                 |Jan. 18,
    Here are two other flames, also issuing from burners formed by
my assistant. The one of them is long, straight, and smoky;
the other is short, forked, and brilliant. I sound the whistle; the
long flame becomes short, forked, and brilliant; the forked flame
becomes long and smoky. As regards, therefore, their response to
the sonorous waves, the one of these flames is the exact complement
of the other.
    Here are various flat flames, ten inches high, and about three
inches across at their widest part. They are purposely made forked
flames. When the whistle sounds, the plane of each flame turns
ninety degrees round, and continues in its new position as long as the
whistle continues to sound.
    Here again is a flame of admirable steadiness and brilliancy,
issuing from a single circular orifice in a common iron nipple. I
whistle, clap my hand, strike the anvil, and produce other sounds: the
flame is perfectly steady. Observe the gradual change from this
apathy to sensitiveness. The flame is now 4 inches high. I make
its height 6 inches; it is still indifferent. I make it 10 inches; a
barely perceptible quiver responds to the whistle. I make it 14
inches high, and now it jumps briskly the moment the anvil is
tapped or the whistle sounded. I augment the pressure; the flame
is now 16 inches long, and you observe a quivering which
announces that the flame is near roaring. I increase the pressure;
it now roars, and shortens at the same time to a height of 8 inches.
I diminish the pressure a little; the flame is again 16 inches long,
but it is on the point of roaring. It stands as it were on the brink
of a precipice.   The whistle pushes it over. Observe it shortens when
the whistle sounds, exactly as it did when the pressure was in excess.
The sonorous pulses, in fact, furnish the supplement of energy neces
sary to produce the roar and shorten the flame. This is the simple
philosophy of all these sensitive flames.
    The pitch of the note chosen to push the flame over the brink
is not a matter of indifference. I have here a tuning-fork which
vibrates 256 times in a second, emitting a clear and forcible note.
It has no effect upon this flame. Here are three other forks, vibrating
respectively 320, 384, and 512 times in a second. Not one of them
produces the slightest impression upon the flame. But, besides their
fundamental tones, these forks can be caused to sound a series of
overtones of very high pitch. I sound this series of tones: the
vibrations are now 1,600, 2,000, 2,400, and 3,200 per second respec
tively. The flame jumps in response to each of these sounds; the
response to the highest tone of the series being the most prompt and
energetic of all.
    To the tap of a hammer upon a board the flame responds; but to
the tap of the same hammer upon an anvil the response is much more
brisk and animated. The reason is, that the clang of the anvil is rich
in the higher tones to which the flame is most sensitive.
    Here again is an inverted bell, which I cause to sound by means of

 1867.]             on Sounding and Sensitive Flames.                 11
a fiddle-bow, producing a powerful tone. The flame is unmoved. I
bring a halfpenny into contact with the surface of the bell: the conse
 quent rattle contains the high notes to which the flame is sensitive.
It instantly shortens, flutters, and roars when the coin touches the
     Here is another flame, 20 inches long. I take this fiddle in my
hand, and pass a bow over the three strings which emit the deepest
 notes. There is no response on the part of the flame. I sound the
highest string: the jet instantly squats down to a tumultuous bushy
flame, 8 inches long. I have here a small bell, the hammer of which
is caused to descend by clock-work. I hold it at a distance of 20 yards
from the flame. The strokes follow each other in rhythmic succession,
and at every stroke the flame falls from a height of 20 to a height of
8 inches.
     The rapidity with which sound is propagated through air is well
illustrated by these experiments. There is no sensible interval between
the stroke of the bell and the shortening of the flame.
     Some of these flames are of marvellous sensibility; one such is
at present burning before you. It is nearly 20 inches long; but the
slightest tap on a distant anvil knocks it down to 8.      I shake this
bunch of keys or these few copper coins in my hand: the flame
responds to every tinkle. I may stand at a distance of 20 yards
from this flame: the dropping of a sixpence from a height of a couple
of inches into a hand already containing coin, knocks the flame down.
I cannot walk across the floor without affecting the flame. The
creaking of my boots sets it in violent commotion. The crumpling
of a bit of paper, or the rustle of a silk dress, does the same.   It is
startled by the plashing of a raindrop. I speak to the flame, repeating
a few lines of poetry; the flame jumps at intervals, apparently
picking certain sounds from my utterance to which it can respond,
while it is unaffected by others.
     In our experiments downstairs we have called this the vowel flame,
because the different vowel-sounds affect it differently. Vowel-sounds
of the same pitch are known to be readily distinguishable. Their
qualities or clang-tints are different, though they have a common
fundamental tone. They differ from each other through the admixture
of higher tones with the fundamental. It is the presence of these
higher tones in different proportions that characterizes the vowel
sounds; and it is to these same tones, and not to the fundamental
one, that our flame is sensitive. I utter a loud and sonorous U, the
flame remains steady; I change the sound to O, the flame quivers;
I sound E, and now the flame is affected strongly. I utter the
words boot, boat, and beat in succession.     To the first there is no
response; to the second, the flame starts; but by the third it
is thrown into violent commotion; the sound Ah / is still more
powerful. When the vowel sounds are analysed their constituents
are found to vary in accordance with the foregoing experiments;
those characterized by the sharpest overtones being the most powerful

p . 286. flame is peculiarly sensitive to the utterance of the letter S. If
the most distant person in the room were to favour me with a “hiss,”
the flame would be instantly shivered into tumult. The utterance of
the word “hush,” or “puss,” produces the same effect.               This hissing
sound contains the precise elements that most forcibly affect the
flame. The gas issues from its burner with a hiss, and an external
sound of this character added to that of a gas-jet already on the
point of roaring is equivalent to an augmentation of pressure on the
issuing stream of gas. I hold in my hand a metal box containing
compressed air.        I turn the cock for a moment so as to allow a
puff to escape: the flame instantly ducks down; not by any transfer
of air from the box to the flame, for I stand at a distance which
utterly excludes this idea; it is the sound of the issuing air that

WHEN atmospheric air is separated from a vacuous or partially vacuous
space by a septum, partition, or bag of india-rubber, some air passes
through the septum into the originally vacuous space.
     This space may be conveniently maintained vacuous, and any
    * Those who wish to repeat these experiments would do well to bear in mind,
as an essential condition of complete success, that a free way should be open for
the transmission of the vibrations from the flame backwards, through the gaspipe
which feeds it. The orifices of the stopcocks near the flame ought to be as wide
as possible,

 air passing into it be simultaneously withdrawn and delivered for
 examination, by means of Sprengel's exhauster.
     Whereas atmospheric air consists of about 21 per cent. of oxygen
 and 79 per cent. of nitrogen, the air transmitted through indie-rubber
 into a vacuous space is found to contain about 40 per cent. of oxygen
 and 60 per cent. of nitrogen, and to have the property of re-in<U+FB02>aming
 a glowing splinter.
      A transmission, therefore, takes place through the rubber septum
 of both constituents of the atmosphere, but there is a greater propor
 tionate transmission of its oxygen than of its nitrogen.
      Single or unmixed gases, similarly separated from a vacuous space
 by a septum of indie-rubber, penetrate the rubber and enter the
 vacuous space with the following relative velocities :— ~
                  Nitrogen        .  .    .        . .     1
                  Marsh-gas      .   .   .       .   .     2'15
                  Oxygen         .   .   .       .   .     2'55
                  Hydrogen       .   .   .      .    .     5'50
                  Carbonic acid   .  .    .      .   .    1358
     From these velocities the observed passage of mixed oxygen and
 nitrogen gases through india-rubber is deducible by calculation; and
conversely, the separate velocities of oxygen and nitrogen are deducible
 from the transmission-results obtained with atmospheric air :
        Oxygen     21   x   2'55    :        53'55     .     .  .  40-4
        Nitrogen   79   X   1       =        790        .    .  .  59'6
                                            132‘55                1000
     The constituent gases of atmospheric air not only pass through an
india-rnbber septum into a vacuous space, but also into a space
containing some other gas, such as hydrogen or carbonic acid, and
 at the relative velocities with which they enter a vacuous space ; but
the conditions of the experiment then become more complicated.
     In the case of an india-rubber balloon <U+FB01>lled with carbonic acid, for
instance, not only are atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen gases con
tinually entering the balloon, but carbonic acid gas is continually and
very rapidly escaping from it.
     Throughout the vacuum experiment, the conditions remain constant,
the hyperoxygenized air being withdrawn as fast as transmitted; but
in the balloon experiment, the oxygen is gradually accumulating within
the balloon, whereby the conditions are constantly varying.
     Eventually, by the rapid escape of carbonic acid, the proportion or
pressure of oxygen in the internal mixture comes to exceed that in the.
external air; whereupon a reverse transmission through _'the balloon,
of the excess of oxygen into the external air, at once begins.
                                    II.
    When ordinary coal-gas :is separated from a vacuous space by
a septum, partition, or tube of platinum, some gas passes through the

14                 Dr. Odling on Mr. Graham’s Recent           [Jan. 25,
platinum septum into the originally vacuous space, as soon as, but
not until, the metal is raised to the temperature of ignition.
    Whereas coal-gas is a variable mixture of marsh-gas and hydrogen
with several other gases and vapours, containing on the average about
45 per cent. of marsh-gas and 40 per cent. of hydrogen, the gas
transmitted through ignited platinum is found to consist exclusively
of hydrogen.
    A transmission therefore of only one, and that not the most
abundant of the many constituents of coal-gas, takes place into the
originally vacuous space through a septum of ignited platinum.
     So that while the nitrogen of the air is transmitted through a
septum of india-rubber in a much smaller ratio than its oxygen, the
other constituents of coal-gas are transmitted through a septum of
ignited platinum in an in<U+FB01>nitely smaller ratio than is its hydrogen.
     Experimenting with single or unmixed gases, the quantity of
hydrogen transmitted through a septum of ignited platinum into a
vacuous space amounted to over 100 cubic centimetres in half-an-hour ;
whereas, under the same conditions, the quantity transmitted of
oxygen, nitrogen, marsh-gas, carbonic acid, and some other gases, did
not amount to ' 01 cubic centimetre in half-an-hour.
     Further, the transmission of hydrogen through a septum of ignited
platinum, as of various gases through a septum of indie-rubber, takes
place into a volume of some other gas as well as into a vacuum, but
with a similar complication of results.
     What is the nature of these transmissions of gas through india
 rubber and ignited platinum respectively? Are the phenomena in
 the two cases similar or dissimilar to each other; and with what
 class of actions are they one or both associated P
                                    III.
     By a suf<U+FB01>cient degree of pressure, gases may be forced through
 the minute channels of a porous septum; or, in other words, may
 pass through such a septum by transpiration.                          _
     But transpiration takes place only through obvious channels or
 pores, from which indie-rubber and platinum are entirely free.
     Again, transpiration through a porous septum takes place only in
 the direction of the preponderating total pressure; but the trans
 mission of gas through india-rubber and ignited platinum, from one
 gaseous space into another, can take place in the opposite direction to
 that of the total pressure, and in both directions at the same time, by
 a sort of interchange of gases through the septum.
     Moreover, the composition of a mixed gas, such as atmospheric
 air or coal-gas, is not altered by mere transpiration; whereas the
 composition of these mixed gases is greatly altered by their trans
 missions through india-rubber and ignited platinum respectively.
 ' Lastly, every gas and every mixture of gases has its own special

1867.]            Discoveries on the Diffusion of Gases.                   15
velocity of transpiration, irrelative to any other property of the gas,
and irreducible to any general law. These rates are altogether
different from the observed rates of transmission of the same gases
through india-rubber and ignited platinum, thus:—
               Oxygen      .    -   -      -    •  -    .    1 00
               Nitrogen    .    -   -      •   •   -    .      . 87
               Carbonic acid    .   •      •   -   •    ..    • 73
               Marsh-gas .     -    -     •    -   -    ..    • 55
               Hydrogen .      -    -                         •44
    From these differences in the character of the phenomena, as well
as from another important difference hereafter to be mentioned, it is
clear that the transmission of various gases through india-rubber, and
of hydrogen through platinum, is not due to transpiration.
                                       IV.
    As the channels of a porous septum become more and more
minute, their resistance to the bodily transmission of gas becomes
greater and greater, and the quantity of gas forced through them less
and less, until at length the septum becomes absolutely impermeable
to transpiration, under the particular pressure.
    But such a septum, of which the individual capillary channels are
so Small as to offer a greater resistance, or friction, to the passage of gas
through them than the available pressure can overcome, may neverthe
less present a considerable aggregate of interspace, through which the
proper diffusive movement of gases, due to their innate molecular
mobility, may take place freely.
    When any volume of gas is allowed access to a vacuous space, or to
an additional gaseous space, it gradually diffuses itself throughout the
space afforded it, at a rate inversely proportionate for each gas to the
square root of its specific gravity.
    In so far as the aggregate area of interspace available for diffusion
is greatly diminished, by the introduction of a porous non-transpiring
septum between the diffusing gas and the additional space afforded it,
so is the amount of diffusion within a given time proportionably
diminished; but in no other respect does the septum appear to take
any part in the action; it neither promotes nor retards the diffusion,
but simply allows it to take place in proportion to the aggregate area
of the interspace which it affords.
    The experimental determination by means of Bunsen's diffusiono
meter of the relative diffusion-velocities of different gases through a
thin plate of compressed graphite—a septum without obvious pores and
quite impermeable to transpiration—has given numbers which are
almost identical with the reciprocals of the square roots of the
specific gravities of the several gases:—                              -
                 Hydrogen                                3•80
                 Marsh-gas                                1• 34

                 Carbonic acid   .           •              •81

 16                 Dr. Odling on Mr. Graham's Recent           |Jan. 25,
      Interdiffusion of different gases takes place in proportion to their
 respective diffusion-velocities. Thus with air and hydrogen separated
 from each other by a graphite septum, for every 1 volume of air which
 passes into the hydrogen-space, 3.8 volumes of hydrogen pass into the
 air-space.                         -
     Mixed gases also diffuse away from one another according to their
 respective diffusion-velocities. As a result of even the small superior
 diffusiveness of nitrogen over that of oxygen, the proportion of oxygen
 in atmospheric air has been increased from 21 to 24.5 per cent, by
 the diffusion of nitrogen away from it, during its conveyance through
 several lengths of porous tobacco-pipe enclosed in a vacuous space.
     The acts of gas-diffusion through porous septa and of gas-trans
 mission through india-rubber and ignited platinum resemble each
other in several points. They both take place through septa free
 from obvious pores; they both take place as well in the direction as
against the direction of the preponderating pressure, and also in op
posite directions at the same time by a sort of interchange; and they
both effect an alteration in the composition of any mixed gas subjected
to their operations.
     But they differ altogether from one another in the relative
velocities with which the gas-movements in each case are effected—
the transmissions of gas through india-rubber and ignited platinum
being at special rates, while the diffusions of gas through porous
septa are inversely as the square roots of the specific gravities of the
particular gases.
     Thus the specific gravity of nitrogen being somewhat less than
that of oxygen, its rate of diffusion is accordingly somewhat higher,
in the proportion of 101 to 95. Hence, if the passage of air through
the rubber septum were due to diffusion, the transmitted air should
be rather richer in nitrogen and poorer in oxygen than the original
air; whereas the transmitted air is actually found to be very much
richer in oxygen and poorer in nitrogen than the original air.
     Again, hydrogen having a far lower specific gravity than marsh
gas, its diffusion rate is very much higher, in the ratio of 380 to 134.
Hence, taking the proportion of marsh-gas to hydrogen in coal-gas,
as 1 to 1, and it is usually rather greater, if the passage of coal-gas
through ignited platinum were due to diffusion, for every 380 volumes
of hydrogen transmitted there should be 134 volumes of marsh-gas:
but in reality no marsh-gas whatever is transmitted; so that neither
with the rubber septum nor with the platinum septum are the results
due to diffusion.
     It is rare to have phenomena of diffusion undisturbed by
phenomena of transpiration, or phenomena of transpiration un
disturbed by phenomena of diffusion; but since the alteration in
the composition of a mixed gas by its passage through a trans
piring-diffusing septum is effected solely by diffusion, the results
obtained with the rubber and platinum septa are not due to joint
transpiration-diffusion.

                                     V.                             -
    A septum may be quite free from pores of any kind or degree
of minuteness, and so far be absolutely impermeable to the passage
of gas through it in the form of gas, but may nevertheless permit a
considerable transmission of certain gases by their prior solution or
liquefaction in the substance of the septum.
    The merest film of water, as of a soap-bubble for instance, is quite
impermeable to gas as gas; but allows the ready transmission of a
soluble gas, such as ammonia, through it, by reason of a prior
solution or liquefaction of the ammonia in the film of water.
    The film of water may be replaced by a moist membrane of any
degree of thinness or thickness, with a similar result.
    In this case the phenomenon consists in a solution of the gas in
the moist material of the septum—in a diffusion of the liquefied gas
as a liquid through the thickness of the septum—in an evaporation
of the liquefied gas from the remote surface of the septum—and lastly,
in a diffusion of the evaporated gas into the adjoining space.
    Of the many circumstances affecting the final result, the influence
of the solubility of the gas in the liquid of the septum would so far
predominate over all other influences as to allow of their being left
out of consideration. Whence it may be affirmed that the transmission
of any gas through a film of liquid, or a moist septum, will be found
proportionate to the solubility of the gas in the liquid.
    But gases are absorbable not only by liquids, but also by certain
solids, and especially by charcoal.
    The gases absorbed by charcoal are probably liquefied in the
charcoal; at any rate, the more absorbable of them occupy a bulk
considerably less than if reduced to the liquid state by pressure.
    All charcoal is more or less porous; but its absorption of gases
is not proportionate to, or a mere physical effect of its porosity; since
other similarly porous substances do not manifest the same absorptive
power; and since the absorbability by charcoal of any gas is as special
a property of that gas as is its solubility in water, or alcohol.
    The transmission of an absorbable gas through a septum of
compact charcoal, such as the cocoa-nut charcoal used by Mr. Hunter
of Belfast, which absorbs about ', of its volume of mercury, and
111 times its volume of ammonia, would take place in two ways.
    A portion of the gas would pass through the fine pores of the
charcoal as gas, by diffusion, at a rate inversely proportionate to the
square root of its specific gravity; while another portion would
become liquefied in the charcoal by capillary condensation, pass
through the charcoal as a liquid, and evaporate from the other side,
just as would a gas liquefied by solution in a moist membrane; and
it is conceivable that, in some compact forms of charcoal, the trans
mission of gas by gaseous diffusion might be inappreciable as
compared with its transmission by liquefaction and evaporation.

     Whereas the mere passage of gas through a transpiring or dif
 fusing septum takes place in thorough independence of the nature
 of the material of the septum, in these last considered actions the
 transmission takes place by virtue of a sort of chemical af<U+FB01>nity between
 the gas and the material of the septum—the selective absorption of the
 gas by the septum being a necessary antecedent of its transmission ;
 whence it may be said that the gas is transmitted because it is <U+FB01>rst
 absorbed.
     Is, then, the transmission of oxygen, &c., through indie-rubber, and
 of hydrogen through ignited platinum, effected by a process, at all allied
 to that of gas-liquefaction by solution or capillary condensation ?
     That septa of indie-rubber and platinum differ from merely
di<U+FB02>’usive and transpiring septa, in effecting or allowing a selective
transmission of certain gases through them, is evident; but do they
<U+FB01>rst exert a selective or, in other words, a chemical absorption of these
particular gases?
     Experiment answers that they do; oxygen proving to be more
than twice as absorbable by india-rubber as by water, and hydrogen
proving to be fully three times as absorbable by wrought-platinum as
by charcoal.
     The statements of fact and interpretation contained in this abstract
are based upon the investigations of Mr. Graham, spread over a long
period of years; and especially upon the investigations described in
his more recent memoirs ‘ On the Molecular Mobility of Gases’ (Phil.
Trans, 1863), and ‘On the Absorption and Dialytic Separation of
Gases by Colloid Septa ’ (Phil. Trans, 1866).

                         On the Crystal Palace Fire.
MR. RUSSELL commenced by stating that he appeared as a substi
tute for Professor Max Muller, and that he had much pleasure in
undertaking the task which had been imposed upon him. As one
of the <U+FB01>rst of those o<U+FB02>icially connected with the Exhibition of All

1867.]                on the Crystal Palace Fire.                      19
Nations, in Hyde Park, he, and the other promoters of it, regarded
the Crystal Palace as an institution ;—as one of a series of efforts
which had long been in progress for the purpose of advancing the
education of the English people, and more especially the large mass
of people concentrated in the metropolis; as an institution for edu
cating the multitude by their eyes ;—for cultivating their tastes by
means of the best works of the greatest men of all times, and for sub
stituting pure and re<U+FB01>ned pleasures for the coarse and somewhat vulgar _
recreations which too often <U+FB01>lled up the leisure hours of crowded
masses of men. Regarding the Crystal Palace in that light, his
audience, like himself<U+FB01>would take a deep and painful interest in the
catastrophe which had overtaken one of the most interesting portions
of the building.
    He proposed to divide his remarks into three divisions: <U+FB01>rst, to
consider the structural and mechanical character of the building, its
stability and power of resistance to mechanical force and to <U+FB01>re;
secondly, to consider the <U+FB01>re itself ; and thirdly, to consider what was
best to be done for its restoration.
    With regard to the building itself, it might be super<U+FB02>uous to say
much. They knew its splendid site on Sydenham hill, and the general
beauty of its aspect, but there were peculiarities in its structure not
generally understood, which affected the relations of the <U+FB01>re to the‘
palace. They would remember that the Crystal Palace was the infant
of the original building in Hyde Park,—that fairy palace more won
derful than their dreams had been,—which <U+FB01>rst burst upon their view
on the memorable 1st of May, l851,——that building which itself was
said to be the most beautiful thing in the Exhibition. That 1st of May
could never be forgotten, when All Nations <U+FB01>rst met together in
friendly rivalry. One whose name they would all remember with
respect and gratitude, the late Chevalier Bunsen, on that day and in
that palace, threw his_arms around the neck of one of his country
men, and cxelaimed,—alas ! too prematurely, “ That happy period we
have all longed for of universal peace has at last arrived.” For the
purposes of the present discourse, it was necessary to describe how that
beautiful building was made strong, durable, and relatively <U+FB01>reproof.
It was the invention of Sir Joseph Paxton, whose experiments at
Chatsworth induced him to submit to the Royal Commissioners the
plan of this great and beautiful glasshouse. It had happened to be
his, Mr. Russell’s, duty to take Sir Joseph Paxton’s designs to His
Royal Highness the late Prince Consort, and the result was that the
Commissioners were induced to forego their accepted brick and mortar
plan, and to adopt that of Sir Joseph Paxton. That building, however
(drawings of which were before the meeting), could hardly be recog
nized as the present Crystal Palace, so much had its exterior been
changed by progressive improvements in the design. The design, as
at <U+FB01>rst submitted, was of the simplest form ; the roof being <U+FB02>at from
end to end. When the drawings were submitted to the Building Com
mittee by Messrs. Fox and Henderson, who had worked out Sir Joseph
                                                              0 2

     Paxton’s design, they were required to add a transept to be in confor
    mity with the plan of the Building Committee, which had a transept.
        There were a number of trees on the site of the building, and it
    had been intended to out openings in the roof for the trees to grow
    through, and the next suggestion was that the proposed transept should
    be placed over the trees ; then it was found that the trees were taller
    than the transept. In this <U+FB01>x, Mr. Henderson said, “ Happy thought.
. I Take the circular roof of the Great Conservatory at Chatsworth, and
    put it upon the transept instead of a <U+FB01>at roof.” “ Happy thought,”
    indeed! A happier thought still was that of Sir Charles Barry, to
    continue the arched roof along the whole length of the building, and
    thus to complete an entirely new style of edi<U+FB01>ce in glass and iron.
    Time, however, was wanting, and the <U+FB01>rst building went without this
    great crowning feature. The elevation of the building derived great
    advantage from the suggestion of Sir Charles Barry, who suggested
    the horizontal panels or string courses with circular openings in each,
    above and

        He next proceeded to explain, with the assistance of drawings and
    diagrams, the peculiar arrangements which constituted the strength
    and stability of a building so apparently fragile, and to render it a
    marvellous combination of lightness with elegance and strength.
    Supported by columns only eight inches in diameter, the strength
    of the structure consisted in the two qualities of accumulation and
    rigidity. Arranged in sets of four, these columns, which might in
    that position be compared to the legs of a table, were <U+FB01>rmly braced
    and united together by cross-girders of triangular pattern, which acted
    as the top of the table to its legs, and hence the quality of rigidity
    and strength. Each of these sets of four columns and girders was
    <U+FB01>rmly connected with a second set, so that it was impossible to upset
    one of these tables without upsetting the second; the second was
    connected with a third, and so on; and thus, by the principle of accu
    mulation, the whole building was able to resist any pressure that might
    come against the front of it. Hence, the essential parts of the
    Crystal Palace had never suffered, as it had been predicted it would,
    from any of the violent storms of wind to which it had been exposed;
    and the merit of this admirable arrangement of mechanical powers
    rested between Sir Charles Fox and Mr. Henderson. The beauty of
    detail and colour which gave grace and homogeneity to the interior,
    was due to Mr. Owen Jones. Not the least ingenious portion of the
    design was the construction of the roof by the repetition of ridge and
    furrow ribs, in sections of 24 feet long by 8 feet wide; and nothing
    but this simplicity could have made it possible for all these parts to
    be constructed with the greatest accuracy, in di<U+FB01>'erent parts of the
    country simultaneously, and the whole building put together in such
    an incredibly short space of time.
        How then could such a building as Mr. Russell had described be

 burnt? In the <U+FB01>rst place, such a building would not burn of itself;
 secondly, if you set it on <U+FB01>re it would not keep alight; thirdly, he
 thought it was pretty clear that the late <U+FB01>re at the Crystal Palace went
 out by itself, though some of them took a great deal of credit to them
 selves for trying to put it out ; and fourthly, it must not be forgotten that
 any building could be burnt by putting suf<U+FB01>cient combustible matter in
 it. It was to be feared that there was enough combustible matter in that
 portion of the Palace which had been destroyed to burn <U+FB01>ercely, and
 do great injury to the building, but he was as satis<U+FB01>ed as ever that the
 building was one of the safest that could be conceived to resist <U+FB01>re.
 With regard to the late <U+FB01>re, it was very di<U+FB02>‘icult to ascertain the actual
 facts, nor did he know that he could distinctly recollect, or could put
 into language which might not be misunderstood, that which he had
 actually seen of it.
      The <U+FB01>re, it ‘would be remembered, occurred at the north end of the
 palace, in the beautiful Tropical Department where they used to sit
 and dream of bygone ages and distant climates, very unlike their own.
 There stood the wonderful court illustrative of that ancient Nineveh
which Layard did so much to discover and Ferguson to restore. There
 also was the exquisite Alhambra Court, which, as it said itself in one
of its inscriptions, taught all men who would gaze carefully at it
what were the deep and hidden and mysterious principles of beauty,
and how that beauty could be created with certainty, and worked out
as if with magical art, but after all with that true science which was
the most wonderful of all art ;—that court which taught the principles
by which not only could Alhambras be made beautiful, but by which all
other works of art could be made beautiful to the eye, comely to look
at, ravishing to the senses. That court was the realization of the ideal
dreams of Mr. Owen Jones, whose <U+FB01>rst love was the Alhambra, who
had left his own country and exiled himself there to worship it, who
brought home, models and drawings of it, but was unable to display its
beauties to the British public till the Crystal Palace afforded him the
opportunity of reproducing it. He (Mr. Scott Russell) remembered
how Mr. Owen Jones revelled in the thought of doing so, when the
proposition was laid before him.              Then there was the beautiful
Byzantine court of Mr. Digby Wyatt, who at this point stood between
the architecture of the ancients and that of the modems, and repre
sented that extraordinary jumble of the oriental, the antique, and the
renaissance (in the proper, not the architectural sense), between the
old world and the new, to show what a remarkable combination could
be formed

admirable works of art should in one brief afternoon vanish from.
their vision was indeed a sad calamity, for the sake of their pro
ducers, and for the public.*
    * It has been said that these courts ought not to be reconstructed, as the state
of knowledge and views on which they were originally made, have materially
changed; but after consulting the authors, I <U+FB01>nd that no ground exists for such

22                           Mr. Scott Russell                           [Feb. 1,
    At two o'clock on the last Sunday of 1866 there was no fire. At
five, or ten, or twenty minutes past two (overwhelming evidence was
to be had to each of these as the precise time of its commencement)
—there was fire in the Crystal Palace. Where did it come from?
Ten minutes after two one of the firemen saw a singular column of
what he called fire, in the building. It was in fact gas, and consisted
of the products of combustible materials, heated into a gaseous state.
He immediately applied water by a hose, both to this and the opposite
side of the transept, but in vain. A cloud of smoke and a volume of
flame rose to and spread under the floor of the gallery, which was
immediately in flames, around both the end and side of the Tropical
Department. In the transept there stood the Mammoth tree, the
Wellingtonia Gigantea, 20 feet in diameter and 100 feet high, consist
ing not of wood, but of dry bark, ready to light a fire. The moment
the gases spread from the wooden floor of the palace to the Mammoth
tree, that became a huge chimney, an immense tunnel full of inflamed
gas. On reaching the building, at twenty minutes to three, he (Mr.
Scott Russell) found the whole of this transept in flames; and within
ten minutes he saw that all chance of saving it was gone. He had
been burnt out three times. He had never yet got the money he had
insured for, and the Crystal Palace was unfortunately in the same pre
dicament; for under what was termed the “average clause,” in the
policy, although insured for 80,000l., the company would probably
only recover one fourth or one fifth of that amount.” This clause was
considered fair by the Insurance Companies, and therefore there must
be some justice in it; but for his own part he could not see it.
Seeing the transept lost, he, together with many brave and zealous
volunteers, set himself to work to draw a line, across which the
flames should not pass; and, by applying water freely to the part
beyond this mathematical line, the flames were stopped. This was
indeed the whole theory of stopping a fire. It was useless to waste
water on anything which fire had obtained firm possession of As to
the commencement of the fire, the probability was that a boiler in the
basement became overheated; it had not, he understood, blown up,
but he believed that, it being Sunday, the stoker wanted to go to
church, and put as much coal on the furnace fire as he thought would
keep the boiler hot till he returned; but in doing so he converted a
moderate fire into a splendid gas manufactory.
     This gas escaped, and, undoubtedly, ascended in formidable quan
tities to the building, and became ignited, being indeed in an excellent
condition for combustion. This was the origin of the fire, and it was
a thing to be guarded against in future. As soon as the combustible
matter piled together in this portion of the building was consumed,
the fire died out; and, although it was quite possible for the palace
to have been altogether destroyed if there had been less help from the
    *I am happy to acknowledge that, since the date of this discourse, 38,500l. has
 been paid by the Insurance Companies to the Crystal Palace Company.

 1867.]                 on the Crystal Palace Fire.                   23
 parish engines and those of the Fire Brigade, he was convinced that
 with certain precautions the Crystal Palace, qud the building itself,
might be regarded as <U+FB01>reproof; but not if <U+FB01>lled with highly com
bustible matter.                                         '
     Mr.‘ Scott Russell then proceeded to consider the question of
reconstruction.
     In 1851 the building in Hyde Park was about to be swept off the
 surface of the earth. At that crisis there came to its aid some of the
 old and tried friends of the Exhibition of All Nations. Amongst
 them was a gentleman whose efforts were at the present time being
 energetically used to restore, if possible, the Crystal Palace to its
 original beauty and its original usefulness. Mr. Francis Fuller was
 one of the three original promoters of the original Crystal Palace
 the Exhibition of 1851-one of those three who, under its great
founder, the late Prince Consort, <U+FB01>rst conceived the idea that it would
 be possible to erect the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park; and indeed it
 was by his enthusiastic exertions that the necessary funds were origi
nally obtained to start the project, and bring the <U+FB01>rst Crystal Palace
into existence. The merit of the <U+FB01>rst institution of Exhibitions of All
 Nations was due to His Royal Highness Prince Albert, and although
princes were often deprived of the credit due to them by the claims
 set up by others, he (Mr. Scott Russell), who knew all the factsgwas in
 possession of time, date, and circumstance, in the Prince Consort’s own
 handwriting, to prove that to him alone was due the enunciation of this
 great idea. Under him Mr. Fuller was one of the <U+FB01>rst who founded
 and made possible the Crystal Palace. To Mr. Fuller also the public
 were mainly indebted for its reconstruction on Sydenham hill.       The
<U+FB01>rst idea of purchasing the building in Hyde Park, and re-erecting it
at Sydenham, originated between Mr. Leech and his partner, the late
 Mr. Farquhar, of the <U+FB01>rm of Johnston, Farquhar, and Leech. Next to
 them it was imparted to Mr. Fuller, and next to himself; and they,
with one or two other gentlemen, purchased the building accordingly.
At Sydenham the arched roof throughout the length of the palace
 was introduced. Many other improvements were made upon the
original design, and the whole presented a great combination of the
united talents of Sir Joseph Paxton, Sir Charles Barry, Sir Charles
Fox, Mr. Henderson, Mr. Owen Jones, and Mr. Digby Wyatt. Surely
such a building ought not to be allowed to go down. If the company
were not rich enough to do it,-—if the Insurance companies would not
pay the full insurance, the public ought somehow to help them. In
other countries, a great educational institution like this would be
helped by the government.      In England, in such a matter as this, the
people were the government.        Let them therefore help both the
directors and themselves to restore and maintain so grand a temple of
art, education, and re<U+FB01>nement : for to do so was a matter affecting the
national reputation. “ If,” said the speaker, “ you will do what I
have done to-night,—say how fond you are of the Crystal Palace;
tell everybody how much good you think of it; explain to them what

WHEN I had the honour of being invited to deliver a discourse before
the Royal Institution, my subject was at the same time assigned to
me. Yet even if this had not been the case, it would perhaps have
been unnecessary to apologise for speaking to you on a. topic of great
importance, of which I know so much from personal experience. Al
though, therefore, my discourse must be of an interest immeasurably
inferior to those fairy tales of science, illustrated by delicate and
wonderful experiments, to which you are accustomed in this place, it

facts which have not been derived from <U+FB01>rst-hand observation.
     Thirteen full years of labour spent in the heart of Public Schools,
and devoted, to the utmost of my poor ability, to their service, are the
credentials which I oifer to save me from the charge of presumption if
I deal with their shortcomings. My position di<U+FB02>'ers widely—nay,
absolutely-from that of a rude, uncompromising, and unsympathetic
assailant. The fact that I have myself toiled for years at a task
which, in many instances, has <U+FB01>lled me with the misgiving that it
would be as barren of all obvious results as if I had ploughed the
sand of the sea-shore and sown salt in its furrows, will show, I trust,
that I am no arrogant critic with an eye blind to every merit, but
keen as that of an eagle to every fault. Honouring the body of
public schoolmasters with a sincere honour,—believing that, though
their usefulness is often impaired by the trammels of an unpro<U+FB01>table
routine, there may be found among them men of conscience ‘the most
enlightened, of intellect at once solid and brilliant, of indomitable
energy and noble purpose,—-I can hardly be suspected of desiring
to cast a slur on a profession, to which, however lightly it may be
 estimated by the outer world, it is my pride and pleasure to belong.
 If, then, a hand so feeble as mine can in<U+FB02>ict the slightest wound on
 our present system, I ask to be believed when I say that it is the
 faithful wound of a friend, and that my spear, like the spear of
 Achilles, is meant to heal as well as smite. If I criticize Public
 Schools fearlessly, it is because I love them deeply, and because I
 would not willingly see them fall into that gradual neglect and dis
 esteem, which must be the consequence of a refusal on their part to
 progress with a progressive age, and to widen the narrow horizon of
 their studies with the widening of an epoch, whose researches have
 thrown light on every region of nature, from its minutest organism to
 its most distant nebulae and stars.
      Not, then, from any wish to conciliate favour for my future
 remarks, still less because I shrink from the full brunt of any anger
 they may bring upon me, let me say as the hearty tribute of my
 genuine admiration, that judged by the nobility and serviceableness
 of the manhood they have trained, the Public Schools have no cause
 to blush; and that though they may have fallen far short of that
 splendid ideal which is entertained for them in the aspirations of
 those who love them best, they may yet put forth an irrefragable claim
 to the respect and honour of their hitterest enemies :—
            “ Great men have been among them,—hands that penned,
              And tongues that uttered wisdom."
 And although they have no right to claim the entire credit of such
 names, because the greatest men are often the accidents rather than
 the results of a system, and they have often been great in spite of it
 rather than because of it, yet, when a school (like that which I have at
 this moment the honour to serve) may boast to have produced in one

half-century among its <U+FB01>ve Prime Ministers, a Palmerston, a Peel, a
Spencer Percival, and an Aberdeen; and among its statesmen, a Dal
housie and a Sidney Herbert; and among its soldiers and sailors, a
Rodney and a Codrington ; and among its poets, a Byron and a
Proctor; and among its scholars, a Parr and a Sir William Jones;
and among its divines, a Trench and a Manning; and among its
common crowd of unknown alumni, so vast a multitude of honourable
and useful men ;—-such a school (and it is but an illustrious type of
many more) has no cause to fear that a system which, in other days,
has borne “such fruit in all its branches,” will be hastily or indis
criminately condemned.
    1. To proceed, then, to my review of our present system in its
workings and results, I would state my belief that the social education
offered by our schools is one of immense value. I am not now
alluding to the despicable advantage of making fashionable acquaint
ances, but to something much deeper and more indisputable. It is, I
think, a distinct bene<U+FB01>t to the growth and development of English
society, that boys of families and of professions the most widely
diverse, should be thrown together at our Public Schools. It is a
bene<U+FB01>t, I think, to the harmony and to the breadth of our statesman
ship, that the poor curate working obscurely in his remote country
parish, and the brilliant journalist who wields the force of public
opinion, and the college don in his quiet quadrangle, and the
Manchester man building up his vast fortune in the counting-house,
and the eloquent Radical member for some city or borough, and the
silent millionaire nobleman who <U+FB02>ings the whole weight of his in
<U+FB02>uence on the side of Conservatism, should still have this friendly
bond of sympathy between them, that at school they each found their
own level or realized their own worth, and that one was the other’s
fag, and that they joined in shouting for the victory of their common
house in the green and sunny cricket-<U+FB01>eld, and passed under the
in<U+FB02>uence of the same associations and interests, and that, however
widely they may now be separated, they loved and esteemed each
other in those days as equals and friends. In broadening the views,
in knitting together the sympathies of brother Englishmen, even amid
such din of controversies and strife of parties as may be raging at this
moment, or will soon be raging, within the walls of St. Stephen’s, such
ameliorating in<U+FB02>uences are not, I think, to be despised.
    2. And, again, as far as regards moral education, I give my most
sincere and honest opinion when I say we have good reason to be
thankful. Be it remembered that we have to deal with a dif<U+FB01>cult and
impetuous period of life ; with that perilous age—
                       “ When young Dionysus seems
                  All joyous as he burst upon the East
                  A jocund and a welcome conqueror;
                  And Aphrodite sweet as from the sea
                  She rose, and <U+FB02>oated in her pearly shell
                  A laughing girl.”

1867.]         on some Defects in Public School Education.           29
     Let any one consider how di<U+FB01>icult must be the task of governing
that wilful age, and then let him visit some great school, and note the
admirable discipline, the cordial relations between master and scholar,
the manly bearing, free at once from presumptuous forwardness and
servile timidity; and then, further, the reverent attention to the
religious services, and the number of hushed and youthful partakers
of the Lord’s Supper,——and few, I think, will refuse to admit that, by
God's blessing, we have in large measure ennobled and puri<U+FB01>ed the
once unhealthy moral atmosphere of our Public Schools. Some,
indeed, there are, and will ever be, who, in spite of the many kindly
and solemn warnings they receive, learn there but few lessons save
those of sin and sorrow; but the majority, by their high tone of
honour and principle, and by that deeply encouraging growth of
Christian character which marks their progress from form to form,
show that the most high-spirited boys may be guided by a thread,
when they are guided by gentlemen and by Christians, as well as
by scholars, and when the sincere and simple spirit of religion is
made to bear—not in the shape of dead dogmas, but in the shape
of living principles-upon the whole tenour of their lives.
    3. Nor——once more-if we turn to the physical training of our boys,
shall we <U+FB01>nd any errors-at any rate on the side of omission. If the
end and aim of physical training be health, vigour, and activity, few
will think it neglected when they see the healthy colour, and high
spirits, and well-knit frames, which among our Public School boys are
not the exception, but the rule. The only question could be whether
in this direction we have not gone too far. I would leave ample margin
for our hours of play; I look with the heartiest sympathy on the
<U+FB02>ourishing of our manly sports; I know the value and beauty of a
keen glance, a strong arm, and swift feet, and I rejoice to see the
racquet-court, the cricket-<U+FB01>eld, and the ri<U+FB02>e range thronged with
emulous competitors; but I must not hesitate to say, that in some
instances we have pushed our admiration for these things to extravagant
and disastrous lengths. When we commonly see boys ready to sacri<U+FB01>ce
everything to cricket ; when we see them devoting to it a number of
hours and an amount of enthusiasm, out of all proportion to that
expended on their work; when we <U+FB01>nd their thoughts so thoroughly
coloured and moulded by it that they talk cricket, think cricket, and
dream cricket, morning, noon, and night; it is hardly surprising to
<U+FB01>nd many who complain that this mania of muscularity has its share
in the hunger-bitten poverty of our intellectual results, and tends to
account for the fact that the value of the work we get out of the mass
of boys is, as Mr. Gladstone puts it, “ scandalously small.” Let us
by all means make our boys good animals if we can; let us train them
to patient endurance and hardy strength ; let us teach them (if we can
teach them) to scorn the ever-growing tendency to luxury and extrava
gance ; but let us at the same time impress on them, that to be good
animals is a contemptible result if it does not conduce to their being
better, more thoughtful, and nobler men. It is hardly satisfactory that

30                         Rev. F. W. Farrm'                     [Feb. 8,
the child of nineteen Christian centuries, “the heir of all the ages in
the foremost <U+FB01>les of time,” should spend all his energies, and all his
admiration on the attainment of those corporeal attributes in which, let
him do his best, the brute and the savage will beat him still.
    4. I now turn to that part of my task which is at once the most
difficult and the most immediately important—-I mean the Intellectual
Education of our Public Schools. And here I shall doubtless out
against the grain of a hundred prejudices, and draw upon my head a
storm of opposition. Be it so, if I thereby hasten the victorious
purpose which so many have at heart. About my own insigni<U+FB01>cance
the storm may roar as loudly as it will, if thereby it “lash into motion
those lazy clouds” that have stagnated so long on our educational
horizon. Nor will I deprecate it further than by saying that no one
has a right to resent the straightforward avowal of a conviction derived
from long experience; and that, as I speak without arrogance and
without censoriousness, I claim the privilege, as indeed I have earned
the right, to speak also with perfect plainness.
     I must, then, avow my own deliberate opinion,—arrived at in the
teeth of the strongest possible bias and prejudice in the opposite
direotion,——arrived at with the fullest possible knowledge of every
single argument which may be urged on the other side,—I must avow
my distinct conviction that our present system of exclusively classical
education as a whole, and carried out as we do carry it out, is a
deplorable failure. I say it, knowing that the words are strong words,
but not without having considered them well; and I, say it, because
that system has been “ weighed in the balances and found wanting.”
It is no epigram, but a simple fact to say, that Classical Education
neglects all the powers of some minds, and some of the powers of all
minds. In the case of the few it has a value, which being partial, is
unsatisfactory; in the case of the vast multitude, it ends in utter and
irremediable Waste. On the theory of the convertibility of force,
something, I suppose, must come of the energies expended on our
ordinary teaching ; but at present a large portion of them seems to me
as entirely wasted, as the sunbeams which waste their vivifying in<U+FB02>u
ence in scorching the desert sands. “ We pour this kind of knowledge,”
says Mr. Ruskin, “ on one and all alike, like snow upon the Alps, and
are proud if here and there a river descends from their crests into the
valleys, forgetting that we have made the loaded hills themselves
barren for ever.”
     The proofs of the fact are now but too patent in the faithful report
of eminent and most friendly commissioners ; for after diligent,
anxious, and repeated study of the four thick blue volumes in which
their laborious investigations lie buried from the public ken, I can
draw from them no other conclusion than that which may be summed
up in these few words : That but a small proportion of our boys, say
twenty-<U+FB01>ve per cent., go to the Universities ; that yet the entire
curriculum of our Public Schools is framed with a view to the Uni
versities ; and that even of this poor twenty-<U+FB01>ve per cent., who are as

 1867.]          on some Defects in Public School Education.            31
 it were the very <U+FB02>ower and fruit of the system, and if I may so phrase
 it, its raison d’e‘tre, a considerable number (many would be inclined to
 say the larger number) leave school at the age of eighteen or nineteen,
 not only ignorant of history, both ancient and modern, ignorant of
 geography and chronology, ignorant of every single modern language,
 ignorant of their own language and often of its mere spelling, ignorant
 of every single science, ignorant of the merest elements of geometry
 and mathematics, ignorant of music, ignorant of drawing, profoundly
 ignorant of that Greek and Latin to which the long ineffectual years of
 their aimless teaching have been professedly devoted ; and we may add,
 besides all this, and perhaps worst of all, completely ignorant of—
 altogether content with—their own astonishing and consummate
 ignorance. Or, in other words—for here I am but translating into a
 little plainer language the courteous euphemisms of the commissioners
 —We have this fact :—During ten or twelve, or even more, of the best,
 the most vigorous, the most plastic, and the brightest years of life, a
multitude of boys have been mainly, at some schools almost exclusively,
 occupied with Greek and Latin, who yet at the end of those years not
 only know nothing else, and not only are wholly careless to learn
 anything else, but have pro<U+FB01>ted so little even in their Greek and Latin
 that they can neither write a single correct sentence in either language,
nor stumble correctly through a single page of their simplest authors
without special previous preparation. On such a topic it would be
useless to amplify; there, whether we like it or not, is the plain, naked,
unvarnished fact. If it startle us, I can only say it ought to startle us ;
if it is painful, I say that it ought to be painful to any mind on which
 custom is not lying with a weight “heavy as frost, and deep almost as
death.” If any one be prepared to question it, the Commissioners will
 supply him with ample proofs in both hands; and any public school
 master could quadruple those proofs, if his eyes are open, out of the
 experiences of a single year. The Commissioners quote tutor after
 tutor of the Oxford Colleges, and tutor after tutor of the Cambridge
Colleges, who come forward with dreary iteration to say that the men
are mostly men of excellent principles and manners, but to numbers of
 whom they freely apply the epithets “indolent,” “ unawakened,”
“inaccurate,” “men of idle habits, and empty uncultivated minds.”
And this, be it remembered, is the verdict on boys who go to the
University, the only body of whom the Commissioners had even an
opportunity of forming a judgment ; and it suggests these two
re<U+FB02>ections :—-—If these be the results in the case of boys for whom
the system was specially framed, what are we to think of the rest?
And if these boys know nothing of Greek and Latin in which for years
they have been assiduously taught, how unfathomable may be their
ignorance in subjects which they have never been taught at all, or (as
is the case with many noble branches of knowledge) taught by an
ignorant tradition to neglect and to despise ?                     ‘
     Facts like these may have been unknown to all but professional
teachers at schools and universities until the Commission revealed

32                          Rev. F. W. Farrar                     [Feb 8,
them, and until the whole press of the United Kingdom, whether
friendly or unfriendly, whether religious, political, educational, or
scienti<U+FB01>c, had with appalling unanimity summed up the general result
of the Report of the Commissioners in the one ugly word, FAILURE.
There was no escape from the plain conclusion ; yet the apathy with
which it was accepted strikes one with amazement. We know what
the years of boyhood are—how keen, how inquiring, how full of life :
we know what education can do; how it can stimulate exertion and
store up knowledge, and give extraordinary energy to every faculty
and every sense. Is it then a matter of no consequence that the in
tellectual powers of so many <U+FB01>ne and noble English boys should be
suffered to run to seed? Is it the will of England that her sons
should grow up good oars, and good cricketers, and profoundly
ignorant men? While science commands its thousands of eager,
devoted, enthusiastic workers, will England remain content that the
main e<U+FB02>'ort of her education should end so often in an atrophy of
intelligence and knowledge ? Is education a mere tri<U+FB02>ing experiment
 made in corpora vili? Is the mighty development, the magni<U+FB01>cent
heritage of this and many centuries to be left with an in<U+FB02>uence either
 ml or insigni<U+FB01>cant in the teaching of our boys? If people believe
 in a classical education, do they believe in one which may be nominally
 classical, but which ends with such extreme frequency in a gigantic
 negation? Will they listen to idle and <U+FB02>ourishing rhetoric about
 the graceful and godlike literature of Greece and Rome, and then
 deceive themselves with the illusion that this is the reward of lads who,
 after an inde<U+FB01>nite term of years, could not speak two Latin sentences,
 or construe Xenophon without a crib? Are we, in the nineteenth
 century, to learn no more and to teach no more—nay, to attempt and
 to achieve actually less-——than was learnt by young Romans in the
 school of Quintilian, or at best by Gregory and Basil in the retirement
 of Athens? The young Greek learnt something of geometry; the
 young Roman something of law; even the young monk of the Middle
 Ages learnt in his meagre quadrivium some scraps of such science as
 was then to be had. Are we alone to follow the example of the
 Chinese in a changeless imitation of our ancestors, and to con<U+FB01>ne our
 eager boys for ever between the blank walls of an ancient cemetery,
 which contains only the sepulchres of two dead tongues?
     Such questions crowd indignantly upon the mind; and that they‘
 should admit of no answer is a subject of simple astonishment. If
 English people do not really care about the question—if they are
 indifferent to knowledge, scorn ideas, and despise Geist as a continental
 importation-—then there is an end of the matter ; but if, undeceived at
 length, they begin to realize that a solely classical education even for
 the few who succeed in it is not the best, while for the multitude who
fail, it ends in no Latin, no Greek, and nothing else : then it is full
 time for their voice to be heard. The mighty stream of public
 opinion must be brought to bear upon universities and schools, and if
they cannot be aided from within they must be coerced from without,

to modify a curriculum which has long been too narrow and antiquated,
and is now demonstrably unsuccessful. In a scienti<U+FB01>c age their studies
ought not to be solely literary : in a progressive, practical, and earnest
age they must not he suffered to remain stationary, fantastic, and pre
eminently pagan.
    That Greek and Latin—-taught in a shorter period, and in a more
comprehensive manner-should remain as the solid basis of a liberal
education, we are all (or nearly all) agreed: none can hold such an
opinion more strongly than myself: but why can it not be frankly
recognized that an education con<U+FB01>ned to Greek and Latin is a failure,
because it is an anachronism? It has outlived its time. It is utterly
out of harmony with the spirit of the age. It may have been all very
well three centuries ago, but is it to remain unaltered after three
centuries, which in the history of the human race have the importance
of thirty? * This is an age of progress, and we keep spinning round
and round on the same pivot; an age of observation and experiment,
and we keep bowing and scraping to mere authority; an age, as Pro
fessor Huxley has said, “ full of modern artillery, and we turn out our
boys to do battle in it, equipped with the sword and shield of an .
ancient gladiator.” Its continuance is due, not to its importance, but
mainly, as the Commissioners admit, to custom and prescription;
and now the new wine is bursting the old bottles. The days when
men were grateful to a literature which had unshackled them from the
fetters of scholasticism——that heroic age of classical studies when
in spite of bad food, bad lodging, straw beds, and eternal horrible
<U+FB02>oggings, youths came on foot vast distances to crowd the school of
a Tempéte~the days when such men as Erasmus and Stondonck,
after toiling out the daylight, mounted a clock-tower to study still by
the gratuitous moonbeams-the days when Ronsard and Baif occupied
one bedroom, and rose, one after the other, in turns, long after mid
night, to go shares in their single candle and keep the same spot
 warm; those days have gone by for ever, and we can neither repro
duce their acquisitions, nor galvanize them into life. People see
now, as Montaigne’s father saw more than three hundred years ago,
that a scholar may cost much too dear ; and they are beginning to see
that to produce your scholar here and there, you are apt to sacri<U+FB01>ce
multitudes of minds no less gifted, it may be far more gifted, than his.
The complaint is no new one. “ It is deplorable,” says the poet
Cowley, himself a brilliant scholar, “to consider the loss which
children make at most schools, employing, or rather casting away,
six or seven years in the learning of words only, and that very im
perfectly.” “ We do amiss,” says John Milton~a man whose opinion
is of in<U+FB01>nite importance, not only for his immense learning and
splendid imagination, but also because he stands out of nineteen
Christian centuries as one of the grandest ideals of a noble and cull

in scraping together so much miserable Greek and Latin, as might
be learnt otherwise easily and delightfully in one year.” “Would
not a Chinese who took notice of our way of breeding,” says John
Locke, “be apt to imagine that all our young gentlemen were de
signed to be teachers and professors of the dead languages of foreign
countries, and not to be men of business in their own ‘2 ” After three
such testimonies I need hardly add more; but I could easily produce
a catena of overwhelming testimony in the same direction of our best
and greatest men; from these down to‘ Whowell and Macaulay, and
that great, good Prince, who has many a time sat in that chair, and
whose wisdom and foresight we only then began to acknowledge,
when he was far beyond the reach of our ungrudging censure and our
niggardly applause. And that voice would be swelled not only by
the all but unanimous testimony of our greatest men of science—the
Herschels, the Tyndalls, the Huxleys, the Faradays-but also by a
vast crowd of our living statesmen, orators, philosophers, and poets;
 nay more, from both our Universities, by some of the very best and
 profoundest scholars of the present day. It should be a signi<U+FB01>cant
 sign to our educational conservatives that within this very year two
 such statesmen and thinkers as Mr. Lowe and Mr. Mill—thc one
 eminent as a scholar, the other as a philosopher-should both have
 spoken of the main staple of our Public School education with scath
 ing and undisguised contempt. Impenetrable as the deaf and sluggish
 majesty of prescription, and serene as the dull self-complacency of
 routine may be, it is impossible not to hope that, assaulted by such
 batteries as these, routine and prescription are beginning to totter to
 their fall.
      I have less, however, to do with any general cause for the failure
 of our system, than with two special ones of which I wish particularly
 to speak.     I mean, <U+FB01>rst, the fact that some of our existing methods
 are so disagreeable and illogical as to clog all progress, even in our
 narrow path, with difficulties all but insuperable, even when we have
 absorbed an inordinate length of time; and secondly, that we have
 hitherto coldly refused, or but partially admitted, an alliance with
 those fruitful scienti<U+FB01>c studies, which can put forth a claim to
 reverence far prouder than our own, and which would have given our
  own studies material assistance by the very act of making room for
 more.       ,
      First, then, I believe that one of the reasons why classical studies
  lie across the path of education, unprogressive themselves and a
  hindrance to all other progress, is the present superstitious devotion
  to Greek and Latin composition, and the present irrational mode of
  studying grammar. It is in this direction that our reform must be
  most radical and most imperative.
       That nebulous halo of admiration which for many years has so
  densely enshrouded Greek and Latin composition, and which has given
  to their proportions as seen through the mist a sort of inde<U+FB01>nite and

1867.]           on some Defects in Public School Education.              35
colossal grandeur, was perhaps the cause why the Royal Commissioners
expressed no word of reprobation against the pursuit, and neither
sought nor elicited any evidence condemnatory of their practice. To
myself, trained in the system for years, and training others in it for
years—being one of those who succeeded in it, if that amount of
progress which has been thought worthy of high classical honours in
two Universities may be called success—in<U+FB01>uenced therefore by every
conceivable prejudice of authority, experience, and personal vanity in
its favour-I can only give my emphatic conclusion that every year
the practice of it appears to me increasingly deplorable, and the
theory of it every year increasingly absurd. Any facility which I
may myself have attained in it I hold exceedingly cheap; I should
estimate its value as simply nought in any inventory of my intellec
tual possessions. The utterly extravagant value attached to Greek
and Latin verse, and the utterly untenable arguments urged in its
favour, are irritating enough; but with me all minor irritation is
lost in deep pain and regret, when year after year I see boys of
eighteen and nineteen who have been working for ten years or more
at Latin verses under conscientious and able teachers, and who at the
 end of that time are unable to produce one single line that is not
 <U+FB02>agrantly'incorreet and intolerably odious to every reasonable mind.
Almost daily it is my fortune to see poor boys ploughing barren poetic
<U+FB01>elds in the shape of verse-books with a grammar and dictionary
“unequally yoked together like ox and ass.” This is the kind of
thing they have to turn into Latin elegaies-—for instance (to give only
a favourable specimen), this lucid address to the sun :—
            “ Thou, midmost of our world, I narrate wonders,
             Bulest stars, lest they should wander, laws being broken.”
Or this :—
            “ The <U+FB01>ery steed, his tail in air proudly cocked,
               Not without much neighing, traverses glad pastures.”
This is the sort of “ kelp and brickdust ” used to polish the cogs of
their mental machinery ! And when for a good decade of human life,
and those its most invaluable years, a boy has stumbled on this
dreadful mill-round without progressing a single step, and is plucked
at his matriculation forLatin prose, we <U+FB02>atter ourselves, forsooth,
that we have been giving him the best means for learning Latin
quantities, for improving taste (or what passes for such!) and—
credite posterz' !—for acquiring the m'ceties of Greek and Latin scholar
ship! We resent the nickname of the Chinese of Europe, yet our
education offers the closest possible analogue to that which reigns in
the Celestial empire, and for centuries we have continued, and are
continuing, a system to which (so far as I know) no other civilised
nation attaches any importance, yet which leaves us to borrow our
scholarship second-hand from them ; which is now necessary for the
very highest classical honours at the University of Cambridge alone ;
in which only one has a partial glimmering of success for hundreds

and hundreds who inevitably fail; and in which the few exceptional
successes are so <U+FB02>agrantly useless, that they can only be regarded at
the best as a somewhat trivial and fantastic accomplishment,—an
accomplishment so singularly barren of all results, that it has scarcely
produced a dozen original poems on' which the world sets the most
tri<U+FB02>ing value, or which (as I believe) even a Bavius or a Maevius
could have owned without a blush. While we waste years in thus
perniciously fostering idle verbal imitations, and in neglecting the
rich fruit of ancient learning for its bitter, useless, and unwholesome
husk—-while we thus dwarf many a vigorous intellect, and disgust
many a manly mind—while a great University, neglecting in great
measure the literature and the philosophy of two great nations,
contents itself with being, in the words of one of its greatest sons, “ a
Bestower of Rewards for Schoolboy Merit ”-—while thousands of
despairing boys thus waste their precious hours in “ contracting their
own views and deadening their own sensibilities ” by a failure in the
acquisition of the nseless—while we apply this inconceivably irra
tional process to Greek and Latin, and to no other language ever yet
taught under the sun—while we thus accumulate instruction without
education, and feel no shame or compunction if at the end of many
years we thrust our youth in all their unarmed ignorance through
the open gate of life-while, I say, such a system as this continues
and <U+FB02>ourishes, which most practical men have long scorned with an
immeasurable contempt, do not let us consider that we have advanced
a single step in reforming education, to reform which (in the words of

permitted I could corroborate them by multitudes of facts, maintain
them with most cogent arguments, and support them by the most
splendid authority,—if indeed authority be needed to prove that an
unique absurdity, condemned by its unique failure, is irrational and
wrong. Phillips compared it to going from point to point in curved
lines. It is a “preposterous exaction,” said Milton, the greatest of
all our Latin versi<U+FB01>ers, no less than one of our greatest men; “these
are not matters to be wrung from poor striplings, like blood from the
nose, or the plucking of untimely fruit.” “ See that your son be not
employed in making themes, neither verses of any kind,” says the
strong common-sense and manly wisdom of John Locke; “it is a
sort of Egyptian tyranny,” and “if he have no poetic taste ’tis the
most unreasonable thing in the world to torment him and waste his
time about that which can never succeed.” “ Versi<U+FB01>cation in a dead
language,” says another eminent scholar—Lord Macaulay-“is an
exotic, a far-fetched, costly, sickly exotic.    The soils on which the
rarity <U+FB02>ourishes are in general as ill suited to the production of native
poetry as the <U+FB02>ower-pots of a hothouse to the growth of oaks.” “ It
appears to me a cruel absurdity,” says Bishop Thirlwall, “to attempt
to forestall an imitative instinct . . . by forcing young boys
through the hardest drudgery and at a great expense of time, to wrap

the vacancy of thought in Ciceronian phrases, and to hammer nonsense
into Horatian metres.” “ To what purpose,” asks Mr. John Stuart
Mill, in his recent great address at St. Andrew’s,* which I should like
to see framed and glazed in every schoolmaster’s study, “should the
most precious years of early life be irreparably squandered in learning
to write bad Latin and Greek verses ? I do not see that we are much the
better even for those who end by writing good ones. Can our favourites
of fortune <U+FB01>nd no better or more serious employment than these nugw
di<U+FB02>icz'les ? Are we to pay this extravagant price for acquiring the per
nicious faculty of stringing together borrowed phrases—a habit which
a teacher should consider it one of his <U+FB01>rst duties to repress ? ” For
myself, as one who has seen the thing in actual working, I will only
add, that if one could but show the world what the teaching of Latin
verse practically amounts to, and the kind of paltry poésie e'pithe’tique
in which at the best it practically ends,-—if the verses Written in any
one verse examination by any one school in any one day were but laid
before the world, with the ages of the boys appended, and the number
of hours which the boys have spent for years in thus not progressing
a step in this enervating drudgery, I<U+FB01>rmly believe that the system would
not last a week longer, because then Englishmen would see—as clearly
as I know, that an ever increasing number of scholars and of school
masters have long seen—that in sacri<U+FB01>cing so much time and so many
branches of study to the non-achievement of this puny accomplishment,
is to make our sons slave in the service of a huge gilt empty idol-it
is to worship a <U+FB02>y or a beetle, and daily to offer a hecatomb of costly
oxen in sacri<U+FB01>ce thereto.
      I pass from our empty infructuous years of Greek and Latin verse
making to another blot upon our system no less pernicious,—-I mean
the illogical and indefensible way in which we teach grammar. Here
too, I believe, we have another instance of—
                        “ Blind authority heating with his staff
                         The child that might have led him."
       Nothing can be more certain than that the comprehension of
 grammar comes after the mastery of language; that the science of
 grammar (for there is such a science, and a noble one it is) is at once
 abstruse and di<U+FB02>icult, and that its deeply-seated metaphysical prin
 ciples are best attained by an analysis of abundant linguistic facts
 already appreciated. Yet what do we do ? we try to build up a boy’s
 knowledge synthetically by plunging him at once into a bewilderin
 mass of intricate rules and anomalous exceptions; and instead 0
 making him understand those, we effectually prevent                 from ever
 learning them in any real sense by making him learn them by rote :T
 and then, as though it had been our express object to paralyse his own
 intellectual powers, we shroud these mysterious instructions in the

 very language which he is supposed not to understand! Well may
 Mr. Herbert Spencer speak of “that intensely stupid practice, the
  teaching of grammar to children.” “ Grammar,” says Horne Tookc
  (who surely, was a good judge, if any one was), “ is among the <U+FB01>rst
 things taught, and the latest understood.” Yet what happens? what
  is happening at this moment to your little sons? They are being
  “‘ dragged through grammar as through a cactus-bush,”—being taught
 it in a way which always reminds me of Judges viii. 16, where it
 says that Gideon “took thorns of the wilderness, and briers, and
 with these he taught the men of Succoth.” They have been sent to a
 preparatory school, where the two main implements of education put
 into their innocent and unsuspecting hands are a primer and a verse
 book. The verse-book is the kind of thing of which I have given
 you a specimen; the primer-—that utterly disastrous legacy of the
 commission which, in spite of the strenuous opposition of many of us,
 is now forced as a standard grammar upon nine great public, and
 countless private schools-is a delightful manual in which the little
 victim, not Without amazement, learns by heart in Latin a multitude
 of such lucid empiricisms as that “factitive verbs have two accusa
 tives, one of the object, the other of the oblique complement I”
       Here too, at the tender age of eight or nine his young imagination
 is terri<U+FB01>ed, often by ignorant men, with such incubi and succubi as
 “quid-quale verbs,” “gerundive attractions,” “suboblique clauses,”
 “spirants,” “receptive complements,” “relations circumstantive and
 prolative,” “ quasi-Passives,” “ semi-deponents,” and I know not what,
 —which are hard enough for grown men to understand, even if they do
 not despise this clatter of pedantic (because needless) polysyllables,
 but which to a child must be worse than “ Gorgons, and Hydras, and
 Chimera-s dire.” Imagine, ladies and gentlemen, that at this moment
 you yourselves were desirous to learn Arabic; imagine an Arabic
 grammar, with rules in Arabic, put into your hands; imagine these
 Arabic rules clothed in a scholastic terminology, and bristling with
 philosophical abstractions, interspersed here and there with the castanet
 music of an abhorrent doggrel; imagine that the Arabic verb, like the
 Greek verb, had twelve hundred synthetic forms, and that you had to
learn them every one by heart before proceeding a step ; imagine that
this amazing sum-total were forced on you in a solid and amorphous
form, perhaps by a wholly incompetent teacher who repressed all
questions at the point of the ferula; imagine this, and you have the
very photograph of what in very many cases is being done with your
little sons in Greek and Latin. Can “the theory of elementary
unintelligibility” go farther than this? Would it be possible to be
more ingenuously out of harmony with all that is natural ?_ After such
a grievous waste of time, are you astonished at failure‘? Are you
surprised if your son, thus suddenly introduced from the mid-sunlight
of his boyhood into these “ yawning caves where glaring monsters lie,”
and where, like the Indian hunter, he is forced into chronic indigestion

by feeding on dry Greek roots,—are you astonished if he revolts and
succumbs altogether ? Or, should he be courageous and lucky enough
to emerge undazed, retires for life into what Sidney Smith calls “ the
safe and elegant imbecility of classical learning,” with a con<U+FB01>rmed
habit for “ credulously swallowing millstones with passive obedience,”
~crammed with dead words, but unapt for living inquiry,——with plenty
of second-hand knowledge re<U+FB02>ected and refracted through the semi
opaque medium of books, but with a sight too bedimmed in this long
darkness to gaze on the sun-bright and unveiled ‘countenance of truth.
“There is no study,” says Professor Halford Vaughan, “that could
provev more successful in producing often thorough idleness and
vacancy of mind, parrot-like repetition and sing-song knowledge, to the
abeyance and destruction of the intellectual powers, as well as to the
loss and paralysis of the outward senses, than our traditional study and
idolatry of language.”
    But, if this be so with the successful, what are the results with
the unsuccessful? Ask our- modern writers of genius, and they will
point to the ambition, the dissipation, the restlessness of our wealthier
classes. Ask our parents, and they will sigh over the vacant hours
spent in lounging in the billiard-room and the stable-yard. Ask our
schoolmasters, and they will deplore the number of dunces and idlers
whom they produce. Ask our most zealous and earnest college tutors,
and they will tell of undergraduates who regard their royal and sacred
seats of learning as luxurious and fashionable clubs,——of torpid minds
that either do not care to read enough for the most elementary examina
tions, or only cram through them with in<U+FB01>nite di<U+FB01>iculty and disgust.
Contrast this languishing ine<U+FB01>’iciency of unprogressive studies with the
keen, passionate, eager, undaunted enthusiasm wherewith thousands of
minds, hitherto untrained, are <U+FB02>inging their whole energy into the
toils of science, and thereby adding year by year to the fair sum of
human knowledge; and then ask if the nature of our studies be not to
blame? “ I do not wonder,” says Tanaquil Faber, who, at least,
succeeded in making his own daughter, Madame Dacier, one of the
<U+FB01>rst scholars of her day, “that one-half of our boys who go to schools,
do become downright asses rather than learned men.” While, if you
turn once more to Milton’s opinion, you will <U+FB01>nd that he sets down
barren hearts-a tendency “ to live in ease and luxury,” and “ an am
bitious, mercenary, or ignorantly zealous divinity”-—-to the fact of boys
“misspending their prime youth at the schools and universities in
learning mere words,” and being “deluded with ragged notions and
babblements, while they expected worthy and delightful knowledge.”
    With facts like these before us, how long, I ask, are we to leave
our education “ sickening in this muddy pool of conformity and tradi
tion?” Are we to go on for ever conjugating and declining, and
gerund-grinding, and Latin-verse manufacturing, “while the great
world spins for ever down the ringing grooves of change? ” I speak,
be it observed, in the highest interest of Classics. I would not aban

don them as the basis of a liberal education ; I feel their abuse some
what bitterly, only because I know how great may be their proper use.
I am not one of that large and increasing multitude who say that
classical education is a barren tree, and that the axe must be laid mer
cilessly at its very root. I say, on the contrary, that it is a fair tree and
a strong, and that if we cut off its dead and unsightly branches, we
may still leave its stem in the tender grass of the <U+FB01>eld, and that men’s
hopes and fears may still
                                        “Take shelter in

                      And 0001 impleached twilights."
I know that the Classics introduce us into a region of virtues in which
our modern life is meanest and most meagre. I should hold it disastrous
to disintegrate ourselves altogether from the past, and to break the
chain of its noble associations. But this is the precise e<U+FB01>'ect which is
now being produced by the wretched baldness and poverty of our
system. The worst enemies of classical education are those who
would stereotype its present imbecility. I am no enemy, but a sincere
and humble supporter of classical education properly supplemented and
properly understood. That against which I have been pleading is not
knowledge of the classics, but ignorance of their entire spirit; not
classics, but the degradation of the classics; not the thoughts of the
ancients enshrined in their noblest literature, but a paltry stringing
together of the arti<U+FB01>cial phrases of their rhetoric; not a sound learn
ing, but a shallow simulacrum of superiority; not mental training, but
a mere knack acquired by desultory reading and incessant practice; a
peacock’s feather, which, though it has often been a proof of intellec
tual rank, yet often waves over very empty skulls-a trick so difficult
and so useless that it averts robust minds from all classical study, and
is capable (on the published confession of some of its best represen
tatives)‘ of coexisting with a profound ignorance on all subjects,
ancient as well as modern. These are not the results of classical
teaching in any high and noble sense; but of its fantastic abuse by
methods which our best and wisest men have combined in denouncing
as glaringly irrational and curiously bad.
     But further, and lastly, I would. ask, if this idol of the theatre is
still to be worshi ped, how long shall its service be so exclusive as now
it is? However high we are to place classics, are we still to act as
though they were the sole end and aim of education, and as though
men had neither the faculties nor the thirst for any other kind of
knowledge ‘2 Are we never to get rid of this bed of Procrustes, which
for some is inordinately long, for some intolerably short? I allude of
course to that second special cause for the failure of our system, in the

    short-sighted neglect which has suffered our boys to grow up in total
    ignorance of, sometimes in digraceful contempt for, every scienti<U+FB01>c

                              “ Mid the mighty march of mind,
         The steamship, and the railway, and the thoughts that shake mankind,”
 ‘ a boy has been su<U+FB01>'ered to know nothing of the world of wonder,
    of beauty, and of power, in which his lot is cast. What has science
    achieved within this century ? She has made the shattering force of
    the electric spark obediently speed her messages through the heart of
    iron mountains, and under the waves of raging seas ; she has kindled
    her silver beacons on the wave-tormented crags, as though to light up
   an avenue to her palace front ; she has enabled the sailor to steer in
   safety amid the breaker’s wintry surge, and the miner to work in safety
   amid the blasting <U+FB01>re-damp of the mine; she has drawn the forked
   lightning in harmless splendour out of the purple cloud ; she has
   discovered the precious anodyne which lulls the senses into calm and
   dreamless sleep, while the work of agony, agonising no longer, is
   wrought upon the human frame; with a scratch of her lancet she has
   stayed the loathsome ravages of disease ; she has forced upon reluctant
   sel<U+FB01>shness, and branded into the brain of invincible ignorance, those
   bene<U+FB01>cent laws which paralyse the fury of the pestilence, and restore
   health and buoyancy to the factory and the hut; all this and more,
   she is doing, and has done; and the history of her discoveries, and the
   knowledge of the methods she has used in all this majestic sorcery,
   would, I take it, be almost as useful, and would effect as much for the
   human race, as the most delicate appreciation of the particle 9/2, or
   even as an approximate knowledge of the uses of dv with the moods!
   Oh, if the world is to be transformed for our boys into the cave I have
   described, at least suffer them to look round upon it, and enter it torch
   in hand :
                     “ And bid with lifted torch its starry walls
                       Sparkle, as erst they sparkled to the glow
                       Of odorous lamp tended by saint and sage ! "
   It would give reality, it would give utility, it would give happiness to
   their education. It would give reality. Our present system does not
   represent the existing state of knowledge. It deals with names, not
   things ; with grammar, not facts ; with books, not phenomena. It
   learns, but does not acquire; it imitates, but does not observe.         With
   at Paradise open before us, it fumbles at the old and costly key of a
   second-hand knowledge. It acts as though God had turned His
   creatures into a world in which there was no such thing as education
   until Greece and Rome emerged. What wonder that our boys have
   ceased to feel all relation between these dead and barren vocables and
   their bright and living world ? We have not enlisted among them the
' services of what Dr. Brown calls “that resident teacher within the

skin,” who is for ever giving his lessons while we are giving ours.
Our boys are getting weary of Horace and Ovid :
                     " Earth outgrows the mythic fancies
                       Sung beside her in her youth;
                       And those debonnaiic romances

                       Look up, poets, to the sun ;—
                                Pan, Pan, is dead 1 ”
    Then it would give our education more usefulness. I use the word
in no vulgar or sordid sense. I do not only mean professionally—
though surely that is not wholly unimportant; nor do I mean by the
stimulus to great philanthropic discoveries, though that too ought not
to be despised; but I mean morally, and socially, and intellectually as
well. To speak of the bene<U+FB01>t of scienti<U+FB01>c knowledge to our physi
cians, our barristers, our engineers, our soldiers, our country gentle
men, would be waste of time, and owing to a deeply-seated stupidity I
have never been able to see anything specially glorious in inutility
per 86. But it is worth while to take the single instance of the use of
science to our clergy. Seeing that the Bible, in page after page, to
say nothing of whole books of it, is constantly occupied in directing
profound attention to the power of God as proved by the magni<U+FB01>cence
of His Creation,—seeing that the Saviour of the world points, as the
special proofs of God’s love, to His care for the mountain lily, and the
falling sparrow, and the raven’s callow brood,—is not our education,
and especially that of our clergy, distinctly lwellgious in neglecting
these things, and in elevating the poor words of man, as an instrument
of training, unmeasurably above the mighty works of God? And with
what results? It would be hardly possible to exaggerate their disas
trous importance. Not only do the clergy, who should be the leaders
of thought, lose the advantage of assisting in a thousand ways their
poorer parishioners, but they <U+FB01>nd themselves actually inferior in these
great <U+FB01>elds of knowledge to many clerks and artisans in their own
congregations, before whom they cannot venture to speak of them
without the danger of raising a contemptuous smile. This, however,
is the least part of the evil. Science has interpenetrated to a won
derful degree the thoughts, the speculations, nay, even the common
literature of the age, and yet the clergy are wholly out of sympathy
 with it; in many instances are suspicious of it ; in many more are its
bitter and ignorant opponents. Scarcely has there been an eminent
philosopher, from Roger Bacon down to Comte,~—scarcely an eminent
discoverer, from Galileo down to Darwin, who has not counted the
clergy among his most ruthless opponents. I challenge denial of the
fact. Against astronomy, against zoology, against chemistry, against
geology, against ethnology, against philology,-against well-nigh
every nascent science in its tm-n-has theological arrogance and self
styled orthodoxy marshalled their menacing array of misinterpreted or
inapplicable fragments of Holy Writ. Just as of old “fops refuted

Berkeley with a sneer,” so now some young ordained B.A. <U+FB01>nds it
easy to crush Darwin with a text.         Is it, I ask, uncommon to hear
some ignorant clergyman who has laboriously scraped into a poll
degree, lay down the law as though he held the keys of all knowledge

      students,     could

                                                                heroism  of
candour and research ? You may say that an opposition of this calibre
usually ends in some complacent avowal of the ardent friendship
between science and Qtheology, and in the acceptance as axiomatic
truisms of what had previously been denounced as atheistical and
absurd. But meanwhile, what happens? Men of science, confounding
religion with the anachronisms of its most feeble and most violent
expounders, too often hold aloof from a Church whose inmost heart is
 intensely truthful,-—a Church which well knows the delight that
deeply religious minds have ever felt in reverent inquiry into the laws
of God, and which sees more of her own real spirit in the patient
labours of science than in unprogressive idleness and theological
hate.
     The remedy is simple. Let the boys who are to become our
clergy be trained, if it be but in one single science ; let them see the
stern and simple accuracy of its methods; let them observe the single
ness of its eye for truth, and truth alone ;—lct them mark its inevit
able progress over triumphant errors ;—lct them be initiated in the
labour, the sincerity, the patience, the self-devotion, the precision of
thought which it requires,—and then we shall hear no more of the
preposterous falsehood that science is inimical to true religion, and
see no more of men who prefer anathema to inquiry,——who rather than
sit at God’s feet, and learn the great laws which He reveals to the
humble and to the patient, prefer to gyrate round and round in the
petty circle of one-thousandth-hand expositions, or, if I may borrow
an old simile, to make long voyages in the belly of Jonah’s whale,—
traversing immense distances but seeing nothing in the world It is
my solemn belief, and a belief that I am neither afraid nor ashamed
to avow, that the scepticism so often laid to the charge of science, is in
reality the necessary result of its neglect.
     In conclusion, I con<U+FB01>dently look to an education in science for a
considerable increase of youthful happiness. How do many boys
regard their school-hours ‘2 Chie<U+FB01>y as time spent in the close atmo
sphere of a dull room over verbal disquisitions for which they care
little, and verbal imitations for which they care still less. If you
would have them progress in such studies, and believe in them, you
must superadd another education, which by enlisting their sympathies,
shall awake their dormant faculties and save their decaying self
respeet. You must teach the boy who fails in classics that the autho
rity of long words in crabbed books is not the only source of know
ledge; that he can use his untrained senses as the gateways for a
thousand forms of instruction; that the theory which strove to make
teaching unpleasant was an odious and unnatural heresy ; and that his

44 Rev. F. W. Farrar on Defects in Public School Education.       [Feb. 8,
education, so far from ceasing, is but being continued (if he so wills it)
with greater intensity when with open eyes, and senses keenly observant,
he is living under the blue temple-roof of heaven,-storing his cabinet
with the gorgeous and delicate loveliness of shells and butterflies and
eggs,—or following the game on the mountain-side, ancle-deep in
purple heather, knee-deep in the tall green ferns. Teach him that in
every dewdrop brushed away by his careless feet there slumbers the
electric flame; teach him that there is no flower which he can pluck,
in the study of which he may not soon reach those “flammantia moenia
mundi” over which not even the eagle wing of science can soar;
teach him that there is not the simplest phenomenon of his daily life
which does not involve for its explanation the agency of the most mar
vellous and eternal laws. Show him too that, when once taught to
read and write, and think, and use his senses, he has been equipped in
all the panoply wherewith the giants of human intellect have made
the elements of the physical world their slaves; that with no more
potent instrument than his own kite he may take the lightning by the
wing; that in the falling of an apple, and the swinging of a lamp, and
the thoughts of an idle boy as he watched the steam condensing on
the bowl of his silver spoon and the twitching of a dead frog's leg
when it was touched by a scalpel as it lay upon a plate, lay hid the
secrets of the rolling of the planets, and the mode in which we mark
the flight of time, and the rushing of the railway engine, and the
means whereby with the simplest possible materials we can put a
girdle in a few seconds round the globe. Add this to your classical
system, and the frequency of dunces will cease to be a commonplace
of schoolmasters. I dare not indeed use the strong language of
Milton, when he says, “I doubt not that ye shall have more ado to
drive our dullest and laziest youth, our stocks and stubs, from the
infinite desire of such a happy nurture, than we have now to hale and
drag our hopefullest and choicest wits to that asinine feast of sow
thistles and brambles which is commonly set before them as the food
and entertainment of their tenderest and most docile age;”—but I do
say with him that the path of a virtuous and noble education is “so
smooth, so green, so full of goodly prospects and melodious sounds on
every side, that the harp of Orpheus was not more charming,”—I do
say that the kind of education which here I advocate will be fruitful
of the mightiest advantages both to England as a nation and to thou
sands of her individual sons,—and that it is
               “Not harsh and rugged, as dull fools suppose,
                 But musical as is Apollo's lute,
                 And a perpetual feast of nectared sweets,
                 Where no crude surfeit reigns.”

1867.]         Mr. C. F. Varley on the Atlantic Telegraph.            45
                 WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                      Friday, February 15, 1867.
    Sir HENRY Holland, Bart. M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. President,
                              in the Chair.
             CROMWELL F. WARLEY, Esq. M.I.C.E. M.R.I.
                       On the Atlantic Telegraph.
THE object the speaker had in view was to demonstrate (for the
first time in public) a few of the more subtle phenomena, which
present themselves when attempting to work long submarine cables,
and to show how the disturbances arising from earth currents are
sufficiently neutralized to prevent them from interfering with the
telegraphic signals.
     For this purpose he had two artificial telegraph cables, the one
representing the Atlantic Telegraph cable, the second one being made
40 times slower, so as to represent the phenomena which would
present themselves on a cable of the same dimensions per nautical mile
as the Atlantic Telegraph, but 13,000 miles in length, long enough to
reach from England to Australia.
     The former artificial cable consisted of 11 coils of fine German
silver wire, having together the same resistance as the actual Atlantic
cable. The phenomena of electro-static induction were given to this
conductor, by attaching at each of the junctions between the coils a
large condenser. (Wide Fig. 14, p. 49.)
     The second or slow artificial line consisted of 11 glass tubes; and
the apparatus was so constructed that by turning a handle the con
densers could be removed simultaneously from the resistance coils,
and reapplied as often as necessary. A galvanometer was inserted
between each of the tubes in the latter circuit.
     The glass tubes were filled with a solution consisting of 98 parts
pure water and 2 parts sulphate of zinc.
     The metal poles dipping into the solution were composed of zinc
amalgamated; amalgamated zinc electrodes in a solution of sulphate
zinc being almost entirely free from polarization.
     The reflecting galvanometers differed from those hitherto used in

46                           Mr. C. F. Varley                    [Feb. 15,
the following respects:—the mirrors consisted of lenses ground and
polished, instead of flat microscope glass, the tubes containing the
mirrors had glass ends and were filled with pure water, which cut off
the tremors of the room, and brought the instruments to rest in the
fraction of a second.
     Each mirror was half-an-inch in diameter, and with its magnet
weighed 2 grains, and was suspended by 3 cocoons of silk 'ath of an
inch in length.
     The time allowed for this discourse only permitted of a cursory
examination into two of the many interesting inquiries connected with
the Atlantic Telegraph.
     The speaker observed:—“The press had (imperfectly) familiarized
the public with the mechanical operations of manufacturing and laying
the cables, as well as with the means adopted for navigating the ship
across the ocean.
     “The method adopted for testing the integrity of the insulation
of the cable as well as of its conducting power were partly brought
under the notice of this Institution by Sir William Thomson not long
since.”
     Light and radiant heat travel through space with a definite velocity;
electricity does not. The waves of light do not flatten out or elongate
during their flight over millions and millions of miles. For example,
suppose the star Sirius were suddenly covered by a screen for ten
minutes and then uncovered again, the star would still appear on this
earth to shine continuously for about twenty years after the screen was
applied, when it would be suddenly extinguished for just ten minutes,
and then re-appear.
     Electricity in passing through a cable begins instantly to appear at
the distant end, but in strength far too weak to be measured, after
the lapse of a certain time definite for each particular cable, it begins
rapidly to augment in power and continues to approach to a definite
limit of strength.
     The reason for this will appear when the construction of the arti
ficial Atlantic cable is considered.
     Electricity is popularly supposed to have a definite velocity, like
light; this is not so. The question—what is the velocity of electricity?
cannot be answered unless other conditions are given; for instance,
it begins to arrive at the distant end instantaneously, but to reach its
maximum strength would, strictly speaking, require eternity and a
day; while to reach half its maximum strength would have occupied a
time of 6 a, this quantity a being a definite time dependent upon the
dimensions of the cable.              -
     Fig. 1, curve No. 1, represents the strength of the current at the
distant end of the cable, after the lapse of periods of time represented
by the figures under the diagram, the maximum strength which the
battery can produce through the cable being represented by 10.
    The figures on the horizontal line represent equal periods of time: a.

     The <U+FB01>gures on the vertical line represent the strength of the
current. On connecting one end of the cable to a battery whose other
 pole is to earth, no sensible current is visible until after the lapse of
 the period a, when the current has a strength of a little more than a
 thousandth part of that which the battery is capable of producing.
     When the cable is fully charged, the current attains its__ maximum
 strength, which is represented in the diagram by the line opposite the
 vertical <U+FB01>gure 10. After the lapse of 4 a, the strength of the current
 is about one-fourth of this maximum power. After the lapse of 6 a
 it has a strength equal to half the maximum, and for greater periods
 of time the strength of the current goes on augmenting if the battery
 be continually applied, as shown by curve No. 1. But although it
 approaches to, it never, in strict language, actually attains the abso
 lute maximum strength 10. For instance, after 20 a, the strength
 of the current is about 98 per cent. of the maximum.
      The curves 2 and 3 show the rise and fall of electric currents at the
 distant end after the cable has been connected to the battery for intervals
 of time corresponding to 12 a and 6 a; and after such contact with the
 battery, the cable has been connected to therearth again. This is about
 as quick as it is possible to signal through a submarine cable with the
 ordinary Morse instrument. No. 2 represents a “dash ;” No. 3, a dot.
      The little curve 3 represents a signal whose strength is only 1
  per cent. of the maximum strength. Such signals are only to be
  obtained either by the curb-key or the use of condensers at the end of
  the cable, as explained further on.
      It will be seen that considerable time must be allowed to elapse
  after the impulse has been given for a dot or dash before the cable
  has sufficiently discharged itself to permit of a second intelligible
  signal. It is evident from the above diagram that in order to get
  rapid signalling through an Atlantic or other long cable the apparatus
 must <U+FB01>rst of all be very sensitive, so as to give as early indication as
 possible of the arrival of the electric current, and the moment such
 indication begins to be produced the line must be discharged as
  quickly as possible, in order that a second signal may be made to
 follow quickly afterwards.

    On January 20, 1854, Dr. Faraday, in a discourse at the Royal
Institution,” described a number of experiments which he had made
with a hundred miles of gutta percha-covered wire, and also some
experiments upon 1500 miles of line between London and Manchester.
But on the table before the speaker was an artificial representation of
a cable 13,000 miles in length, by the aid of which the same pheno
mena amplified and many others were exhibited.
    A telegraph cable is a long Leyden jar, one end of which is
attached to the earth, whilst the other is attached to a source of elec
tricity each time a signal is to be produced. If the cable be con
nected to a battery for a long time, the strength of the charge in the
different parts of the cable will be shown by the diagonal line, Fig. 2,
being nothing at the end connected to the earth, and equal to the full
power of the battery at the other.

                 -                 the risk of a flaw or break in the
conductor, which would be fatal to the line; secondly, to reduce
the rigidity of the copper.

     When the cable is at rest, the two ends are connected to the earth;
 on depressing the telegraphic key, a battery is inserted between the
 earth and the cable, and a current immediately flows in at the sending
 end; the keys in the diagram are double ones; on depressing the right
 hand key, the positive or copper pole of the battery is connected with
 the cable, while the negative or zinc pole is left in connection with the
 earth; if the left-hand key be depressed, the right-hand key being up,
 the negative or zinc pole of the battery is connected with the cable,
 while the positive or copper pole remains connected to the earth. The
 second key shown in Fig. 14 was used as a switch to connect the
 cable at pleasure either to the battery key or to the Geissler's tube,
 to show the escape of the charge in the cable from both ends of the
 circuit.
     On depressing one of the keys, the battery is inserted between the
 earth and the cable; a current immediately flows; after passing
 through the first resistance it meets with the first condenser; here it
finds two channels, namely, the condenser and the other resistance
 coils, forming the remainder of the circuit.
     At the first moment of time the condenser being empty, it offers no
appreciable opposition to the electric current which commences
charging it, and therefore at the first instant of time nearly the whole
of the current is spent in charging the condenser. No sooner, however,
has the charging commenced than this charge begins to oppose the
further flow of electricity into it; a current then flows through the
second coil; its strength is dependent upon the potential for the time
being of the charge in the first condenser. Example: suppose the poten
tial of the battery to be 100 (and its resistance practically nil), let the
resistance of each coil be 1 at the first moment of time; as the first
condenser offers no sensible resistance, there will be a resistance of 1
only in circuit.    By Ohm's law the strength or volume of the current

                            I = R =+
Where I equals the volume of the current, E the potential of the
battery, R the resistance in circuit.
     After the lapse of a very short interval of time, the first condenser
will have become charged to a potential of Iloth part that of the
battery, viz. 1, at that moment of time, as there will be no sensible
charge in the second condenser; the strength of the current in the
second resistance coil will be rinth part the strength of the current
that flowed through the first coil at the first moment of contact with
the battery.
     Thus it will be seen that no appreciable current will be found in
any of the other resistance coils until an appreciable charge has reached
the condenser immediately preceding it.
     If ten galvanometers were inserted in a long cable at equal distances,
it would be seen that at the first moment of contact with the battery,
the current rushing into the cable is vastly greater than it is a few

moments afterwards : ‘this was illustrated by the speaker on the
large arti<U+FB01>cial cable represented in Fig. 13, p. 49. The ten galvano
meters were placed one above the other; they were carefully adjusted
so that the ten images which they re<U+FB02>ected from the electric lamp upon
a large white screen formed a vertical line when no current was passing
(ville Fig. 4, p. 52). The galvanometers were all of equal sensibility.
     To familiarize the audience with the relative positions of the
different galvanometers, the speaker considered the upper part of the
screen to be England, the lower part the Antipodes.
     The 1st station was named Gibraltar, the 2nd Malta, the 3rd Suez,
the 4th Aden, the 5th Bombay, the 6th Calcutta, the 7th Rangoon, the
8th Singapore, the 9th Java, the 10th Australia.
     No galvanometer was inserted at England, because the discharge
from the cable through it to the earth was so powerful that the
magnetism of the needle was reversed by it, and the indications
rendered alternately the opposite of the truth.
     The speaker <U+FB01>rst of all connected the condensers of the arti<U+FB01>cial
line all together, and charged them with a battery of 800 cells, Daniel’s
battery. On discharging them by means of a sheet of tinfoil, a loud
report, a brilliant <U+FB02>ash, and an irregular hole <U+FB01>ve-eighths of an inch
in diameter were the result. "
     The second experiment consisted of connecting the 800 cells with
the arti<U+FB01>cial Atlantic cable (Fig. 14, p. 49), the condensers being
removed from the resistance coils. The instrument used to show the
passage of the electric current was an exhausted glass tube (a Geissler’s
tube), whose resistance was such that it would just allow a current of 400
cells, Daniel’s battery, to pass from wire to wire. This tube formed a
ready method of showing when the charge at the Newfoundland end
reached half the potential of the battery. The condensers being
removed from the arti<U+FB01>cial line, the current appeared instantly at the
Newfoundland end, and disappeared instantly upon the connection
between the battery and the cable being broken at the English end.
When the condensers were applied, an interval of 3 or 4 seconds
elapsed before the current appeared ; and on breaking the connection
between the battery and the cable at the English end, the current
still continued to <U+FB02>ow out of the Newfoundland end for many seconds
afterwards.
     The experiment was varied by connecting the cable to the 800
cells, until, by the brilliancy of the Geissler’s tube at Newfoundland,
the cable was seen to be nearly fully charged; the battery connection
was then broken at the English end, and the cable connected to the
earth by a second Geissler’s tube, the latter shone with a more brilliant
light than that at Newfoundland, because the charge in the cable near
the battery was greater than at the distant end, thus forming a rough
but very pretty illustration of Figs. 1 and 2, pp. 47, 48. The tube at
the English end continued to shine for several seconds after the New
foundland end had gone out, because the charge at the end of the
cable near the battery was greater than at the other end.

upon the 10 galvanometers, each of which re<U+FB02>ected a little sun-like

     Later still the current* at Gibraltar decreased considerably in
 strength (Figs. 6, 7, and 8), owing to that end of the line becoming
 charged. Fig. 7 shows approximately the appearance presented after
 the cable had been connected to the battery 14 seconds; and Fig. 8
 shows the appearance after the lapse of nearly a minute, when a
 powerful current was rushing out at the Australian end. The
 English end was then removed from the battery and connected
 with the earth; and quickly after the Gibraltar spot rushed across
 to the other side of the screen, indicating the rolling back of a power
 ful current to the earth. This was followed shortly afterwards by
 Malta, Suez, and Aden. Bombay came only as far as the zero line,
 at which time the currents in the dilferent parts of the cable were
 <U+FB02>owing out at each end, leaving Bombay neutral. It was some
 minutes before the cable was sufficiently discharged to allow the ten
 spots to come near enough to the zero line to admit of a second
 experiment.
     The curves produced at successive intervals of time while the
 cable was discharging are shown by Figs. 9, 10, and 11'. Fig. 9 giving
 the position of the spots a second after the English end was connected
 to earth; Fig. 10, the appearance shown at a still later period; Fig. 11,
 after the lapse of about a minute. Here it will be seen the cable
 having become charged had to discharge itself by pouring its electric
 charge out at each end.
     When a succession of signals was sent into the cable by alternately
 depressing and elevating the key, for periods of <U+FB01>ve seconds each,
 these impulses produced waves which could be distinctly traced as far
 as Aden, where their individuality became lost. The little spots be
 yond this station showed the presence of a current resulting from the
 combination of these successive waves.
     The speaker then pointed out his methods of clearing the line after
each impulse. In 1853-54 he invented a plan which consisted of
sending after each positive current, a negative current—-a plan which
is now generally used in working submarine lines.
     In 1856 he invented a plan which consisted of sending a strong
positive current of de<U+FB01>nite strength and duration into the line, fol
lowed by a weak positive current to produce a signal; this being
followed by a strong negative retreat, succeeded by a weak negative
current to clear the line. This system was a great improvement upon
the former.
     In 1858 Professor Sir William Thomson proposed the use of three
currents of equal duration but irregular strength and alternate signs,
which produced a still more rapid result.
     In 1863 the speaker found, by experiments on his arti<U+FB01>cial line,
that by using a succession of four or <U+FB01>ve currents, all of the same
strength but varying in duration, greater rapidity could be secured.
    * In Figs. 10 and 11 the engraver has made a mistake, and inserted one
galvanometer too many.

  54                              Mr. G. F. Varley                [Feb. 15,
  For example, <U+FB01>rst a positive current, followed by a negative of
  longer duration, followed again by a positive current of much less
  duration; then a shorter negative current, and that again by a very
  short positive current, produced a succession of positive and negative
  waves throughout the line : the result of all of which was at the Au
- stralian end one very small positive wave, perfectly distinct, the rest of
  the line being left almost immediately entirely free from all traces of
  electricity, ready for the production of a second signal.
      This is shown by Fig. 12.

     In the previous experiments, when an impulse had been given the
charge had to <U+FB01>nd its way to the earth through the two ends of the
cable.
     By experiments on actual cables the speaker had at an early date
ascertained that the rate of transmission through a cable is inde
pendent of the potential or intensity of the battery, and that it varies
inversely as the square of the length of the cable, excepting in the case
 of very short cables thickly covered with iron, where the retardation
caused by the magnetic inertia of the iron forms an item of some im
portance; and in the foregoing experiments it has been assumed, which
is really the case with such a cable as the Atlantic, that this retardation
is too small to be worthy of consideration.
     Professor Thomson, by mathematical reasoning, has calculated, and
 the arti<U+FB01>cial cable has demonstrated, that the strength of the current
at the distant endyaries, as shown in Fig. 1, p. 47 ; and that with a given
potential or intensity there is no possible means of expediting this
rate of arrival : and therefore, in order to get high speed, highly
sensitive instruments must be used, and so soon as a visible indication
has been produced at the distant end, the cable must be cleared of its
charge, so as to admit of a second impulse or signal being given.
     The instrument known as the curb key seems to carry this to the
utmost limit, and its success depends upon the following consider
ation :—If the line be cut in half, the speed of transmissiomis increased
four times. If new one-half the cable were made positive while the
other half was made negative, it is clear that while the <U+FB01>rst quarter of
the cable which was negative is discharging to earth, and while the
last quarter of the cable which was positive is discharging to earth,
the two intermediate quarters would discharge by rushing into each
other: consequently the electricity having a shorter distance to travel,
the discharge is effected much more quickly.
    Fig. 12 represents the currents in the cable, after a curbed signal
of <U+FB01>ve currents producing three positive and two negative waves in
the cable, the <U+FB01>rst positive current to produce the signal was followed
by a longer negative current to cut off ‘the upper portion of the curve
No. 1, Fig. 1, p. 47. This would have produced a powerful negative
signal, therefore a shorter positive current was sent into the line to
curb it, and that followed by a still shorter negative, followed by a
very short positive.
    These <U+FB01>ve alternate currents were all sent into the line before
any signal was visible at Australia.
    Almost immediately after the appearance of the current at the
Australian end the alternate waves neutralized each other, and the
ten spots fell rapidly upon the zero line, showing that the cable was
discharged throughout.
    The little curve 3’ Fig. 1, p. 47, represents a signal curbed down to
nearly 1 per cent. of the original wave, while the big curve 3 represents
the short signal of the ordinary Morse key, the latter requires at least
18 a for its formation, while the former can be made in from 2% to 3 a.

56                        Mr. C. F. Varley                    [Feb. 15,
There seems a definite limit beyond which the curbing cannot be
carried with advantage. The eye of the operator can read the signals
even when considerably distorted; and when the curbing is carried
below the rioth part of the original wave, which the speaker has done
upon the Atlantic cable itself, an interval of time has to be left
between each signal to admit of their being individualized; i.e. the
signals will not bear distortion, and the line must be more thoroughly
£OLIOW.

expediting the signals through the cable, and for cutting off the dis
turbances arising from the Aurora Borealis, and which were generally
designated “magnetic storms.”
     These phenomena are not unfrequently experienced simultaneously
over the greater part of the earth, and are sometimes so powerful that
the earth at Ipswich has been found to be + or – to the earth in
London to the extent of 140 cells Daniel's battery. These currents do
not change suddenly like electric signals, but go gradually over from
positive to negative. The speaker had constructed an apparatus (vide
Fig. 15) for imitating these currents. An annular trough containing
sulphate of zinc solution was connected at opposite points to the earth
and to the cable (through the telegraph key). A fly-clock rotated
the crossbar as shown by the arrow in the diagram. From this cross
bar depended two pieces of amalgamated zinc connected with the
two poles of the battery, when the latter were at right angles to the
line connecting the cable with the earth, viz. as in the figure, no
current flowed into the cable.     When this crossbar had moved 90°
from the position shown in the diagram, a positive current was
flowing into the cable; on its moving 180° more the current had
changed sign and reached its maximum negative. This apparatus
performed the half revolution in 40 seconds. The speaker stated that
he had never seen, in all his experience, an earth current change from
maximum positive to maximum negative in a shorter period than 60
seconds, and that only once; the change was often spread over an
interval varying from five to ten or more minutes.
     At the Newfoundland end of the cable, a reflecting galvanometer
was placed between the earth and the cable, whilst a second galvano
meter was placed, on Mr. Varley's plan, between a condenser and the
cable, the other pole of the condenser being connected with the earth.
The moment a current began to arrive at the distant end, it was shown
upon both galvanometers; but as soon as it had acquired a uniform
strength, the cendenser, being charged to that strength, cut off all
further electricity, and the second galvanometer returned to zero,
while the first one remained deflected.     The amount that the second
galvanometer was deflected did not depend at all upon the amount of
current passing through the cable, but simply upon the rate at which
its potential varied, and according to which the condenser charged or
discharged itself. The earth currents sent the ordinary galvanometer
image running from right to left twenty or thirty feet, right off the
 screen in fact, but the other one simply moved three inches, because
 the rate of variation of potential being slow the condenser charged
 slowly.
      The effect of the condenser on the latter galvanometer is at the
 first moment to offer no resistance to the passage of the electric current.
 Suppose a current of a force 1 to arrive at the distant end, the current
 splits, part running through the galvanometer D to the condenser, the
 other through the galvanometer or resistance B to the earth.
      As soon as the condenser becomes charged to the power 1 the

58              Mr. O’. F. Varley on the Atlantic Telegraph.      [Feb 15,
current in D ceases, if now the current increase from 1 to 2 the
condenser E will become charged to 2, and while charging the gal
vanometer D will indicate the presence of a current ; but as soon as
 the condenser is charged with the same power as the cable, the current
in D ceases. Thus then the galvanometer and condenser D, E do
 not measure the strength of the current <U+FB02>owing through the cable,
 but simply indicates alterations of the potential.
     Suppose the cable and condenser charged to a potential of 100, D
would show no current ; if anything suddenly augmented this potential
to 101 the condenser would be charged to 101, and the variation of
potential would be indicated. Suppose now that the charge were
decreased from 100 to 99 the potential of the condenser would be
reduced to 99 by discharging itself into the cable, producing a
current in the opposite direction of a power of 1. -
     Thus then the strength of the current in D is entirely dependent
 upon the increment or decrement of potential, and not upon the
 strength of the current <U+FB02>owing through the cable. Suppose now an
 earth current of a power of 100 to pass from + to - in 60 seconds.
A signal through the Atlantic cable is produced in about a quarter of
a second.                                                   ‘
     If the strength of the signal be but 1%, of that of the earth current,
yet as the rate of variation is 240 times greater, the signal while it
 lasts will be 24 times as strong as the earth current, and so the weak
 rapid current produces a signal, while the strong, by slowly changing
 earth currents, produces one too feeble to interfere.
     The same disposition of apparatus greatly accelerates the speed of
 signalling, and affords a near approach to the rapidity attained by the
 curb key; this contrivance, however, can be used with advantage in
 conjunction with the curb key.
     The speaker demonstrated this by sending signals through the
arti<U+FB01>cial Atlantic cable, from a very much weaker battery than that
used to produce the earth currents; however, the rate of augmentation
qf potential of these small signal waves being much greater than the
rate of variation of potential of the great earth current wave, sharp
clear signals were produced upon the second galvanometer. So by
this extremely simple contrivance the small ripples upon the back of
the big earth current wave were, practically speaking, entirely detached,
and clear signals produced, which despised altogether the great swell
which had rendered the <U+FB01>rst instrument altogether useless. A number
of words were spelt through the cable to illustrate the fact.
     In concluding, the speaker remarked that it was upon the data
furnished by this arti<U+FB01>cial cable that he designed the present Atlantic
cables, and that without it he could not then have guaranteed eight
words per minute without a core whose conductor and insulator were
each 60 per cent. greater than the present, which consisted of 3001b,
of copper and 4001b. of gutta percha t0 the mile; and he added that
it was at least some reward for the years of arduous labour he had
had in connection with this great enterprise to <U+FB01>nd that everything he

Tm; men and women who left England in the dawn of the seven
teenth century and landed on Plymouth Rock represented the <U+FB01>ltered
strength of the English people. It was because they feared they
would in Holland, where they <U+FB01>rst sought refuge from persecution,
lose their English name and speech, that they resolved to seek the
shores of America, where their wild home was rightly named New
England.     They were 102 in number—28 women—who landed at
Plymouth in 1620, and there was not a feeble heart nor a blockhead
among them. Their wildly-cradled infant colony was born on Christ
mas Day, but they toiled through every hour of it, though the bitter
cold could not induce them to work on their cabins the previous day,
it being Sunday. The <U+FB01>rst years of the colony were lowly enough,
the hand to hand struggle with nature for subsistence; but from this
was evolved national character.
    The section in which the pilgrims settled has a distinctive physical
character. After describing at considerable length the features of the
country and its great beauties, the speaker referred to the Indians, of
whom the pilgrims found about 50,000 in New England when they
landed. The <U+FB01>rst impression of the Indian is attractive, on account of
his <U+FB01>ne physical appearance; but the near view reveals his repulsive
characteristics.  The power of his senses has not been exaggerated,

He is, however, a brainless savage, by no means the right <U+FB01>gure for a
central position in America. The Puritans began by being scrupu
lously just to the Indians ; but the Indian could not be made to under
 stand an English bargain. He thought that a thing reverted to him
when what he had received for it was exhausted. This led to the Indian
wars. But the Indians were hardly so heavy a trial to the Puritans
as the power from which they had <U+FB02>ed in England, but which found
them out so soon as they had any success. The king gave their lands
to his favourites, and they had to share whatever they could wring
from their hard soil; and even this was not so hard on them as the
effort made to crush their religion; the noblemen thinking it a dis
grace that their American estates should be Worked by a party of
vulgar “separatists.” Neither they nor their religion was crushed,
however. At the end of twenty years there had been drawn thither
20,000 people, and they were building good ships, and had‘ a good
trade. They were distributed into the settlements which were the
germs of the six New England States by natural forces. The barren
ness and the <U+FB01>ne water-power of Massachusetts~the mother state
decided that it should be a manufacturing state; these parties went
out to the grazing uplands of New Hampshire and Vermont, and to
the meadows of Connecticut, to get wool and grain for those mills of
Massachusetts. Rhode Island was planted by Roger Williams, an
eloquent Oxonian, who <U+FB02>ed from the persecutions of Laud, and was
too much of a Radical for the Puritans to tolerate. The State of
Maine was settled through the free trade that was opened by the
French of Nouvelle France in the north with the Boston colony; the
<U+FB01>rst of the long column of benefactions on which rests what is called
the traditional friendship between America and France. The hostility
of the Indians made every inland migration a costly one.
    In 1643 the various settlements formed the <U+FB01>rst American Con
federation. It was partly a mutually defensive union, but mainly a
religious one. The body which represented it was a Council in which
each settlement, however large or small, had two members; and in
this respect it was the original senate. There was no President, but
only a Moderator chosen by the Council. They adopted the Mosaic
code as their constitution; but it is not true, as is generally supposed,
that their laws were unusually rigorous. Whilst England and Scot
land had as yet thirty offences punishable-with death, New England
had only ten. It was in small affairs, and in the interference with private
conduct, that Puritan rigour was felt chie<U+FB02>y, although they were
guilty of cruelties in the instances of the Quakers and other heretics.
However, those “ heretics” were never punished for heresy with any
thing beyond banishment from the colony; the scourges, and the four
memorable executions of Quakers, were punishments for the de<U+FB01>ance
of magistrates involved in repeated returns, when death had been
named as the penalty for the <U+FB01>nal return. At this time New England
was a religious aristocracy. The preachers were also the magistrates ;
only Church members could vote. This had hardened into a despotic

regime.    But a silent power—the free school—had even at that early
period been set in motion, which, when the persecution of the witches
came on, was shown to have undermined the clerical power. The
people released the condemned witches, and swept out of pulpits and
from benches the judges and preachers concerned in their prose
cution. Amid this revulsion at the close of the seventeenth century,
the authority of the clergy in New England closed, and the era of
 religious liberty began.
     The period stretching from the year in which the last witch was
executed-—l693—to the Revolution of Independence was one of great
intellectual and moral growth. Under the masterly neglect of the
Duke of Newcastle, to whom the administration of that region was so
long committed, the New World matured its powers, and the colonies
silently became Republics. The Revolution was but the publication
of a fact. It was a victory in which both sides won, and decided that
the New World is not to be a duplicate of the Old.
     Independence came upon New England like the breath of a tropic.
Its industry had always been great. The cultivable land is only
about the size of England, but its products for 1866 may be
represented by 250,000,0001. The single state of Massachusetts
is a <U+FB02>int not larger than three English counties, yet out of it came
last year 100,000,000L, which is thrice as much as in 1845. The
taxable property of that state, apart from all public institutions, is
over a thousand millions of dollars.                  -
     One-third of the American people are of New England descent.
Another third is of other English settlements. It is undeniable that
the races of the old world have been modi<U+FB01>ed in the new, and the
English more than others. “The full and <U+FB02>orid habit,” says Dr.
Palfrey, “the moist skin, the curly hair, and sanguine temperament so
general in Great Britain, have in America been replaced by a
comparatively slender form, dry skin, straight hair, and bilious or
nervous temperament.” With more <U+FB02>esh than the American, the
Englishman has not quite so large a skeleton. Agassiz has admitted
this fact, though it is unfriendly to his theories. Haller gave the
average height of the European man as 5 feet 5 inches ; the measure
ments of New England soldiers in {the late war show them to be
5 feet 8 inches. The New Englander reaches his maximum of size
later in life than the European. There is doubtless a slight infusion
of the Indian characteristics in the American. These traits are
possibly physiognomical. In religion, in education, the skeleton or
type is large, though not yet completely <U+FB01>lled out. With less scholar
ship than Europe, America has a better school-system. New England
may be called a large university. Her system of education has been
<U+FB01>ltered through 230 years, and is so complete that it is impossible to
<U+FB01>nd a healthy native of the country uneducated. In coming in contact
with the people fresh from work and reality the colleges have lost
much of their monasticism, and science has become paramount in them.
This enthusiasm for scienti<U+FB01>c studies has in<U+FB02>uenced literature.

     Nearly all the men of letters in America are of New England. Forty
     years ago American thought began to cease to be the refrain of English
     thought, and to assume those distinctive characters which are best
     represented in transcendentalism. The transcendental movement has
     revolutionized the beliefs and politics and institutions of America
     more than anything else. It was a kind of spiritual Positivism.

          SIR HENRY Hol.IAND, Bart. M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. President,

                       ASSISTANT SUPERINTENDENT, ROYAL LABORATORY.
                    On Military Breech-Loading Small Arms.
    THose who believe that breech-loading rifles formed no part of the
    equipment of the British army until the present or the past year—that
    they sprang directly out of the performances of the needle-gun in the
    late Bohemian campaign, will learn with surprise that not only had
    breech-loading been determined upon for our infantry nearly three
    years ago, and the actual pattern of arm that is now in the hands of
    a large proportion of our troops decided upon a full month before
    Königgratz was fought, but that two regiments of English cavalry were
    provided with a breech-loading carbine ten years ago. If we examine
    one of these Sharp's carbines, as they are called, we notice at once an
    objectionable feature, viz. that the ignition is effected by means of a
. . percussion cap. Then again, the arm is provided with no effective
    arrangement for checking the escape of gas. So great is this escape,
    that a handkerchief laid over the breech at the moment of firing will
    be burnt through and through; whereas with a close-fitting arm or

1867.]           on Military Breech-Loading Small Arms.               63
cartridge the handkerchief should not be even soiled by the discharge.
This defect is aggravated by the quantity of powder, which in damp
weather adheres outside the breech after loading. The back end of
the cartridge is cut off thus, and the powder sprinkled about. From
these two causes, the firer's face is generally flecked and burnt in
firing; while the escape of gas tends also to foul and clog the breech
action, which exposes large friction surfaces, and to render the arm
more difficult to open as each round is fired. For these reasons: the
retention of the percussion cap, the liability to an escape of gas, the
flash occasioned also by the spilt powder, and the difficulties which
often arise in loading, this system is extremely imperfect. And yet
this system did undoubtedly reflect to some extent the state of feeling
which prevailed in this country on the subject of military breech
loading arms a few years ago. For at that time this question was
regarded exclusively as a cavalry question, and quick shooting was
scarcely thought desirable for a cavalry soldier. . . . . .
    Between 1857 and 1861 three other breech-loaders were introduced
for experimental cavalry use. One of these, the Green's carbine,
even in that easy age, never obtained a footing as a recognized service
arm. But the Terry's carbine, which I have here, was introduced to
some extent, and is not yet entirely obsolete; and the Westley
Richards' carbine has found justly more favour.      In 1861 this arm
was definitively adopted. It is a great improvement on the others
which I have named.        It is an accurate arm; it fires six or seven
rounds a minute with comparative ease and certainty; it spills no
powder; it does not burn the firer's face or facings. Until the recent
competition, Westley Richards was accepted as the best type of mili
tary breech-loading arm known in this country, and, with its many
objections, I would still pronounce it one of the most effective capping
breech-loaders which has been produced.
    But we have now to consider the subject in a broader light. It
had been treated hitherto from one narrow point of view—as almost
exclusively a cavalry question. We had considered only arms of
which the percussion cap formed a material element, and a capping
arm may be pronounced, with our present knowledge and for our
present purpose, only half a breech-loader. Thus far, then, we may
justly say that breech-loading had been cramped within contracted
limits and misunderstood. But a couple of years or so ago the
whole aspect of the case altered. As by a revelation we learnt
then what breech-loading really meant, and of what development the
system was capable. It was a great epoch for breech-loading, its
Hegira, it might be called, when it was discovered that the objections
to cartridges containing within themselves the means of ignition had
in reality no force. If we are to trace the stagnation which had hung
over the question to a definite cause, we may confidently place our
finger upon these objections.                                            -
    When men said, and the ablest and most experienced military men
did say, and our military authorities laid it down as a fundamental

64                         Captain V. D. Majendt'e                      [March 1,
axiom, that cartridges containing their own ignition were not ad
missible for military use, what they meant was: 1st, That such
cartridges were more liable than others to accidental explosion; and.
2nd, That in the event of the explosion of one cartridge, the contents
of the barrel were liable to be all exploded en masse, and so to com
municate from barrel to barrel. If we grant these premises, the
conclusion is just. Ammunition which is liable to explode in bulk,
and thus not only to commit injury and dangerous havoc for the
moment, but by its explosion to deprive the troops dependent upon it
of their supplies, is clearly not admissible for military use. But
when, mainly, I believe, by reason of the explosion of gunpowder at
Erith two years and a half ago, men’s minds were directed towards
explosions generally, an experiment was made to determine the
liability of small-arm cartridges—not breech-loading cartridges in
this case, but the ordinary muzzle-loading En<U+FB01>cld ri<U+FB02>e cartridges, ball
and blank—to explode in bulk, and it was established not only that
the explosion of a single cartridge in a barrel was not communicated
to the rest, but that the explosion of a number of cartridges, or even
of 1- lb. of loose powder, although it might burst open and destroy the
barrel, would not occasion a general explosion. Although the bearing
of this fact upon the question of breech-loading was not immediately
perceived, it furnished the opening through which presently a <U+FB02>ood
of strong new light rushed in upon the subject.
     This effect proceeds from the same cause as that which operates
in rendering the well-known Gale gunpowder inexplosive. Mr. Gale
enclosed each grain of his powder in an incombustible envelope of
<U+FB01>nely-powdered glass or bone-dust.* In a barrel of cartridges we
have not each grain enveloped, but a number of grains, so many as
compose one charge, in a non-combustible case. I have tried over
and over again to explode a barrel of the service breech-loading
cartridges without success. I have several times <U+FB01>red one cartridge
in a barrel without igniting the remainder. I have <U+FB01>red ten cartridges
at once, and no more have <U+FB01>red.           I have gone further, and placed
the barrel inside an iron cylinder, tightly screwed down, and have
exploded <U+FB01>lb. of powder in the midst of the 700 cartridges which it
contained; and although the screws were broken and the lid of the
cylinder was blown off with violence, and some of the cartridges
were strangely distorted, none of the cartridges were ignited. Ex
periments not less exhaustive have established also the non-liability
of these cartridges to separate accidental ignition, by concussion or
otherwise. In this way we dispose of the objections which have been
entertained against cartridges containing their own ignition, and es
tablish their admissibility for military service. . . . . .
     Between 1859 and 1864, no less than'twenty-six different plans of

four parts of powdered glass, was described and illustrated by experiments.   See

1867             on Military Breech-Loading Small Arms.              65
breech-loading were proposed. For sporting purposes, too, breech
loading guns had found their way into very general use, and in
America they were being largely applied experimentally for military
service. But always this shadow hung over the question; that car
tridges containing their own ignition were not generally considered
admissible for military use. And as breech-loaders not adapted for
such ammunition presented comparatively few advantages except for
cavalry, for whom as I have explained quick <U+FB01>ring was not specially
desired, and as the development of the system was thus stunted, the
question was in fact argued in a circle, and the subject remained up to
this period practically at a stand-still.
    But when once this fatal restriction and limitation were removed
we began at once to make real progress in the matter. It was no
longer a question merely of an arm which presented certain minor
facilities of manipu1ation—of an arm somewhat handier to load on
horseback—but it became obviously a question of an arm, which
would multiply the <U+FB01>re of an army three or fourfold—which, pro
perly considered, would place as it were three or four ri<U+FB02>es in each
soldier’s hands.
    In the course of the Dane-German war the value of the famous
needle-gun, or rather of the system of which the needle-gun was an
indifferent exponent, became in the eyes of observant men fully
established. S0 obvious was the teaching of this campaign, that our
then Secretary of State for War, Lord De Grey, appointed forthwith a
committee, with General Russell as president, to “report upon the
advisability of arming the infantry, either in whole or in part, with
breech-loaders.” After four meetings this committee reported,
abstractedly and without reference to any particular system, that it
would be desirable to arm the whole of the infantry with breech-loading
ri<U+FB02>es; and on the day on which this report was drawn up, the llth
July, 1864, the death-warrant of muzzle-loading ri<U+FB02>es for the use of
the British soldiers may be regarded as having been signed.
    The next question to be considered was, how to give effect to the
recommendations of the committee. This question admitted of con
sideration in two ways : either by itself with a view to ascertain the
speediest and cheapest mode of placing a breech-loader in the hands
of the troops, or in combination with other questions connected with
ri<U+FB02>es, such as the best size of the bore and the best mode of igniting
the cartridge, and with a view to determine what would be, in all
respects, the most perfect arm for the use of the infantry. The <U+FB01>rst
mode of dealing with the question would have the advantage of celerity,
the second of completeness. But why not have combined the two,
by arming the British army immediately with the needle-gun? Here
was a complete system-a good system perhaps, some will say, ready
made to our hand; a system too which had had the advantage of
being tried on actual service, and which, if economical considerations
were to have any weight, had been adopted by a nation very much less
able to bear heavy‘ expenditure than ourselves. I have here a needle

 gun, which will I think answer this question for itself. Take the
 gun as it stands, and tell me~those of you at least, and I doubt not
 there are many who are accustomed to handle the beautiful weapons
 which England puts into the hands of her soldiers and her volunteers
 and her sportsmen-tell me if this clumsy ri<U+FB02>e is one which you
 would have cared to see issued to our troops. But why not, you will
 say, improve the workmanship of the piece-—make it lighter, balance
 it better, alter its bore if need be, or its mode of ri<U+FB02>ing, improve
 its mechanism, and when you have suited it to the more advanced
 requirements of this country, adopt it?
     Need I point out to you that such a measure would have disposed
 of the <U+FB01>rst argument for the adoption of the arm. We are no longer
 in this case adopting a system ready made to our hands. We are in
 fact creating one. We are adopting a breech mechanism, merely one
 element of a system, nothing more. And but little knowledge of the
 subject was needed toiinstruct us as to the extremely defective nature
 or principle of this breech mechanism. If I handle the needle-gun
you will see that it is comparatively slow. It is clumsy and imperfect,
 in other ways. The needle with which the cartridge is ignited is
 very liable to become bent or injured. I shall be reminded that these
 needles are easily replaced, that each Prussian soldier carries two or
 three. But this injury and replacing of a needle temporarily disables the
 arm, and constitutes, it must be admitted, an objection. Then again, the
 gas-check is not permanently reliable. The whole escape is thrown upon
 the arm, at the junction of the breech, none upon the cartridge; and
even if we set out with a tight <U+FB01>t, the <U+FB01>t will become less and less close,
and in time, if the arm be not carefully looked to and repaired, an
inconvenient escape'of gas will occur,—an escape which sometimes
induces the Prussian soldier to deliver his <U+FB01>re by preference from the
hip. Of the ammunition it will be su<U+FB02>icient to say that it is rude, and
for technical reasons ill-adapted for the requirements of military service.
 The egg-shaped bullet is embedded in a. small papier-maché wad,
 which serves the double purpose of ri<U+FB02>ing the bullet, which never
 touches the grooves, and of containing the fulminate, which the needle,
 penetrating the powder and the thin paper envelope which encloses the
\whole, has to pierce. In short the needle-gun, however superior even
 to a good muzzle-loader, was not such an arm as we should have been
justi<U+FB01>ed in adopting, except in an emergency more pressing than that
which now presented itself.
     Of the other systems of which we had any experience, and
which you have seen, there was none which seemed calculated to
satisfy our requirements, and their adoption was accordingly not
entertained.
     Under these circumstances, having no complete system to begin
upon, we determined to take so much of a known and reliable system
as we approved, and apply it. By this course we should get, as it
were, a lift upon our road, and start somewhat in advance of the point
from which we must set out, if we elected to consider the question

1867.]          on Military Breech-Loading Small Arms.                67
ab ovo. Therefore, and without prejudicing the ultimate and more
leisurely investigation which the question as a whole demanded, we
resolved to take so much of the existing arm—the Enfield rifle—as
seemed to us good, and to revolutionize that part of it which we
deemed bad.     We determined, in short, to convert our Enfield rifles
into breech-loaders. In speaking of the Enfield rifle as a good arm,
I am anxious not to be misunderstood.        It is an arm doubtless with
many defects, if we judge it by the rigid standard of more modern
requirements. A steel barrel, for example, would probably be
preferable to a wrought-iron barrel; the Enfield twist is undoubtedly
too slow for extreme accuracy; and the calibre may be considered as
unnecessarily large. The refinements and progress of gunmaking
have left the Enfield rifle to a certain extent behindhand, just as the
refinements and progress of breech-loaders have left the needle-gun
behind; and yet in the main it is an excellent weapon for military
use, and I know no power whose soldiers possess a muzzle-loading
rifle which can compare with it. We do not, recollect, require a
match-rifle for military purposes.     Except, on a few rare occasions,
such an arm would have no special value. It was Lord Palmerston,
I think, who pointed out that what the soldier is required to do is,
not to hit a particular button upon his enemy's coat, but generally
to drive home an effective fire into an opposing body of infantry
or cavalry. . . . . Instructed then by the sober teaching of
actual warfare, we were justified, I think, in assuming that if
to this Enfield rifle, without subtracting from its accuracy and
other qualities, we could apply an effective breech-loading arrange
ment, we should be at once relieved of all pressing anxiety, and in a
position to select leisurely a new and superior breech-loader for future
manufacture.      Moreover, there were more than half-a-million of
these muskets available for conversion; and the step which was pro
posed had the secondary, but by no means inconsiderable, advantage
of economy. It had other subordinate advantages, such as the
experience in breech-loading equipment to be derived in the course of
the inquiry, and which might stand us in good stead when the more
complete and difficult question should come before us, and finally the
avoidance of the danger of hurrying without due consideration into
the adoption of a possibly unsatisfactory arm.
     In August, 1864, an advertisement was issued, inviting gunmakers
and others to submit propositions for the conversion of the Enfield
rifle. From the fifty systems which were sent in in reply to this
advertisement, those which were obviously unsuitable were eliminated,
and eight systems were selected for trial, of which five only, for
reasons which it is unnecessary for me to detail, ultimately came to
the post. Of these, four were capping arms, one only a non-capping
arm. The selection for trial of these capping arms indicates that
we were not then quite as advanced or decided upon this point as we
are now, and had not yet absolutely learned to regard non-capping as
a sina quá non. So Westley Richards', Mont-Storm's, Wilson's, and
                                                             F

Green's converted Enfield rifles entered the lists against the solitary
representative of the non-capping system—the Snider rifle.
     Westley Richards converted Enfield was substantially the same
in respect to its breech mechanism as the cavalry carbine which I have
shown you, with the addition of a small hook at the end of the
plunger for withdrawing the wad after firing.
     In Wilson's arm the breech of the original rifle is removed, and
the barrel prolonged for some inches in the form of an open slot.
The cartridge is inserted here and pushed forward into the barrel,
and is followed by a sliding plunger, which is fixed after loading by a
stout bolt which passes through stock and plunger. There is an
india-rubber ring to diminish the escape of gas.
     The Green rifle resembled the Wilson, except in the manner of
 securing the plunger, which is furnished with a small knob, and is
 turned round after loading a quarter circle, and so locked.
     The Montgomery Storm or Mont-Storm arm is one of that class
 of breech-loaders known as “chamber-loaders.”        A chamber-loader
 is in fact a sort of muzzle-loader cut short, or so arranged that the
 arm can be conveniently loaded by hand, without the assistance of
 a ramrod. The charge is deposited in a short chamber, instead of
 being rammed all the way down a long barrel; and the chamber is
 then replaced in the position for firing in the prolongation of the
 barrel. Of breech-loaders on this plan there are many modifica
 tions. In this arm the hinge is in front of the chamber; in many
 rifles (the Swedish rifle for example) it is behind, and that would
 probably be the most primitive form of chamber-loading. Colt
 and Deane and Adam's revolvers are examples of chamber
 loading arms having several chambers. In these arms, the chambers
 are not hinged but revolve, and are brought in succession into pro
 longation of the barrel. I have several other examples of chamber
 loading arms here, to which I would invite your attention after this
 discourse. The chamber of the Storm rifle can be turned completely
 over the breech, and loaded; or it may be swivelled at right angles to
 the barrel for loading with loose powder. When the chamber is
 returned it is secured by a bolt worked by the lock, and an escape is
 prevented by an expanding ring or thimble on the pan of the chamber.
      In the first arms made on the Snider system, about two inches of
 the upper side of the breech end of the barrel were cut away, leaving
 a wide open slot or breech for the admission of the cartridge. When
 the cartridge had been pushed forward into a taper chamber formed
 by enlarging what was now the hind part of the barrel, the slot was
 closed by a lump of steel, hinged on the right side of the barrel, and
 forming a false breech. It was afterwards found more convenient to
 remove the back part of the barrel bodily, and to replace it with a
 “shoe,” in which the whole of the breech arrangement was comprised;
 other modifications followed, until we got at last the more perfect
 arm, which I hold in my hand. The breech-block, you will see,
 hinges upon this pin and works thus.       It is kept in its place by a

1867.]         ‘on Military Breech-Loading Small Arms. -               69
small spring stud; and the <U+FB01>t of the block tends also to hold it.      In
order to meet a possible objection that this arrangement is liable to
wear and get out of order, I have brought a “shoe” which has
never even ’been hardened, but which has <U+FB01>red at least 30,000 rounds,
and still remains, as you will see if you care to inspect it presently,
perfectly serviceable.
     The ignition is effected by means-of a small piston or striker,
which passes through the breech-block, and which, when in repose, is
<U+FB02>ush with the face of the block. A blow of the hammer causes it to
dart forward about a tenth of an inch into the cap, which is <U+FB01>xed, as
I shall presently more particularly explain, in the base of the
cartridge. The piston is returned by a spiral spring. To withdraw
the empty cartridge case, a claw or extractor forms part of the
breech-block. When I withdraw the block, the empty cartridge is
necessarily drawn with it, and by canting the ri<U+FB02>e sideways the case
is thrown out. The extractor is returned by another spiral spring.
With regard to this spring, to which objection has been taken, I would
point out that it is negative, not positive, in its action. The spring in
the needle-gun is positive, and the action depends upon it. In this
gun, the spring is an auxiliary merely, not an essential. We can do
without the spring. It is better to have it; but if we have it not,
if it becomes damaged or inert, the extractor can be pushed back by
hand. And lastly, the spring in this case is never repressed to a
greater extent than about one-tenth of an inch.
     It has been stated lately that the Snider system was not really
invented by Mr. Snider at all, but by M. Francois Eugene Schneider;
or to go further back, by Mr. John Poad Drake, a Cornishman. But
if we are really to trace the system to its source, we must go back to
a time which places the invention quite beyond the reach of living
men. I have thus far not ventured on the archaaology of breech-load
ing; but if you will permit me, I will make one dive into antiquity
for the purpose of bringing under your notice two breech-loading
<U+FB01>rearms of the reign of Henry VIII., on the Snider system! By the
kindness of Admiral Cai<U+FB01>n, these interesting arms have been lent to
me from the museum of the Tower, for the purpose of exhibition this
evening.
     In the course of the competition the Snider gun proved about
50 per cent. quicker than its rivals; it was stronger too; it was
simple, and apparently durable, the breech arrangement being well
adapted to sustain the shock of any number of discharges, from the
fact of those shocks being sensible only in a direction at right angles
to that in which a force must be exerted to open the breech; and
lastly——I should perhaps have placed this advantage <U+FB01>rst, not last,
—it was adapted for a cartridge containing its own ignition.
     Among the capping arms, the Mont-Storm ri<U+FB02>e was ranked <U+FB01>rst,
and was recommended for experimental application to a certain
number of ri<U+FB02>es. The system failed subsequently at proof, and the
recommendation was cancelled. It failed partly on account of the

70           ~           Captain V. D. Majendie                [March 1,
unsuitability of the skin cartridge which formed part of the system;
and this reminds me of another objection to which all capping arms
are open. Such arms need a cartridge so thin, that the <U+FB01>re from the
cap shall pierce it, and at the same time the cartridge must be so
entirely consumed or carried out by the discharge, as to leave no
residue to endanger or interfere with loading. These requirements
make it di<U+FB02>icult to satisfy another not less important point in a
military cartridge, viz.: that it shall be strong enough to stand the
knocking about to which it will inevitably be exposed in transport
and on service. Moreover, a thin cartridge is evidently less well
adapted than a stout one to resist the e<U+FB01>'ects of an accidental adjacent
explosion. But the Mont-Storm ri<U+FB02>e failed also in the arm itself.
Under proof charges, the hinge and small bolt by which the chamber
is locked were broken.
    The Snider ri<U+FB02>e, while satisfying many requirements, failed in one
important respect. It was so inaccurate as to be quite unsuitable for
adoption as it stood. . . . .
    As the fault could not lie in the barrel, which the accuracy obtained
under the other systems showed could be converted without detriment
in this respect, it was due obviously to the ammunition which Mr.
Snider had submitted. At this point then, the question of providing
more suitable ammunition for the arm was referred to Colonel Boxer,
by whom, after a year’s experiments, the present service ammunition
was designed. Discarding the papier-maché case submitted by Mr.
Snider, the objections to which, especially in damp weather, are well
known, Colonel Boxer made the case of his cartridge of very thin
sheet brass, 'OO3° thick. The cartridge has a little over two turns of
this brass.
    Five important advantages result from the employment of this
case :-—lst. Being uncoiled slightly by the explosion, instead of
depending upon the mere stretch of the material, the case can be
used in a chamber considerably larger than itself, with little danger
of breakage and consequent escape of gas. 2nd, It-is not liable to
swell with damp, and so to interfere either with loading or withdrawal.
3rd, The difference between the size of the case and of the chamber
is so considerable, as to permit of loading even when the case has
become considerably enlarged or dis<U+FB01>gured by rough usage. Nor
under these circumstances again is there any danger of leakage or
escape. 4th, Such a cartridge may be made, like the present service
cartridges, practically waterproof. 5th, The reaction, or tendency of
the case to recoil, which arises after the pressure of gas is removed,
tends to render a case of this sort easier of extraction than any other.
All of these advantages hold good against a papier-maché case ; many
of them hold good also against a case of simple copper or other metal.
    The last point to be noticed in'the ammunition. for the Snider ri<U+FB02>e
is the bullet. On this the accuracy of <U+FB01>re of the arm depends. The
bullet is not made, as in the majority of breech-loading arms, slightly

1867.]           on Military Breech-Loading Small Arms.              71
larger than the bore, but depends for its action upon the system of
expansion which Colonel Minié was I believe the <U+FB01>rst practically to
adopt, viz. a hollow on the base, together with a plug, by which the
original Minié iron cap has been superseded. This plug, which is
now made of baked clay, plays the double part of expanding and
supporting agent. The expansion of the bullet would be effected, it is
true, to a great extent by the simple action of the powder-gas upon
the sides of the hollow. But a plug makes that expansion more
instantaneous and more uniform; and above all it supports the sides
of the bullet after expansion. Thus with a plug the passage of the
gas is prevented and fouling diminished, in the <U+FB01>rst place; and in
the second, even when fouling has been established, its effect upon the
accuracy of a plugged bullet, whose sides do not collapse when they
come into contact with the obstructing deposit, will be much less than
upon an expanded bullet which has no plug.            '
    Another important feature of the bullet is the wood plug in the
head. By this plug we obtain three advantages : greater length, and
so a broader bearing and lubricating surface; secondly, the centre of
gravity is more favourably adjusted with reference to the requirements
of the projectile and the slow twist of the piece; thirdly, the weight
is disposed, as in the <U+FB02>y-wheel, away from the axis of rotation. . . . .
    Round the bullet are disposed grooves or cannelures, which serve
to carry the bees’ wax lubricant, by which means a layer of wax is
always interposed between the lead of the bullet and the sides of the
bore; and fouling is so completely got rid of that one of the best
targets ever made with this arm was made after 1000 rounds had been
<U+FB01>red from it without cleaning. This point is one of extreme import
ance, for the accuracy of a military arm is to be measured by its
average accuracy during a long sustained <U+FB01>re, and not by its perform
ances when perfectly clean. The measure of e<U+FB02>‘iciency of a military
arm in this, as in other respects, is to be obtained by taking the arm,
not at its_best, but at its worst. In other respects the ammunition
satis<U+FB01>ed the tests which were imposed. It stood an extraordinary
amount of rough usage. It was waterproof to an extent which
enabled it to be kept for a whole week in wet sawdust without
injury; it was easy of extraction, not liable to escape or explosion;
and its expense is very little greater than that of a paper cartridge,
even if we take its <U+FB01>rst cost merely, and immeasurably less if we
spread the cost over the periods during which the two ammuni
tions would respectively remain serviceable-if, indeed, the paper
cartridge could ever be considered serviceable. The extreme rapidity
of <U+FB01>re in the arm is <U+FB01>fteen shots per minute. Of this ammunition
about eight millions of rounds have been issued up to the end of
last week, and of the arms in round numbers 100,000. To deal with
the false and exaggerated reports which have been circulated respect
ing the “failure” of the Snider system is a task which I cannot
undertake, except in a general way. I can only say that in essence
and in substance these reports are false. There have been dii<U+FB01>culties

72                          Captain V. D. Majendie                    [March 1,
of detail, it is true, but fewer and less serious di<U+FB02>icnlties, I believe,
than have ever attended the introduction of any new system of guns or
small arms; and whereas the general tenour of the misstatements to
which I refer has been that the system has failed, the general tenour of
the reports of the troops, in Canada, at Hythe, and at Aldershot, to
whom the arms have been issued, has been that the system has proved,
on the whole, and specially with reference to the cartridge and the
breech action, admirably successful. It may tend, perhaps, to restore
con<U+FB01>dence, also, if I state that the percentage of failures out of a total
of about 50,000 rounds of ammunition, which, in the course of my
duty, it has fallen to my lot to <U+FB01>re since the arms were introduced, has
amounted to little over one failure in every three hundred cartridges,
including every defect, however slight-—every miss upon the target at
500 yards, every mis<U+FB01>re, every cartridge which has split or failed
from any cause. And out of more than 20,000 rounds <U+FB01>red by the
Ordnance Select Committee, the percentage of failure has been, I
believe, even less.      .   .   .  .
     Breech-loaders may be divided into two great classes:*-—(a)
breech-loaders, in the ordinary acceptation of the term; and (1)) re
peaters.
     The <U+FB01>rst class maybe further subdivided into (1) chamber-loaders,
and (2) breech-loaders proper. Of Chamber-loaders I have already
shown you two examples, the Mont-Storm and the Hagstrom. I have
here several others, such as a Spanish arm (Gareia’s), Bergstrom’s,
and another Norwegian system; Leetch’s, Mackenzie and Went
worth’s, &c.
     The more conspicuous defects of this class of arm would seem to
be their liability to injury by the explosion, which generally acts
directly upon the breech mechanism. On the other hand, they are
generally perfectly free from escape of gas, except sometimes at the
junction of chamber and barrel. In Sweden and Norway chamber
loaders <U+FB01>nd more favour than in this country.
     Breech-loaders proper include more numerous types of arms. The
 Snider ri<U+FB02>e is an arm of this class; so is the Westley Richards, the
 Terry, the Sharp, the Green, the needle-gun, all of which you have
 seen.   I have here several others, some good, some bad, some cele
 brated in their way, and some which exhibit the imperfections of
 which the system is capable. The Amsler-Milbank system (adopted by
 the Swiss Government for conversion), Joslyn’s, Bayliss’s, Restell’s,
 Beard’s, Bruton’s, Prince’s, the Starr carbine (now in use in Canada),
 Fosbery’s, Laidley’s (adopted in Russia), are all examples of breech
 loaders proper. In these arms, as a rule, very much more work is
 thrown upon the cartridge. Where, as in the neodle-g1m and the Sharp
 carbine, the escape is sustained by the gun, and not by the cartridge, the
     * A number of characteristic specimens of British and foreign breech-loaders
 were exhibited. Their special peculiarities were referred to in the discourse, and
 discussed in the library afterwards.

1867.]            on Illr'litary Breech-Loading Small Arms.             73
system will generally be open to objection on the score of excessive
escape of gas. With secure ammunition, this defect may be entirely
got rid of ; and to me it seems sounder in principle and more reliable
in practice to throw the burden of the escape upon the cartridge,
which only has to sustain it once, than upon the arm, which must
sustain it many hundreds or thousands of times.
     (1)) Repeaters may be subdivided into (1) revolvers, and (2) magazine
arms. Of Revolvers the best examples are furnished by revolving
pistols, of which, by the addition of a long stock and barrel, ri<U+FB02>es
have sometimes been made. I have here also a revolving carbine, by
a. Colonel Porter. The system is open to many objections, among
which, except for pistols, the weight of the several chambers is con
spicuous.
     Of Magazine arms there are two important varieties: The simple
repeater, such as Henry’s, in which the cartridges are constantly
drawn from a magazine under the barrel, which must be replenished
from time to time as it becomes exhausted; and secondly, an arm
which, like the Spenser and Lamson ri<U+FB02>es, can be used as repeaters
or simple breech-loaders at will. In these arms I can, if I wish, shut
ed the magazine, and load them as ordinary breech-loaders. This
plan presents several important advantages over the ordinary repeater,
which entails distinct intervals of ine<U+FB02>iciency while the magazine is
being replenished, and which directly tempts the soldier to indulge in
an excessive rapidity of <U+FB01>re while his magazine supply lasts. But in
the improved repeaters these objections are obviated. I have here,
for example, the Lamson ri<U+FB02>e, with its magazine full. I need not,
however, call upon the magazine, but I may load as if the arm were
an ordinary breech-loader. Then when pressed I can, so to speak,
turn on the tap of the magazine, and pour forth such a <U+FB01>re as no
simple breech-loader can deliver. When my magazine is exhausted,
I am not, as with an ordinary repeater, temporarily disabled; for I
can fall back upon the simple breech-loading action, until an op
portunity presents itself for replenishing the magazine against another
emergency. So with the Spenser ri<U+FB02>e, in which, as you will see from
this diagram, the magazine is situated in the stock.
      The direction in which repeaters generally err is in complexity of
 construction ; but if this defect can be overcome, a magazine-ri<U+FB02>e would
present immense advantages over the simple breech-loader, not merely
for those services, such as the navy, the cavalry, and artillery, in which
 an intensely rapid <U+FB01>re is generally required for a few decisive moments,
 but for the universal equipment of troops. It is in arms of this class
 that breech-loading tends towards its highest development; and to
 this principle of action I believe we must look for the complete and
 ultimate solution of the breech-loading question. . . . .
      The advantages which breech-loading presents in a military ri<U+FB02>e
 are—
      First, Rapiolity of Fire. We give each soldier, so to speak, and as
 I have before expressed it, three or four ri<U+FB02>es, with the inconveniences

74                       Captain V. D. Majendia         -    [March 1,
 only of one. At close quarters no troops, however brave, devoted, or
 disciplined, could stand with muzzle-loaders against a corresponding
 force armed with breech-loaders. It amounts to being opposed to a
force whose numbers are practically multiplied by the figure which
 expresses the ratio of rapidity of fire of the breech-loaders to the
 muzzle-loaders. We must not press this argument too far. It will
hold generally when the fighting is quick and close and decisive, and
 when the conditions of the contest on both sides are the same.     But
breech-loaders will not do everything; and we must avoid the error
 of supposing that they did everything in the Danish or Bohemian
campaigns. The needle-gun was but the embodiment of that spirit
of “geist” and progress which animated the Prussian army and its
leaders, which dictated the execution of their rapid movements, and
which was the soul and essence of their superior organization.
 Especially must we avoid the too close application of mere abstract
reasoning when the element of artillery fire comes into play.    Eleven
years ago an experiment was made at Hythe with life-size dummy
figures of men and horses, which went to prove conclusively that
artillery would be beaten off the field by infantry armed with rifles.
This drawing shows what was then proved, that a detachment coming
into action would be annihilated in three minutes by thirty file of
riflemen. But two important considerations were overlooked : that
in actual warfare infantry would scarcely deliver.so effective a fire as
then served to plant at 800 yards’ range thirty-four shots in a single
gun detachment,-just as two men standing opposite one another at
twenty paces to fight a duel often fail to hit one another, while at a
very much greater distance they can each easily break a bottle's neck
in a pistol gallery. And, secondly, the necessity for artillery coming
within this range at all was not established; so that the reasoning
which was based upon these premises fell in practice to the ground;
and notwithstanding improved musketry instruction and improvements
in the arms, the use and importance of artillery have in nowise
diminished since the introduction of the rifle for general service: so
those also would be mistaken who might argue from this diagram
that if so much could be done with muzzle-loading rifles, firing as
as they did on this occasion one round per minute only, breech-loaders
firing seven or eight rounds per minute would produce a correspond- .
ing effect, and that the predominance of artillery fire in an action
must henceforth cease to exist.     But within reasonable limits, the
effects of breech-loaders, as opposed to muzzle-loaders, can hardly be
over-estimated. It must be remembered too, that there is always
attendant upon the employment of a more effective arm a moral as
well as a physical effect. As Marshal Marmont said, a battle is
decided after all not by the number of men killed, but by the number
frightened.
    By a converse application of this argument, we reach the second
great advantage of breech-loading, increased confidence, a point upon
which I need not dwell, but of which all military men will recognize
the importance.

1867.]           on Military Breech-Loading Small Arms.               75
     Thirdly, we obtain greater facility in loading. On horseback,
breech-loading, even of an imperfect kind, is vastly superior mechani
cally to muzzle-loading. For the infantry man, if we reflect a moment,
the advantages will appear quite as great. Whatever the soldier's
position, whether lying behind some sheltering mound, cramped in a
rifle-pit, working in close squares, with his bayonet presented to resist
cavalry, or running forward as a skirmisher, he can load a breech-loader
as he could never load a muzzle-loader—without exposing himself,
without changing his position, without inconvenience or loss of time
or effect.
     We have, in the fourth place, improved shooting. The arm is
always loaded in a position which favours the subsequent delivery of
a low and effective fire. The eye is never removed from the object;
and no part of the powder can be spilt, no part can be lodged in the
grooves of the rifle; while the increased confidence of which I have
spoken tends to steady men's arms and improve their aim. It has
been objected that the rapid firing of the breech-loader will tend to
tire and unsteady men's arms, but surely this objection, if it has any
force, may be met by the consideration that the operation of loading
 a breech-loader is very much less fatiguing.
     Fifthly, the possibility of overloading is avoided. This in the
 hurry and excitement of action is no uncommon accident. A man
 loads and as he thinks fires.   His cap misses fire, or he even neglects
 to cap at all. But he does not at once recognize it. He rams down
 another charge; perhaps another, &c. &c. After one of the American
 battles several arms were picked up loaded with two charges, others
 with three; some with four, and a few even with eight !
     Among the minor advantages of breech-loaders, I may name the
 completeness and compactness of the ammunition; the facilities for
 cleaning and inspecting the arms; the ease with which the drill may
 be acquired; the diminished danger in loading; and the possibility of
 the arm being rendered inefficient by the loss of a ramrod.
     It has been said that breech-loaders will entail an excessive
 expenditure of ammunition. But in the first place, we have no grounds
 for supposing that the ammunition expended will be wasted: and a
 similar argument would have held against the supersession of the old
 flint-lock by the percussion cap. If the fire be delivered at such
 ranges that the shots tell, it merely amounts to this, that the work is
 done with the new system so much quicker and more effectually than
 with the old; and experience teaches us that the requisite supply can
 be kept up without difficulty, even in a long hot general action, and
 that this objection has been much overrated. It is stated indeed that
 the greater coolness and confidence of the men tends rather to a less
 expenditure; and the number of rounds fired by any individual
 Prussian soldier in the late campaign, if figures are to be relied upon,
 would seem to favour this view.    The supply of ammunition, whatever
 its expenditure, is, however, only a question of organization; its
 efficient expenditure is a matter of instruction.        •

                    On the Yorkshire Wald Tumult’.
THE object of the discourse was to illustrate the early sepulchral
remains of the Wolds, a district in the East Riding of Yorkshire
singularly compact and self contained. The tract of country is of
moderate elevation, with a surface varied by deep valleys and swelling
and rounded hills, the geological formation being for the most part
the chalk. The valleys are nearly all waterless, and in this and other
respects, as Well as in the numerous signs it presents of early occu
pation, the district possesses a marked similarity to the Wiltshire
Downs. It is surrounded on all sides by <U+FB02>at alluvial land. Wood
was scanty, the prevailing tree being the thorn, here attaining a large
size, whilst considerable tracts were covered by furze and heather.
This dearth of wood was not favourable to the presence of large
quantities of wild animals, which require its shelter for protection,
but that was afforded by the coverts which abounded in the neigh
bouring low-lying and then swampy ground. In the comparative
absence of cultivated crops a population must, in a great measure,
depend upon the chace for its support, and the Wolds might therefore
seem unsuitable for early occupation. They were, however, largely
peopled in pre-historic times, as several facts distinctly show.
Occupation is evidenced by remains of houses, which cannot, however,
lay claim to much architectural skill either as regards convenience or
stability. They were only rude wigwams, formed in two ways, by
raising a conical roof of wood and turf upon a low circular wall, and
by covering in a circular pit, with a similar shaped, or perhaps a <U+FB02>at,
roof. Besides these dwelling-places, there remain some gullets still
uudestroyed by the plough, as well as extensive lines of mounds and
ditches, which seem too large to have been intended for defensive
purposes, though they might serve the end of preventing cattle being
driven off by sudden raids.
    The abundance of the people who were settled in the district is

1867.]               on the Yorkshire Wold Tumuli.                     79
shown, perhaps, most clearly by the number of <U+FB02>int implements which
are found scattered over the surface of the ground. They are there in
thousands —arrow-points, knives, scrapers, and articles of uncertain use.
A common material may in some way explain their frequent occurrence.
Still whatever cause may have made them so abundant, their number
points to a numerous population. Besides objects of <U+FB02>int and other
stone, considerable hoards of bronze swords, spear-heads, gouges, and
celts have been discovered.
    The question who were the people who occupied the Wolds is one
of great interest, and a careful and systematic examination of their
burial mounds will tend to settle it. So far as present researches
show, two distinct races appear to have occupied the district in pre
historic times, and for some part of this period they lived side by side
and intermingled, but at an earlier time it seems almost certain that
only one of these races was living on the Wolds. They may be called
a long-headed (dolicho-cephalic) and a round-headed (brachy-cephalic)
people, the long heads being the earlier.
     Upon the Wolds and in other parts of Yorkshire, but principally
in the south-western counties of England, a peculiar shaped barrow
exists, which is very long in proportion to its breadth, as much as
three to one. They are, for the most part, placed approximately east
and west, and the burials are at the east end, which is broader and
higher than the west. With the primary interments in these barrows
no implements of metal have ever been found, those which occur being
made of <U+FB02>int. There is a remarkable feature in connection with the
interments in the long barrows, and which is quite peculiar to them.
A large number of bodies is sometimes found placed together, and the
condition of the bones of some of them is very peculiar. Whilst one
or more of the bodies have the bones unbroken, and laid in their
natural order and juxtaposition, the greater part have the various
bones scattered about, separated from each other, and broken, and
showing by unmistakable signs that this breakage had taken place at
the time of death. This seems to show that the <U+FB02>esh must have been
removed before the bones were buried ; for if that had not been the
case, the broken pieces of the same bone would have been lying close
together, and not at some distance from each other. These unusual
features appear to point to rites which, if abhorrent to our ideas, have
nevertheless been prevalent in many countries, nor has cannibalism
been so unfrequent that it need be wondered at to <U+FB01>nd evidence of its
having been used in this country. There are historic accounts of the
practice in times much later than when these barrows were erected.
    In the long barrows in Wiltshire and Gloucestershire the bodies
have been buried unburnt; on the Wolds the intention was to burn
them, though that had not perfectly succeeded in every case. The
way in which the burning had taken place was peculiar. Upon the
bodies, whole and broken up, chalk rubble and <U+FB02>int had been placed,
over this was piled wood, which had then been <U+FB01>red, and so the bodies
were consumed by the ignited lime.

  80                    7     Rev. W. Greenwell                 [March 8,
      The skulls of the bodies found in the long barrows are dolicho
  cephalic, and they differ in other respects than in length from the
  brachy-cephalic skull, which is that ordinarily found in the round
  barrows of the bronze age. They appear to have been neither a tall
  nor strong race, and were the earliest inhabitants of the Wolds whose
  sepulchres have been preserved to us, as is shown by their ignorance
  of metal, which was known to the people of the round barrows. They
  present some similarity with long-headed tribes in Spain and the
   North of Africa. But the great ‘rarity of these long barrows on the
  Wolds point to a very scanty population.
      The round barrows, which generally occur on the high ground,
  are however numerous. They average 50 or 60 ft. in diameter and 4
  or 5 in height; yet when we consider the length of time the Wolds
  were occupied by the brachy-cephalic race, we can hardly suppose
  that any but the chiefs and their families, and perhaps captives slain
  at the funeral, were buried in them, even when we; take into account
  that the same mound often serves for several interments. Occasionally
  we <U+FB01>nd a mound containing only the body of a child, probably the
  favourite child of the chief. Many persons of distinction in the tribe
  were buried separately, without mounds, but covered by large slabs of
  stone. These graves are not noticed so frequently on the Wolds, on
  account of the absence of large stones. The ordinary dead were
  buried together in large numbers, as has been found in making railway
I cuttings. In these cases no objects appear to have been interred with
  the bodies, as in the mounds. On the Wiltshire Downs barrows are
  often surrounded by a ring of earth and stones to protect the inter
  ment. This feature has, on the Wolds, been destroyed by cultivation.
  These circles also surround burials with no mound, and have then
  been commonly held to be of Druidical origin, but needlessly. It is
  probable that even Avebury and Stonehenge, which only differ in size
  from these circles, are connected with sepulchral purposes.
      The two modes of burial, cremation and inhumation, prevailed on
  the Wolds as elsewhere. The latter, owing perhaps to the scarcity of
  wood, is the more usual practice; but local and family peculiarities,
  and not differences of rank or sex, seemed to have determined which
  mode should be preferred, as burnt and unburnt bodies were constantly
  buried together at the same time.
      When the body was buried unburnt, it seems to have been dressed
  in its ordinary clothing, and always in a contracted position, the knees
  being drawn up towards the chin ; sometimes it was probably swathed
  like a Peruvian mummy. It was laid on the side. I have never seen
  it placed in a sitting position. When stone could be procured it was
  surrounded with a cist; if not, it was simply placed in the material
  of the barrow or in a grave sunk below the surface, and very rarely in
  a split and hollowed tree. In the case of cremation, the body was
  placed on a pile of wood and consumed with various degrees of com
  pleteness. The burnt bones are generally removed from the place of
  burning and enclosed in an urn or small cist, or simply laid on the

1867                  on the Yorkshire Wold Tumul'i.                  81
ground. Secondary interments occur above the primary and round
the sides of the barrow, though seldom on the north and west.
Various implements are often found close to the bodies. In one
barrow, about 50 ft. in diameter, there‘ were found unburnt six grown
up bodies and six children. It may be noticed that the teeth, though
much worn by hard food, show little marks of decay.
    The pieces of animal bones which frequently occur in barrows are
remains of the funeral feast, and were broken to get at the marrow.
The occurrence of sherds of pottery and <U+FB02>int chippings, which seem
to have been thrown in indiscriminately, is difficult to account for.
From a curious passage in ‘ Hamlet’ it appears that “ shards, <U+FB02>ints, and
pebbles” were thrown on the corpse of a suicide. It is possible that
this sacred Pagan rite was remembered in Christian times, but as- ~
sociated with what was irreligious and profane, as pious rites in one
religion are often accounted accursed in a new one.
    Occasionally, the <U+FB01>rst interment is disturbed by a subsequent one.
Probably this only took place when the family or tribe to which the
<U+FB01>rst belonged had become extinct, and their burying-place had not
been respected by their successors. Even the bodies contained in the
<U+FB01>rst grave have been sometimes broken in digging a place for the
second interment.
    Burnt and unburnt bodies are accompanied by the same imple- =
ments ; but this is not the case with the urns, which are of various
shapes, and placed in various positions with respect to the body they
accompany. They are not sun-baked, but have been exposed to <U+FB01>re.
They are formed by hand, not by the wheel, yet they show great sym
metry, and the material, though varying with the different localities,
is often well tempered, but not glazed.
    The numerous variations in the shape of those found with unburnt
bodies resolve themselves into two types, to which the names of “ food
vessel” and “ drinking-cup ” have been given. The <U+FB01>rst class is like
a <U+FB02>ower-pot, but more globular, often with a series of projecting knobs
round the neck, which in the earlier specimens probably was useful
for hanging them up. They vary in height from 4 inches to 7. The
“ drinking-cups " are larger, and of <U+FB01>ner clay and more elegant shape,
being taller and more swelling in outline. The ornamentation on
both kinds of vessel is profuse and varied, consisting mostly of com
binations of short lines, made by a twisted thong or by a pointed
instrument. a
    It is probable that, as has been generally believed, these vessels
were for the purpose of holding food for the dead. The custom of the
American Indians a<U+FB01>'ords an analogy.
    Enclosing or accompanying the remains of burnt bodies we <U+FB01>nd
urns of a much larger size—sometimes exceeding 2 feet in height
and coarser material and workmanship. They have an overhanging
rim, and the ornamentation is continued but ‘little below it. They
are as often found reversed over the bones as upright. With them
often occurs a small vessel, like a saltcellar, and not unfrequently

pierced, known as an “incense cup.” Other types of vessels are also
occasionally found, but none contain the burnt bones except the
cinerary urn; the others may possibly have contained food. But
all the vessels described were, I believe, especially made for sepulchral
use, as they are too imperfectly baked to be used as domestic vessels,
from which, too, they greatly differ in appearance.
    N0 rule can be laid down as to the occurrence of weapons and
implements with bodies, burnt or unburnt. Often none at all are
found; at other times several. With the bodies of men occur axes,
spear and arrow heads, knives, and scrapers, all of <U+FB02>int, bone pins and
jet buttons, bronze daggers, pins, and, very rarely, simple axes ; with
those of women, stone rubbers or corncrushers, <U+FB02>int knives and scrapers,
jet or amber necklaces, buttons, pins, and bronze awls. When crema
tion has been used, implements were sometimes burnt with the bones;
and sometimes placed with the ashes afterwards.
     Neither bronze swords nor socketed celts are ever found with
interments ; indeed any bronze articles are very rare. This does not
arise from that metal being unknown, as the round barrows, I believe,
are later than its introduction ; but it was for long only used for the
more important articles; the commoner ones, and those which, like
arrow-heads, were thrown away, being still made of <U+FB02>int. The poor
had probably no implements of bronze. The scarcity of bronze with
interments, then, is explained by its liability to decay, by its being, like
gold, too valuable to place with the dead, and by the fact that it was
not the material of which such objects were made as were habitually
placed in the grave.
    It has been generally held that the depositing with the dead the
implements, &c., which they used while alive, implied a belief in
another state of existence : without disputing this view, it may be
observed that the affectionate and pious feeling of the relatives might
be enough to account for the custom; and also that the articles found
with the bodies were mostly attached to the dress, or else were such
weapons, ornaments, &c., as could hardly be used by others without
disrespect to the memory of the deceased ; while if they were intended
for use in a future state, it seems strange that the majority of the dead
should be interred without anything of the kind.
    From the broken bones found in the barrows we infer that the
B05 longifrons, the roe and red deer, the wild swine and the goat
were among the animals used for food, but neither the sheep nor the
dog has been discovered on the Wolds.
    In the round barrows we <U+FB01>nd both the long-headed race of the long
barrows, and the later perfectly distinct round-headed type, which is
far the more frequent, besides one which may have sprung from the
union of the two. The earlier race, though perhaps conquered,
would not be destroyed, and in time must have become one with the
intruders, who were a larger and stronger people, and acquainted with
the use of bronze. They were harsh and rugged in the face, with all
the features prominent, and the mouth and eyebrows projecting. The

 head was broad, especially behind, with a remarkably <U+FB02>at occiput,
 a part which in the long—headed race was remarkably prominent.
      The long-headed race appears to have a<U+FB02>‘inities with the south, and
  the round-headed with the north; the latter approach in type of skull
  to that of the people of the stone age, who buried in the barrows of
  Denmark, and may have been allied to the Laps. But the question is
  too wide for this discourse.
      The Wold people have been spoken of as living before the Roman
 conquest; but this view has been opposed by some, especially by Mr.
  Thomas Wright, who place them at a time when the Romans had left
 Britain. But from Caesar and other sources we learn that the offen
 sive arms of the Britons at the time of the Roman invasion were made
 of iron. Yet no trace of this metal has been found in the Wold
 barrows.     And neither in these, nor in those of the same class in
 other parts of England, has any article showing the least trace of
 Roman in<U+FB02>uence been found. All their weapons, implements, &c.,
 are as different as possible from corresponding ones of Roman manu
 facture, both in shape, material, and workmanship. Is it possible
 that several centuries of the imperial rule could have had no in<U+FB02>uence
 in this respect ? For the Wolds were in the vicinity of <U+FB02>ourishing
 Roman towns.
      We can, however, come to only an approximate date for these
 barrows. But taking all the circumstances into consideration, we
 cannot place them later than a hundred years before Caesar’s landing,
 and probably the greater part of them belong to a time very much
 earlier, when bronze, though known, was scarce.           More extended
 researches will enable us to come to a more certain      conclusion. In
 the meantime it is safer not to lay down any speci<U+FB01>c     date, but to say,
 what we can with con<U+FB01>dence do, that they belong          to a time which
 ends a century or two before the occupation of            Britain by the
 Romans.

             On Traces of the Early Mental Condition of Man.
Ir an antiquary is asked his opinion as to the early condition of man
kind, he will probably take up the question with reference to an
excellent test of man’s civilization, the quality of the tools and weapons
                                                                 e 2'

he uses. He will show how, within our own knowledge, the use of
metal instruments has succeeded the use of sharpened stones, or shells,
or bones; how the stone axes and arrow-heads found buried in the
ground prove that in every great district of the world a Stone Age has
prevailed at some more or less remote period; and lastly, how recent
geological researches have displayed to us the traces of a Stone Age
extraordinarily low and rude in character, and belonging to a time as
extraordinarily remote in antiquity. The history of man, as thus told
by a study of the implements he has used, is the history of an upward
development, not indeed a gradual steady progress of each family or
tribe, but a general succession of higher processes to lower ones.
     Now there also exists evidence, by means of which it is possible
still to trace, in the history of man’s mental condition, an upward pro
 gress, a succession of higher intellectual processes and opinions to
 lower ones. This movement has accompanied his progress in the
material arts during a long but unde<U+FB01>ned period of his life upon
 the earth; and of this evidence, and of the lines of argument that may
 be drawn through it, the object of the present discourse is to give a
 few illustrative examples.
     I. In the <U+FB01>rst place, the art of counting may be examined from this
point of View. We ourselves learnt to count when we were children,
by the aid of a series of words, one, two, three, four, and so on, which
we were taught to associate with certain numbers, 1, 2, 3, 4, and can
 thus reckon up to the largest imaginable number, and down to the
 smallest imaginable fraction. But if we look round among other
 tribes of men we <U+FB01>nd a very different state of things. As we go lower
 in the scale of civilization, it becomes easier and easier to puzzle a
 man with the counting of 20 objects, or even of 10, and to drive him
 to the use of nature’s counting-machine, his <U+FB01>ngers. When we
 reach the low level of the savages of the Brazilian forests or of Au
 stralia, we <U+FB01>nd people to whom 3 or 4 are large numbers. One tribe,
 described by Mr. Old<U+FB01>eld, reckoned one, two, and then bool-tha,
 “many; ” but when their poor word-language fails them they fall
 back on gesture-reckoning. Mr. Old<U+FB01>eld tells us, for instance, how he
 got from a native the number of men killed in a certain <U+FB01>ght. The
 man began to think over the names, taking a <U+FB01>nger for each, and thus
 after many unsuccessful trials, he at last brought out the result by
 holding up his hand 3 times, to show that the number was 15.
     Now our words one, two, three, four, &c., have no etymology to us,
 but among a large proportion of the lower races numerals have a
 meaning; as among many tribes of North and South America and
 West Africa are found such expressions as, for 5, “a whole hand,”
 and for 6, “ one to the other hand,” 10, “ both hands,” and 11, “ one
 to the foot; ” 20, “one Indian,” and 21, “one to the hands of the
 other Indian; ” or for 11, “foot 1,” for 12, “foot 2;” for 20, “a
 person is <U+FB01>nished ; ” whilst among the miserable natives of Van Die
 men’s Land, the reckoning of a. single band, viz. 5, is called puganna,
 “ a man.”

    1867.]             of the Early Mental Condition of Man.                  85
         For displaying to us the picture of the savage counting on his
    <U+FB01>ngers, and being struck with the idea that if he describes in words
    his gestures of reckoning, these words will become a numeral, perhaps
    no language approaches the Zulu. Counting on his <U+FB01>ngers, he begins
    always with the little <U+FB01>nger of his left hand, and thus reaching 5, he
    calls it “ a whole hand ; ” for 6, he translates the appropriate gesture,
    calling it tatisitupa, “take the thumb ; ” while 7, being shown in gesture
    by the fore<U+FB01>nger, and this <U+FB01>nger being used to point with, the verb
    komba, “ to point,” comes to serve as a numeral expression, denoting 7.
         Now, though many numerals, especially <U+FB01>ves, tens, and twenties
    were named from the <U+FB01>ngers, hands, and feet, this is far from being
    the only source of numerals. Many centuries ago, the Hindu scholars,
    besides their regular series, made a new set of words 'to serve as a sort
    of memorial techm'ca for remembering dates, &c. Thus, for 1 they said
    “ earth” or “ moon ,- ” for 2, “ eye,” or “arm,” or “ wing ,' ” for 3,
   “ Rama,” or “<U+FB01>re,” or “quality:”—there being considered to be 3
    Ramas, 3 kinds of <U+FB01>re, 3 gunas or qualities; for 4, “ age” or “'ueda,”
   because there are 4 ages and 4 vedas.        One line of an astronomical
   formula will show the working of the system :

        When Wilhelm von Humboldt, more than thirty years ago, looked
   into this arti<U+FB01>cial system of numeration, it struck him that he had before
   him a key to the general formation of numerals. When a. Malay, he
   said, calls 5, lima, that is, “hand,” he is doing the same thing that
   the Hindu pandits did when they took “ wing ” as a numeral for 2 ; and
   then, he suggested, the numeral words having thus been once made, the
   sooner their original meaning was got rid of and they were reduced
   to the appearance of mere unmeaning symbols, the better it would be
i for            forwarduseininsupport
       their practical
   be brought                    language. Now a number
                                       of Humboldt’s       of actualsuggestion.
                                                                      facts may
                                                       far-sighted
   The Abipones of South America counted to 3, and for 4, said “ostrich
   toes,” from the division of their ostrich’s feet; then for 5, “ one-hand ;”
   for 10, “ two-hands ;” and so on. In Polynesia there is a regular set
   of decimal numerals, but sometimes, for superstitious reasons, they
   turn words out of their language for a time, and have to use fresh ones.
   Thus, in Tahiti, they ejected rua, 2, and rima, 5 ; and in a missionary
   translation of the Bible we <U+FB01>nd Pitt and pae instead ; now piti, the
   new word for 2, means “ together,” and pae, the new word for 5, means
   “ side.”
        In other South Sea islands, the habit of counting <U+FB01>sh or fruit one in
   each hand has led to ta'ema, “ a pair,” becoming a numeral equivalent for
   2; the habit of tying bread-fruit in knots of 4 has made anew numeral
  part0, “ a knot,” while other terms for 10 and 100 have had their origin
  from words meaning “ bunch ” and “bundle.” And so, even in
  European languages, numeral words break out from time to time,

86                      Mr. E. B. Tylor on Traces             [March 15,
ready to become proper numbers, should a vacancy be made for them I
in the now meaningless series one, two, three, four.    Thus in English
we have pair or couple for 2, and score, that is “notch,” for 20.    The
Letts count crabs and little <U+FB01>sh by throwing them 3 at a time, and
thus the word mettens, “ a throw,” has come to mean 3, and so in many
other cases in other languages.
     Now when tribes count by saying hand for 5, take the thumb for 6,
half a man for 10, and so on, it is evident that the basis of their nu
meration is <U+FB01>nger-counting. But there is also evidence in the systems of
numeration of most civilized languages that they, too, are the successors
of a rude unspoken system of gesture counting. The rule of the whole
world is to count by <U+FB01>ves, tens, and twenties; the exceptions are so late
 or so incidental that we may neglect them and say that the original
counting of mankind is the quinary, the decimal, or the vigesimal
 system, or a combination of these. We need not go abroad for
 examples. In the Roman numerals, which count to V, and then begin
 again VI, VII, we have the quinary system. The decimal system is
 our familiar one.      And when we speak of “ threescore and ten,”
 “ fourscore and thirteen,” we are counting by the vigesimal system,
 each “ score” or notch, thus ideally made, standing for 20, for “one
 man,” as a Mexican or Carib would put it. It is a very curious thing
 that both we and the French, having two good decimal systems of our
 own, should have run off into vigesimalism. Why should we have ever
 said “fourscore and thirteen ” for the 93, which we have good Saxon
tens to express? and why should they say in France, “ quatre-vingt
 treize,” instead of holding to the Latin original of their language, and
 saying “nonante-trois? ” The reason seems to be that counting by
 scores is a strongly marked Keltic characteristic, found in Welsh, Irish,
 Gaelic, and Breton, and has been taken up into the alien numeral
 systems of France and England. At any rate, the rule of the world is
 to count by <U+FB01>ves, tons, and twenties; and the connection of this rule
 with the practice of counting on the <U+FB01>ngers and toes will hardly be
 disputed. Indeed the remark has often been made that the fact of our
 having 10 <U+FB01>ngers and 10 toes has led us into a system which is actually
 not the best; while if we had had 6 <U+FB01>ngers on each hand, and 6 toes
 on each the
 penter,   foot,
              more
                 we convenient
                    should probably    of duodecimals.
                               systemhave   taken to using, like the car—
     These are examples of the facts which tend to show that man's
 early way of counting was upon ‘his <U+FB01>ngers; as Massieu, the Abbé
 Sicard’s celebrated deaf and dumb pupil, records in describing his
 recollections of his yet uneducated childhood : “ I knew the numbers
 before my instruction; my <U+FB01>ngers had taught me them. I did not
 know the ciphers. I counted on my <U+FB01>ngers.” Among the lower races,
 the use of word-language has only to a small extent encroached
 upon gesture-language in counting ; among races above these, numeral
 words are more largely used, but preserve evident traces of a growth
 out of gesture-counting; while among the higher peoples, though
 language gives little trace of the original signi<U+FB01>cation of numerals,

1867.]           of the Early Mental Condition of Man.                  87
there still prevails the system of counting by <U+FB01>ves, tens, and twenties,
of which we can hardly doubt that the norm is given by the arrangement
of the <U+FB01>ngers and toes. Thus it appears that in the mental history of
mankind we may see back to a condition so much lower than our own,
that the numerals, which we look upon as so settled a part of speech
that We use them as one of the <U+FB01>rst tests of the common derivation of
languages, were still unspoken, and their purpose was served by the
ruder, visible signs ‘which belong to the department of gesture.
    II. The next argument to be brought forward belongs to a very
different province of thought, and touches on the early opinions of
mankind as to the nature and habits of spiritual beings. It is well
known that the lower races of mankind account for the facts and
events of the outer world by ascribing a sort of human life and person
ality to animals, and even to plants, rocks, streams, winds, the sun
and stars, and so on through the phenomena of nature. It is also
known that a low stratum of the religion of the world consists in
belief in, and adoration of, spiritual beings who inhabit the winds
and trees and streams, who preside over the ripening of fruits and the
falling of rain, give success in war, or in<U+FB02>ict disease or misfortune on
the savage hunter. Thus the Mintira, a low tribe on the Malayan
peninsula, ascribe every ailment that happens to them to a spirit or
hantu. One causes smallpox, another brings swelling and in<U+FB02>ammation
in hands and feet, another causes the blood to <U+FB02>ow from wounds ; indeed,
to enumerate all these hantus would be to give a list of all their known
ailments. The worship of such spirits, found among the lower races
over almost the whole world, is commonly known as “ fetichism.”         It
is clear that this childlike theory of the animation of all nature lies at
the root of what we call Mythology ; if the sun and moon are described
as semi-human beings, called by‘the Greeks, Helios and Selene, by the
Esquimaux, Anninga and Malina, this personi<U+FB01>cation is founded on
an original opinion still found in lively existence in the world, that
the sun and moon are living Anthropomorphic creatures. It would
probably add to the clearness of our conception of the state of mind
which thus sees in all nature the action of animated life and the pre
sence of innumerable spiritual beings, if we gave it the name of
Animism instead of Fetichism. Now by examining a single phase of
this Animism, it seems possible to give some idea how generally man
in his lowest known state of culture is a wonderfully ignorant, con
sistent, and natural spiritualist ; and also how the effects of his early
spiritualism may be traced through the development of more cultured
races in proceedings which have often changed their meaning, and
lost their original consistency by the encroachment of more real
knowledge.
    We all know how deep and sincere is the terror of ghosts among
savages. It is often no exaggeration to say that they are in more
deadly fear of a man after he is dead than while he is alive. The
savage’s notion of a ghost corresponds very nearly with that of the
English peasant in our own day-—it is a thin phantom going from

88                      Mr. E. B. Tylor on Traces             [March 15,
place to place, like the person it belonged to, when it does appear, but
 often invisible, though capable of knocking and uttering sounds. The
notion of the ghost runs almost inextricably into that of the spirit or
soul, of the breath and the blood, and of those unsubstantial some
 things which follow the man and are like him, his shadow and his re<U+FB02>ec
tion in the water. Now it is consistent with this opinion of ghosts to
hold that by killing a man you can release his ghost and send it where
you will. This is what the king of Dahome does when he sends men
day after day to take messages to his father in the land of shadows.
The Getae, according to Herodotus, sent a man every <U+FB01>ve years to their
god Zamolxis, giving him their messages, and then throwing him up
and catching him on their spears. Thus in British India, some eighty
years ago, it is on record that two Brahmans, believing that a man
had taken forty rupees out of their house, took their own mother and
cut her head off, that her ghost might torment and pursue to death the
offender and his family—the old woman being herself a consenting
party to the transaction. This is not an isolated case, but one belong
ing to a recognized Hindu practice.
     In perfect accordance with this opinion we <U+FB01>nd in almost every
country in the world, at some time or other, the practice of slaying
men and women at the graves of the dead. In one of the South Sea
Islands a cord is put round the wife’s neck at her marriage, and when
her husband dies it will be tightened, to release her soul, that it may
accompany his to the land of shadows, and continue to catch <U+FB01>sh and
cook yams for him there. The Dyaks of Borneo have a passion for
waylaying their enemies and bringing home their heads; as they told
Mr. St. John, “the white men read books, we hunt for heads instead.”
They do this to secure the services of a slave in the next world. These
practices are the consistent working out of a spiritualistic theory,
which, if crude and false, is at any rate intelligible. To some extent
the same may be said, when not only the dead man’s wives and slaves
but his dogs and horses are killed, and buried or burnt at his grave.
The man’s ghost is to ride the horse’s ghost in the land of shadows,
and the dog’s ghost will run on before after ghostly game ; or, as in
Mexico, the dog was to carry the man across the river which lies
between the world of the- living and the world of the dead; while in
Greenland, a dog’s head was placed by the grave of a little child, that
the soul of the dog, who ever knows his way home, might guide the
helpless infant to the land of spirits.
    But when not only men and animals but inanimate objects are
buried or burnt for the dead, what does this mean?      When the hunt
ing tribes of North America provide the dead man with his favourite
horse, and at the same time with his bow and arrows ; while the <U+FB01>shing
tribes bury the dead man in his canoe, with the paddle and the <U+FB01>sh
spear ready to his hand, what di<U+FB02>'erence can we discern between the
purpose of the animate and of the inanimate o<U+FB01>'erings, which alike
are to serve the spirit of their owner ? When the dead chief ’s wives
and his slaves, his horses, his weapons, his clothes and ornaments, are

1867.]              of the Early Mental Condition of Man.                       89
indiscriminately buried with him ; when food is put in the grave with
the dead man and fresh supplies brought every month; when the little
child is provided with its rattle and playthings, and the dead warrior
has the ceremonial pipe put in his hand, that he may hold it out as
a symbol of peace when he comes to the other world, while a store of
paint is buried with him that he may appear decently among his brother
warriors; in these and hundreds of other instances, the spirit of the
dead man is to use the spirits alike of men and animals, and of weapons,
clothes, and food. Then we should expect savages to be found recog
nizing the existence of something of the nature of a spirit or ghost
belonging to inanimate objects; and this in fact they do.* The exist
ence of the Fijian opinion is well authenticated, that lifeless objects
have spirits, and that the souls of canoes, houses, plants, broken pots,
and weapons, may be seen <U+FB02>oating down the river of death into the
land of souls: and crossing into North America, we <U+FB01>nd the same idea,
not only that souls are like shadows, and that everything is animate in
the universe, but that the souls of hatchets, kettles, and such like
things, as well as of men and animals, have to pass across the water
which lies between their home in this life and the Great Village where
the sun sets in the far West. We must not expect the spirits of spears
and kettles to have the same distinetness and vitality in savage phi
losophy as the spirits of men and horses. Inanimate objects want those
signs of life that are given to men and animals by the breath, the
blood, the independenceof voluntary action; but at any rate they
have shadows, as in the New Zealand tale of Te Kauawa, who o<U+FB02>'ered
the fairies his neck ornament and ear-rings; they took the shadows
of them, but the substance they left behind. They have also that pro
perty, which in the mind of the savage has so much to do with de<U+FB01>n
ing the nature of ghosts—their impalpable phantoms can and do
appear far away from where their real substance is, in the dreams and
hallucinations which savages look on as real events. When we meet
with notions of apparitions among more civilized people, it seems that
they hold a theory inherited from the full Animism of the lower races,
but much damaged in its consistency by the interference of a better
knowledge of facts. When the ghost of Hamlet’s father appeared, he
“wore his beaver up.” What beaver? To a European believer in
ghosts, it would seem foolish to talk of the ghost of a helmet; but to a
North American Indian it is quite reasonable that a helmet should
have a ghost as well as the warrior who puts it on his ghostly head.
The opinion of the European ghost-seer is no doubt the more scienti<U+FB01>c,
the more affected by knowledge of the facts of nature; but the broader
spiritualism of the savage is more full, more thoroughly consistent,
because, as there is much reason to think, it is nearer to its source.
    * The speaker mentioned that he had just found in the works of an American
writer, Mr. Alger, independent con<U+FB01>rmation of the view he had taken of the
savage theory of spirits, as including speetres of inanimate as well as of animate
objects.

9O                   '   Mr. E. B. Tyler o'n Traces            [March 15,
    A slight acquaintance with the spiritualism of the savage has
sometimes led to its being considered as the result of a degeneration
from the opinions of more cultured races ; but more complete know
ledge of the facts tends to show that such an opinion inverts the real
history of events. The way in which the fullest and most consistent
theory of ghosts is at home among savage tribes is well shown by the
belief that the spirit arrives in the next world, whole or mutilated,
according to the condition of the body at death. For instance, there
is an Australian tribe who believe that if a man be left unburied, his
soul becomes a wandering ghost. If one of their warriors kills his
enemy, he is sometimes embarrassed with the dif<U+FB01>eulty that by so
doing he is setting free a hostile ghost to vex his own people, and
therefore he resorts to the device of cutting off the dead man’s right
thumb, so that the ghost can no longer throw his spear, and may be
safely left to wander as an evil spirit, malignant but harmless. The
history of the very funeral offerings just spoken of shows in the most
interesting way the progress of a ceremony from its source in a crude
and savage philosophy to its gradual breaking-down into mere
formality and symbolism. To the Aryan of the Vedas it was quite
reasonable to burn the priestly sacri<U+FB01>cial implements with the dead
man’s body, for his use in the next world; but the modern Hindu lays
one thread of woollen yarn on the funeral cake of his father, saying,
“May this apparel, made of woollen yarn, be acceptable to thee!”
\Ve may learn from Ovid how the offerings of food to the dead, in
ruder times a thorough practical savage proceeding, had in his time
dwindled to a mere affectionate, sentimental ceremony. Garlands,
he says, and some scattered corn and grains of salt, and bread
steeped in wine, and violets laid about: with these the shade may
be appeased. “Little the manes ask, the pious thought stands in
stead of the rich gift, for Styx holds no greedy gods.”
              “ Parva petunt manes-pietas pro divite grata est
                  Munere.  Non avidos Styx habet ima duos.”
     We may see how the early Christians kept up the heathen custom
of burying ornaments with the dead, of putting playthings in a child's
‘grave, doing just what a red Indian squaw will do, but doing it with
how changed a purpose. The Chinese keeps up the time-honoured
custom of providing the dead with clothes and money; but the money
that he will palm olf on his dead father is a pasteboard coin stamped
like a Spanish dollar and covered with silver—leaf ; this he will burn,
and his father will have the spirit of it to spend in the next world.
The same Chinese will yearly spread a feast for the souls of his dead
ancestors ; he and his friends will wait a decent while for the ghosts
to eat the spirits of the food, and then they will fall to themselves.
To see the same thing done nearer home, you have only to travel into
Brittany, where on the night of the Fete des Morts you will <U+FB01>nd the
<U+FB01>re made up and the hearth swept, and the supper left on the table
for the souls of the derd to come and take their part. And when we

  1867.]             of the Early Mental Condition of Man.               91
  see a wreath of everlastings laid upon a tomb, or a nosegay of fresh
  <U+FB02>owers thrown into an open grave, a full knowledge of the history of
  funeral offerings seems to justify us in believing what we should
  hardly have guessed without it, that even here we see a relic of the
  thoughts of the rudest savages who claim a common humanity with us,
  a funeral offering vastly changed in signi<U+FB01>cation, but nowhere broken
  in historic sequence.
       Lastly. Another subject may be found to throw light upon an early
  condition of men’s minds. We are all agreed that there is a certain
  mental process called the association of ideas. That we are in the habit
  of connecting in our minds different things which have, in actual fact,
  no material connection, we all admit as a matter belonging to this
  association of thoughts or of ideas. Now we have been taught to
  keep an eye on the action of the association of thoughts, to recognize
  it as a fallacious process apt to lead us into all manner of unreasonable
   opinions. But if we descend to a lower range of civilization, we shall
  <U+FB01>nd that the mental association which we tolerate as a sort of amiable
  weakness, and against which we are at any rate forewarned and fore
  armed, is the very philosophy of the savage. There is one particularly
   excellent way of studying the effects of the association of thought. It
   began to produce, in a time associated with a very low human condition,
   a set of opinions and practices known as the occult sciences, witchcraft,
   divination, astrology, and the like. The germs of these imaginary
   sciences are to be ‘found still lively among the lower races. Their
   development into elaborate pseudo-scienti<U+FB01>c systems belongs to a
   period now beginning to pass away; and we can still study them in
   their last stage of existence, that in which their remnants have lingered
   on into a period of higher mental culture, and have become survivals,
   or, as we call them, “ superstitions.” In producing the occult sciences,
   the association of thought works in ways most distinctly recognizable.
   When the Polynesian weather-maker practises on his sacred stone,
   wets it when he wants to produce rain, and puts it to the <U+FB01>re to dry
   when he wants dry weather ; and when in Europe water is poured on
  a stone, or a little 'girl led about and pails of water poured on her that
  rain may in like manner be poured down from the sky, we have prac
  tices resting on the most evident and direct association of thoughts.
       Thus we may see a Zulu busy chewing a bit of wood, and thereby
 performing an ideal operation, softening the heart of another Zulu with
 whom he is going to trade cows, that he may get a better bargain out of
 him, So it is when we <U+FB01>nd lingering in England a practice belonging
 thoroughly to the savage sorcerer, that of making an image representing
an enemy or part of him, and melting 1t, drying it up, .or‘woundrng it,
that the like may happen to the person with whom it is associated.
From time to time there is still found hidden about some country
farm such a, thing a a heart stuck full of pins, the record of some
secret story of attempted magic vengeance.
    In the ancient and still existing art of astrology, we see the some
early delusive association of ideas producing results so perfectly intel

92                      Mr. E. B. Tylor on Traces               [March 15,
ligible to us, that it is really di<U+FB01>icult for educated people to have
patience to study its details. An astrologer will tell us how the planet
Jupiter is connected with persons of a bold, hearty, jovial temperament;
and how the planet Venus has to do with love and marriage; while to
us the whole basis of this theory lies in the accident of the names of
certain gods having been given to certain stars, which are therefore
supposed to have the attributes of these gods. The wonder is not that
much of the magician’s sham science is inexplicable to us, but that the
origin of so many of its details is still evident.
    [An extract from Zadkiel's almanac was here read, with the object
of showing the principle on which the astrologer’s deductions are still
made, the movements of the heavenly bodies being simply taken to
symbolize human action, virtue and good fortune being connected with
the aspects of the Sun and Jupiter (sunny and jovial in<U+FB02>uences), &c.,
the working of the early childlike principle of the association of ideas
being thus traceable through the occult sciences from their rise among
savages to their decay among educated men.]
    By the study of facts like those of which a scanty selection has here
been brought forward, it seems possible to look back to an early condition
of our race much more nearly corresponding with that of existing savages
than with that of the civilized nations even of very ancient times.
We seem to have before us the traces of a state of language so low that
words for counting had not yet arisen in it, but mere gesture-language
served their purpose. It is not meant to imply that we have evidence
of a state of pure gesture-language anterior to any spoken language:
we do not seem to have such evidence, and even among the lower
animals we <U+FB01>nd, in a rudimentary form, expression by action and by
voice going on together. In the working of the minds of these early
tribes, we absence
wonderful           childlike
            trace a of         condition
                       de<U+FB01>nition  between ofpast
                                              thought  in which
                                                  and future,    there fact

and imagination, between last night’s dream and to-day’s waking.
Out of this state of mind we <U+FB01>nd arising all over the world a consistent,
intense, and all-pervading spiritualism to form a basis upon which
higher intellectual stages have been reared. In this low and early
mental state there reigns supreme the faculty of association of thoughts.
Out' of this, when unchecked by experience, arise those delusions
of sorcery which pervade and embitter the whole life of the savage,
and carry a stream of folly far on into the culture of the higher races.
But through age after age there has gone on a slow process of
natural selection, ever tending to thrust aside what is worthless, and
to favour what is strong and sound. Wilhelm von Humboldt, already
once quoted, may serve us again by laying down in few words one of
the great generalizations of our intellectual history. “ Man,” he says,
“ ever seeks the connection, even of external phenomena, <U+FB01>rst in the
realm of thought; . . . . his <U+FB01>rst endeavour is to rule nature
from the idea outward.”
    Now if the result of inquiries like the present were to bring out

more abstract truth, barren of all practical importance-this would
perhaps be the last place where it would be needful to apologize for
the want. But it is to be noticed that they do happen to have this
practical importance. There are certain studies which have entered
upon a thoroughly scienti<U+FB01>c stage, and ask no aid from ethnographic
research; they care nothing for the crude theories of earlier times, but
go directly to their own observed facts by which they must stand or
fall. But there are other studies, of not less importance to us than
Astronomy or Chemistry, which are in a very di<U+FB02>'erent state. In such
especially as relate to man, the operations of his mind, his relations
to the rest of the universe, the past and future condition of his race,
 his ethical and political rights and duties-in all these complex
 and dii<U+FB01>cult problems we <U+FB01>nd established side by side sources of
opinion of very di<U+FB02>'erent value. Some opinions come to us authorized
 by the best of evidence, and when put to the test of reason and ex
perience the trial proves their soundness. Others again, though
founded on some crude theory of less educated times, have been so
 altered in their scope and meaning by the lessons of experience, as
 to be on the whole the best known, representatives of facts, and by
 this not unsatisfactory title they hold their ground. Others, lastly,
may arise out of opinions belonging to a low stage of culture, and
maintain their place, not because they are proved to be true or useful,
but simply because they have been inherited from long past genera
 tions. Now it is one duty of ethnographic research to follow up these
 lines of thought, to mark out, among existing opinions, which are
 old notions kept up in a modi<U+FB01>ed condition to answer a more modern
 purpose; in what cases a growing knowledge goes about with the re
mains of the old philosophy which once clothed it, now hanging in
 strips and tatters about its back; in what case opinions belonging to
 a low and early mental state survive into the midst of a higher culture,
pretending to be knowledge, and being really superstition. Thus the
study of the lower races has a work to do in facilitating the intellectual
progress of the higher, by clearing the ground, and leaving the way
open for the induction of general laws and their correction by the
systematic observation of facts, to the results of which method alone
We may <U+FB01>tly give the name of Science.                          B. T.]

         ASSISTANT CURATOR OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS OF ENGLAND MUSEUM.
       On the Various Modes of Flight in relation to Aeronautics.
 THE subject of flight, natural and artificial, is one which has occupied
 the attention of mankind from a very early period.
     It involves a more or less intimate acquaintance with Anatomy,
 Physiology, Mechanics, and the higher branches of Mathematics.
     If regarded as a natural movement, it forms one of the three
 kinds of locomotion by which animals progress—the remaining two
being walking and swimming; if regarded as an artificial one, it repre
sents the unsolved problem of that grand trio which has for its integral
parts the locomotive, steamboat, and flying-machine. Had time per
mitted, it was my intention to have gone into the subject of locomotion
at length. I find, however, I must curtail my remarks under this
head, which I do with reluctance, from a feeling that the chain of
animal movements, like the great chain of existence, winds in and out
and doubles upon itself so completely, as to render a partial examina
tion of it in many respects unsatisfactory.
    The movements of animals are adapted either to the earth, the
water, or the air. There are others, however, of a mixed character,
where they are suited equally to the land and water, or even to the
land, water, and air.
    The instruments by which locomotion is attained are therefore
specially modified.
    This is necessary because of the different densities and the different
degrees of resistance furnished by the land, water, and air respec
tively.
    '.  the earth affords a greater amount of support than the water,
and the water than the air, it requires a greater degree of muscular
exertion to swim than to walk, and a still greater one to fly.
    For this reason flight is the most laborious, and in some respects
the most complicated and difficult, of all the animal movements.
    The peculiarities of the different media, as far as locomotion is
concerned, may be briefly stated.

1867.]       Various Modes of Flight in relation to Aeronautics.          95
    On the land we have the maximum of resistance and the minimum
of displacement.
    In the air, the minimum of resistance and the maximum of dis
placement.
    The water is intermediate in these respects.
    As a consequence, the feet of land animals are small—their bodies
large. The horse and deer furnish examples.
    In those land animals which take to the water occasionally, or the
reverse, the feet are enlarged and usually provided with a membraneous
expansion between the toes. Of such, the otter, ornithorhynchus,
seal, frog, turtle, and crocodile may be cited.
    In addition to the land animals which run and swim, there are
some which precipitate themselves, parachute fashion, from immense
heights, and others which even fly. In these the membraneous expan
sions are greatly increased—the ribs affording the necessary degree of
support in the dragon or flying lizard, the anterior and posterior
extremities in the flying lemur, flying cat, and bat.
    Although no lizard is at present known to fly, there can be little
doubt that the extinct pterodactyles, which are intermediate between
the lizards and crocodiles, were possessed of this power.
    The bat is interesting as being the only mammal at present enjoy
ing the privilege of flight; it is likewise instructive, as showing that
flight may be attained without the aid of hollow bones and air-sacs, by
purely muscular efforts and by the mere contraction and dilatation of
a continuous membrane.
    If we now direct our attention to the water we find that the
amount of surface engaged in locomotion greatly exceeds that in the
amphibia.     The fish furnishes the best example.
    In it the lower half of the body and the broadly-expanded tail are
applied to the water very much as an oar is in sculling. The sea-mam
mals, as the whale, dugong, manatee, and porpoise, swim in precisely
the same manner as the fish, with this difference that the tail strikes
from above downwards, or vertically instead of horizontally, or from
side to side. The seal is exceptional in this respect.
    The animals which furnish the connecting link between the water
and the air are the flying fishes on the one hand, and the diving birds
on the other: the former sustaining themselves for considerable inter
vals in the air by means of their enormous pectoral fins, the latter
using their wings for flying above and beneath the water, as occasion
demands.
    I have carefully examined the relations, structure, and action of the
fins in the flying-fish, and am of opinion that they act as true pinions;
their inadequate dimensions only preventing them from sustaining the
fish for an indefinite period in the air, at all events so long as they
remain moist. They operate upon the air from beneath, after the
manner of a kite or spiralifer, and in so doing, lever the animal upwards
and forwards.
    If they did not act as true pinions within certain limits it is difficult

 96                      Dr. J. B. Pettigrew on the            [March 22,
 and indeed impossible to understand how such small creatures could
 obtain the momentum necessary to project them a distance of 200 or
 more yards, and that sometimes at an elevation of 20 feet above the water.
     In birds which <U+FB02>y indiscriminately above and beneath the water
 the wing is generally provided with sti<U+FB01>'er feathers than usual, and
 reduced to a minimum as regards size. In subaqueous <U+FB02>ight the wings
 may act by themselves, as in the guillemots, or in conjunction with
 the feet, as in the grebes; but in either case it is the back or convex
 surface of the wing which gives the e<U+FB02>‘ective stroke, the wing in such
 birds as the great auk, which are incapable of <U+FB02>ight, being for this
 purpose twisted completely round, in order that its concave surface
 which takes a better hold of the water may be directed backwards.
     The wing therefore operates very differently in and out of the
water.
     In the water it acts as an auxiliary of the foot, and both strike
backwards and downwards.
     In the air, on the contrary, it strikes downwards and forwards, and
this is a point deserving of attention, as showing that the oblique
surfaces presented by animals to the water and air are made to act in
opposite directions. This is owing to the greater density of the water
as compared with the air ; the former supporting or nearly support
ing the animal acting upon it; the latter permitting the animal to
fall through it in a downward direction.
     But to come to the subject more particularly in hand, viz. :
     Flight in its relation to Aer0nautics.-The atmosphere, because of
its great tenuity, mobility, and comparative imponderability, presents
little resistance to bodies passing through it at low velocity. If, how
ever, the speed be greatly increased, the action of even an ordinary
cane is sufficient to elicit a recoil.
     This comes of the action and reaction of matter, the resistance
experienced varying according to the density of the atmosphere and
the shape, extent, and velocity of the body acting upon it. While,
therefore, almost no impediment is offered to the progress of an animal
in motion, it is often exceedingly di<U+FB02>icult to compress the air with
su<U+FB01>icient rapidity and energy to convert it into a suitable fulcrum for
securing the onward impetus. This arises from the fact that bodies
moving in this medium experience the minimum of resistance and
occasion the maximum of displacement. Another and very obvious
di<U+FB01>‘leulty is traceable to the great disparity in the weight of air as
compared with any known solid (this in the case of water being nearly
as 1000 to l), and the consequent want of buoying or sustaining power
which that disparity necessitates. To meet these peculiarities the
insect and bird are furnished with extensive surfaces in the shape of
pinions or wings, which they can apply with singular velocity and
power at various angles, or by alternate slow and sudden movements,
to obtain the necessary degree of resistance and non-resistance. Their
bodies, moreover, are constructed on strictly mechanical principles:
lightness, strength, and durability of frame; and power, rapidity and

precision of action, being indispensable. The cylindrical method of
construction is consequently carried to an extreme; the bodies and
legs of insects displaying numerous unoccupied spaces, while the
muscles and solid parts are tunnelled in every direction by innumer
able air-tubes which communicate with the surrounding medium by
a series of apertures termed spiracles.
    A somewhat similar disposition of parts is met with in birds, these
being in many cases furnished not only with hollow bones, but also
(especially the aquatic ones) with a liberal supply of air-sacs. They
are also provided with a dense covering of feathers or down, which
adds greatly to their bulk without materially increasing their weight.
The air-sacs are well seen in the swan, goose, and duck; and I have
in several instances carefully examined them with a view to deter
mining their extent and function. They appear to me to be connected
with the function of respiration, a view advocated by Hunter in 1774,
and within the last year or so by Drosier, of Cambridge. That they
have nothing whatever to do with flight is proved by the fact that
some excellent flyers, take the bats e.g., are destitute of them, while
the wingless running birds, such as the ostrich and apteryx, which are
incapable of flight, are provided with them. The same may be said of the
hollow bones: some really admirable flyers, as the swallows, martins,
and snipes, having their bones filled with medullary substance, while
the bones of the running wingless birds alluded to are filled with air.
Furthermore, and finally, a living bird weighing 10lbs. weighs the same
when dead minus a very few grains; and all know what effect a few
grains of heated air would have in raising a weight of 10lbs. from thc
ground.
    When we have said that cylinders and hollow chambers increase
the area of the insect and bird, and that an insect and bird so con
structed is stronger, weight for weight, than one composed of solid
matter, we may dismiss the subject, flight being, as I shall endeavour
to show by-and-by, not so much one of weight as of power properly
directed, i.e. power directed on strictly mechanical principles. Those
who subscribe to the heated-air theory are of opinion that the air con
tained in the cavities of insects and birds is so much lighter than the
surrounding atmosphere, that it must of necessity contribute mate
rially to flight; but the quantity of air imprisoned is, to begin with, so
infinitesimally small and the difference in weight which it expe
riences by increase of temperature so inappreciable, that it ought not
to be taken into account by any one endeavouring to solve the difficult
and important problem of flight. The Montgolfier or fire balloons were
constructed on the heated-air principle; but as these have no analogue
in nature and are apparently incapable of improvement, they need
not detain us at this stage of the inquiry. The area of the insect
and bird when the wings are fully expanded is, with the single
exception of the bats, greater than that of any other class of animals,
their weight being proportionably less. It ought, however, never
to be forgotten that even the lightest insect or bird is immea

surably heavier than the air, and that there is no <U+FB01>xed relation
between the weight of body and the expanse of wing in either class.
We have thus light-bodied and large-winged insects and birds, as
the butter<U+FB02>y, heron, and albatross; and others, whose bodies are
comparatively heavy, while their wings are insigni<U+FB01>cantly small, as
in the sphinx-moth and stag-beetle among insects, and the grebe,
quail, and partridge among birds. Those apparent inconsistencies
are readily explained by the greater muscular development of the
heavy-bodied short-winged insects and birds, and the increased power
and rapidity with which the wing is made to oscillate.            This is of the
utmost importance in the science of aerostation, as showing that <U+FB02>ight
may be attained by a heavy, powerful animal with comparatively small
wings, as well as by a lighter one with enormously enlarged wings.
While, therefore, there is apparently no correspondence between the
area of the wing and the animal to be raised, there is an unvarying
relation as to the weight and number of oscillations, so that the
problem of <U+FB02>ight seems to resolve itself into one of weight, power,
velocity, and small surfaces; versus buoyancy, debility, diminished
speed, and extensive surfaces: weight in either case being a sine
 qua non.
      In order to utilize the air as a means of transit, the body in
motion, whether it moves in virtue of the life it possesses, or because
of a force superadded, must be heavier than it. If it were otherwise, if
it were rescued from the operation of gravity on the one hand, and
bereft of independent movement on the other, it must <U+FB02>oat about
uncontrolled and uncontrollable, as happens in the ordinary gas
balloon. The difference between an insect or bird and a balloon
here insisted upon was, I have learned since writing the above, like
wise pointed out by His Grace the Duke of Argyll, in his very able
and eloquent article in ‘ Good Words,’ entitled “ The Reign of Law ”*
-—an article whose merits cannot be too widely acknowledged or too
universally known. The wings of insects and birds are, as a rule,
more or less triangular in shape, the base of the triangle being directed
towards the body, the sides anteriorly and posteriorly. They are also
conical on sections from within outwards and from before backwards,
this shape converting the pinion into a delicately-graduated instrument,
balanced with the utmost nicety to satisfy the requirements of the
muscular system on the one hand, and the resistance and resiliency of
the air on the other. While all wings are graduated as explained,
innumerable varieties occur as to their general contour, some being
falcated or scythe-like, others oblong, others rounded or circular, some
lauciolate, and some linear.
      Wing of Insect-The wings of insects may consist either of one or
two pairs; the anterior or upper pair, when two are present, being in
    "‘ ‘ Good Words ’ for February, 1865.  This article I am glad to <U+FB01>nd has been
reprinted in a separate form with numerous illustrations, and should be read by all

some instances greatly modi<U+FB01>ed and presenting a corneous condition.
When so modi<U+FB01>ed they cover the under-wings when the insect is
reposing, and have from this circumstance been named elytra from the
Greek ’E’Av'rgov, a sheath. The elytra or wing-cases as they are some
times called, are dense, rigid, and opaque in the beetles ; solid in one
part and membraneous in another in the cockroaches; more or less
membraneous throughout in the grasshoppers ; and completely mem
braneous in the dragon-<U+FB02>ies.       The superior or upper wings are indi
reetly connected with <U+FB02>ight in the beetles, cock-roaches, and grass
hoppers, and actively engaged in this function in the dragon-<U+FB02>ies and
butter<U+FB02>ies. The true wings, and by this I mean the membraneous
ones, present different degrees of opacity; those of the moths and
butter<U+FB02>ies being non-transparent; those of the dragon-<U+FB02>ies, bees, and
common <U+FB02>ies presenting a delicate, <U+FB01>lmy, gossamer-like appearance.
They have, however, this feature in common, and it is fundamental;
both pairs are composed of a duplicature of integument, or investing
membrane, and are strengthened in various directions by a system of
hollow, horny tubes, known to entomologists as the neurze or nervures.
These nervures taper towards the extremity of the wing, and are
strongest towards its root and anterior margin, where they supply
the place of the arm in bats and birds.
    The neurse are arranged at the axis of the wing after the manner of
a fan or spiral stair ; the anterior one occupying ahigher position than
that farther back, and so of the others. As this arrangement extends
also to the margins, the wings are more or less twisted upon them
selves, and present a certain degree of convexity on their superior
or upper surface, and a corresponding concavity on their inferior
or under surface; their free edges supplying these <U+FB01>ne curves which
act with such ei<U+FB01>cacy upon the air in obtaining the maximum of
resistance and the minimum of displacement. As illustrative exam
ples of the form of wing alluded to, that of the beetle, bee, and
<U+FB02>y may be cited: the pinion in those insects acting as helices, or
twisted levers and elevating weights, much greater than the area of the
wing would seem to warrant. The insects adverted to <U+FB02>y, as a rule,
with great accuracy and speed, and frequently in a straight line.
    From the foregoing account it is evident that the wings of insects
vary as regards their number, size, and shape. They also differ as
regards their surfaces, margins, venation, degree of consistence and
position, so that it might naturally be asked, Do the several orders of
wings act according to a common principle, or does each wing act
according to a principle of its own ? There can, I think, be but one
answer to this question. All wings obtain their leverage by presenting
oblique surfaces to the air, the degree of obliquity gradually increasing
in a direction from behind, forwards and downwards, during extension
when the sudden or effective stroke is being given, and gradually
decreasing in an opposite direction during <U+FB02>exion, or when the wing is
being more slowly recovered preparatory to making a second stroke.
The effective stroke in insects, and this holds true also of birds, is
                                                                H2

   therefore delivered downwards and forwards, and not, as the majority
   of writers believe, vertically, or even slightly backwards. This arises
  from the curious circumstance, that insects and birds when <U+FB02>ying
  actually fall through the medium which elevates them, their course
  being indicated by the resultant of two forces, 1252.: that of gravity,
  pulling vertically downwards, and that of the wing, acting at a given
  angle in an upward direction. The wing of the bird acts after the
  manner of a boy’s kite, the only difference being that the kite is
  PULLED FORWARDB upon the wind by the string and the hand, whereas
  in the bird the wing is PUSHED roawsnns on the wind by the weight of
  the body and the life residing in the pinion itself. The angle at
 which the wing acts most e<U+FB01>icaciously as an elevator, as proved by
  an examination of the pinion of the living insect, bat, and bird, when
  fully extended and ready to give the effective stroke, is an angle of
 45° with the horizon.      As, however, this angle could not be uniformly
 maintained without a rotatory motion which would wrench the wings
 from their <U+FB01>xings, a compromise is adopted, the wing being made
 to rotate on its axis to the extent of a quarter of a turnin one
 direction during extension, and the same amount in an opposite
 direction during <U+FB02>exion. That the wing rotates upon its axis as
 explained may be readily ascertained by watching the movement in
 the larger domestic <U+FB02>y. If the insect be contemplated either
 from above or beneath, the blur presented by the rapidly oscil
 lating wing will be found to be concave, the depressed portion re
 presenting the wing when its plane of least resistance is parallel with
 the plane of progression. Of this I have had the most convincing
 proof, particularly in semi-torpid insects where the wing was plied
 with less vigour than usual. To confer on the wing the multiplicity
 of movement which it requires, it is supplied with a double hinge or
compound joint which enables it to move not only in an upward,
 downward, forward, and backward direction, but also at various inter
mediate degrees of obliquity. An insect furnished with wings thus
hinged may, as far as steadiness of body is concerned, be not inaptly
compared to a compass set upon gimbals, where the universality of
motion in one direction ensures comparative <U+FB01>xedness in another.
     Many instances might be quoted of the marvellous powers of <U+FB02>ight
residing in insects as a class. The male of the silkworm moth
(Attacus Paphia) is stated to travel more than 100 miles a day ;* and
an anonymous writer in Nieholson’s Journal calculates that the common
house-<U+FB02>y (Musea domesticus) in ordinary <U+FB02>ight makes 600 strokes per
second, and advances 25 feet ; but that the rate of speed, if the insect
be alarmed, may be increased six or seven fold, so that under certain
circumstances it can outstrip the <U+FB01>ectest racehorse. Leeuwenhoek
relates a most exciting chase which he once beheld in a mcnagerie
about 100 feet long, between a swallow and a dragon-<U+FB02>y (mordella).

        Wing of Bird-There are few things in nature more admirably
   constructed and where design can be more readily traced than in
  the wing of the bird. Its great strength and extreme lightness, the
  manner in which it closes up or folds during <U+FB02>exion, and opens
  out or expands during extension, as well as the method according to
  which the feathers are strung together, and slate each other in divers
  directions to produce at one time a solid resisting surface, and at
  another an interrupted and comparatively non-resisting one, present
  a degree of <U+FB01>tness to which the mind must necessarily revert with
  pleasure.     The wing of the bird, like that of the insect, is con
  cave-convex, and more or less twisted upon itself when extended,
  so that the upper or thick margin of the pinion presents a different
  degree of cm'vature to that of the nether or thin margin : the curves
  of the two margins in some instances even intersecting each other.
  This twisting is in a great measure owing to the manner in which the
  bones of the wing are twisted upon themselves, and the spiral nature
  of their articular surfaces, the long axes of the joints always inter
  secting each other at right angles. As a result of this disposition of
  the articular surfaces the wing may be shot out or extended, and
  retracted or <U+FB02>exed in nearly the same plane, the bones composing the
  wing rotating on their axes during either movement. This secondary
  action, or the revolving of the component bones upon their own axes,
  is of the greatest importance in the movements of the wings, as it
  communicates to the hand and forearm, and consequently to the
  primary and secondary feathers which they bear the precise angles
  necessary for <U+FB02>ight. It in fact ensures that the wing, and the curtain
  or fringe of the wing which the primary and secondary feathers form,
  shall be screwed into and down upon the wind in extension, and
  unscrewed or withdrawn from the wind during <U+FB02>exion. The wing of
  the bird may therefore be compared to a huge gimlct or anger, the axis
  of the gimlct representing the bones of the wing, the <U+FB02>anges or spiral
  thread of the gimlct the primary and secondary feathers. As the
  degree of rotation made by the bones of the forearm and hand during
  extension amounts as nearly as may be to a quarter of a turn of a
  spiral, it follows that in <U+FB02>exion the wing presents a. knifelike edge to
  the wind; whereas in extension the curtain of the wing is rotated in
 a downward direction until its anterior or concave surface makes an
 angle of 45° with the horizon. From this description it will be
 evident that by the mere rotation of the bones of the forearm and hand
 the maximum and minimum of resistance is secured much in the same
 way that this object is attained by the alternate dipping and feathering
 of an oar.

not glide or skim—considerable advantage is gained by the primary
and secondary feathers being thrown out of position during flexion,
this arrangement preventing retardation, by diminishing the amount
of air displaced. This slating or overlapping and unslating action of
the feathers during extension and flexion is, however, one of the pecu
liarities or refinements, and not necessarily an essential in flight, as
this function can be efficiently performed by the insect and bat where
no feathers are present, and where consequently no opening or closing
of them can possibly occur. The wing of the bird may be said to act
in three different ways:—1st, During extension, when it gradually
makes an angle of 45° with the horizon; 2nd, During the downward
stroke, when it maintains the angle of 45° with the horizon, and
makes a variable angle with the body; and 3rd, During flexion, when
it acts at a gradually decreasing angle in virtue of its being carried
against the wind by the body of the bird which is in motion; it being
a matter of indifference whether the wing acts on the air or the air
on the wing, so long as the body bearing the latter is under weigh;
and this is perhaps the chief reason why the albatross, which is a very
heavy bird," can sail about for such incredible periods without ap
parently moving the wings at all. Captain Hutton thus graphically
describes the sailing of this magnificent bird:—“The flight of the
albatross is truly majestic, as with outstretched motionless wings he
sails over the surface of the sea, now rising high in air; now, with
a bold sweep and wings inclined at an angle with the horizon, descend
ing until the tip of the lower one all but touches the crest of the
waves as he skims over them.” f
                     “Tranquil its spirit seemed, and floated slow,
                       Even in its Very motion there was rest.”
     As an antithesis to the apparently lifeless wings of the
albatross, the ceaseless activity of those of the humming bird might
be adduced. “In those delicate and exquisitely beautiful birds, the
wings, according to Mr. Gould, move so rapidly when the bird is
poised before an object that it is impossible for the eye to follow each
stroke, and a hazy circle of indistinctness on each side of the bird is
all that is perceptible.”
     The various movements involved in ascending, descending, wheel
ing, gliding, and progressing horizontally are all the result of muscular
power, properly directed and acting upon appropriate surfaces-—that
apparent buoyancy in birds, which we so highly esteem, arising not
from superior lightness but from their possessing that degree of weight
which enables them to subjugate the air; weight and independent
motion being the two things indispensable in successful aerial
    * The average weight of the albatross, as given by Gould, is 17lbs. “Ibis, 2nd

progression. The weight in insects and birds is in great measure
owing to their greatly-developed muscular system-this being in that
delicate state of tonacity which enables them to act through its instru
mentality with marvellous dexterity and power, and to expend or
reserve their energies, which they can do with the utmost exactitude
in their lengthened and laborious <U+FB02>ights. The elastic structures
which receive or draw back the wing in the insect and bird during
<U+FB02>exion are of the utmost consequence in the movements of the wings ;
these by their mere contraction enabling the muscles of the wing to
rest nearly half the time they are in action. In this we have a
probable explanation of the extraordinary power of endurance dis
played by insects and birds on the wing.
     The foregoing remarks on the wings of insects and birds lead me
to speak of the inclined plane as applied to the air, but before doing
so, it will be advisable to allude brie<U+FB02>y to the balloon.
     Balloon.—This, as my audience is aware, is constructed on the
obvious principle that a machine lighter than the air must neces
sarily rise through it. The Montgol<U+FB01>er Brothers invented such a.
machine in 1782. Their balloon consisted of a paper-globe or
cylinder, the motor power being superheated air supplied by the
burning of vine twigs under it. The Montgol<U+FB01>er or <U+FB01>re balloons, as they
were called, were superseded by the hydrogen-gas balloon of MM.
Charles and Robert, this being, in turn, supplanted by the ordinary gas
balloon of Mr. Green. Since the introduction of coal gas in the place
of hydrogen gas no radical improvement has been e<U+FB01>'ected; all attempts
at guiding balloons having signally failed. This arises from the vast
extent of surface which they necessarily present, rendering them a fair
conquest to every breeze that blows; and because the power which
 animates them is a mere lifting power which, in the absence of wind,
 must act in a vertical line, all other motion being extraneous and
foreign to it. It consequently rises through the air in opposition to
the law of gravity, very much as a dead bird would fall in a downward
 direction in accordance with it. Having no hold upon the air, this
 cannot be employed as a fulcrum for regulating its movements, and
 hence the cardinal difficulty in ballooning as an art.
     Any one attempting to control the movements of a balloon is very
much in the position of a boatman who endeavours to steer his craft,
which is drifting with the current, by pushing against the stern.
     If ever the balloon is to be utilized as a means of transit, this will
 probably be achieved by converting part of its lifting power into a
horizontal propelling power, which possibly could be done by a<U+FB02>ixing
a horizontal screw, like a small windmill, to the car ; this apparatus
receiving its motion by being forced against the air from beneath
during its ascent (the air playing upon it from above), and com
municating its movements to a similar and smaller screw placed
vertically or at right angles, which could be made to revolve with
great celerity as a driving screw. To prevent rotation in the balloon
itself, it might to be armed with plates of some light material placed at

right angles to the plane of rotation. The great expense, however,
involved in the construction and <U+FB01>lling of the balloon will always
operate against its being used otherwise than as a luxury ; while the
enormous expanse and delicacy of the material employed, as well as
the change in volume of the contained gas arising from increase or
decrease of temperature, cannot fail to prove troublesome, not to say
dangerous.
      Finding that no marked improvement has been made in the balloon
since its introduction in 1782, we naturally turn our attention to some
other method of traversing the air; and here I would add my inde
pendent testimony in favour of the helice or screw, not only as a lift
ing power, but also as a propelling power. When I commenced my
inquiries into the structure and uses of wings, I was early struck with
the curious manner in which they are twisted upon themselves, and
how they are rotated on and off the wind during <U+FB02>cxion and extension,
after the manner of screws; and without knowing (for the subject of
arti<U+FB01>cial <U+FB02>ight is not much in my way) that the helice had been pro
posed as a means for raising inanimate bodies, I had actually con
structed a double screw, with a view to testing its e<U+FB01>icacy in this
respect!“       I have therefore unwittingly laid anatomy and physiology
under contribution in support of what I <U+FB01>nd is not a new doctrinetf
I was impelled in this direction by detecting the principle in nature,
and from knowing that a body to rise and progress in the airneed
not necessarily be lighter than it; in fact, that the balloon is con
structed on a principle diametrically opposed to that on which the
bat, insect, and bird are constructed, and is from this circumstance open
to serious, and in some respects, insuperable objections.
      The e<U+FB01>icacy of the screw in water is well known, and the action
of the child’s toy, usually called the spiralifcr, will illustrate its
utility as applied to the air. This toy, for toy it has hitherto
been, consists of two inclined planes, produced by simply twisting
the enveloping wires in opposite directions.                 It therefore repre
sents the most primitive form of screw. This apparatus, simple as
 it may appear, curiously enough furnishes the mechanical appliance by
 which a body may be elevated, 01' elevated and carried in a horizontal
direction at one and the same time. By applying the necessary power
 the spiralifer can be made to act vertically or horizontally, or at any
 intermediate angle, so that we have in it an easily regulated and per
 fect driving power. The position taken up by the advocates of the
 screw is the reverse of that occupied by the advocates for the balloon;
 so that the aeronaut promises at no distant day to be fairly impaled on
 the horns of a dilemma, by having on the one hand, a motor power
     * This screw had four fans or blades, two of which revolved from left to right ;
 the remaining two from right to left. This I found to be necessary to prevent
 rotation in the driving apparatus, which consisted of a steel spring and clockwork.

 navigation, as early as 1867.

 which (because of the space occupied by it) no human ingenuity can
 direct; and on the other a thoroughly manageable and docile elevating
 and driving apparatus, minus an adequate motor power. The pro
 blem of <U+FB02>ight will probably be solved by one employing a certain pro
 portion of gas to assist him in overcoming the inertia of his machine
 while he uses the screw as a propeller and partial elevator. Of the
two systems propounded, if they‘be judged separately, I incline to that
 which proposes to employ the screw both in elevating and propelling,
 and this for two reasons : 1st, Because the screw or a modi<U+FB01>cation of it
 is the instrument by which, as I have shown, the insect, bat, and bird
 rises and progresses ; and 2nd, Because a certain degree of weight is
 necessary to overcome the air and make it useful for the purposes of
aerostation.
      That the principle of the heliee as applied to the air is correct, is
proved by the very remarkable experiments of MM. Pontin d’Amé
court and De la Landelle, both of whom have constructed within the
last three years helicopteric models, which not only rise by them
selves into the air, but also carry graduated weights.‘ The di<U+FB01>ieulties
therefore attending aerial locomotion by means of the screw are
already partially surmounted.
     The advantages which will accrue from the employment of the
screw in aerostation may be brie<U+FB02>y stated.
      It occupies little space, is strong without being heavy, and is
prodigiously powerful.
     It rigidly eeonomizes the motor power by keeping the inclined
planes of which it is composed closely applied to the air throughout
its entire revolution.
     The speed of the screw can be increased at pleasure-increased
velocity, as I have shown in the insect and bird, conferring enormously
increased propelling and lifting power.
     By a judicious combination of horizontal, vertical, and oblique
screws, almost any degree of speed may be attained, and any course,
whether upwards, downwards, or forwards, pursued.
     A machine elevated and propelled by screws will be necessarily a
compact machine—a machine which will navigate the air as a master;
its weight and the small surface occupied by it rendering it superior
even to moderately high winds.
     The nearer such machine is kept to the earth and the greater
the density of the atmosphere, the greater will be its facility and
power-the inconveniences arising from temperature and excessively
rare<U+FB01>ed air being thus avoided.

 It is just possible that the motor power required for the helicopteric
 <U+FB02>ying-machine may be derived from compressed atmosphere, the air
 being compressed by the aid of an engine on terra <U+FB01>rma, and stowed
 away in the cylinders comprising the <U+FB02>oor or other portions of the
 machine before starting.
     When and where such a machine will be successfully launched no
 one can of course predict. The subject of arti<U+FB01>cial <U+FB02>ight, however,
 has been so frequently discussed of late years, and has excited so much
interest in America, France, and other portions of the Old and New
World, that it must obviously receive a settlement in one direction or
other at no distant date. Even Britain, involved as she is in business
and politics, and caring little about science which is not directly
remunerative, has made a move in this direction, and we have now the
“Aeronautical Society of Great Britain,” presided over by His Grace
the Duke of Argyll, himself a Goliath in aeronautical matters. It were
much to be desired that those who can afford the time or the means
requisite for conducting experiments on a scale commensurate with
the importance of the subject would lend their aid to this great public
movement.
     Homo Volans.—-Whether the genus homo will ever be able, by
his unaided exertions, to leave the scene of his joys and sorrows for
the <U+FB01>elds etherean, time only can determine. Berelli, a great
anatomical authority,"E made elaborate calculations to prove the
absurdity of such an attempt. His calculations, however, will not
deter the more sanguine and speculative portions of mankind from
renewing their exertions in this direction as opportunity permits; and
I may state, for their guidance in the matter, that if man ever <U+FB02>ies it
will not be by employing his arms simply, but by concentrating the
energies of his entire muscular system—by transferring in fact the
movements of his arms and legs to a central axis or shaft, surmounted
by one or more horizontal and vertical screws of appropriate size and
shape ; these being made to revolve with a velocity to be determined
by experiment. The value of this hypothesis could be readily tested,
and at a tri<U+FB02>ing expense, by a machine constructed after the manner
of a velocipede, which need not be of a very complicated character.
     In order to construct a successful <U+FB02>ying-machine, it is not neces
sary to imitate the <U+FB01>lmy wing of the insect, the silken pinion of the
bat, or the complicated and highly di<U+FB02>'erentialed wing of the bird,
where every feather may be said to have a peculiar function assigned
to it ; neither is it necessary to reproduce the intricacy of that
machinery by which the pinion in the bat, insect, and bird is moved :
all that is required is to distinguish the form and extent of the surfaces
and the manner of their application, and this has, in a great measure,
been already done. When Vivian and Trevithick constructed the

locomotive, and Symington and Bell the steamboat, they did not seek
to reproduce a quadruped or a <U+FB01>sh ; they simply aimed at producing
motion adapted to the land and water in accordance with natural laws,
and in the presence of living models. Their success is to be measured
by an involved labyrinth of railroad which extends to every part of
the civilized world, and by navies whose vessels are despatched without
the slightest trepidation to navigate the most boisterous seas at the
most inclement seasons. The aeronaut has the same task before him
in a different direction, and in attempting to produce a <U+FB02>ying-machine
he is not necessarily attempting an impossible thing. The countless
swarms of <U+FB02>ying things testify as to the practicability of the scheme,
and nature at once supplies him with models and materials. If
arti<U+FB01>cial <U+FB02>ight were not attainable, the insects and birds would afford
the only examples of animals whose movements could not be repro
dueed. The outgoings and ineomings of the quadruped and <U+FB01>sh are,
however, already successfully imitated, and the fowls of the air, though
clamorous and shy, are not necessarily beyond our reach. Much has
been said and done in clearing the forest and fertilizing the prairie,

                  On the Water Supply of the Metropolis.
 ANOTHER attack of the most terrible epidemic to which modern
London is subject, has once more called earnest attention to the
 serious defects of the Metropolitan Water Supply. The origin and
spread of cholera is confessedly still involved in much obscurity, but
the experience which we have derived from four visitations leads
irresistibly to the conclusion, that, whilst no successful barriers have
been devised against the introduction of the disease into this or any
other country, cholera can never establish itself as an epidemic unless
the water supply of a community be tainted with sewage impurity.
Thus Manchester su<U+FB02>'ered fear-fully from cholera in 1832 and in 1849,
whilst supplied with impure water, but after the introduction of pure
water from the Derbyshire hills, the return of the disease in 1854,
and again last year, manifested itself in Manchester by a few sporadic
cases only; although in other respects Manchester is one of the most
unhealthy towns in the United Kingdom.
    The violence of the epidemic, as Dr. Farr has shown, exhibits
also a close relation to the degree of sewage contamination of the
water supply. Thus he has demonstrated that in the visitation of
1849, that portion of the metropolitan population which was supplied
by water taken from the Thames at Kew suffered a mortality from
cholera of 8 in 10,000. Of every 10,000 people supplied with water
taken from the river at Hammersmith, 17 died. Of the inhabitants of
Belgravia, St. George’s Hanover Square, Chelsea, and Westminster,
supplied with water taken below Chelsea Hospital, 47 in 10,000 died.
Whilst the populations drawing their supply still lower down, viz.
at Battersea and between Hungerford and Waterloo Bridges, where
the river was still more foul, su<U+FB02>'ered to the extent of ‘163 in 10,000.
In the year 1854, one-half of this latter district was supplied by
water taken above Teddington Lock, and the deaths fell to 87—little
more than one-half; whilst last year, when the whole supply was

8 in 10,000.                  -
    The water withdrawn from the Thames is now all taken above
Teddington Lock, and its <U+FB01>ltration before distribution is rendered
compulsory by the Metropolitan Water Act of 1852. The wisdom of
thus withdrawing the water at a higher point, and of enforcing its
<U+FB01>ltration, is evidenced by the comparatively slight mortality from
cholera last year in those districts supplied with Thames water. Far
di<U+FB02>'erent, according to the Registrar-General, was the fate of that por
tion of the metropolis which had the misfortune to be supplied from
reservoirs at Old Ford, belonging to the East London Water Com
pany. The suddenness and virulence of the outbreak of cholera in
the east of London last summer at once aroused the suspicious of the
Registrar-General, who requested me to make an immediate investi
gation into the East London Water Company’s supply. I found the
chief reservoir at Old Ford to be situated close to the river Lea, which
is there little better than an open sewer. This reservoir is also sunk
16 feet beneath the low ground, which is there only just above the
level of spring-tides; consequently the water in the reservoir is
always below Trinity high-water mark. I pointed out that soakage
from the adjacent foul river and from the surrounding sail, saturated
with sewage, must take place into such an excavation, with its floor of
two-and-a-half acres in extent, an opinion which has been con<U+FB01>rmed
by recent investigation when this reservoir was emptied as far as
possible by pumping, for the soakage was so great that it was found
impossible to empty it. The mortality in that portion of London
supplied from these reservoirs was frightful, for whilst the deaths in
the districts drawing water from other sources varied from 2 to 12 in
10,000, they ranged from 63 to 111 in 10,000 in those districts sup
plied from Old Ford.

gallons daily. Some idea may be formed of the vastness of this
supply by a comparison of its volume with some well~known magni
tude. If it were contained in a reservoir having a <U+FB02>oor area equal
to that of Westminster Hall, the walls would require to be carried to
the height of 1070 feet, or more than three times the height of the
Victoria tower, to enable it to contain the water which is daily dis
tributed in the metropolis. Five of the water companies abstract
about one-half of the total supply from the Thames; two withdraw
about 42,000,000 gallons from the river Lea, and the remainder is
pumped by two other companies (the Kent and South Essex Com
panics) from artesian wells sunk into the chalk of the Thames basin.
Such is the present volume of water daily supplied to London and its
suburbs ; what will be the amount required twenty years hence it is
di<U+FB02>icult to estimate, but if the annual rate of'increase since 1850 be
continued, it can scarcely be less than 150,000,000 of gallons, for in

        Proposed Water Supply of London.—Notwithstanding the best
   e<U+FB02>'orts of the water companies, the present supply of water to the
   metropolis is far from satisfactory, owing to causes which are mostly
   beyond the control of those to whom that supply is entrusted; it is
  therefore contemplated either to change entirely the source of supply,
  and thus obtain water of greater purity than any available in the
  neighbourhood of London, or so to alter the conditions at present
  affecting Thames water, as to materially improve its quality. For
  this purpose no less than <U+FB01>ve schemes have been recently brought
  forward, 'uz'z. :—
       1. Sources of the Severn, proposed by Mr. Bateman.
       2. The Cumberland Lakes—Messrs. Hemans and Hassard
       3. Thames water <U+FB01>ltered through Bagshot Sands-Mr. Telford
  Macneill.
       4. Storage reservoirs near the sources of the Thames-Mr. Bailey
  Denton.
       5. Derbyshire and Sta<U+FB02>'ordshire hills-Mr. Remington.
       The last three of these schemes have scarcely yet assumed a shape
 for discussion from a chemical point of view; we shall therefore con
 <U+FB01>ne our attention to the <U+FB01>rst two.                                 .
      Mr. Bafeman’s Schema-Mr. Bateman proposes to obtain the metro
 politan water supply from the mountain ranges of Cader Idris and
 Plynlimmon, in North Wales, which constitute the chief sources of
 the Severn. These mountains rear their heads into the moist air
 brought from the Atlantic by the prevailing south-westerly winds,
 and receive the precipitation of from 70 to 150 inches of rain per
 annum. We should thus avail ourselves of a great natural and very
 active distillatory apparatus, furnishing water of great purity. These
 Welsh hills consist of the Upper and Lower Silurian formations,
 “. which yield water as pure in quality as that of Loch Katrine, and
which afford sites for magni<U+FB01>cent reservoirs, which may be constructed
with perfect safety and facility, and of suf<U+FB01>cient capacity to economize
 the full annual rainfall I have assumed, and to last out droughts of
from 140 to 150 days’ duration, both for town supply and river com
pensation.      One of these districts, of 66,000 acres in area, is situated
a little to the east of the range of mountains of which Cader Idris
and Aran Mowddy are the highest summits, forming the drainage
ground of the rivers Banw and Vyrnwy. The other district, of about
equal area, is situated immediately to the east of Plynlimmon, 2500
feet in height. The discharge pipes of the lowest reservoir in each
of these districts will be placed at an elevation of about 450 feet
above the level of Trinity high-water mark. The water will be
conducted by separate aqueducts, of 19 miles and 21% miles in length
respectively, to a point of junction near Martin Mere, from whence
the joint volume of the water will be conveyed by a common aqueduct
to the high land near Stanmore, where extensive service reservoirs

feet above Trinity high-water mark. From these reservoirs the
water will be delivered to the city at high pressure, and under
the constant supply system. The total distance from the reser
voirs on the Severn to London will be 183 miles. One of the
reservoirs on the river Vyrnwy will, by an embankment of 76 feet
in height, form a lake of <U+FB01>ve miles in length, and will contain
1,089,000,000 cubic feet. Another, on the river Banw, by an embank
ment of 80 feet in height, will form a lake of four miles in length,
and contain 940,000,000 cubic feet ; and a third, in the same district,
by an embankment of similar height, will contain 732,000,000 cubic
feet.   Amongst the reservoirs on the Severn will be one which, by
an embankment of 75 feet in height, will contain 2,230,000,000 cubic
feet; this single reservoir being 50 per cent. greater than the avail
able water in Loch Katrine.” Mr. Bateman estimates the cost for
220,000,000 gallons per day at l0,850,000l., the interest upon which,
together with cost of maintenance, &c., would be met by a domestic rate
of 10d. in the pound, and a public rate of 201. in the pound. The
present rate paid to the London water companies is much heavier,
being about 18. 511. in the pound. The total gathering ground in
Mr. Bateman’s scheme is estimated at 204 square miles.
     Messrs. Hemans and Hassard’s Scheme.-—~This scheme lays under
contribution the magni<U+FB01>cent condensing surface of the Cumberland
and Westmoreland mountains, where, as every tourist knows, rainless
days are rare exceptions. The extent of gathering ground would be
 177 square miles, whilst the average annual rainfall in the district
is 100'56 inches. The districts from which water is proposed to be
taken, lie on the northern slopes of the range of hills towering over
Grassmere, Windermere, and Kendal, and draining into the rivers
 Lowther and Greta, and into the lakes of Haweswater, Ullswater, and
 Thirlmere. This scheme has the advantage of naturally-formed
 reservoirs, which would, however, require to be further enlarged by
 embankments ; and these natural advantages are also to some extent
 counterbalanced by a greater length of conduit (280 miles), and by
 the necessity for several tunnels, two of which would be respectively
 7% and 8 miles long. The daily delivery of water in London would
 be 250,000,000 gallons, and the cost of the works, &e., 13,500,000l.
 The interest upon this capital, cost of maintenance, &c., and com
 pensation to present water companies, would be met by a domestic
 rate of 1s. 1d. per pound.
      From a chemical point of view, it is at present quite impossible to
 give the preference to one or the other of these colossal schemes, both
 of which are truly worthy of the latter half of this century of engi
 neering triumphs, and of the great city on behalf of which they are
 projected. Before we can appreciate, however, the advantages of such
 magni<U+FB01>cent undertakings, it is necessary that we should <U+FB01>rst consider
 the chemical quality of our present supply, and compare it with that
 of the water which we should obtain from these new sources.

     Quality of the present Metropolitan Water SuWly.—Absolutely pure
water is never found in nature. In addition to mechanically suspended
impurities which can be mostly removed by <U+FB01>ltration, potable waters
also contain various solid substances in a state of solution. These
substances are left behind as a solid residue when such waters are
evaporated to dryness ; they have been commonly classi<U+FB01>ed by
chemists into the three following divisions :—
    1. Matters which are expelled when the solid residue is heated to
redness in contact with air.
    2. Matters which are not expelled at a red heat, and which decom
pose soap.
    3. Matters which are not expelled at a red heat, and which do not
decompose soap.
    The substances of the <U+FB01>rst division consist of :—
         a. Organic matter.
         b. The products of the decomposition of certain mineral salts,
            chie<U+FB02>y nitrites and nitrates.
    Formerly ammoniacal salts, a certain amount of moisture, and even
hydrochloric acid were amongst the products expelled on ignition, but
since the adoption of the suggestion of Hofmann and Blyth in the year
1856 to add a known weight of carbonate of soda to the water before
evaporation, these substances have been excluded from category No. l,
and it is important to bear this in mind when comparing the analyses
of waters made prior to 1856 with those which have been made since
that year. Notwithstanding the more de<U+FB01>nite character, however, thus
given to the matters expelled on ignition, it is still di<U+FB01>’icult to inter
pret the meaning of this loss. It may all arise from organic matter,
-—nay, there may even be more organic matter in the solid residue of
a water than is indicated by the total loss on ignition, as I have
recently had occasion to observe; or it may be all due to the dissipa
tion of mineral ingredients, the result, however, of the decomposition
of previously existing organic matter. When it is large it throws
suspicion upon the character of the water, it indicates either the
presence of organic matter, animal or vegetable, or it denotes previous
contamination with sewage or decaying animal matters. This analy
tical determination is thus surrounded with much uncertainty; and it
has always been considered, as indeed it deserved to be, highly un
satisfactory. Hence the attempts which have been made to indicate,
directly or indirectly, by means of permanganate of potash, the
amount of real organic matter involved in this loss by ignition. Per
manganate of potash when dissolved in water readily yields oxygen to
many substances capable of combining with this element. Thus if it
be added to water acidulated with sulphuric acid, and containing
oxalic acid in solution, the latter is completely and rapidly converted
into carbonic acid and water at the expense of oxygen derived from
the permanganate; and it is found that one part by weight of oxalic
acid in being thus oxidized abstracts almost exactly eight parts by

114                       Professor Frank/and                  [March 29,
weight of oxygen from the permanganate, the latter being converted
into sulphate of manganese. In undergoing this chemical change the
rich violet colour of the solution of permanganate of potash vanishes;
and it is thus easy to ascertain, by the non-disappearance of the
characteristic tint of the permanganate, when the oxidation of the
oxalic acid is complete. Now a similar disappearance of colour
occurs when the solution of permanganate of potash is added to an
acidulated sample of potable water containing organic matter; and it
 has been assumed that, as in the case of the oxalic acid, the organic
 matter contained in the water is completely oxidized by the perman
ganate, which was thus thought to indicate the amount of oxygen
 required to oxidize completely the organic matter contained in the
 water. Dr. Letheby has even employed this reaction for the estima
 tion of the actual weight of organic matter contained in a known
 volume of water, on the assumption that every grain of organic matter
 contained in a sample of Water robs the permanganate solution of
 eight grains of oxygen. Such a method of ascertaining the actual
 amount of organic matter in a water, or even the amount of oxygen
 required to convert this organic matter into its <U+FB01>nal mineral products
 of oxidation, would be invaluable on account of the extreme facility
 with which it can be applied; and it was therefore not without a certain
 amount of regret that, after employing this process for many months,
 I noticed unmistakable symptoms of its untrustworthiness, symp
 toms which were amply con<U+FB01>rmed on submitting it to rigorous ex
 perimental tests. By the addition of known weights of di<U+FB02>'erent
 organic substances to equal volumes of pure distilled water, the
 latter was arti<U+FB01>cially contaminated with a known proportion of each
 kind of organic matter. Each sample of water so arti<U+FB01>cially con
 taminated was made to contain three parts of organic matter in
 100,000. I then proceeded to ascertain—-<U+FB01>rst, the amount of oxygen
 which this organic matter abstracted from the permanganate of
 potash; and secondly, the actual amount of organic matter present in
 the Water, on the assumption that each part by weight of organic
 matter consumed eight parts by weight of oxygen from the permanga
 nate of potash. The same test was also applied to another sample of
 distilled water from which all organic matter was carefully excluded,
 but to each 100,000 parts of which three parts of nitrite of soda
 were added. The importance of this last experiment will be evident
 when it is stated that nitrite of soda is rarely absent from the different
 waters supplied to London. The amount of oxygen consumed by the
 organic matter was determined for two different periods of time, viz. :
 -<U+FB01>rst, for a period at the end of which the acidulated and contami
 nated water remained tinted with permanganate for ten minutes after
 the addition of the latter; and secondly, for a period of six hours,
 during the whole of which time the permanganate was present in
 excess.
    The results are contained in the following table, where they are

        From this table it is seen that of the nine kinds of organic matter
 operated upon, only one was completely oxidized by permanganate of
 potash, even after the lapse of six hours, whilst it will be remarked
 that urea, hippuric acid, and creatin—three organic substances likely
 to be present in water recently contaminated with sewage—su<U+FB01>'er an
 oxidation which, even in the most favourable case, only reaches 316th
 of complete oxidation; whilst if we attempt to calculate the amount
 of these substances present in the water, from the quantity of oxygen
 so absorbed, instead of <U+FB01>nding three parts of each in 100,000 of water,
 we obtain only ‘138 part of creatin, ‘095 part of urea, and '480 part of
hippuric acid. On the other hand, the mineral salt, nitrite of soda, weight
for weight, surpasses every form of organic matter experimented upon
in the avidity with which it absorbs oxygen; and three parts of this
inorganic substance in 100,000 of water would actually, by the mode of
calculation above described, indicate no less than 5% parts of organic
matter. Thus it is evident, that for the estimation of the amount of
organic matter in water or the quantity of oxygen necessary to oxidize
that organic matter, permanganate of potash is utterly untrustworthy
and fallacious. Whilst, however, this reagent is quite worthless for
the quantitative estimation of organic matter in Water, it may still be
used in certain cases as a qualitative test where there is no oppor
tunity for accurate analytical examination. Thus, if a clear and
colourless water decolorizes much of the permanganate solution, the
water ought to be rejected for domestic use as being of doubtful
quality; for although such a water may be absolutely free from or
ganic impurity, yet its decolorizing action upon the permanganate
would indicate with considerable certainty that the water had been in

                                           \
116                      Professor Frankland                [March ‘29,
contact with decaying animal matters.      Should the water, however,
instead of being colourless, be tinged of a yellow or brownish-yellow
colour when viewed through a considerable stratum, as in a quart
decanter for instance, its capability of decolorizing a considerable
amount of permanganate solution ought not to be regarded with the
same suspicion as in the case of a colourless water, because the yellow
tint of such waters is generally owing to the presence of peaty matter,
which, though innocuous, has the power of decolorizing perman
ganate of potash.
     Having thus convinced myself of the fallacy of the permanganate
process of analysis, and there being no other method by which the
estimation of organic matter in waters can be even approximately
e<U+FB02>'ected, I have, for some months past, in conjunction with my- pupil,
Mr. Armstrong, been endeavouring to remedy this grave defect in
water analysis; and we have at length succeeded in replacing the
unsatisfactory item of “ organic and other volatile matter,” by certain
precise and de<U+FB01>nite determinations, which throw great light upon the
present condition and previous history of the sample of water sub
mitted to analysis.
     The two most important things to be ascertained about a water
 used for domestic purposes are, <U+FB01>rst-the amount and character of the
 organic matter present in the water at the time of analysis; and
 secondly, the amount of hardening or soap-destroying materials which
 the water contains. Unfortunately, the <U+FB01>rst of these data cannot be
 ascertained; but we have devised processes by which the amount of
 the two most important elements of organic matter, carbon and
 nitrogen, can be determined with considerable precision. For this
 purpose the following processes are necessary :——~
     1. Determination of the carbon contained in the organic matter.
 To distinguish this carbon from that which is contained in the
 mineral carbonates present in most waters, I will term it organic
 carbon.
     2. Determination of the total combined nitrogen. This nitrogen
 may exist in the water in one or more of the three following forms :—
 a. As a constituent of organic matter—0rgam'c nitrogen. b. As a
 constituent of mineral nitrites and nitrates. c. As a constituent of
 ammonia.
     3. Determination of the nitrogen present as nitrites or nitrates.
     4. Determination of ammonia.
     5. Calculation of amount of organic nitrogen.     This is obviously
 avery simple operation, for if from the amount of total combined
 nitrogen (determination No. 2), there be deducted the amount of
 nitrogen present as nitrites and nitrates (determination No. 3), plus
 the amount of nitrogen present in the ammonia (determination No. 4),
 the remainder will be the amount of organic nitrogen.
     The processes by which these determinations are made will be
fully described elsewhere.
     The organic matters containing nitrogen which occur dissolved in
 water, are chie<U+FB02>y, if not entirely, of animal origin, being derived

1867.]           on the Water Supply of the Metropolis.                 117
either from sewage or manured land; be their origin, however,
animal or vegetable, no distinction founded upon their source can be
drawn between their respective noxious qualities. After admixture
with spring or river water, these noxious organic matters undergo
slow oxidation, by which they are <U+FB01>nally resolved into comparatively
innocuous mineral compounds; their carbon is converted into car-'
bonic acid, and their hydrogen into water; and these products can
no longer be identi<U+FB01>ed in the aerated waters of the river or spring:
but the nitrogen is converted into nitrous and nitric acids, which,
combining with the bases contained in most Waters, remain dissolved,
and constitute a record of the sewage or other analogous contamina
tion to which the water has been subject. With certain corrections,
presently to be mentioned, the analytical determination of the nitrogen
contained in these salts and in the form of ammonia writes, as it
were, the history of the water, as regards its contact with decomposing
animal matter. Such previous organic contamination may be con
veniently expressed in parts of average <U+FB01>ltered London sewage, which,
if thus completely oxidized in a river, would yield a like amount of
nitrogen, in the form of nitrites, nitrates, and ammonia. For this
purpose, average <U+FB01>ltered London sewage may be taken as containing
 10 parts of combined nitrogen in 100,000 parts, as deduced from the
 numerous analyses of Way, Hofmann, and Witt. The number so
 obtained as the previous sewage contamination of a water requires, how
 ever, a correction, since rain-water itself contains combined nitrogen
 as ammonia, nitrite of ammonia, and nitrate of ammonia. The
 amount of these substances present in rain which falls at Rothamp
 stead has been most carefully determined by a laborious series of
 monthly analyses, made independently on the one hand by Messrs.
 Lawes and Gilbert, and on the other by Professor Way, and extending
 over two years. The results of these chemists accord well, and they
 give as the average amount of nitrogen in the forms of ammonia,
 nitrite of ammonia, and nitrate of ammonia, ‘0985 part in 100,000
 parts of rain-water. This must be deducted therefore from the calcu
 lated amount of previous sewage contamination of any sample of
 Water. It corresponds to 985 parts of previous sewage contamination
 in 100,000 parts of the water. There is no doubt that this reduction
 is too large, and therefore favourable to the character of the water,
 since in most cases but a very small proportion of the water of a river
 or spring falls as rain directly into the stream; and Professor Way
 water
 has    is absorbed
      proved         when every
              that almost   the water
                                 trace of
                                       percolates through
                                          the ammonia       cultivated
                                                         contained     rain~

 Now, as three-fourths of the combined nitrogen in rain-water is in
 the form of ammonia, it is evident that rain-water must be deprived
  of much of its original nitrogenous contamination before it reaches such
  a river as the Thames. The very small amount of combined nitrogen
  found in natural waters of undoubted purity, such as that of Loch
  Katrine for instance, also testi<U+FB01>es to the liberality of the above allow
  ance. The water of Loch Katrine contains only one-third as much
 combined nitrogen as that present in rain falling at Rothampstead, so

     118                     Professor Frankland                 [March 29,
    that, starting from the base line of purity above proposed, the water
     of Loch Katrine exhibits a negative previous sewage contamination
     equal to 575 parts in 100,000; or, in other words, it would require
     575 parts of average London sewage to be added to, and allowed to
    oxidize in each 100,000 parts of Loch Katrine water before its purity
    would be reduced to the standard with which I propose to compare
    the metropolitan waters. It is necessary here to remark, however,
    that owing to the more copious rains of the Highlands of Scotland,
    the rain-water of that district probably contains less combined nitrogen
    than that which falls at Rothampstead.
        The nitrogenous organic matter which has escaped the process of
    oxidation above described, and which therefore still exists in the
    water at the time the analysis is made, constitutes what may be appro
    priately termed the present sewage contamination of the water. The
    existence of this contamination is shown by the presence of organic
    nitrogen in the water, and its amount may be expressed by the
    number of parts of average <U+FB01>ltered London sewage (of the strength
    above described) ; which if contained in 100,000 parts of pure water,
    would contaminate the latter with the same amount of combined
    nitrogen. By operating upon one litre of water. for the determination
    of total combined nitrogen, one per cent. of sewage ca'n be detected
   with certainty; but smaller percentages ought, in operations upon
   such a small quantity of water, to be considered as falling within the
   possible errors of experiment. Thus in the table of analytical results
   given below, the indications of organic nitrogen, and consequently of
   present sewage contamination, amounting in the maximum to one-half
   per cent., ought to be disregarded; because as the total combined
   nitrogen was determined in one litre of each water, the amount of
   present sewage contamination indicated by the analysis falls within
   the limit of possible experimental error. The subjoined tabulated
   results obtained in the analysis of samples of the metropolitan waters
   collected in February last and during the present month, show there
   fore that none of these waters contained as much as one per cent. of
  present sewage contamination. This search for unoxidized sewage, or
  its equivalent in a water, may be rendered more minute by operating
  upon a larger volume of water, by which the possible error of experi
- ment is reduced in proportional amount : thus, if 10 litres of water be
  used for the determination of total combined nitrogen, one-tenth of a per
  cent. of present sewage contamination can be ascertained with certainty.
  This operation has been performed upon 10 litres of the Thames water
  delivered by the Grand Junction Company, and collected during the
  present month; and it is satisfactory to <U+FB01>nd that this minute examina
  tion failed to detect any actual sewage contamination, consequently
  the sample of the Grand Junction Company’s water operated upon
  did not contain n‘w th of its volume of unoxidized sewage. It
  must be consolatory to the drinker of Thames water to know, that
  although, according to Mr. Bateman, the population within the basin of
  the Thames above the points at which the water is withdrawn for the
  supply ,of_ London exceeds 1,000,000 persons, the drainage of some

1867.]          on the Water Supply of (he Metropolis.                119
600,000 of whom is poured into the river, the whole of this faecal
matter is so completely oxidized before it reaches the water-cisterns
of London, as to defy the detection of any trace in its noxious or
uuoxidized condition. If the average <U+FB02>ow of Thames water just above
the point at which the London companies withdraw their supply be
taken at 800,000,000 of gallons daily, the drainage of 600,000 people
ought to produce a sewage contamination of 2250 parts in 100,000. It
could scarcely be expected that this calculated number should approx
imate very closely to that obtained by the actual analysis of Thames
water, since the calculated number depends upon many contingencies,
as for instance, upon the volume of water actually <U+FB02>owing past the
points of withdrawal at the time the companies abstracted the water
analyzed ; and secondly, upon the greater or less retention of the fsecal
matters in the sewers of the towns draining into the river : it is
interesting, however, to <U+FB01>nd that the sewage contamination of Thames
water as determined by analysis does not di<U+FB02>'er much from that calcu
lated from the above data. The analytical table given below shows
that the average previous sewage contamination of the water delivered
by the <U+FB01>ve companies drawing their supply from the Thames during
the months of February and March, 1867, was 2466 parts in 100,000
of water, the amount calculated from the number of persons draining
into the river being as just mentioned 2250 parts in 100,000 of water.
As summer advances and aquatic vegetation becomes vigorous in the
bed of the Thames and its tributaries, this coincidence of calculated
and analytical results will doubtless be disturbed ; as the water plants
can scarcely fail to withdraw an appreciable amount of nitrates and
nitrites from the water, thus diminishing the amount of combined
nitrogen, and consequently of previous sewage contamination, as
determined by analysis.
    The second important class of impurities contained in water used
for domestic purposes consists, as above mentioned, of certain mineral
salts which possess the power of decomposing soap. These substances
are the hardening or soap-destroying constituents of waters; from a
purely sanitary point of view they are of less direct importance, than
the organic impurities, still by rendering e<U+FB02>icient ablution and thorough
cleanliness di<U+FB01>’icult of attainment, they doubtless indirectly affect the
health of communities supplied with waters in which they are present
in considerable quantities. The chief hardening ingredients in potable
waters are the salts of lime and magnesia. These salts decompose soap,
forming curdy and insoluble compounds containing the fatty acids of
the soap, and the lime and magnesia of the salts. So long as this
decomposition goes on the soap fails to produce a frothiness in the water,
 and is useless as adetergent; but when all the lime and magnesia salts
 have been decomposed by the action of the soap, the slightest further
addition of the latter produces a lather when the water is agitated, but
this lather is again destroyed by the addition of a further quantity of
the hard water. Thus the addition of hard water to a solution of soap,
or the reverse of this operation, causes the production of the insoluble
curdy matter above mentioned. Bearing this in mind, it is easy to

 120                      Professor Frankland                  [March 29,
 understand the process of washing the skin with soap and hard water,
 which may be thus described z-lst, the skin is wetted with the water,
 then soap is applied; the latter soon decomposes all the hardening salts
 contained in the small quantity of water with which the skin is covered,
 and there is then formed a strong solution of soap which penetrates into
 the pores of the skin. This is the process which goes on whilst a
 lather is being produced in washing, but now the lather requires to be
 removed from the skin. How can this be done? Obviously, only in
 one of two ways, viz. by wiping it off with a towel, or by rinsing it
 away with water. In the former case the pores of the skin are left
 <U+FB01>lled with soap solution, in the latter they become plugged up with
 the greasy cin'dy matter which results from the action of the hard
 water upon the soap solution occupying the pores of the cuticle. As
 the latter process of removing the lather is the one universally adopted,
 the operation of washing with soap and hard water is perfectly
 analogous to that used by the dyer or calico-printer when he wishes to
 <U+FB01>x a pigment in the pores of any tissue. He <U+FB01>rst introduces into the
tubes of the <U+FB01>bre of calico, for instance, a liquid containing one of the
ingredients necessary for the formation of the insoluble pigment, this
 is followed by another liquid containing the remaining necessary
ingredients; the insoluble pigment is then produced within the very
tubes of the cotton <U+FB01>bre, and is thus imprisoned'in such a manner as
to defy removal by subsequent washing. The process of ablution,
therefore, in hard water is essentially one of dyeing the skin with the
white, insoluble, greasy and curdy salts of the fatty acids contained in
 soap. The pores of the skin are thus blocked up, and it is only
because the insoluble pigment produced is white that such a repulsive
operation is tolerated‘. To those, however, who have been accustomed
to wash in soft water, the abnormal condition of the skin thus induced
is for a long time extremely unpleasant.
     Nevertheless, opinion is not quite unanimous as to the advantages
of soft water over hard: some persons consider hard water to be
necessary for the supply of the calcareous matter of the bones ; others
believe soft water to be peculiarly liable to attack and dissolve the
lead of the pipes through which it is conveyed, or of the cisterns in
which it is stored.
     An examination of the grounds upon which these opinions are
based would completely refute them; but the limits of this discourse
do not permit of such a digression, and I must therefore content
myelf with a mere allusion to one or two facts in connection with
them. First, as to the necessity of hard water for the supply of the
calcareous matter of bones. If it be assumed that a man drinks daily
half-a-gallon of Thames water, he obtains from it 3&- grains of lime,
chie<U+FB02>y in the form of chalk. This amounts to not quite three ounces
per annum, which does not seem to be a very large contribution to
bony matter. Now suppose the use of this water to be discontinued,
and that no part of it is replaced by bitter beer, which always con
tains far more lime in a given volume than Thames water; but we
will assume that the individual consumes one-third of a pint of milk

1867.]            on the Water Supply of the Metropolis.                121
per day, he then receives in this quantity of milk more lime than his
system can acquire from two quarts of Thames water. Then as to soft
Water attacking and dissolving lead and thus becoming poisonous ; it is
by no means true, as a general proposition, that soft water does attack
and dissolve this metal. The very soft water of Loch Ness, as supplied
to Inverness, does not attack lead, as evidenced by the condition of the
lead pipes which I now produce, and through some of which that water
<U+FB02>owed for six years; neither does the soft water of Ennerdale Lake, sup
plied to Whitehaven, attack lead. Even those soft waters which do attack
the metal, such as those now supplied to Glasgow and Manchester,
only do so when the surface of the lead is clean and bright. The
action soon ceases; in fact as soon as the metal becomes tarnished the
pipes are protected; and no complaints of any symptoms of lead
poisoning have, for the past ten years, been heard from these large
cities. Lastly, a sample of very soft water, taken from one of the
principal streams from which it is proposed to supply London, has
no action even upon clean and bright lead. Notwithstanding the
numerous researches made in connection with this subject, the causes
of the attack of lead by water have not yet been completely elucidated;
 it has, however, been established that the presence of oxygen and the
 comparative absence of carbonic acid in the dissolved gases are
 essential conditions to this action. Messrs. Graham, Miller, and
 Hofmann, in their report on the Metropolitan Waters in 1851, <U+FB01>rst
 showed that carbonic acid, when dissolved in water, was a complete
 protection against lead contamination, and from a series of experi
 ments recently made, I <U+FB01>nd that two volumes of carbonic acid dis
 solved in 100 volumes of water, completely protect even distilled
 water from such contamination. Rain water as it descends to the
 earth dissolves atmospheric gases, and this solution is afterwards
 continued in brooks and rivers. Of the chief atmospheric gases car
 bonic acid. is by far the most soluble ; 100 volumes of pure water can
  dissolve 100 volumes of this gas; oxygen, on the other hand, only
  dissolves to the extent of 3 volumes in 100 volumes of water. Never
  theless, owing to the much larger proportion of oxygen than of
  carbonic acid in atmospheric air (500:1), water takes up oxygen
  more rapidly than carbonic acid, and hence freshly fallen rain-water
  acts upon lead ; but when the water <U+FB02>ows a great distance through an
  open conduit, the carbonic acid absorbed <U+FB01>nally reaches the protecting
  proportion, and the action upon lead ceases, although the water retains
  its original softness. Hence there is no necessary connection between
  soft water and lead corrosion.     Even distilled water, left in contact
   with the air, for some time, loses its property of acting upon lead.
       The third class of impurities present in potable waters, viz. matters
  which are not expelled at a red heat, and which do not decompose
   soap, require no detailed notice; they consist chie<U+FB02>y of salts of the
   alkali metals, such as the sulphates and chlorides of potassium and
   sodium. Unless present in excessive quantity they are innocuous,
   both as regards the internal and external use of the water.

     The numbers in columns 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, all relate to
100,000 parts of the waters. Column No. 2 shows the total solid
impurity contained in each water as delivered from the Company’s
mains. No. 3 gives the amount of carbon contained in the organic
matter present in this solid impurity. No. 4, the amount of nitrogen
in the form of salts of nitric and nitrous acids. Column No. 5 shows
the amount of ammonia present in each sample, and column No. 6
records the total amount of nitrogen in the several forms of nitro
genous organic matter, salts of nitric and nitrous acids and ammonia,
whilst column No. 7 exhibits the previous sewage contamination
 estimated as above described. Column No. 8 shows the hardness of
 each water as estimated by the soap test ; that is, the number of parts
 of carbonate of lime, or its equivalent of other hardening salts con
tained in 100,000 parts of the water. Finally, column No. 9 gives
the amount of soap which it is necessary to add to 100,000 parts of
each water before a lather can be produced, this amount of soap
being thus wasted or destroyed in decomposing the hardening con
stituents of the water. It is usual to call each part of carbonate of
lime or its equivalent of other hardening material in 100,000 parts of
water, a degree of hardness."i Each degree of hardness indicates
the destruction of 12 parts of the best hard soap by 100,000 parts of
water.
     As an example of the mode of reading the above table, we may
take the Chelsea Company’s water, 100,000 lbs. of which contained,
in the month of February last, 28'58 lbs. of solid impurity; the
organic matter constituting a portion of this impurity contained
0433 lb. of carbon. This solid impurity also contained 0-337 lb. of
nitrogen in the shape of nitrates and nitrites, besides 0004 lb. of
ammonia; whilst the total amount of combined nitrogen in every form
was found to be 0371 lb. The above quantity of water as supplied
by the Chelsea Company had been, after its descent to the earth as
rain, contaminated with sewage or manure matter equivalent to
2420 lbs. of average London sewage. By gradual oxidation, partly in
the pores of the soil, partly in the Thames and its tributaries, and
partly in the reservoirs, <U+FB01>lters, and conduits of the Chelsea Water
Company, this sewage contamination had been entirely converted
into comparatively innocuous inorganic compounds before its delivery
to consumers. Finally, 100,000 lbs. of the said water contained
162 lbs. of carbonate of lime, or their equivalent of other hardening
ingredients ; whilst, if the water were used for washing, 100,000 lbs.
of it would occasion the waste of 194-4 lbs. of the best hard soap.
    * The degree of hardness more usually employed by_chemists is that <U+FB01>rst
proposed by Dr. T. Clark, viz. one grain of carbonate of ‘lune or its equivalent,
in one imperial gallon of water, or one part in 70,000 of water. ‘The degrees in
the above table harmonize better with the decimal arrangements of the rest of
the analytical results : they are readily converted into Clark's degrees by multi
plying by 7, and then moving the decimal point one place to the left.           '

      For the purpose of comparison I have also appended to the above
 table the results yielded by Loch Katrine water, as delivered in
 Glasgow, when submitted to the same analytical processes. A glance
 at the table will show how vastly superior is the quality of this water
 as compared with the best at present supplied to London. 100,000 lbs.
 of this water contain but 3'28 lbs. of solid impurity; it has no sewage
 contamination, previous or present, and it has only 0'3 degree of
 hardness, occasioning the destruction of only .36 lbs. of soap by
 100,000 lbs. of the water.
      Such is the chemical history of the water at present supplied to
 the metropolis; and it must be borne in mind that, grave as are its
 defects, the mode of the delivery of this water to consumers is still
 more defective. That in a densely-populated city, water should be deli
 vered only once and for a few minutes in twenty-four hours, and not at
 all on Sundays, is a condition of things utterly incompatible with the
 supply of wholesome and palatable water. Even if the water of Loch
 Katrine itself were delivered in London according to the system at
 present adopted by the metropolitan water companies, it would in
fallibly be rendered un<U+FB01>t for human consumption after twenty-four
hours’ exposure to the vile atmosphere and sewer gases in which the
water cisterns of London are systematically placed.
     The fundamental defects of our present water supply may be thus
 summed up :
           1. Great previous sewage contamination.
           2. Liability to present sewage contamination.
           3. Great hardness.
           4. Intermittent supply.

from the sources of the Severn and from the Cumberland Lakes have
not yet been submitted to the above analytical processes, and it is
therefore impossible to compare them in all respects with the present
metropolitan supply. The water of the Bala Lake, in North Wales,
which may be regarded as similar to that which would be supplied
by Mr. Bateman’s scheme, was examined by the late Dr. R. D.
Thomson, and the waters of the Cumberland Lakes have been more
elaborately investigated by Professor Way. From the analyses of
these chemists the following numbers are calculated :—
                                       Total
                                  solld impurity   Hardness. Soap destroyed.

table exhibits the great superiority of the proposed waters over those

at present supplied to London as regards total solid impurity and
soap-destroying ingredients, whilst it can scarcely be doubted that
waters obtained from such sources will be as free from deleterio
organic contamination as that of Loch Katrine.             _            '
     Amelz'o'rution of present Water Supply.—1n the event of a new
source of water supply being at once determined upon, at least seven
years must elapse before it can be rendered available to the metro
polis; it therefore becomes important to inquire how far it is possible
in the interim to ameliorate our present supply. The <U+FB01>rst and most
obvious improvement would be the substitution of the constant for the
intermittent system of delivery. With certain restrictions, all the
metropolitan companies express their willingness to make this change,
and with the unanimity of opinion regarding its advisability it is
di<U+FB01>icult to account for the delay in effecting it, unless it arise from
the paltry cost involved in the alteration of the present <U+FB01>ttings, which
would fall upon the landlords of small tenements. 'Most towns of
importance in Great Britain have been long supplied with water on
the constant system; why, then, is this boon denied to London, where
it is much more prgently required ‘2 Until this alteration is effected
it is, for the bulk of the population, almost useless to improve the
quality of the water. Where a supply for one or even two days has
to be stored in a <U+FB01>lthy butt, exposed to the foul atmosphere of a crowded
court or alley, good and wholesome Water can never reach the lips of
the consumers.
     The most formidable danger arising from the use of the present
water supply is undoubtedly the liability to actual sewage contamina
tion, such as that which there is every reason to believe destroyed so
many lives in the east of London last summer. How can we best
protect ourselves against this ‘noxious contamination? The answer is,
there is no absolutely reliable protection. Filtration through animal
charcoal is perhaps the best safeguard; but I have shown that this pro
 cess fails to remove from water the matter which is believed to constitute
cholera poison. Permanganate of potash is also an excellent puri<U+FB01>er
of water, but there is not the slightest evidence that this agent can
destroy cholera poison. Boiling the water for a short time is no
guarantee that its noxious qualities are destroyed; for, even on the
very probable supposition that cholera and other similar poisons are
organic germs, we know that many such germs, especially those which are
of a low type, retain their vitality after being boiled in water or even
after exposure to a temperature of 248° F. for a considerable time.
The late‘ Dr. Lindley mentions the fact of raspberry seeds germinating
after being boiled for jam ; and as syrup boils at a higher temperature
than water, these seeds must have been exposed to a heat considerably
higher than that of boiling water. Nearly twenty years ago a
curious red fungus or mould (Ot'dium aura'ntiacum) attacked the bread
of Paris. M. Payen exposed pieces of bread, upon which spores of
the fungus had been sown, for half an hour to 248° F. in tubes ; the
red fungus afterwards germinated, although its vitality was destroyed

when the temperature was raised to 284° F. I have undoubted
evidence of the production of violent cramps and diarrhoea by the
drinking of tea made from water which, previous to boiling, had
become contaminated with sewage.
    Nevertheless, whilst none of these methods can be relied upon for
the destruction of noxious organic matter in water, I am far from
wishing to discourage their use as measures of precaution. More
especially would I recommend <U+FB01>ltration through animal charcoal as a
most undoubted and valuable means of greatly reducing the amount of
organic matter in water. I <U+FB01>nd that water will readily pass through
a stratum of animal charcoal three feet thick, at the rate of 41,472 gallons
per day per square foot, the oxidizable organic matter contained in the
water being reduced to one-half. Five hundred tons of animal charcoal
would be an ample quantity through which thus to pass the whole of
the present metropolitan water supply. This at 131. per ton would
cost 6500l. This charcoal would require to be heated to redness
in retorts or ovens, for a couple of hours every six months. It
would last for two years, and would then be worth nearly half its
original cost as manure.                                 ,
    With regard to the excessive hardness of the London waters, it
does not appear that any practicable scheme of amelioration can be
contrived. Some twenty years ago a beautiful and very simple process
of softening hard waters by the addition of lime was devised by Dr.
Clark, of Aberdeen; but although this process has repeatedly been
tried by water companies, it has invariably been again abandoned,
since, notwithstanding the cheapness of the material employed, the
amount of carbonate of lime deposited by the London waters when
submitted to this treatment was, in the case of such vast volumes of
water, so enormous, as to cause the process to be pronounced imprac
ticable. It is to be feared, therefore, that we must for the present be
content to block up the pores of our skins with the greasy curd of
hard water; but it is very desirable that the other ameliorations of
which I have spoken should be carried out at once, although they
ought not to delay the introduction of a water-supply free from sewage
contamination. Such a supply is a priceless boon to a community; and
relying upon our experience in other cities, it is not too much to hope
that its introduction into London would be the means of banishing for
ever epidemic cholera from the capital of this country.

                        WILLIAM PENGELLY, Esq. F.R.S.
             On the Insulation of St. Michael's Mount, Cornwall.
THE opinion which at present prevails respecting the antiquity of
man is largely ascribable, either directly or indirectly, to the results
obtained, in 1858, from the exploration of the celebrated cavern on
Windmill Hill, at Brixham, in South Devon.             The entrances of this
cavern are in the slopes of the hill, 78 feet above the existing bottom
of the valley immediately beneath, and 100 feet above the level of
mean tide. Within the memory of persons still living this valley was
fully fifteen feet deeper than it is at present, it having been to that
extent filled up by the artificial lodgment of rubbish in order to the
formation of the principal thoroughfare to Brixham harbour. Prior
to this the tide occasionally flowed up the valley above the point
immediately below the cavern entrances.
     The natural bottom of the valley consisted of vegetable remains,
lying on and rooted in blue clay of unknown depth; being, in fact,
a portion of the submerged forest which covers a large part of the
bottom of Torbay, and which has been traced seaward to the five
fathoms line. Mixed with the vegetable remains, which are those of
such species of plants and trees as still exist in the neighbourhood,
have been found the bones of Elephas primigenius, Bos longifrons, red
deer, horse, and wild hog. Similar and coeval forests are well known
to exist on the opposite shores of the English, Bristol, and St. George's
Channels, as well as in other localities. They everywhere present

the same phenomena, among which may be specially mentioned large
vertical stumps of trees, with roots and rootlets ramifying to consider
able distances through the clay.
     From the character and arrangement of the materials found in the
cavern, it was obvious that they had been introduced by the action of
a small stream of water <U+FB02>owing persistently through it at a time when
the bottom of the valley was on the level of the cavern entrances.
     From the foregoing statements, it follows that since the cave
earth, containing the bones of extinct mammals and human implements,
was carried into the cavern, the following changes have been wrought
in the district :—
     1st and earliest. The depth of the valley was increased by at least
 one hundred feet.       4
     2nd. The excavated valley was partially re<U+FB01>lled by the lodgment
in it of a thick mass of blue clay.
     3rd. In this clay grew a forest which afforded food and shelter to
numerous animals, some of which belonged to species now extinct.
     4th. The entire country underwent a slow, tranquil, and uniform
 subsidence, to the extent of at least forty feet.
     Though the time required for and represented by these changes
must be great, it fails to <U+FB01>ll the interval between the present day and
the earliest traces of man in Dcvonshire; for since the last adjustment
 of the relative level of sea and land the waves have out back the cliffs
until they have formed a foreshore which, in some cases even where
the rocks are hard and crystalline, is more than half-a-mile in width.
This strand constitutes a <U+FB01>fth change since the advent of man in
south-western England. It is the object of this discourse to show
that the commencement of this, the most recent of the changes, must
have been long before the Christian era.            .
     It is well known that St. Michael’s Mount in Cornwall is an island
at every high water, and, with rare exceptions, a peninsula at every
low water. Its distance from Marazion Cliff, the nearest point of the
mainland, to spring-tide high-water mark on its own strand, is about
1680 feet. The tidal isthmus consists of the outcrop of highly in
clined Devonian slate and associated rocks, and in most cases is
covered with a thin layer of gravel or sand. At spring tides, in still
weather, it is at high water about twelve feet below, and at low water
six feet above, the sea level.      In <U+FB01>ne weather it is dry from four to
<U+FB01>ve hours every tide; but occasionally, during very stormy weather
and neap tides, it is impossible to cross from the mainland for two or
three days together.
     The Mount. isv an outlier of granite, measuring at its base about
‘<U+FB01>ve furlongs in circumference, and rising to the height of 195. feet
above mean tide. At high water it plunges abruptly into the sea,
except on the north or landward side, where the granite comes into
contact with the slate. Here there is a small plain occupied by a
village ; adjacent to which is the harbour, which was built in 172631,
and is capable of receiving ships of 500 tons burden.                    ‘

130                        Mr. Pengelly on the                     [April 5,
    The country immediately behind or north of the town of Marazion,
consists of Devonian strata traversed by traps and elvans, and attains
a considerable elevation. The town stands on a small plain, which
terminates in a cliff from twelve to twenty feet high. Judging from
the cliff, the plain is a subaerial accumulation of fragments of rock
derived from the adjacent hill, and embedded, without any approach
to regularity of arrangement, in a yellowish clay, which probably forms
no more than from 30 to 40 per cent. of the entire mass.
    It is obvious that, all other things being the same, the Mount
would be a permanent peninsula if the district were raised twelve feet,
and always an island if it were six feet lower. It must have been the
former during the growth of the well-known adjacent submerged forest;
and its insulation was necessarily the result either of the subsidence
by which the 'forest area was carried below the sea level, or of a
subsequent retreat of the coast line in consequence of the wasting
action of the waves.
    There can be no doubt that the Marazion plain is somewhat ill
adapted, if much exposed, to resist the encroaching tendency of the sea;
the vertical cliff in which it terminates suggests the idea that the
waves have shorn it of some part of its area, and this suggestion is
apparently strengthened by the fact that in some places the cliff is
bounded by a sea-wall. A careful study of the plain, however, shows
that though the space between its margin and some of the Marazion
houses is scarcely a yard broad, the wall is so very slender as to
indicate that it could never have been intended, and was not expected,
to be called on to resist powerful attempts at encroachment. More
over, several parts of thercli<U+FB02>‘ have never had any arti<U+FB01>cial protection,
and these have not retreated, even to the extent of a single inch, more
than those which are defended by the wall.
    Again, the only quarter from which destructive waves can be sent
to this part of the coast, is that included Within the quadrant of the
horizon between south-west and south-east, and on this side they are
so e<U+FB01>'ectually intercepted by the Mount as to render it probable that
the cli<U+FB02>’s have wasted scarcely more rapidly than has the natural
granitic breakwater which defends them. From information furnished
by intelligent natives, familiar with the district during the last seventy
<U+FB01>ve years, it appears that there has been no loss of area in that time; but
east of it, where the Mount affords no shelter, there has been a “ great
loss of Ian ,” which, on being measured under their directions, was
found to have been at the rate of about thirty-three feet in a century.
    If, from the foregoing data, the retrocession of the sheltered cliffs
be taken at ten feet in a century-probably a high estimate-the
Mount cannot have become an island within the last 16,800 years;
and it must be borne in mind that on the hypothesis of insulation by
encroachment, at present under review, the submergence of the forests
was still earlier.
    Geologists have called attention to the fact that the “ Greens,” or
sand-banks which form the coasts immediately east and west of

 1867.]         Insulation of St. Michael’s Mount, Cornwall.           131
 Penzance-the former extending almost to the Mount—have wasted at
 a rate greatly exceeding any of the <U+FB01>gures just given. According to
 Dr. Boase, the western “ Green ” has, during the last 150 years, lost
 about a foot in breadth annually. To apply this rate to the Marazion
 plain, however, would be utterly fallacious, for the “ Greens ” consist
 of loose sand exposed to the unchecked fury of the waves. Moreover,
 there is a difference of opinion as to the cause of this waste. Mr.
 Edmonds, a native writer of considerable experience, states that “in
 the course of the year the sea always deposits more than it withdraws.
 The great cause of the lessening of the banks appears to be the
 constant abstraction of the adjacent sand and pebbles, between low and
 high water, for manure, ballast, road-making, building, and other
 purposes.”
     Though the hypothesis of insulation by encroachment carries back
the era of submergence fully 17,000 years from the present time, the
rival supposition, that the severance of the Mount from the mainland
was simply the result of the subsidence of the country, leaves the
chronology of the event an open question. It may have happened in
more recent or in more modern times, but it must not be forgotten
that the forests, which the subsidence carried down, go back to the
mammoth era.                                             ,
     History, however, a<U+FB02>'ords some evidence on the question. St.
Keyna is said to have made a pilgrimage to the Mount, and there to
have met St. Cadoc, another pilgrim, about the year 490. An appari
tion of St. Michael was seen on the Mount in 495, or, as some assert,
in 710.    It is of no avail to object that, at least, the latter event is
improbable. The well-established fact that its occurrence was taught
and believed, warrants the opinion that the monkish chroniclers care
fully recorded every great event connected with a spot so sacred, and
that they would have certainly mentioned so important an occurrence
as its severance from the mainland. Nor was the belief in this sanctity
of brief duration. In 1044, Edward the Confessor granted a charter
to a body of monks already established there, and in 1079, Pope
Gregory VII. granted a remission of a third of their penance to all
persons who should visit the Church of St. Michael at the Mount,
with oblations and alms.
     From detailed descriptions still in existence, it appears that the
dimensions of the Mount, and its distance from the mainland, were'
in the 16th and 15th centuries, much the same as at present. Leland
(1533 to ’40) says, “ the cumpace of the roote of the Mont of S.
Michael is not dim” (half) “ myle about.” William of Worcester
(1461 to ’82) estimates the distance from Marazion to the foot of the
Mount to be “ 700 steppys,” and as he states that the length of St.
Michael’s Church was “30 steppys,” and of the new chapel was
“ 40 feet or 20 steppys,” it is obvious that according to his measure
ment the church was 60 feet long. Now the church is still intact,
and measures 65 feet 3 inches in length, so that, making the cor
responding correction, the space between the mainland and the

132                       Mr. Pengelly on the                    [April 5,
Mount, instead of 1400 feet, as he estimated, would be 1522 feet. It is
idle, however, to insist on even a near approach to accuracy in his
<U+FB01>gures, the probability being that at most he only “stopped” the
intorspace, and there being no evidence respecting the terminal points
of the distance thus roughly measured. Nevertheless, the statement
is su<U+FB01>icient to show that the condition of the Mount is now essentially
the same as it was four centuries ago, and that the rate of waste has
been almost inappreciably slow.
    Bishop Lacy, on August 10, 1425, “considering the great losses
of vessels and of lives during the storms in Mount’s Bay, encouraged
the faithful to complete the stone causeway between Maraziou and St.
Michael's Mount ;” whence it appears that the Mount harbour was
then the only one in the bay. that a considerable trade was carried on
there, that the condition of the Mount was as fully exposed as it is at
present, and that the “causeway,” apparently begun, was not a mere
footpath to be used at low water, but was intended as a permanent
protection for ships.
    The earliest passage, however, believed to be descriptive of the
Mount, is the famous one in Diodorus Siculus (9 B. 0.). Having
given a description of Britain, that author says, “ Now we shall speak
something concerning the tin that is dug and gotten there. They
that inhabit the British promontory of Bclerium” (Land’s End), “ by
reason of their converse with merchants, are more civilized and
courteous to strangers than the rest are, These are the people that
make the tin, which, with a great deal of care and labour, they dig out
of the ground, and that being rocky, the metal is mixed with some
veins of earth, out of which they melt the metal, and then re<U+FB01>ne it;
then they cast it into square pieces like a die, and carry it to a British
isle near at hand called Iktis; for at low tide, all being dry between
them and the island, they convey over in carts an abundance of tin in
the meantime. (There is one thing peculiar to those islands which
lie between Britain and Europe, for at full sea they appear to be
islands, but at low water for a long way they look like so many
peninsulas.) Hence the merchants transport the tin they buy of the
inhabitants to Gaul; and for thirty days’ journey they carry it in
packs on horses’ backs through Gaul to the mouth of the river
Rhone.”
    From this passage it may be inferred that the account was copied
from a description by some one who had visited Britain; that the
Iktis was near the Land’s End; that no place in the district afforded
superior accommodation and shelter for maritime trade; that it was
adjacent to the tin country; and that it was the only commercial
station in Britain, or that all others were comparatively recent. To
these conclusions it may be added that the Mount answers admirably
in every respect to the description of the Iktis ; that besides it there
is no island which can be supposed to have been the spot described
by the historian ; and that the geographical changes which have taken
place in the Lands End district within the last 2000 years have

 been scarcely appreciable or enormously great according as the Mount
 is or is not the Iktis.
     Notwithstanding the close agreement between them, writers are
 much divided respecting their identi<U+FB01>cation. It is, perhaps, note
 worthy, that those who are conversant with the geology of Cornwall
 admit the claims of the Mount, whilst most archaeologists deny them.
 The sceptics, moreover, are much divided amongst themselves, some
advocating the pretensions of the Isle of Wight; others, those of St.
Nicholas Island in Plymouth Sound ; the Black Rock at the entrance
of Falmouth Harbour, which is submarine from about half-<U+FB02>ood to
half-ebb, and has never less than three fathoms of water around it;
or the Wolf Rock, about 8 miles S.W. of the nearest land in Corn
wall, and which is covered at every high water.
     Setting aside all other considerations, it seems fatal to the pre
tensions of the Isle of Wight, St. Nicholas Island, and the Black
Rock, that they are immediately adjacent to excellent harbours, of
which the traders would probably have availed themselves rather than
 of semi-insulated stations near them, to which tin could have been
taken in carts at certain states of the tide only.
     The following are amongst the objections which have been made
to the claims of the Mount :
     1. That the tidal strand is too limited to be called a “long way.”
     2. That the Mount is not large enough for the trade of which the
 Iktis was the seat.
     3. That it is a solitary rock of the kind, whilst Diodorus speaks
not of an island, but of islands.                               '
     4. That in the Gonfessor‘s Charter it is described as near the sea,
not in it.
     5. That in Domesday Book it is stated to have been much larger
than it is now.
     6. That, according to its ancient British name, it was situated
within a wood since the British language was <U+FB01>rst spoken in Corn
wall.
     7. That several early authors speak of a great loss of land in the
district.                                           .
     8. That this loss is con<U+FB01>rmed by the character of the sea bottom
between the Land’s End'and Scilly, and by articles which have been
recovered thence.
     9. That it is also con<U+FB01>rmed by certain family traditions.
     These objections will be considered in the order in which they
stand.
     1. “ Long” and “ short” are comparative terms. To a geographer
accustomed to the feeble tides of the Mediterranean, a breadth of 1680
feet left dry at low water would undoubtedly appear to be a “ long way.”
     2. It was not the ore, but the smelted tin which was taken to the
Iktis. Unless the early trade in this metal greatly exceeded that» in
modern times, thatthe Mount was much larger than was required for
all the tra<U+FB02>ic may be safely inferred from the following statement,

 134                        Mr. Pengelly on the                   [April 5,
 made in 1838 by the late Mr. Davis Gilbert, a native and resident of
 Cornwall, and sometime President of the Royal Society :—“ At the foot
 of the Mount a small pier existed from a time probably anterior to the
 monastery itself ; but, in the early part of the last century a lease on
 lives was granted to Mr. George Blewctt. . . . This gentleman
 rebuilt the pier on a very enlarged scale, and concentrated here almost
 the whole commerce of Penwith hundred, which has since his time
 gone to Penzance and Hayle.”
     3. The Mount is by no means a solitary rock of its kind. Within
 seventy miles east of it, there are certainly four that actually are, or
 probably were within the last 1900 years, precisely similar though
 slightly larger islands—Looe Island, St. Nicholas Island, the Mew
.stone, and Borough Island.
     4. In the Confessor’s Charter the Mount is stated to be “ juwta mare.”
 This is usually translated near the sea, but it would, perhaps, be more
 correctly rendered next, or, as Dr. Barham observes, by the sea, when,
 in either case, it would be a correct description of the present position
 of the spot.
     5. In Domesday Book (1086), “ The Land of St. Michael” in
 “ Cornvalge ” is stated at “ two hides ”—supposed to be not less than
 240 acres. At present the Mount measures about seven acres only,
 and it could have been but very little, if at all larger, in William of
 \Vorcester’s time. There are, however, at least four St. Michaels in
 Cornwall, and it is assumed rather than proved that the St. Michael of
the Survey is the Mount.         But waiving this point, it is not the
acreage of the immediate vicinage, but the property of the Church,
wherever situated, which is described.
     6. It is frequently asserted that Florence of Worcester, who died in
 1188, mentioned the Mount under an old British name which signi<U+FB01>es
 that the spot itself was formerly in a wood. This is incorrect, as
 Florence does not once allude to the Mount.        The error, no doubt,
arose from confounding Florence with William of Worcester, who
lived fully 350 years later. The alleged British name, which appears
 to have been <U+FB01>rst mentioned by Carew in 1602, assumes so many
forms, and there is so much uncertainty about its exact import, as to
render it improbable that it is of any value as evidence. But accept
ing the prevalent translation—-“ the boar rock in the wood”——three
different explanations have been suggested. First, that the name was
given by a people who spoke British, and who were contemporaries of
the wood which surrounded the Mount. There is no doubt that man
existed in south-western England when the forests, now submerged,
were sub-aerial, and within one of which the Mount must have stood;
—his tools have been foimd in these forests, and also in the more
ancient cavern deposits. But to suppose the name to be older than
the subsidence, is to suppose the British language coeval with the
mammoth, whose‘ remains have been found in the forests, but not in
the lake-dwellings of Switzerland or the kitchen-middens of Denmark,
and which, so far as is at present known, did not outlive the Age of

1867.]         Insulation of St. Michael‘s Mount, Cornwall.            135
Bronze,-an antiquity so great as to render it eminently improbable
that any philologer could now give a trustworthy translation of a
language then spoken in this country.
    The second suggestion is that the name was not contemporary with
the submerged woods, but was given whilst the British language was
spoken, in consequence of trees which grew on the Mount itself in its
present condition; or because the Marazion plain and adjacent low
lands were formerly well wooded, when the Mount, seen from the sea,
or from the opposite side of the bay, would appear to be in a wood.
It has also been suggested that the “ hoar rock” was originally not
the Mount itself, but a wood-surrounded rocky cairn on it, and that the
name <U+FB01>rst given to a part was ultimately applied to the whole.
Amongst the objections to each of these guesses there is the fatal one,
that, so far as is known, the idea of loss of area is older than the name.
As has been stated, the latter is <U+FB01>rst mentioned by Carew in 1602,
whilst William of Worcester, more than a century before, speaking of
the Mount, terms it “Monte Tumba antea vocata to Here role in the
wodd ;” and that he understood it to imply a loss of area is evident
from his subsequent statement that the Mount was “ originally inclosed
with a very thick wood, distant from the ocean six miles, affording the
<U+FB01>nest shelter for wild beasts.” It is obvious that this description can
apply only to times anterior not only to the <U+FB01>fteenth, but to the
eleventh century; for, whatever may be the exact import of the phrase,
the Mount was “junta mare” in 1044. The era of the topography which
William described, but of which he records no evidence, was separated
from his day by an interval of time wider than that which divides him
from us. Leland (1533 to ’40) says, “ Ther hath been much Land
devourid betwixt Pensanoles and Mousehole. Ther is an old Legend
   . . . . a Tounlet in this Part (now defaced and) lying under the
Water.” He subsequently states that, “ In the Bay betwyxt the Mount
and Pensants be found nere the lowe Water marke Rootes of Trees yn
dyvers Places, as a token of the Grounde wasted,” and thus furnishes
the earliest known mention of the submerged forest, as well as
of evidence of loss of area. Carew (1602) having stated that the Mount
is termed by “ the Cornishmen Cara Gouz in Clowze, that is the boar
Rock in the Wood,” adds, in a note, “ Tradition tells us that in former
ages the Mount was part of the insular continent in Britain, and dis
joined from it by an inundation or encroachment of the sea, some
earthquake or terrestrial concussion. To prove this opinion, the
country people tell us that oak trees have been found under the
sand.”                         '
    The third explanation of the alleged British name is suggested by
a consideration of the foregoing quotations.
    There is <U+FB01>rst a tradition of a loss of area which took place at least
<U+FB01>ve centuries previously. Seventy years later the tradition or, as the
recorder calls it, the “ old legend” is repeated, and with it, and as a
proof of its truth, the earliest mention of a submerged forest. Seventy
years later still, the same tradition and proof, causes assigned in such

136                        Zllr. Pengelly on the                  [April 5,
terms as to prove the cause unknown and the fact unrecorded, and,
from materials derived from a language hastening to extinction, there
is somewhat clumsily manufactured a name supposed to express the
early topography. At low tide the remains of a forest were seen on
the strand, in a condition which proved that the trees were in situ, and
that there had been a subsidence. To the mind‘s eye the area was re
elevated, the Mount became surrounded with trees = a “ hoar rock in
a wood” = “ Garreg Luz en Kuz.”
    7. To his other statements, William of Worcester adds, but gives
no evidence, that there were “ 140 parish churches submerged between
the Mount and Scilly.” Wore this assertion accepted it would follow
that after Cornwall was christianized (not earlier than the <U+FB01>fth century)
and divided into parishes, but prior to the Confessor’s Charter, there
had been lost 140 parishes, having, according to the existing average
in the adjacent hundred of Penwith, an aggregate area of 830 square
miles, or twice that required to <U+FB01>ll the space between the Cornish
coast and a line joining the Lizard with Scilly. A loss so enormous
that it is impossible to believe that the monkish chroniclers, laboriously
minute as they were, especially in all things affecting the Church,
would have omitted to record it, happening, as it must, within or near
their own times.
    8. Carew, in proof of this subsidence between the Land’s End and
Scilly, states that “ this space carrieth continually an equal depth of
forty or sixty fathoms (a thing not usual in the sea’s proper dominions),”
and that “ <U+FB01>shermen also casting their hooks thereabouts, have drawn
up pieces of doors and windows.” It is not easy to see the force of
the <U+FB01>rst statement; moreover, it exceeds the truth, the depth being
from thirty to forty fathoms. It would be awkward, however, to accept
this proof, as it would prove also that prior to the submergence there
could have been no English Channel. The second statement could
only be entertained by one who had never re<U+FB02>ected on the power of the
Atlantic waves.
    9. The legends and crests of the families of Trevillian and Vyvyan
are also cited to prove the subsidence. The Herald’s Of<U+FB01>ce is a some
what novel court for the settlement of a question in physical science.
    Of those who believe in the comparatively recent insulation of the
Mount, a few ascribe it to encroachment of the sea without change of
level; but the great majority contend for a general subsidence. As
may be expected, the latter diifer as to the date of the event. The late
Dr. Borlase (1756) favoured the end of March, AD. 830, when, as the
Irish annals say, an inundation happened on the west coast of Cork,
but which is not recorded to have visited any other locality. Others
prefer the very destructive “ great sea <U+FB02>ood ” which, according to the
Saxon Chronieler, Florence of Worcester, and William of Malmcsbury,
occurred in 1014, on Michaelmas eve, or near the equinox. The preva
lent opinion, however, strongly inclines to “a very high tide” men
tioned by the same three historians as happening on St. Martin’s day,
1099. Malmesbury speaks of it as very destructive on the banks of the

1867.]          Insulation of St. Michael’s Mount, Cornwall.           137
Thames ; the other‘ a'uthors speak of the great injury it wrought, but
there is no evidence of its extending beyond the Thames. The
Chronicler says, “ The same day was the <U+FB01>rst of the new moon ; ” hence
it has been remarked that it was not the highest spring tide, and that,
being in November, it was not near the equinox. One of the highest
tides, however, which, during the present century, have visited the
south-west of England, occurred on the 26th October, 1859, the day of
new moon.         _
    It does not fall within the scope of the present discourse to enter
on a consideration of such questions as “Did the Pheenicians ever
carry on trade with Cornwall by way of the Straits of Gibraltar ‘3"
“ Where were the Cassiterides ‘3” “Was tin ever wrought in Scilly ‘9”
or “Was the tin taken from Cornwall to the continent directly, or
coastwise to the Isle of Wight, or some other near point?” With
reference to the last, however, it may be remarked, in passing, that a
block of tin which, answering well to the description by Diodorus,
was dredged up near Falmouth harbour upwards of forty years ago,
appears to suggest that the route was, at least, occasionally coastwise.
    In conclusion, and by way of recapitulation: St. Michael’s Mount
has undergone no important change during the last four centuries;
there is no su<U+FB01>icient evidence that it has done so since the Christian
era; those whose habit and interest it was to record such an occurrence
are silent on the question; it affords the requisite shelter, and is
abundantly large enough for the storage and shipment of the early
Cornish tin, and for the tra<U+FB01>ic consequent thereon; it possesses all
the characters, and‘ occupies the position of the Iktis of Diodorus,
and no other existing island has any claim to this distinction ; nineteen
centuries ago it possessed a safe harbour, so that its insulation must
have been effected long before; it was at one time unquestionably a
“hoar rock in a wood,” but in all probability it had ceased to be so
long before any language now known to scholars was spoken in the
district. Prior to its insulation, was the era of the growth of the
forests now submerged along our entire sea-bord. Before this, again,
was the period of the deposition of the blue clay—tl1e forest soil:
earlier still, was the epoch of the excavation or re-excavation of the
valleys, in whose bounding hills are the caverns of South Devon; and
when, still farther into the past, the bottoms of the valleys were at
least 100 feet above their present level, the red loam was carried into
the caverns, and there were also introduced evidences of contemporary
men. Great as is the age of these cavern deposits, it does not exceed
the antiquity of man in Devonshire, and hence, in all probability, it falls
far short of the antiquity of man.

SIR HENRY HOLLAND, Bart. M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. President, in the

                        DIRECTOR OF THE KEW OBSERVATORY.
                    On the Sun as a Variable Star.
Tun man of science who would extend his inquiries into the remoter
regions of the universe is beset from the <U+FB01>rst, with the following
di<U+FB01>iculty.
    How is he to know that the laws with which he is here familiar
hold in those distant regions?
    Now, without attempting to discuss the origin of our beliefs, it
may be inferred that the same principle which induces us to think
that the laws of light which were proved to be true to-day will hold
     to-morrow,
truetrue
be       here willinduces   us likewise to believe that what is proved
                    hold elsewhere.                                I      to
    But while we are all, without exception, led by an innate belief in
unity of design to attribute the same fundamental laws to different
regions of the universe, it is only lately that we have been informed
of a similarity or rather identity which we had no previous reason to
expect.
    Spectrum analysis, that very powerful and searching method of in
vestigation, while it informs us of great varieties in the molecular con
stitution of different regions of the universe, seems to proclaim the fact
that the elemental forms of matter are greatly the same throughout,
and that familiar substances, such as sodium, magnesium, and iron,
with which we are here so well acquainted, form also the staples of
other worlds.                                                '
    A study of binary stars has likewise shown that the law of gravi
tation is not the peculiar attribute of our solar system, and we may
entertain the hope that as our knowledge extends the appearance of
resimblance between ourselves and distant regions will extend along
wit it.
    In <U+FB01>ne, there can be little doubt that we are to-day in a position
to argue with more con<U+FB01>dence regarding these regions than we were
<U+FB01>fty years ago, and that we may assume that the laws of heat and light
are the same throughout the universe. If this principle be allowed,
the discussion of the varying brightness of certain stars, and it may

 1867.]               on the Sun as a Variable Star.                  139
be of our own sun, is one which we can approach with great hope
fulness.
     Indeed, we are now by means of this principle enabled to limit
 the number of the immediate causes of this change of light, and to
 say the change must be due to one or other of these causes. Now,
when these various causes are examined one by one there is a tendency
in the mind to reject certain of these and to prefer others, apart
altogether from the results of observation; and this is one of those
tendencies which, if it is indulged in with distrust, ought not to be
 wholly discarded.
     But, while attempting to exhibit this evening this method of selec
 tion, and to hit upon the most probable cause of variable luminosity,
it becomes us all, as disciples of the school of Bacon, to see what
 observation has to say to our selection; does this ultimate court of
 appeal con<U+FB01>rm our conclusions or does it not?
     [The phenomena presented by variable stars were then described;
 and it was next argued, from the ten-yearly period of sun-spots that
 our own luminary is a variable star. The photographs of sun-spots
 were also exhibited on a screen by aid of the electric light]
     Let us now proceed to the subject of the diminution of light which
 characterizes variable stars, and according to the principles already
 stated, see what such a diminution most probably implies. Two cases
 may be discussed under this head, according as the temperature may
 be supposed to remain constant or to change. First,—If the tempera
 ture remains constant, then a change of light implies a change of the
 surface or of the state of the heated body. This was illustrated by
 two simple experiments. In the <U+FB01>rst of these a ball of iron marked
 with chalk, and a piece of porcelain of a black and white pattern, both
 heated to redness, were viewed in the dark, and the White of both was
 found to be less luminous than the black, thereby proving that change
‘of the re<U+FB02>ecting power of the surface produces change of luminosity,
 even although the temperature be the same. In the second experi
 ment it was shown, by means of the oxyhydrogen <U+FB02>ame viewed by
 itself and then directed against a piece of lime, that a solid substance
 gives out much more heat and light than a gas at the same tempera
 ture, and thus that a change of state may be expected to produce a
 change of luminosity.
     If, therefore, a solid or liquid substance change suddenly from a
 black to a white or re<U+FB02>ecting surface, or if it become gaseous, it will
 decrease in luminosity.
     It was then argued that we cannot readily suppose the variable
 luminosity of certain stars to be caused by a periodical change of
 surface from white to black and vice cersd.
     On the other hand, if we assume (as is most probable) that the
 photosphere of a star consists of incandescent, detached particles
 similar to a cloud, we may well imagine this cloud-surface to contract
 or expand in the atmosphere of the star, so as to present a variable
area to a distant observer. Mr. De la Rue and some others, including

1&0                          Mr. Balfour Stewart                 [April 12,
the speaker, entertain a suspicion that something of this kind may
possibly take place with regard to our sun, although to a very small
extent; but this is not proved. In the meantime, suf<U+FB01>ce it to say, such
an explanation will not account for a variability analogous to sun
spots ; and to account for these and similar phenomena, we must look
for some other explanation. We may therefore take it for granted
that a change of surface or of state, without a change of temperature,
will not account for the phenomena of variability, in as far as these are
similar to sun-spots.
    A change of luminosity may, however, take place in another way,
even while the temperature of the hot body remains constant. It may
be caused by the interposition of a cold absorbing screen between the
source of light and the observer.
     Under this head may be ranked one hypothesis regarding stellar
variability, which supposed the decrease of luminosity to be caused by
a dark body of great size coming between the star and our earth.
The probability of such a body being in an exact line between the star
and the earth is, however, very small; and as our system is supposed
to move in space, we should soon escape its interference, unless its size
was supposed to be enormously large. This is not likely; and if
stellar variability is caused by such a screen, the screen must be sup
posed to lie close to the star—in fact, vto be connected with the star
itself, and to form part of the atmosphere of the star.
     The second case of varying luminosity is that in which the tem
perature may be supposed to change; and here evidently a decrease
of luminosity implies a decrease of temperature.
     If we imagine that stellar variability is caused by a decrease of tem
perature, we are led to contemplate two possible causes of this decrease.
     In the <U+FB01>rst place, there may be supposed to be some chemical or
molecular change periodically recurring, which produces a marked
decrease of temperature. Evaporation on an extensive scale might
account for it ; but the same objection applies here as before, when we
considered change of surface.
     We have 'not the shadow of a proof that such processes are
periodically going on in the sun or any star ; and we do not get rid of
our burden by this means, but merely, as it were, shift it from one
shoulder to another.
     Now, if we do not readily admit that the supposed fall of tempera
ture is produced by some such process, we can only account for it by
the redistribution of some previously existing comparatively cold
matter; and this comparatively cold matter must be either on one side,
under, or above (by under is meant nearer the centre).
     It has been supposed by some that this cold matter might be to one
side ; that, in fact, a star might have one hemisphere cold and the other
hot: so that, if it revolved round an axis, the e<U+FB01>'ect produced on a
distant spectator would be that of a varying brightness. The difficulty
in this idea is two-fold. In the <U+FB01>rst place, we cannot easily conceive
such an extremely arti<U+FB01>cial distribution of heat ; and even if this

 1867.]                on the Sun as a variable Star.                   141
could be conceived, we could not imagine that it would be a permanent
one. This, therefore, is an unlikely hypothesis.
     Next, the idea has been entertained that the comparatively cold
matter whose re-distribution we are at present supposing, exists below,
or nearer the centre of a sun or star than its luminous envelope; and
the fact that sun-spots appear to be depressions, has given countenance
to this idea; but if we imagine that the sun or star has been for a
very long period of time surrounded by this luminous envelope, we
shall have great di<U+FB02>iculty in imagining the interior to be colder than
it. As far as we can judge from terrestrial experiments, a body
surrounded with a heated envelope, such as that of the sun, will
ultimately have in all its parts the temperature of this envelope. We
cannot, therefore, readily assent to this hypothesis, although it might
add the sun and stars to the list of habitable worlds.
    Now, if the colder matter, whose re-distribution we are supposing,
come neither from one side‘ nor from below, it must come from above;
that is to say, above the luminous envelope of the sun and stars we
must have colder matter.
     Thus we see that if we consider the decrease of luminosity to be
due to the presence, between the source of light and the observer, of
a comparatively cold, absorbing body, we are driven to an atmosphere ;
and if we consider the decrease of luminosity to be due to a decrease
of temperature, we are still driven to look to an atmosphere as the
immediate cause.
    We must now bring our results to the test of observation, and ask :
What reason have we, in the <U+FB01>rst place, for assuming the existence of
solar and stellar atmospheres ‘P and in the second, What reason have
we for supposing the decrease of luminosity to be immediately caused
by an increased action of this atmosphere ‘2 Now, in the sun we have
various proofs of the existence of a comparatively cold, absorbing
atmosphere above the luminous envelope.
    (1.) The existence of dark lines in the spectra of the sun and
            certain stars denotes the existence in these bodies of a com
            paratively cold, absorbing atmosphere above the luminous
            envelope.                              _
    (2.) The existence of such an atmosphere surrounding our own
           luminary is indicated by the fact that the sun’s limb is less
            bright than his centre; this effect being, no doubt, caused by
            an absorbing atmosphere, and being greatest round the edge,
            for the same reason that any similar e<U+FB02>‘ect of our own at
            mosphere is greatest near the horizon.
   (3.) Finally, the presence of a solar atmosphere extending as far
            as 72,000 miles above the bright surface, is indicated by
            the presence of those red <U+FB02>ames which occur during a total
            eclipse of the sun. These red <U+FB02>ames have been proved by
            Mr. De la Rue to belong to our luminary, while, from the
            nature of the light which they emit, we may infer (although
            this is not yet proved) that the heated matter is gaseous.

142                          Mr. Balfour Stewart                 [April 21,
    We now come to consider what observational evidence there is
that the changes of luminosity in the sun's disc are due to the e<U+FB02>'ects
cooling, absorbing, or both together, of a greater or less stratum of
atmosphere.
    In the <U+FB01>rst place (under this head), there is abundant evidence
that the luminous surface of the sun does not consist of one uniform
mass of incandescent, solid, or liquid matter, it is neither land nor
ocean, but it is a cloud. The proof of this assertion is derived from
the behaviour of certain bright patches, or faculse, as they are called,
which appear near the sun’s border, and generally accompany a spot
or dark patch. The brightness, when near the border of these faculse,
denotes that they have escaped, in a great measure, the absorbing in
<U+FB02>uence of the solar atmosphere, which in<U+FB02>uence is very strong near
the border ; in other words, they are elevated above a great portion of
this atmosphere, and as they remain suspended for some time, they
cannot be heavy matter. Indeed, masses of luminous matter have
 been known to sail across a spot evidently above it, and leaving it
afterwards quite undisturbed.
    Now, if we imagine the bright surface of the sun to be acloud
surface, or surface of condensation of small particles in contradistinc
tion to a solid or liquid heavy surface, we at once, by such an
hypothesis, greatly increase the freedom of action. Such a boundary
might easily be depressed by the accumulation of an enormous down
rush of cold atmosphere, or it might be raised above its ordinary level,
and, generally speaking, would be more impressible than a continuous
solid or liquid surface.
    Again, if we view a spot as the centre of a disturbance of some
kind, it is, in the <U+FB01>rst place, worthy of remark that the facula: or bright
portions which accompany a spot for the most part fall behind, as far
as rotation is concerned, a fact which has been shown in the solar
researches of Messrs. De la Rue, Stewart, and Loewy. Now, this
would always take place in the case of a body carried. from a lower
region to a higher one, or from a region possessing less to one possess
ing greater absolute velocity of rotation. We are, therefore, induced
to suppose that faculse are masses which have been carried upwards
from the area of disturbance, and have thus fallen behind.
    So much for the up-rush of matter or the ascending current ; and
now, it may be asked, have we any evidence that a spot is a descending
current ‘?
    We have evidence of a precisely similar character to that we have
for faculae, and we are entitled to conclude, from the observations of
sun-spots made by Carrington, that spots, instead of falling behind, as
far as rotation is concerned, move forward as if they had come from a
higher region.
    Also Lockyer, one of our sun-observers in this country, noticed a
piece of matter in the very act of moving down. It was <U+FB01>rst of all as
bright as the faculae, then it became like the ordinary surface, then it
grew dark like the spot itself, still retaining its identity of form.

  1867.]               on the Sun as a Variable Star.                  143
      It would thus appear that the comparatively cold, absorbing at
 mosphere is accumulated above the area occupied by a spot, while the
 faculae are so high up as to escape its in<U+FB02>uence; and <U+FB01>nally, we are
 led to conclude that all the variations in brightness that appear on the
 surface of our luminary are due to the presence, to a greater or less
 extent, of a comparatively cold, absorbing atmosphere.
      We thus perceive that the phenomena of variability, as far as these
 are analogous to sun-spots, are due, most probably, to a greater or less
 amount of a comparatively cold, absorbing atmosphere.
      A down-rush and a corresponding up-rush would thus appear to
 be the immediate cause of these spots; yet why, it may be asked,
 have these phenomena a periodicity? Why is there a ten-yearly
 period of sun-spots besides other probable periods ?
     At the same time, the following question arises, Why are sun
 spots con<U+FB01>ned to the equatorial regions of the sun, which are also
 those regions which border upon the ecliptic or plane of the planets’
 motion?
     Arguing possibly from this fact, the illustrious Galileo seems to
 have imagined a connection between sun-spots and planetary con
 <U+FB01>gurations; but he did not publish his ideas, probably from Want of
evidence.
     In order to obtain as much information as possible on this point,
 Messrs. De la Rue, Stewart, and Loewy have measured the areas of
 all the spots in Carrington’s original pictures, extending from the
beginning of 1854 to the end of 1860, and the result deduced from
 these measurements is favourable to the idea of a connection between
the behaviour of sun-spots and planetary con<U+FB01>gurations.
     These results were obtained by noticing that at one period of time
all the spots, as a rule, increase towards the centre of the sun’s visible
disc as they pass over it by rotation, while at another period they all
decrease from their <U+FB01>rst appearance, or perhaps increase from their
<U+FB01>rst appearance. Considering the earth merely as the point of view
from which these various phenomena are observed, we have to ask,
What is the cause of this peculiar behaviour of sun-spots?
     It evidently must refer to something Without the sun, and that
something is not so very di<U+FB02>icult to <U+FB01>nd. When these phenomena
denoting peculiarities in the behaviour of sun-spots are attentively
studied, it is seen that every twenty months the same behaviour occurs
again. Couple with this the fact that every twenty months the planet
Venus returns to the same position with reference to the earth, and
we can scarcely help attributing some predominating in<U+FB02>uence over
the behaviour of sun-spots to this planet. A closer analysis of the
phenomena observed shows us that this is the case ; and that as any
portion of the sun’s surface retreats by rotation from the neighbour
hood of Venus, the spots on that portion have a tendency to increase,
attaining a. maximum at the point furthest from Venus. Jupitcr has
also much in<U+FB02>uence. Now, is it not a very extraordinary circumstance
that two planets which are never so near the sun as they are near
                                                               M 2

the earth, should appear to cause phenomena of the vast magnitude of
solar spots ?
    It naturally occurs to us that the sun must be in a most sensitive
molecular state, in consequence of which that wonderful mass
experiences great changes from very small outward in<U+FB02>uences.
(Experiments were here made, showing examples of this state.) Pro
fessor Tait and the speaker have conjectured that the properties of a
body, especially with reference to heat, light, and electricity, may be
in<U+FB02>uenced by the neighbourhood of a large body. An in<U+FB02>uence of
this kind would naturally be most powerful upon a body such as the
sun, which is of a very high temperature, just as a poker thrust into
a hot furnace will cause a greater disturbance of heat than if thrust
into a chamber very little hotter than itself.
    We have, moreover, very good grounds for supposing the sun to
be in a very sensitive molecular state. We may infer from certain
experiments, especially those of Cagniard De la Tour, that at a very
high temperature and under a very great pressure, the latent heat of
vaporization is very small, so that a comparatively small increase of
heat will cause a considerable mass of liquid to assume the gaseous
form, and vice eersd.
    We might thus suppose that an extremely small withdrawal of
heat from the sun might cause a copious condensation, and this
change of molecular state would, through the alteration of re<U+FB02>ection,
&c., alter, to a great extent, the distribution over the various particles
of the sun’s surface of an enormous quantity of heat.
    Again, convection is very strong in the sun, since the force of
gravity is very strong, so that great mechanical changes might very
easily result.

        On the Music of Speech in the Greek and Latin Languages.
THE title of this paper indicates a subject too vast for the compass of
a single discourse. What I intend to confine myself to on the present
occasion, is to show in a few propositions that the system of pro

146                      Professor Blackie on the                 [May 3,
nouncing the Greek and Latin languages to which the southern half
of the island of Great Britain has long been trained, is scienti<U+FB01>cally
altogether perverse and historically quite unwarranted, and that it mars
the music of the most harmonious of the ancient languages to a degree
quite inconceivable by those whose ears have been dulled by a long
course of arbitrary and barbarous vocalization. And not only are
some of the <U+FB01>nest features of the classic tongues thus systematically
defaced, but the Englishman is put at an unnatural disadvantage with
all foreigners, not only as concerns the ancient languages, but likewise
in reference to the spoken tongues of Europe. For the peculiar habits
of English vocalization being engrained by the long course of classical
tuition in our great public schools and universities, the organs of
speech often acquire a rigidity which it is di<U+FB02>icult afterwards to
correct; and an arti<U+FB01>cial barrier is raised between Latin and those
Romanesque languages which are only variations of that tongue with
fundamentally the same tone. In these days of travelling and touring
it is often most tantalizing to an Englishman to <U+FB01>nd that his Latin is
of no service to him with a Hungarian nobleman or an Italian priest,
and his Oxonion Greek as useless in Athens as it would be in Kam
schatka. A Scotsman, on the other hand, whose classical training is
generally inferior to that of an English scholar, will follow a Latin
oration by a Gottingcn or Bonn professor without di<U+FB01>iculty. The
 disadvantages of these peculiarities are so great, that with a practical
 people like the English, they ought to be allowed the greatest weight,
independently altogether of the scienti<U+FB01>c aspect of the matter. Ex
pressions of opinion on this point have been put forth by some of our
most distinguished scholars and men of literary eminence. Tennyson,
our poet laureate, whose practice in such a region ought to constitute
law, never reads Virgil with any other vocalization than the masculine
and sonorous one, which belongs to the recitation of the Dim'na O'omed'ia ;
and Mr. Gladstone, in vol. i. of his ‘ Homeric Studies,’ p. 92, has the
following decided declaration. “I should gladly see the day when,
under the authority of scholars, improvement might be eifected in our
 solitary and barbarous method of pronouncing both the Greek and the
 Latin languages. In this one respect the European world may still
 with justice describe the English as “ penitus toto divisos orbe
Britannos.” To a reform in this method I can see nothing that is
 opposed, unless it be that spirit of dogged conservatism, which, while in
politics it may be sometimes useful, in the region of scienti<U+FB01>c research
and of scholarly practice, is simply absurd. A convention of English,
 Scottish, and Irish scholars might easily be held in London or Oxford,
which could lay down the main lines of necessary remodelment in this
 domain, after a few hours’ consultation.    No man who loves the truth,
 and has even super<U+FB01>cially looked into the sources of philological
 tradition, can doubt for a moment that the peculiarities which
 distinguish the English enunciation of Latin and Greek are arbitrary
and barbarous, and ought to be abolished. And though it be no doubt
 true that the di<U+FB01>'ercnt European nations have interpolated some of their

 1867.]      Music of Speech in the Greek and Latin Languages.          147
 own orthoepic peculiarities into their recitation of Latin and Greek, it is
 to be noted that these peculiarities a<U+FB01>'ect only a few secondary articu
 lations ; while the English method strikes a fundamentally false key
 note, inverts the poles of vocalization, and substitutes a <U+FB01>gment for a
 fact in some of the most important elements on which the music of the
 classical languages depends.
     In what follows, to avoid prolixity, I shall con<U+FB01>ne my remarks
 principally to the Greek language; but the scholar will have no
 difficulty in perceiving that the principles of my method apply to
 Latin as broadly, and in some points with less liability of contraven
 tion, than to Greek.
     The subject of the music of speech divides itself naturally into
 three great sections :
     l. Articulation and vocalization: the musical value and signi<U+FB01>
 cance of the vowels and consonants of which spoken language is
 composed, and from the combination of which words are made.
     2. The accent or intonation of words in utterance.
     3. The rhythm or measured cadence to which sentences are made
 subject, in poetical composition with curious care, and with a more
arbitrary sweep of harmony in prose.
     The comparative musical excellence of a language depends of
course on the completeness and richness of its whole elements of
utterance, and of the cunning displayed in their combination. But
for my present purpose, it will be sufficient to notice the quality
of the vowel sounds, on which the sonorous value of a language
mainly depends. Now with regard to the pronunciation of the Greek
vowels we have a distinct and clear utterance of a rhetorician of the
highest authority, which, if it had been duly weighed by English
scholars, would long ago have furnished a sure basis on which to raise
a true scale of vowel variation for the Greek and Latin languages.
     In the fourteenth chapter of his well-known treatise 'n‘zpi meme;
o’voud'rwv, Dionysius of Halicarnassus writes as follows :—-—
     “There are seven vowels; two long, 17 and w, and two short,
2 and o ; three both long and short, a, L, 1;. All these are pronounced
by the wind-pipe acting on the breath, while the mouth remains in
its simple natural state, and the tongue remaining at rest takes no
part in the utterance. Now, the long vowels, and those which may
be either long or short, when they are used as long are pronounced
with the stream of breath extended and continuous; but the short
vowels, and those used as short, are uttered by a stroke of the mouth
cut off immediately on emission, the windpipe exerting it§ power only
for the shortest time. Of all these, the most agreeable sounds are
produced by the long vowels, and those which are used as long,
because their sound continues for a considerable time, and they do not
suddenly break off the energy of the breath. Of an inferior value are
the short vowels, and those used as short, because the volume of
sound in them is small and broken. Of the long again, the most
sonorous is the a, when it is used as long, for it is pronounced by

  148                        Professor Blachie on the               [May 3,
  opening the mouth to the fullest, while the breath strikes the palate.
  The next is 17, because in its formation, while the mouth is moderately
  open, the sound is driven out from below at the base of the tongue,
  and keeping in that quarter does not strike upwards. Next comes
  the w, for in it the mouth is rounded, and contracts the lips, and the
  stroke of the mouth is sent against the extreme end of the mouth
  (dxpoo-rouwv, the lips, I presume). Inferior to this is the v, for in
  this vowel an observable contraction takes place in the lips, so that
  the sonorous breath comes out attenuated and compressed. Last of
  all comes I, for here the stroke of the breath takes place about the
  teeth, while the opening of the mouth is small, and the lips contribute
  nothing towards giving it dignity as it passes through. Of the
  short vowels, neither is sonorous ; but 0 is the least disagreeable, for
  it parts the month more than the other, and receives the stroke nearer
  the windpipe.”
      Now not to go into a detailed criticism of this passage, two things
  are obvious on the surface of it, and incontestable: that' the sound of
  the <U+FB01>rst letter of the alphabet here indicated is not'that of the English
  a in nation, but certainly that of the long Italian a, or the <U+FB01>ne hollow
  English a in hall ; and secondly, that the sound of the last vowel here
 mentioned, 1', is the most slender of all, corresponding to the thin
  sound of ea in cheap, not to the broad diphthongal song of i in time.
  For there can be no doubt, as Walker remarks, that the peculiar
~English sound of the long 'i, by which the letter is named, is a
 diphthong, composed of the broad a followed by an 6. Thus our
 English orthoepy has achieved the monstrous result, that while we
 have attenuated the broadest sound in the ancient vowel scale, we
 have broadened the most attenuated—a perversity equalled only by
 the strange habit which vulgar English speakers have of inserting an
 1' or a h where no 'r or h ought to be, and sinking the same letters
 where they ought to be pronounced. What a wretched effect this
 inversion of the points of polarity in the vowel scale must have in
 marring the music in some of the <U+FB01>nest lines in Greek and Latin
 poetry need not be mentioned. Let a man only try it in Italian, and
 he will see how unpardonable such an offence is.
      Avery long and elaborate method of proof would be necessary,
 were it my purpose on the present occasion, to corroborate the values
 of the Greek vowels as here given by Dionysius. Let it be enough
 to state that Seyffarth, Liscov, and other writers have corroborated
 the grand outlines of the scheme here given by the various’methods
 of philologioal induction appropriate to this branch of investigation ;
 and as the result of the whole, it appears that the proper classical
 values of the long vowels may be stated as in the following scale :—
                          d, as in Italian am<U+FB01>re;
                         17, as in English mine;
                         (0, as in English boat ,
                         v, as in German briider ,
                        i, as in English cheap ,'

 the short vowels, of course, being the same sounds pronounced sharply,
 as in the staccato notes of music. The practice followed in some
 English schools of pronouncing the short a like a in hat, and the long
 a like a in mane, which is a quite different vowel, must be reprobated.
 The long a should always be pronounced like the English aw or au,
 as in cawl, maul, &c.
       With regard to the diphthongs, it is a most unfortunate circum
 stance that Dionylsius has not thought it necessary to describe 'their
 sounds. The inference which some have drawn from this, that the
rhetorician considered their pronunciation was always~ identical with
 the elements of which they are composed, so that w. or Kill. should be
like the English i in time, pronounced in the broadest style is alto
gether unwarranted. With regard to two of the diphthongs, however,
philological investigations leave us in no manner of doubt that the
received English pronunciation is altogether wrong. It seems quite
certain that on was pronounced like the English 00 in boom ; and this

inclines to the use of the front part of the month, while the English
speech comes more from the back part, as the American is apt to lose
itself after a most ungraceful fashion, in the nose.            It seems certain
also, that in the time of the Ptolemies a: was always pronounced like
a in the English vain, as it is still pronounced by the modern Greeks.‘
On the phonic value of the other diphthongs I am afraid we must be
content to remain in ignorance; at least I have been able to gain pos
session of no evidence which seems to me such as to place this matter
on a <U+FB01>rmly scienti<U+FB01>c basis. There is an interesting passage in Moscho—
pulos (Titze, Leipzig, 1822, p. 24), which seems to say, contrary to the
doctrine of the modern Greeks, that in the diphthong a the i was
silent, and the sound of 6 alone was heard.
      I have said nothing in the above argument on the pretensions of
the modern Greeks, who have Written not a few learned treatises to
prove that their characteristic itacism, or the predominance of the
slender sound of i, ought to be allowed to rule the pronunciation of
the Greek language, as indeed it actually did everywhere in Europe
before the revolutionary innovations of Erasmus. Now, while it is
quite certain, on the one hand, that a certain amount of attenuated
itacism was characteristic of Greek as contrasted with Latin, at a very
early period,1' the supposition that half-a-dozen distinct vowels and
diphthongs, 1'7 L 1: :1. 0L, should all have been pronounced originally with
the same sound, is preposterous. Even in the days of the Apostles,
I cannot be brought to believe that such a sentence as xdpis tuiv Kat
eip<U+FB01>v'q wkqdvvda'y was pronounced with the slenderest sound in the

   Greek language ten times repeated. Nothing short of a miracle,
  indeed, could have preserved the language of Pericles and Plato from
  some corrupt tendency, during the long space of more than two thousand
  years which has elapsed since they thundered in the Pnyx and preached
  in the Academy. Let the modern Greeks, therefore, confess honestly
  that the excessive itacism of their actual speech is a declension and a
  deformation from the perfection of their ancient vocalism. On the
  other hand, let the arbitrary mouthers of Greek speech according to an
  English-—that is, a barbarous-model, bear in mind that Greek is a
  living language ; that it has changed by degrees only as English has
  changed and is changing; and that, while the English pronunciation
  of the principal vowels is a gross perversion and an arbitrary inven
  tion, the Alexandrian and Byzantine corruptions are only the excess
' of what is characteristic. This is the rank outgrowth of a living
  reality; the other, a scholastic <U+FB01>gment.    As a matter of fact, there
  fore, and for a sort of international convenience, I have no objection
  —as indeed the French Academy two years ago advised-to adopt the
  modern Greek vocalization in reading Greek prose; but the euphony -
  which belongs to poetry seems imperatively to demand that in the
  recitation of Homer, at least, the 0!. should receive something of that
  full, manly sonorousness which the strong lungs of the Homeric heroes
  could not fail to send forth. I am not inclined to sacri<U+FB01>ce the full
  roll of arokvqthola<U+FB01>oio and imrodduom to any merely Byzantine ortho
  doxy, however undisputed.
       I now come to the accent or intonation——a point on which the
  defenders of the present perverse pronunciation are found to make a
  stiff <U+FB01>ght, but on which, when the probabilities and authorities are
  carefully considered, they have really no case at all.         Professor
  Malden, of London, in a paper read before the Philological Society,
  May 28, 1847, maintains that the acute accent of the Greeks, which
  is substantially the accent, meant only elevation of tone in the voice,
  and did not also imply stress or emphasis. There is not the slightest
  foundation for this assertion. All the proof lies most distinctly the
  other way. The words c’u'irao'ts and Fives-Ls, by which the Greek
  grammarians generally express the acute and grave accent, signify
  properly stress or emphasis, and remission or relaxation of the voice.
  That this emphatic stroke of the breath (xpo'ild'pa, Theodos. Grammat.
  Goettling, p. 61) was in Greek enunciation accompanied by an elevation
  of the voice, is attested by the word 6569, and is indeed only what
  might have been expected from the very nature of the. case. To
  elevate the voice on the unemphatic syllable is possible indeed, and
  may sometimes be observed, as Professor Maiden remarks, in the in
  tonation given to English words in some Parts Of Scotland; but this
  practice is certainly not so obvious and natural as the other. _At all
  events, the Greek grannnarians give us not the slightest indication
  that while a superior stress lay upon one syllable, a higher key
  belonged to another. On the contrary, they dlstmctly indicate by
  the whole doctrine of enclitics or unemphatlc syllables, that accent

1867.]     Music of Speech in the Greek and Latin Languages.               151
means emphasis. An enclitic is a monosyllabic or dissyllabic word,
which in actual speech is so closely connected with another more
emphatic word, as to have no separate verbal emphasis.                  In all
languages the pronouns are such words, and in Italian there is a
separate form of that part of speech to express this unemphatic
adjunct of a verb, which is always written so as to make one word
with the verb, as datemi, dateci, &c. But, wherever the emphasis of
speech requires that these words should receive a separate rhetorical
emphasis, as when I, for instance, is contrasted with you, yes with no,
and so forth, these helpless little recumbents immediately assume an
erect position, and are strongly emphasized, as when for the sake of
contrast, in English we emphasize the qualifying elements in such
compounds as progression and 'rétrogression, invade and é'vade. Now‘
the Greek language constantly uses this device; and the use proves
that accent signi<U+FB01>es emphasis. Further; in the decadence of language
there is a well-known tendency of words to be curtailed of their un
emphasized syllables ; in the haste of careless and ill-regulated utter
ance, that syllable alone remains on which the dominant stress lies;
and so the accent, which Diomede calls the anima vocis, is the most
persistent element in a word, and asserts itself with decision, when
terminations are lost and quantity forgotten. Thus in Italian we have
cittd for civitdte, mm‘; for amdvit, and many such. Modern Greek in
the same way shows ,aii; for <U+FB01>nds, SE11 for o<U+FB01>Se'v, aria-w for dm'o'w, mopuai
for awake, ll/(ipL for oil/riptov, math’ for n-azst'ev, and others of the same
kind.   Again, the modern Greeks themselves, who inherit, through
the persistency of acoustic habit, the accents of the ancients, give a
decided preponderance to the last syllable of Hopi/a006, o'xmro, KaM,
&c., as no one can have been but a few days in Greece without observ
ing. What right, therefore, in the face of all these facts a modern
Englishman can have to draw back the accent of these words from the
last syllable, and lay a decided stress of the voice on the preceding
one, no reason can divine. It is merely an arbitrary perversion. For
the glaring absurdity of our existing practice is not that we pronounce
Greek without accents, but that we pronounce it with Latin accents.
The accentuation of the language of ancient Rome, though not marked
in the books, was handed down to us correctly, through the Roman
Church and its beautiful hymnology ; in this language, therefore, we
never err in point of emphasis, though we are often careless enough in
respect of quantity. But in the Greek language, though Aristophanes
of Byzantium, more than 200 years before Christ, took the wise pre
caution of teaching the accent to the eye as well as the ear in the text
of every written sentence, we take upon ourselves systematically to
reject that indication, and read Greek exactly as if we were reading
Latin! A more extraordinary instance of a determination to take the
wrong road, when the <U+FB01>nger of the directing-post is pointing out the
right, will not be found in the annals of learned blundering. There are
no feels like learned fools. That accent means stress in Latin we habitu
ally allow, by laying the emphasis on those syllables where according to

 152                       Professor Blachie on the                    [May 3,
 Roman tradition the accent lies; but while the Roman grammarians
 indicate no difference in nature between Greek and Roman accents, we
 take upon ourselves to deny that dominance to the accented syllable
 of a Greek word which belongs to it by the same right that the accented
 syllable of a Latin or German word is allowed to predominate. Nay
 more; we do this in the face of those very Roman writers who tell us
 in the most, distinct terms, that, while no Latin word is accented on
 the last syllable, the Greek language is particularly rich ‘in this <U+FB01>nal
 oxytone, and that this element of variety in the place of the accent is
one great element of orthoepic beauty in the language of polished
 Athens, as compared with that of more sturdy but less harmonious
 Rome! Nor is this all; while in teaching we allow our scholars to
mence the
.infect     ear with
         a course  of special
                       a false indoctrination

                                                             the understanding
where the accent should be placed! Absurdity cannot go beyond this.
Such a method of teaching, used in the case of any living language,
would expose the pedagogue to the just reproof of his principal, and
the deserved contempt of his scholars.
     That the ancients actually recited their speeches with the observance
of the just accent should require no proof with reasonable persons,
and is distinctly stated by Theodosius. “Kai 8:7." 'rov vs'ov dpxi<U+FB01>ev
xa'ropaoiiv rill! dvd'yvwo'w Kari]. arpoo'wsiav Kai. nil/0V” (p. 58, Gijitling).
And there is a well-known anecdote about Demosthenes, in Ulpian’s
‘ Commentaries ’ I believe, to the e<U+FB02>'ect that the great orator was on
one occasion publicly hissed for laying a false accent on the word
flw'dornyg. It is certain, also, that if any scholar were to deliver to a
Greek audience a Greek oration pronounced according to our perverse
British practice, he could scarcely fail to talk nonsense in almost
every other sentence; for the sense of many Greek words, otherwise
identical in sound, depends altogether on the accent being laid on a
different syllable. It was to prevent this confusion partly that
Aristophanes invented the accentual marks : was Sraorah‘yv 'r<U+FB01>s
duqSt<U+FB02>éhov )tég<U+FB01><U+FB02>s, as Arcadius expressly tells us (p. 186, Barker).
In Jelf’s grammar will be found a long list of such words; and
yet we pronounce rai-ra, these things, and Tau-rd, the same things;
é'Aeog, mercy, and A669, a board for hashing mince collops; <U+FB02>po-ros, gore,
and <U+FB01>po-rés, a mortal; iii/1.0;, a shoulder, and (buds, cruel; 66Aog, a dome
or cupola, and gohds, mud, as if they were the same. Thus our
system, starting from an utter disregard of philological science, ends,
as all random proceedings in such matters must do, in nonsensical
practice. But not only is the sense of the spoken language destroyed
to the ear, the musical character of the whole language is marred
and perverted. The dominant accent upon the proper syllable is as
essential to the melody of Greek prose, as the due prolongation of
the vowel at marked intervals is to Greek poetry. Imagine French
pronounced with the favourite English antepenultimate accent, and
you will realize some analogy to the barbarous effect to a well-tuned
Greek ear made by the received English enunciation of the following
             ~

     Innumerable passages of this kind constantly occur, where the fine
roll of the voice on the av of the genitive plural and other ter
minational syllables is, by the indiscriminate application of the
meagre Latin accentuation, altogether lost. For my part, now that
my ear is, by the practice of many years, tuned to the correct recita
tion of Greek prose, I should as soon consent to blotting out the oto
and the dov from the Homeric hexameter, as to the wholesale swamping
of the oxytones which the English practice induces in reciting the
musical ocean-roll of a Plato, or the energetic thunderclaps of a
Demosthenes.                               -
     Apologies for the present perverse practice of pronouncing Greek
have no doubt been attempted, and will, in all likelihood, be attempted
again. In the most desperate case, a clever advocate will find some
thing to say for an accused person, of whose guilt no sane juryman
can have a doubt. The vulgar objection, for instance, to the correct
pronunciation of the Greek word av6poros, with the accent on the
ante-penult and the penult long, viz. that the quantity of the penult
is thereby lost; this objection disappears the moment we produce a
 German word such as abhaüen, or an English word such as lándhölder,
 where exactly the same relation of accent and quantity exists. And
 if in giving full effect to the accent on the first syllable of such words
 the quantity of the second syllable might in rapid speaking be some
 what curtailed, this is only what happens in all languages, and should
 not be allowed to disturb the rational and legitimate accentuation of
 Greek.    In Latin, for instance, we know with perfect certainty that
 the long final ö, in verbs exactly observed by Virgil, as in cano, fremo,
 is often shortened by Martial; for the obvious reason, that as the
 poet of colloquial wit, this writer followed the loose law of Roman
 talk, which habitually cheated the long final o in this and some other
 cases of its legitimate prolongation. And if there be any scholar
 who cannot be made to understand how the penult of such a word as
 'Aparodiévns (and there are hundreds such in Greek) should be
 accented and short, while the last syllable is unaccented and long,
 this can only be explained by that gross quality of hearing that is
 the natural product of long years of perverse practice, and sopited
 sensibility.
     On the third great section of the doctrine of the music of language
 in Greek and Latin, viz., Rhythm and Metres, my present limits allow
 me only to make one remark; a remark necessary to repel the objec
 tion felt by many to reading Greek prose according to accent, viz. that
 this practice annihilates altogether the metrical movement of verse.

154          Professor Blackie on the Music of Speech, (to.         [May 3,
The remark is this: all ancient poetry was a part of music, not of
colloquy ; the singing element of language is quantity, not accent
full, broad, and prolonged vocalism as we see in Italian ; therefore in
the composition of their verses made to be sung, not read, the ancients
subordinated the colloquial accent, or sunk it altogether. This is certain
from the double fact, that while on the one hand Hcphzestion and other
ancient metrical writers never allude to accent as an element in
poetical composition, no modern reader can bring a metrical move
ment out of any Greek verse otherwise than by the systematic neglect
of it. Another incontrovertible proof of the practice of the ancients
in this matter is that the contrary character in modern poetry has
produced a contrary law of poetical vcomposition. Our poetry, written
to be read, and read a thousand times for once that it is sung, follows
the laws of reading and of spoken discourse, viz. the metrical accent
is kept identical with the colloquial accent, while the quantity is left
to shift for itself, at least does not lie under the dictatorship of certain
<U+FB01>xed and commutable laws. And if it seems a strange thing to us
that the ancients in the composition of poetry should have habitually
tolerated a syllabic accentuation contrary to what‘ they used in
prose, it would no doubt appear an equally strange thing to them,
that in the singing of the most beautiful hymns and songs we
habitually prolong God into goad, and shorten goad into god, as it may
suit our convenience. Practically there is not the slightest difficulty
-—as I know from experience—in reading Greek prose according to
both accent and quantity, and measuring Greek poetry to the ear, by
the musical accent and the exact pronunciation of short and long
syllables. In fact, those who pronounce awards, as if it were main-o9,
would <U+FB01>nd themselves as much put out by the occurrence of such
a word in the close of an Iambic line, as I should be if the line ended
in <U+FB01>po-ros. Nay, it is a curious fact, that in some of the most beautiful
Greek choral songs (as in the dél/GOL N€¢€'/\GL of Aristophanes, ‘ Clouds,’
275-290), the musical accent indicating the metro is, in a great
majority of cases, coincident with the syllabic accent of the words as
spoken in common colloquy. I consider, therefore, the objection that
pronunciation, according to accent, annihilates quantity, not only
scienti<U+FB01>cally worthless, but practically unmeaning. Those who make
these objections appear to me like persons suffering under a certain
nervous disease, which makes them imagine that their bodies are made
of glass, and that the moment they rise to walk they will fall to pieces.
But it is not so. The supposed incompatibility of accent and quantity
vanishes the moment a man works himself into the living practice of
the thing. Here, as in more important matters, the only solution of
sceptical doubts is to be found in action. As for the modern Greeks,
if, after having endured long centuries of decadence and oppression,
they have forgotten their ancient musical cunning, and will persist in
reading Homer according to the spoken accents of their common col
loquy, that is their loss, not ours. A little training would no doubt
set them right in this matter, and they would gladly meet us half-way,

if we did not habitually insult them by throwing overboard all the
living traditions of their orthoepy. Our circumstances have been
more favourable than theirs ; and the one-sided perversity into which
we have fallen deserves less excuse. Historically, I believe it is
traceable principally to the metrical hobbihorsicality which distin
guished the scholarship of Bentley and Person. The Roman accen
tuation was transferred to Greek, as more convenient to mark the
quantity of certain penultimate syllables. This was all. To remedy
one small inconvenience for the sake of ignorant, lazy, or careless
schoolmasters, a huge organism of systematic blunders was created.
I hope the time has now arrived when thoughtful scholars will no
longer allow themselves to be guided in important points of philo
logical practice by no higher law than that which governs crinolines
and chignons. I think this matter should be settled by reason ; and
the great English universities could perform few more thankworthy
services than by promulgating an ordinance on this subject, which
would at once bring England into harmony with the great guildry of
European scholarship, and furnish our public teachers with a rule of
classical orthoepy both scienti<U+FB01>c in its basis and convenient in its
application.

                          Friday, May 10, 1867.
     Sir HENRY Hol.I.AND, Bart. M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. President,
                               in the Chair.
                    Professor ALEXANDER BAIN, M.A.
                         OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ABERDEFN.
   On the Doctrine of the Correlation of Force in its Bearing on Mind.
THE speaker began by giving his view of the Correlated Forces.
There are five commonly recognized forces: one Mechanical, or
lMolar, movement in mass; and four Molecular, or movement in mole
cule—Heat, Light, Chemical Force, Electricity. Of vital force, it is
difficult to speak as a whole, but one member of it—the Nerve Force
—allied to Electricity, is in every respect entitled to rank among the
Correlated Forces, making the fifth of the molecular group. With
the exception of Light, all the forces are exchangeable on an assignable
rate of commutation.
    The speaker then quoted the received views as to the maintenance
of the animal forces; which depend, in the last resort, upon the
oxidation of the food.    From this oxidation, or animal combustion, is
derived, the temperature of the body, the muscular or mechanical
energy, and the nervous power, or nerve force. Now the extension of
the Correlation of Force to mind, if admissible, must be made through
the nerve force, an undoubted member of the group.
    The speaker then referred to some of the theories of the connection
of mind and body, and indicated the views (1) of Aristotle, and (2) of
Aquinas, who may be considered the author of the modern settlement
of the relations of the material and the immaterial. Both philosophers
represented the highest intellectual processes as conducted by the
immaterial substance, a doctrine liable to serious difficulties. The
influence of modern physiology had compelled the admission of a
material basis for the intellectual functions; and the consequence of
this admission has been a modified theory, expressed as the “mutual
action of mind and body.” The speaker regarded this view as an
advance on Aquinas, but as still incorrect. It supposes that we know
mind apart from body, and that pure mind can exert influence upon
pure body. But we have no experience of pure mind: we know only
of the compound mind-body; and when we speak of the mind acting

 on the body, it is the compound phenomenon that really produces the
 effect. When a shock of fear deranges the digestion, the cause is not
 the abstract consciousness called the emotion of fear, but this in
 combination with a condition of the nervous system ; so that the
 real sequence is mind-body operating upon mind-body.
      The commonly conceived di<U+FB01>iculty as to the union of mind with
body is, properly speaking, no di<U+FB02>iculty at all. We accept every
alliance that we <U+FB01>nd in nature as a fact, and merely generalize it to
the uttermost; such are the alliances of gravity and inert matterQheat
and light. The real difficulty in the case is of another kind. When
we speak of two things being united, we can hardly avoid supposing a
local union, a union in place, or extension. We apply this notion to
mind and body, and,‘ <U+FB01>nd ourselves in hopeless perplexity. Body is
an extended thing, but mind proper is unextended; it has no dimen
sions, form, or division of parts; when we are under a feeling of
pleasure or pain, we are in a mood where the property of extension is
inapplicable ; and yet this unextended consciousness has for its
essential condition certain modes of extension, namely, the corporeal
frame and its parts. Mind is not a place but a state ; we live by turns
in two different states, the one unextended, the other having the pro
perty of extension. The union of mind and body is not a local union,
because connection in place supposes the two things to be extended
or objective things; it is a union of dependence, and of sequence in
time. An extended organism is the condition of our existing in states
of the unextended-pleasures, pains, and ideas ; and our life is a con
tinuous thread of alternative states, extended and unextended, object
and subject. The familiar mode of expressing body and mind by the
words ‘external’ and ‘internal’ is faulty, for these words suppose
relation in place, and apply only to two extended things.
     The speaker then proceeded to explain and prove the doctrine of
the correlation of the material forces with the mental force.      Every
mental display, every mode of feeling and thought, demands a certain
de<U+FB01>nite expenditure of nerve force; and the nerve force is de<U+FB01>nitely
related to the source of all vital force, the combustion or oxidation of
the food. He gave a series of proofs and illustrations of the position,
that the mental manifestations are in exact proportion to their physical
supports. He showed that according as the mind is exerted, force is
drawn away from the proper corporeal functions, which are to that
extent weakened. This is merely the general or scienti<U+FB01>c statement
of the common experience of the incompatibility of great mental
exertion with great physical robustness.
     Another important consequence of the doctrine of the de<U+FB01>nite
correlation of mind with the physical forces, is the mutual limitation
of the mental manifestations among themselves. Taking the three
distinct functions or departments of mind-Feeling, Will, and Intellect
—it may be maintained that they each involve a certain de<U+FB01>nite
physical expenditure, and that an excessive degree of the one necessarily
stints the others. On comparing the cost of the three di<U+FB01>'erent func

tions, the speaker held that the demands of the intellect are the
largest, and that great and continued intellectual e<U+FB02>'orts use up a very
large amount of the whole energies of the system.
    He applied the doctrine of mutual limitation of mental functions
to explain the incompatibility of different modes of mental eminence,
as scienti<U+FB01>c and artistic power in a high degree ; great sensibility with
great activity of temperament; and intellectual originality with
emotional exuberance.

      Sir HENRY HOLLAND, Bart. M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. President,
                               in the Chair.

                                     I.
THE remarkable property <U+FB01>rst observed by M. Deville, in the case
of homogeneous platinum and iron, when at a red heat, of being
permeable to hydrogen gas, is not by any means con<U+FB01>ned to these
two metals; and has been shown by Mr. Graham to be manifested
in a much greater degree by palladium, even at temperatures falling
considerably short of redness.
    An exhausted tube of wrought palladium, surrounded by at
mospheric air, remains perfectly vacuous at a red heat; surrounded
by an atmosphere of hydrogen, it remains vacuous at 100", but allows
of some transmission at 240°; while at 265°, and up to a temperature
just short of redness, there is a steady and considerable passage
of hydrogen to its interior, maintained vacuous by the Sprengel
pump. Surrounded, under the same conditions, by coal gas, the free
hydrogen of the coal gas alone <U+FB01>nds its way into the interior of the
tube, the remaining constituents of the gas being excluded by the
heated palladium as effectively as, in other experiments, they are
excluded by ignited platinum.
    This transmission of hydrogen, through the substance of various
metals, is altogether different in character from the transmission of
gases in general by the physical processes of transpiration and
diffusion. It is evidently dependent upon some special relationship
subsisting between the particular gas and metal, and has been shown
by Mr. Graham to be preceded by an absorption or occlusion of the
gas in the substance of the metal.
                                                              N 2

     Platinum-wire, drawn from the fused and solidi<U+FB01>ed metal, was
 heated to redness and allowed to cool slowly in a current of dry
 hydrogen gas. After cooling, it was exposed freely to the air for some
 time, and then placed in a tube of porcelain or hard glass, which was
next exhausted by the Sprengel pump. After complete exhaustion,
 the tube was heated to redness, when the contained platinum began
 and continued to give off hydrogen gas, which was delivered by the
pump. The quantity of hydrogen, measured cold, amounted to 21 per
 cent. of the volume of the platinum-wire. That the absorption did
 not depend upon surface, was shown by drawing out the same wire to
four times its original length, and repeating the experiment when the
 absorption was found not to have increased, but rather to have
 decreased, as it amounted only to 17 per cent.
     To show the effect of texture, a similar experiment was made with
spongy platinum, which was found to absorb and deliver 148 per cent.
of its volume of hydrogen. Experiments were also made with ordinary
wrought platinum, a particular piece of which was found to occlude in
three successive experiments, 553, 493, and 383 per cent. of its volume
of hydrogen, measured cold, giving a mean of 476 per cent. Thus
the intermediate form of platinum, more porous than the fused, but
more compact than the spongy form, was found to be the most
absorptive. In round numbers, 1 volume of this platinum absorbed

centimetres, for instance, of hydrogen into the space of 1 cubic
centimetre would require a pressure of 15 atmospheres. But in this
experiment, the 15 cubic centimetres of hydrogen were condensed,
not merely into 1 cubic centimetre of space, but into so much of
1 cubic centimetre of space as appeared to be entirely occupied by
platinum, and was not really so occupied. So that assuming the pores
of the wrought platinum to amount to <U+FB01>lo-0 of its bulk, the above
described condensation of the hydrogen corresponded to that pro
ducible by a pressure of 15,000 atmospheres.

as before, and then heated very gradually in a vacuous tube. During
exposure for an hour to 220°, not a particle of gas was evolved. At a
temperature slightly below that of visible redness, there was still no
gas evolved. At a temperature su<U+FB02>icient to soften glass (500°), 1'72
0.0. of hydrogen were collected in ten minutes; and, heated for an
hour in a combustion furnace, an additional 8'20 0.0. of hydrogen were
collected, making altogether 9'92 0.0., or 379 per cent. of the volume
of platinum employed in the experiment. The same piece of plati
num, charged with hydrogen, was kept for two months, sealed up in a
glass tube, which "it nearly <U+FB01>lled. At the end of that time, the air of

 the tube was found to be quite free from hydrogen, showing that none
 had been evolved by the enclosed platinum.
     The absorption of hydrogen by platinum took place at a tempera
ture much below that necessary to cause an evolution of the evolved
 gas. Thus some platinum-foil was found to absorb 76 per cent. of
its volume of hydrogen at 100°, and 145 per cent. of its volume at
 230°.
                                     III.
     Palladium appears to be a metal altogether special in its relations
 to hydrogen. Foil of wrought palladium that had been maintained
 at a temperature not exceeding 245“, and allowed to cool slowly in a
current of hydrogen, evolved, when afterwards heated in vacuo, no
less than 52,600 per cent., or 526 times its volume, of the gas within
a quarter of an hour. But even this comparatively low temperature
was found to exceed that most favourable to gas absorption. For,
maintained at a temperature between 90° and 97° for three hours, and
allowed to cool down during an hour and a half, the foil absorbed
 643 times its volume of hydrogen, measured cold. Even at ordinary
temperatures it absorbed 376 times its volume, provided it had been
recently ignited in vacuo. Palladium sponge heated to 200” in a
current of hydrogen, and allowed to cool slowly, afterwards yielded
no less than 686 times its volume of the gas. Now if the absorption
by ignited platinum of 5 times its volume of hydrogen is di<U+FB01>icult to
realize, how much more dif<U+FB01>cult is it to realize the absorption of 5 or
6 hundred times its volume‘of hydrogen by moderately heated palla
dium ? Notwithstanding the levity of the gas, this large absorption
of hydrogen by palladium is su<U+FB01>icient to increase recognizably the
apparent weight of the metal. The retention, however, of such a
charge of gas is not complete, a portion of the condensed hydrogen
being slowly evolved or volatilized by exposure of the_ charged palla
dium to air. The hydrogen condensed in palladium is capable of
exerting those particular reducing actions, which under ordinary cir
cumstances, are producible only when the gas is in the so-called nascent
state. Thus the hydrogenized palladium quickly reduces permanganate
of potassium, bleaches iodide of starch, throws down prussian blue from
ferric ferridcyanide, &c. Further, the absorptive power of palladium
is manifested in a varying degree upon different liquids. Thus, 1,000
volumes of palladium-foil were found to absorb 1 volume of water,
51} volumes of alcohol, and 1?; volumes of ether; results showing a
special selective relationship of the metal to these di<U+FB01>'erent liquids.
                                                                    4

    The absorption of hydrogen by ignited copper, in the state of wire,
amounted to 30 per cent., and, in the state of sponge, to 60 per cent.
Gold, in the form of assay cornettes, was found capable of absorbing
48 per cent. of hydrogen, 29 per cent. of carbonic oxide, 16 per cent.

of carbonic anhydride, and 20 per cent. of air; but of this absorbed
air, nearly the whole was nitrogen. Before charging the cornettes
with the above gases, it was necessary to ignite them for some time in
vacuo, in order to expel the gas they had spontaneously absorbed in
the mu<U+FB02>le. This, which may be termed the natural gas of the
cornettes, amounted to 212 per cent., and consisted principally of
hydrogen and carbonic oxide. Silver, unlike the preconsidered metals,
is characterized by its preferential absorption of oxygen. In different
experiments, silver-wire heated to redness was found to absorb 74 per
cent. of oxygen, and nearly 21 per cent. of hydrogen. Silver-sponge
absorbed 722 per cent. of oxygen, 92 per cent. of hydrogen, 52 per
cent. of carbonic anhydride, and 15 per cent. of carbonic oxide. A
specimen of silver-leaf, exposed to the air at a red heat, absorbed
137 per cent. of oxygen, and 20 per cent. of nitrogen; so that while
ordinary atmospheric air contains 21 per cent. of oxygen, and the air
absorbed by gold only about 5 per cent, the air absorbed by silver
contained no less than 85 per cent. of oxygen.
                                    V.
     Iron, though tolerably absorptive of hydrogen, is specially
characterized by its absorption of carbonic oxide. Ordinary iron-wire,
that had been carefully cleaned and heated in vacuo to expel its
natural gas, when afterwards heated in different atmospheres, was
found to absorb 46 per cent. by volume of hydrogen, and 415 per cent.
of carbonic oxide. The natural gas of wrought-iron, derived from the
forge in which it had been heated, proved to consist principally of
carbonic oxide, and, in different experiments, ranged from 700 to 1,250
per cent.; so that, in the course of its preparation, iron would appear
to occlude upwards of 7 times its volume of carbonic oxide gas, which
it carries about with it ever after. The discovery of this absorbability
of carbonic oxide by iron has an important bearing upon the theory
of acieration. Carbonic oxide (0,0,) would appear to be actually
absorbed by the substance of the iron, and then decomposed at a
di<U+FB02>'erent temperature, into carbon (C) which, entering into combi
nation with the iron, converts it into steel, and into carbonic anhydride
 (G0,) which, escaping from the surface of the iron, gives rise to the
 appearance of blistering.
     It became a matter of interest to determine whether sidereal iron,
that is to say the iron of meteorites, contained any, and, if any, what
natural gas. Accordingly, some 45 grammes, or 6 cubic centimetres,
 of meteoric iron from the Lenarto fall were heated in vacuo for
 two hours and a half, and found by Mr. Graham to give o<U+FB02>' 16'5 cubic
centimetres of gas, which consisted substantially, not of carbonic oxide,
but of hydrogen, to the extent at least of 85'5 per cent. of the entire
yield of gas, the remainder being chie<U+FB02>y nitrogen and carbonic oxide.
 The inference that the meteorite, at some time or other, had been
 ignited in an atmosphere of which the prevailing constituent was

1867.]             on the Occlusion of Gases by Metals.              163
hydrogen, is obvious; and, judging from the volume of gas yielded,
the hydrogen atmosphere must have been a highly condensed one.
For even under ordinary atmospheric pressure, telluric iron is found
to absorb but somewhat less than half its volume; whereas this
sidereal iron furnished fully two and a half times its volume of
hydrogen. _ It is known that Father Secchi, in his classi<U+FB01>cation of the
stars according to their spectra, has distinguished one class, typi<U+FB01>ed
by on Lyme, as having a spectrum which is essentially that of hydrogen.
                                    VI.
    In the year 1823, Mr. Faraday established the general proposition
that a gas is nothing else than the vapour of a volatile liquid existing
at a temperature considerably above the boiling point of the liquid;
and that the condensing points of different gases are merely the
boiling points of the liquids producing them. But the boiling point
of a liquid, or the condensing point of its gas, is Well known to be
not a <U+FB01>xed point of temperature, but a point varying with the pressure
to which the gas or liquid is subjected. Accordingly, every one of
the many di<U+FB02>'erent gases known to chemists, with about six exceptions,
has been actually condensed into the liquid state by a su<U+FB02>icient
increase of pressure; whereby the existing temperature of the gas has
ceased to be above the heightened condensing point, or boiling point,
corresponding to the increased pressure. And since a gas cannot be
reduced by pressure to a bulk less than that corresponding to the
pressure necessary to liquefy it, without its becoming lique<U+FB01>ed, con
versely, the reduction of any gas to a bulk less than that correspond
ing to the pressure necessary to liquefy it, must be taken as evidence
of its liquefaction. Hence, from the extremely minute volume which
oxygen, hydrogen, and carbonic oxide occupy, when occluded for
instance in silver, platinum, and iron respectively, there can be little
doubt but that these gases, though included among the half dozen
which have never been lique<U+FB01>ed by direct pressure, do nevertheless
em'st in the liquid state when occluded in the above metals ; or, at any
rate, do not exist in the gaseous state.
     As regards the nature of this absorption and presumable lique
faction of gases by metals, there are facts which seem to indicate that
the phenomenon is related, on the one hand, to the absorption of gases
by their solution in liquids, or in those soft solids which Mr. Graham
has denominated colloids ; and, on the other hand, to the absorption
of gases by their condensation in the minute pores of hard solids, such
as compact charcoal.

On- the Shooting-stars of the Years 1866-67, and on the probable Source of
     certain Luminous Meteors in the material Substance of the Zodlaoal
     Light.
REGARDED as an exhibition of a variable phenomenon, recurring at the
end of every cycle of nearly thirty-three years, on a particular date
of November, the meteoric shower witnessed on the morning of the
14th of November, 1866, appears to have been a fair example of the
average scale of the November meteors at one of their principal
returns. While it incomparably surpassed all the commoner displays
of shooting-stars that are known to have occurred during the past
period of more than thirty years, it nevertheless fell considerably
short of the celebrated meteoric shower seen in America on the
morning of the 13th of November, 1833.              That shower, it will be
remembered, took place quite unexpectedly, while one of the dis
tinguishing features of the recent November star-shower was that it
a<U+FB01>‘orded a. complete veri<U+FB01>cation of the astronomical theory which made
their return expected by Olbers, as about to take place in 1867 ; and
more recently by Professor H. A. Newton, who anticipated the re
    Although
currence           shower in
           of theintended     1866.
                           only  to guide observation, due notice‘ of the
shower was timely given by Professor Newton,* to the e<U+FB02>‘ect that a
considerable star-shower might be expected to take place on the
morning of the 14th of November, 1866. On the eve of the occur
rence the well-timed appeal was repeated in many places in the public
papers, and a wide-spread, and very intense popular interest in the
phenomenon was excited. In England circular letters were addressed
to the Members of the Royal Astronomical and Royal Meteorological
Societies, by their respective Presidents, Mr. Pritchard and Mr.
Glaisher, suggesting to observers the propriety of making concerted
observations of the star-shower, during the second hour after midnight
on the two mornings of the 13th and 14th of November, so that if

possible a number of the meteors might be simultaneously observed
at distant places. On the <U+FB01>rst of those mornings the sky was com
pletely overcast, and on the morning of the 14th of November the
meteoric shower made its appearance with, certainly, great beauty, but
so exactly during the hour named beforehand for simultaneous ob
servations, that many, even of the most zealous of the confederated
observers, as they expressed themselves, “gave up recording, and
betook themselves to counting.”
     Accordant duplicate observations could hardly be expected to be
obtained, when meteors were so very numerous, and were so strikingly
uniform as to size, as seldom very greatly to exceed <U+FB01>rst magnitude
stars in brightness. Of <U+FB01>reballs su<U+FB02>iciently brilliant to have attracted
general attention (at least over Great Britain), there were very few.
The shower, accordingly, met with less favourable observation, as
regards ascertaining the absolute altitude of the meteors, than that
which was observed more successfully for the same purpose in the
previous year,* when the ‘heights and velocities of several meteors
were determined.
     One observation of the kind, obtained in the recent meteoric
shower, will, however, shortly be mentioned in detail. On the other\_
hand, most important results were obtained by Mr. Glaisher at Green
wich,'|' Professor Adams and Dr. Challis at Cambridge: and by other
eminent observers and astronomers, both at home and abroad, who
gave their best attention to the subject. The vexed question of where
the meteors came from, was thus satisfactorily disposed of. The orbit
of the meteoric group was <U+FB01>nally determined; and, lastly, three recent
comets, to which closed orbits have been assigned, now rank, almost
certainly, as forming part of the material currents which give rise,
respectively, to the meteors of the 10th of August, the 14th of
November, and the 20th of April. The November star-shower of
1866, accordingly, both: for the astronomical premonition which it
ful<U+FB01>lled, and for the novel views which followed it, marks a new era
in meteoric astronomy, not unlike that which dawned upon cometary
astronomy when Clairault calculated the day of the return of Halley’s
comet, in the year 1759, and the comet appeared, almost punctually,
at the appointed time.
      In America the star-shower on the morning of the 14th of
November last, was expected to be visible to the best advantage.
Only 172 meteors, however, mostly of small size, were counted at the
Washington National Observatory on that morning, during an interval
of two hours and a half in which the sky was clear; indicating about
the same rate of falling as on the preceding night. There was nothing
peculiar, either in colour or in motion observed. At Newhaven,

U.S.A.," the average number of meteors seen by one person of
Professor Newton's staff of observers, on the same morning, with a
beautifully clear sky, was about thirty-eight meteors in one hour, the
average number on the preceding night having been from sixteen to
twenty meteors in an hour. So great was the disappointment of
astronomers in America, who confidently expected a successful view
of the phenomenon, that a telegram, viá the Atlantic cable, which
appeared in the New York ‘Herald, announcing the appearance of
the shower in England, could hardly be believed, until the arrival of
the English newspapers at New York dispelled the doubts of its cor
rectness. Owing to the seasonable notice of the shower finding its
way by various channels, into every civilized quarter of the globe,
observers in Europe, and elsewhere, were not a whit less expectant
than in America; and here, at least, they were not destined to be
disappointed, since the star-shower was everywhere conspicuously
seen, and witnessed with admiration. The following extract from
a letter from Syria, published in the New York “Tribune’ of the
29th of December, realizes the figurative language with which the
early Arabian chroniclers sought to adorn their description of the
great November star-shower of the year A.D. 1202:—
    “I have just received the Arabic newspaper of this week's issue,
and find in it the following news about the meteors, which, for your
benefit, I will translate literally:—
    “‘Beirut Domestic Intelligence.—There has preceded this a notice,
in No. 431 of our journal, of the falling meteors of the 12th and 13th
of November, and there happened a marvellous thing of the kind on
the night of the 13th. . . . People of Beirut saw thousands of
these meteors, mixed in commotion and confusion, and they compared
their extent in the heavens to the spreading out of locusts in the sky.
And we have news from Damascus, that the same events were seen
there, and they compared them to the mighty armies, joined in a fierce
strife, from the four quarters of the sky. . . .”
   “The Arabic journal then gives a very fanciful letter on the subject
from one of the learned men of Damascus, the scholar Solyman
Effendi Sooloh, who says:—
     “‘In this past night the stars began the war from the east to the
west, and from the southern to the northern side. They dashed at
the pace of fiery steeds and ghouls, so that you could not distinguish
the Pleiades from the Hyades from the passing of the meteors across
them, and the intensity of the brightness. But you now thought that
the two stars in Leo's nose had been dispersed, and the two fishes
were eclipsed and immersed, and the spearman of Arcturus had for
gotten his spear, and was thinking only of his own safety, and the
Adhal was complaining to the bright daughters of Ursa Major about
the extent of his wound, and the lofty pole had fallen into the claws
of the Eagle, and the Hedrah was prostrate, and the face of night like

a leopard's skin; and to sum up all the heavens were like a sphere of
fire, or a gleaming of sparks, excepting that the fire and sparks were
harmless, not touching the earth, or injuring our safety, as if night's
daring horsemen, who continued till morning beating each other in
single combat, gave us protection and peace. This I write for his
Excellency our Prince, the Sultan Abdul Aziz Khan. May God
perpetuate the seat of his government to the end of the world's
revolution l’”
     The same letter from Syria further mentions that, “on the
morning of the 11th (Sunday), at a little after midnight, some young
men in Beirut, who were out of doors, saw what they described as a
rain of fire, the stars seeming to have got loose, and to be running
about the sky in disorder.”         The occurrence of such a companion
shower to the principal display, is not by any means improbable, and
well deserves attention.* The meteors on the morning of the 14th of
November were also seen in Persia, on the road to Ispahan.f
     A letter from Mr. W. Masters, Professor at the Kishnaghur
College, about fifty-seven miles due north of Calcutta, in India, to
Sir John Herschel, gives the following description of the shower:—
     “I looked out about half-past four, or a quarter to five, and                •
after counting fifty in about five minutes, I woke up four other
persons to witness the phenomenon, and to give aid in watching and
counting. We arranged ourselves looking in different directions, and
as each saw a meteor there was a distinct call of the next number,
51, 52, 53, &c.; the stars shooting out sometimes faster than they
could be counted. Some were lost on this account, . . . yet in
less than half-an-hour we counted 420; had we been all together
during the half-hour we would certainly have counted more than 500.”
     The meteors were visible also at Sealkote, and at Lahore.              Dawn
appearing, however, put an end to the display, but a bright meteor
was still seen at Kishnaghur after daylight had appeared.
     A short note of the phenomenon at Yokohama, in Japan, and a
private memorandum from Mr. B. W. Marsh, of Philadelphia, U.S.A.,
received by the speaker, are as follows, and concur in showing that
the star-shower was not visible in the extreme east of Asia —
    * “It appears from observations of Captain Meiraldi, that another meteoric
swarm passed over Italy during the night of the 12th-13th, and its characters did
not differ from those of the display on the 14th at Urbino: that is to say, a great
number in a short space of time, beginning unexpectedly, and ceasing very
suddenly.”—“Les Mondes, 2nd ser. vol. xii. p. 644. Private letters inform the
writer that a great and sudden outburst of “hundreds of shooting-stars,” lasting
only a short time, but so sudden and bright as to be terrifying, was seen at
Norwich shortly before four o'clock A.M., on the 14th. The same was seen near
Staplehurst, in Kent, “on the stroke of four o'clock,” on the morning of the 14th,
when the regular shower of shooting-stars had almost ceased to be watched. The
notes, perhaps, refer to one and the same phenomenon, which must have taken
place about four o'clock on the morning of the 14th.—(A. S. H.)

      “Yokohama, 17th November, 1866.--I looked out for shooting
stars, but it rained and blew so, that no stars could be seen till the
morning of the 14th, and then nothing was to be seen but one or two
odd ones-(J. P. L. Maclear).”
      “Philadelphia, 22nd March, 1867.-B. R. Lewis, Dep. U. S.
Consul General at Shanghai, writes to me, under date of the 29th of
November, that he had not heard that any unusual display had been
observed there.—(B. V. Marsh).”
      The easternmost limit of visibility of the shower is, indeed, very
clearly de<U+FB01>ned, by the above description of the phenomenon at
Kishnaghur, about the Bengal Presidency of India.
      The star-shower was well observed at the Cape of Good Hope
Observatory, in South Africa, by Mr. G. W. H. Mac1ear.* The
shower was at its height at twelve minutes past two o’clock (Cape
time), corresponding to two minutes before one o’clock Greenwich
time; and a brief letter from Sir Thomas Maclear (‘Edinburgh
Quarterly Review,’ Jan. 1867, p. 258) gives the following graphic
account of its appearance :—
      “ In the early part of the night of the 13th, few meteors or shooting
stars appeared. At 1h. 3m. A.M., on the 14th, the volcano burst forth,
with awful grandeur, from the neighbourhood of Regulus; orange
coloured meteors, leaving streaks of green, mingled with ordinary
looking shooting stars dashing along in a south-westerly direction.
The scene was beyond description, and thus, with little variation, the
projectiles continued till daylight. The total number counted amounts
to two thousand seven hundred and forty-two.”
     At Athens,1' Rome; Turin,§ Paris," Brussels<U+FB02> and throughout
the continent, good observations of the star-shower were made. At
Malta the meteors appeared falling like a shower of hail. At Urbino,
in Italy, they were compared to a <U+FB02>ight of handgrenades, and at
Saragossa, in Spain, they reminded the inhabitants of the bombard
ment of the town. At Haddingham, in England, Mr. Dawes compared
the shower with that which he witnessed at Ormskirk near Liverpool,
on the 13th of November, 1832.M               But the meteors, in 1866, were not
so large as on that occasion. At the Royal Observatory, Greenwich,
the shower <U+FB01>rst reached its maximum at seven minutes past one
o’clook, and it was most intense for the space of an hour and a half,
from half-an-hour after midnight until two o’clock ; before and after
which times the scale of the phenomenon hardly exceeded a con

  siderable August shower. The altitude of the radiant point at the
  last-named hour, was thirty-three degrees above the east horizon;
  and as the shower, as was already mentioned, was not visible in
  America, some thirty degrees of longitude west of Greenwich, in the
  Atlantic Ocean, probably terminated the visibility of the shower
  towards the west.
      The geographical limits of visibility of the star-shower of 1866,
  it will at once be seen, coincide with the area over which the Novem
  ber meteors appeared in 1832. The latter shower was seen as far
  south as the Mauritius, as far east as Arabia and the Persian Gulf,
  and over the whole continent of Europe, with the British Isles, but it
  was not visible in America. It was, moreover, a moderate display,
  but it was followed, twelve months later in America, by the great
  storm of meteors which suddenly appeared on the morning of the
  13th of November, 1833. The recent exhibition may therefore be
 regarded as the prelude of a similar meteor-rain in America, perhaps
 partially visible in Europe, as great and bright as the two star-storms
 seen in America, and partially visible in Europe, in the years 1799
 and 1833.
      Unless unforeseen curvatures of the meteoric current disturb the
 geographical boundaries of the display, the <U+FB01>rst symptoms of the
 approaching star-shower will be perceived at day-break in England,
 on the morning of the 14th of November, 1867, when the light of the
 moon, then three days past the full, and of dawn appearing, will
 detract something from the numbers and brightness of the meteors.
 But the same oscillation of the curves in an opposite direction, it
 should be borne in mind, will bring Great Britain into full view of
 the centre of the shower, and make the principal spectacle of the
 meteors visible in Europe before day-break, as well as in America.

 of its appearance and disappearance. Speaking of the remarkable
 scarcity of meteors on the morning of the 13th, Mr. Serpieri at Urbino
 writes to Mr. Secchi at Home :—“I began to doubt whether even the
 ordinary meteors of the November epoch would not this year be
 altogether wanting. But in the end, it seemed as if all those ordinary
 meteors had gathered themselves together into one dense array, to
 make their transit in the shortest possible time! ”* The de<U+FB01>nable
 character of the shower led to a large number of accurate observations
 being made, on the moment of its maximum abundance.                    This was
 generally observed in England to have taken place <U+FB01>rst, about ten
 minutes past one o’clock; while a second maximum, hardly less marked,
 was observed at twenty minutes past one. At the Cape of Good Hope
 Observatory the shower reached its maximum at two minutes before
 one o’clock (Greenwich time), and afterwards pretty steadily and very
rapidly declined.      The di<U+FB02>'erence, which amounts to about a quarter

170                        Mr. A. S. Herschel on the                 [May 24,
of an hour, is easily explained, if the oblique direction is considered,
in which the earth at this juncture traversed the meteoric current.
The radiant point of the shower was determined on this occasion with
more than ordinary exactness, and few observers di<U+FB01>'er far from <U+FB01>xing
it near the small star, at (Bode) at the centre of Leo’s sickle, being the
very position assigned to it by Professor Twining, at the last great
appearance of the shower on the 13th of November, 1833.
    It was early pointed out by Encke that this position of the radiant
point is almost vertically over the point of the ecliptic, towards which
the earth is moving at the moment. Supposing a pointer laid against
a <U+FB02>at horizontal ring, to indicate the direction in which the earth is
moving in its orbit on the 14th of November. If the pointer is then
inclined a little upwards (about 10% degrees), it indicates the position
of the radiant point, or the direction from which the meteors appear
to come. But as the earth itself is advancing to meet the shower, the
real slope of the meteoric current is less oblique (about 17°) than it
appears to be, at the point of the ecliptic where the earth encounters it.
The southern side of the earth must evidently meet the sloping current
<U+FB01>rst, after which the equatorial parts, and lastly the northern side of
the earth, will be plunged into the stream. Twenty-four minutes
would be required for the whole earth to become immersed, and
thirteen minutes should elapse (which was very nearly the interval
observed) from the time when the maximum display was experienced
at the Cape of Good Hope, until the like should be perceived in
 England. A more favourable opportunity could hardly have been
expected for turning such observations to account; and the general
mode of apprehending the phenomenon is shown to be substantially
correct, by the satisfactory manner in which they answer to the test.
    In twenty-four minutes the whole width of the earth’s diameter
would enter the stream. As the denser part of the shower lasted an
hour and a half, its thickness was nearly equal to four diameters of
the earth, or about 30,000 miles.
    Only two or three of the brightest meteors observed at any one
station, were brighter than the planets. One such was seen after
sunrise at the Observatory at Athens. An equally bright meteor
was seen by Mr. Orumplen as late as nine o’clock in the morning, at
Primrose Hill, in London. The scale of magnitudes of eighty-one
meteors, whose paths were recorded by the speaker, with the assistance
of Mr. A. Macgregor, at the Glasgow Observatory, were as follows :
      As bright as Jupiter, or brighter . . .  2 meteors :   3 per cent.
       As bright as Sirius   .  .  . .  . . . 14         = 17     ,,

    The meteors were in general white, occasionally inclining to blue,
and frequently to tints of orange-red. Every meteor left a peculiarly
hard and solid-looking straight streak of light upon its whole course,

 ahead of which the head was occasionally observed to shoot in its
 <U+FB02>ight, very seldom leaving any large sparks upon its track, and rarely,
 if ever, terminating with an explosion, but disappearing by degrees,
 as if the material substance of the meteor was expended. The streaks
 were lance-like, tapering to the extremities; and commonly faded in
 a few seconds, from the ends towards the centre, without losing their
 lance-like form. But in the case of a good many streaks which
 remained visible for some minutes, the most persistent part of the
 train diffused itself into spiral, snake-like, scymitar-shaped, and
 every possible variety of nebulous-looking clouds, of silvery white,
 or in some very long-enduring cases, of <U+FB02>ame-coloured light. Of
 the latter kind was the stationary streak over Dundee, in Scotland,
 whose real height and position are described, approximately, on the
 next page. Dr. Schmidt describes a streak at Athens, which remained
 visible in the sky <U+FB01>fty-one minutes, like a red cumulus cloud, only
 e<U+FB02>'aced by the approach of daylight. The evident tendency of the
most persistent streaks seen in England, was to drift with a pretty
rapid motion towards the south, or to a few points west of south, until
they disappeared. A very persistent light-cloud left by a large
meteor of the shower in America on the 13th of November, 1833, was
calculated by Professor Twining to have drifted from its place east
wards with a speed of three or four miles in a minute.
     An inquiry projected last year,* with reference to analyzing the
 light of the meteors by their spectrum, was put in practice; and
 meteoric spectra were observed both on the nights of the 9th and
 10th of August, and on the morning of the 14th of November, 1866.
Meteor spectroscopes were constructed by Mr. Browning in good
time for the <U+FB01>rst of those occasions, and seventeen views of the
spectra of the meteor streaks and nuclei were obtained. The pre
vailing character, in the freshly deposited streaks, was a continuous
spectrum of considerable width, but destitute of colour. But as soon
as some of the streaks began to fade, in eight cases there remained
nothing but an extremely slender and bright yellow line of light,
manifestly the light of some self-luminous gas, of which the nearest
analogue in terrestrial <U+FB02>ames is the light of incandescent sodium
vapour.     The spectra of the nuclei generally presented all the
brighter colours of the prismatic spectrum. When feeble, the spec
trum was still continuous, although destitute of colour, but three
examples of nuclei were observed, which presented nearly homo
geneous yellow light; one entirely destitute, and the other two
accompanied only by a very faint continuous spectrum.
     The nuclei of the November meteors presented to Mr. Browning
the same peculiar features in the spectroscope as those which the
speaker had already noted in the spectra of the nuclei of the August
meteors ; namely, a marked preponderance of a line, or broad band of
yellow light, which sometimes appeared to form the totality of their

spectrum; with the addition that two nuclei were observed by Mr.
Browning, among the November meteors, whose light was equally
homogeneous, but green. The light of the streaks, which was
mostly blue, green, or steelgrey, generally appeared homogeneous,‘
and this observation the speaker was able to con<U+FB01>rm. Although the
experiments presented peculiar di<U+FB01>culties from the rapidly-fading
character of the light-streaks, yet the homogeneous appearance of the
light of the November meteor-streaks in the spectroscope was, in
certain cases, so unequivocal, that their bluish-green colour imme
diately suggested to him the suspicion, which was, at the time, nothing
more, but which now appears highly probable, that an analogy exists
between their light and that of the gaseous nebulse, and, particularly,
of the nucleus of Tempel’s comet.
      The principal result of the meteor-spectroscopic observations was,
that the total absence of the presumed bright line of sodium in the
spectra of the streaks of the November meteors establishes a speci<U+FB01>c
difference between the meteoric substances of the two currents, to
which the August and November shooting-stars belong.1'
      Observations of one of the largest meteors of the shower were
obtained at Sunderland, in England, and at Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and
Glasgow, in Scotlandi The meteor appeared at twenty minutes
before three o’clock, and the streak, to which the observations princi
pally refer, remained visible a quarter of an hour. The nebulous
cloud of light very nearly marked the point of disappearance of the
meteor, and its altitude was ascertained to be between <U+FB01>fty-one and
<U+FB01>fty-seven miles above the earth’s surface, over a spot a few miles
distant from Dundee.
       In a series of letters addressed to Padre Secchi, the celebrated
astronomer of Rome,§ shortly before the recent appearance of the
November shower, a fortunate theory of periodical meteors, announced
by Sig. G. V. Schiaparelli, the astronomer of the Brera College at
Milan, completely removes the obscurity of their origin, and claims
for its distinguished author the praise of having, for the <U+FB01>rst time
since the cosmical hypothesis of Chladni, laid a broad and sure
foundation for a new science of meteoric astronomy.
       Supposing that a cosmical cloud of particles should be drawn from
stellar space by the sun’s attraction, it is shown that it could not
cross the earth’s orbit in any other form than as a parabolic current.

 Assuming, for example, that such a cloud, of the sun's size, was
 originally moving at an aphelion distance of 20,000 times the earth's
 distance from the sun, with a velocity of only one hundred yards in a
 minute, and with no relative motions, or mutual attractions, existing
 among its particles, the cloud would represent at that distance a
nebula of only one-tenth of a second of arc in angular width. In
about one-and-a-half million years the cloud would arrive at less than
 the earth's distance from the sun, being then in the perihelion point
 of its orbit, which would there be undistinguishable from a parabola.
 By the inevitable laws of the sun's attraction, the cloud will be
 gradually deformed in its progress, until on the point of its perihelion
 passage it will become a current twenty-three miles broad, one hundred
 yards deep, in a direction measured from the sun, and extending
 upwards of six hundred millions of miles along the arc of the parabola.
 The perihelion passage of the current will occupy more than a year
(387 days) and its particles will be four hundred million times more
closely packed together than they were in the cosmical cloud before
its deformation by the sun's attraction. As there are nebulae in the
sky larger than the sun's apparent disc, if that width only were
adopted for the apparent magnitude of the cosmical cloud at its
aphelion, it would be transformed into a parabolic current, which
would occupy twenty thousand years in its perihelion passage. The
transverse width of the current would at the same time be pro
portionately greater than in the previous case, yet not so large but
that the earth will pass through it in a few hours, or at most, in one
or two days. In this manner, avoiding all impossible assumptions,
 meteoric currents may clearly be accounted for, which, like that of
 August, have been visible for hundreds or thousands of years.
     On the other hand a meteoric stream like that of November, which
is visible for two or three years in succession at the end of every cycle
*f about thirty-three years, must be moving in a very much shorter
ellipse, and must occupy a certain arc of that ellipse with the requisite
materials for a meteoric shower. Mr. Le Verrier supposed” that a
cosmical cloud, like those assumed to exist by Mr. Schiaparelli, was
thrown into such an elliptic orbit by the action of the planet Uranus,
and that the cloud must actually have passed close to Uranus in the
year A.D. 126. The action of the planet having caused some of its
parts to move faster than the rest, the cloud is gradually becoming
transformed into a ring, but it is not yet such an ancient member of
the solar system as, if the same kind of hypothesis could in that
case be entertained, Mr. Le Verrier supposes the ring of the August
meteors to represent.
     It may be remarked that the earth passes periodically through the
current of the November meteors, without sufficient attractive efficacy,
while scattering some of the meteors, to deflect the main body of the
current from its course. That the earth, however, in common with

the larger planets, must produce a sensible effect upon the direction of
the stream, is certain; and Mr. Adams has shown,* as the result of
very elaborate calculation, that assuming the orbit of the November
meteoric current to be a long ellipse extending to near the orbit of
Uranus, with a periodic time of 33' 25 years, the joint e<U+FB01>‘ect of all the a
more important planets upon its course, must be to retard the date of
the appearance of the shower one day at the end of every such cycle.
The modern November star showers, of the 12th of November, 1799, the
 13th of November, 1832, and 1833, and the 14th of November, 1866, as
well as the much more decisive evidence derived from earlier displays
of the same shower completely establish the correctness of this hypo
thetical form of the orbit; while other calculations show that no other
possible orbit which the meteors might pursue consistently with the
 existence of a thirty-three-year period in the date of their returns,
would agree, as the former orbit does, in a precise and accurate manner,
with the very prominent variation of the date.
     Periodical meteors are accordingly found to move in very eccentric
orbits, inclined like the orbits of the comets at all possible obliquities
to the ecliptic. Nor is this similarity of their orbits merely a con
jecture.     In the fourth of his series of letters to Padre Secchi,1' Mr.
Schiaparelli announces the important discovery, that a conspicuous
and well-remembered comet (Comet 111., 1862), which was visible to
the naked eye for several weeks in August and September, 1862, and
which'SteLmpfer calculated to have a periodic time of 113 years, coin
cides almost exactly in its path with the stream, supposed nearly
parabolic, of the Perseids, as the 10th of August meteors are styled
by Schiaparelli.
     A period of revolution of 108 years is assigned to the August
meteors by Schiaparelli, and one of 103 years was proposed by the
speakerjt last year, as bringing the August star-showers of A.D. 830,
933, 1243, and 1451, into conjunction with the remarkable star-show“
of the 10th of August, 1863. The near coincidence of the time of the
comet’s return with the last-named great display of the “Perseids,”
affords a strong presumption that a connection of an intimate kind exists
between the two important classes of bodies. Not less striking is the
coincidence of the return of another periodical comet (Comet 1., 1866),
known as Tempel’s comet, visible with the telescope, which passed its
perihelion in January, 1866, with the recent reappearance of the
November meteors. The November meteors and Tempel’s comet, as
calculated by Oppolzer, pass at the same time close to the earth’s orbit,
at the same ecliptic longitude, at the same obliquity to the ecliptic,
and in the same direction round the sun. The periodic time of their
return is also the same, so that their orbits must, evidently, coincide
throughout their whole extent.          Dr. Galle, the director of the Obser

 between the elements of the orbit of a comet (Comet I., 1861) visible
 to the naked eye, and the orbit, supposed nearly parabolic, of the
 meteors of the §20th of April. The closeness of the coincidence
 makes it probable that the periodic time of 415 years, assigned to
 the comet, is also the periodic time of revolution of the April ring of
meteors.
      Of remarkable meteors visible in the past year, although only
 twice as bright as Sirius, one, having an extraordinary length of path,
 appeared at ten o’clock on the evening of the 11th of January, 1866.
 It shot almost horizontally across the English Channel from eighty
 <U+FB01>ve miles over Paris to ninety-<U+FB01>ve miles over Cork, performing a
 path of not less than four hundred and <U+FB01>fty miles in about six or
 eight seconds.* The most experienced observers were astonished at
 the length of its luminous track, and compared it to “a bombshell
 <U+FB01>red from London into Ireland.”                                                 '
      At midnight on the 10th of March, 1866,1' a detonating meteor
was seen in Hanoverian Prussia, which, the investigation of Dr. Heis
 informs us, shot from thirteen miles over Miete to three miles and a
 half over Liibbecke, a distance of thirty miles, in four or <U+FB01>ve seconds,
with a speed of seven miles in a second. The detonation was so loud
 at Liibbecke as to awaken many from their sleep, with the noise,
which was like a clap of thunder.
     A similar meteor to the last appeared at eleven o’clock in the
forenoon (Paris time) on the 20th of June, 1866, over Calais and
 Boulogne. It left a smoke-like train, that remained visible in broad
 daylight for several minutesi
      The path of this <U+FB01>reball was from <U+FB01>fteen miles over Calais to four
and a half miles over the neighbourhood of Boulogne and Montreuil
in-Somme. The meteor pursued a path of thirty miles in three and a
half seconds, with a speed of eight or nine miles in a second, dis
 appearing with a detonation which was heard, startlingly loud, as far
as Maidstone in Kent, and Hastings in Sussex. At St. Omer it was
at <U+FB01>rst believed that the neighbouring powder-mill of Esquerbes had
exploded.
      Three detonating meteors, to which allusion was made last year,§
made their appearance in England between the 19th and the 21st of
November, during the <U+FB01>ve years 1861-65. The altitudes and other

the New York ‘World’ of the 24th of November, 1866, rel'ates to a
 “ meteorological phenomenon ” which actually took place as there
 described :—
       “ At Nashville, about four o’clock last Tuesday morning (the 20th
 of November, 1866), a meteor, lighting the whole heavens, was seen in
 the direction of Rome, Ga., moving rapidly south-west. It appeared
 like a ball of <U+FB01>re as large as the sun. It exploded apparently ten
miles off, with a tremendous report, like a 40lb. cannon, that shook the
 earth, and made the windows rattle.”
       In addition to two stonefalls, alluded to last year,*‘ which happened,
 one at Shcrgotty, in India, and the other at Aumale, in Algeria, on
the 25th of August, 1865, three other stonefalls took place, one an
aérolite weighing about 5lbs., which fell at Dundrum,1' in Ireland, with
the usual accompaniment of a detonation, followed by a humming
sound, on the 12th day of the same month and year. The second was
an aérolite weighing about 3lbs., which fell at Bheenwalhi in Bengal, on
the 20th of August; and the third, a fall of two stones at Muddoor,§ in
India, on the 7th of September in the same year, making, with the two
stonefalls already mentioned, a total of <U+FB01>ve aérolites in four weeks.
       The next accounts of the same kind which have been received
relate to a stonefall at St. Mesmin, in France, on the 30th of May,
1866, followed in ten days by the shower of stones at Knyahinya, in
Hungary, on the 9th of June, 1866. At St. Mesmin, in the valley of
the Seine, there fell, about four o’clock in the morning, three aérolites,
one of them with such a clattering, and buzzing, and shrieking sound,
that a signal man in the railway cutting, where it fell, remained for
some time mute with a<U+FB02>'right.
       The stone when picked up weighed llb., and a small indentation,
about half-an-inch in width, with a fresh surface, covered with thin
thread-like lines of the fused crust, marks a spot where an angle must
have been broken o<U+FB01>‘ from the meteorite during its <U+FB02>ight through

fragments, weighing from seven to thirty-seven, and one of them
ninety pounds, were picked up near the larger mass, and about a
thousand fragments, weighing together near upon a thousand pounds,
were scattered over an area nine miles long, from north-east to south
west, and four miles wide. All the fragments are completely crusted
over, and the meteor was seen, and the detonation was heard over a
distance of sixty or eighty miles in a south-west direction)“
     As "fragments weighing a few pounds’, or a few hundred-weights
only, could not exist as a group with intervals of more than a hundred
yards between them, at the earth’s distance from the sun, without
being disjoined by the sun’s attractive force; and as it is di<U+FB02>icult to
imagine how such a compact group could be formed, even beyond the
sphere of the sun’s attraction, capable of resisting the sun’s disturbing
action at the earth, it is more probable that the shower of aerolites
entered the atmosphere as a single stone. This was certainly the case
with fragments of the meteorite of Butsura, two of which, picked up
at a distance of more than two miles apart, were completely crusted
over; and yet, when placed side by side, they have a nearly close
<U+FB01>tting junction, and are obviously seen to belong to one piece, by a
vein of iron, which runs directly across the junction through the mass.
     The most probable theory of the zodiacal light makes it to consist
of numberless small bodies, revolving like planets round the sun,
whose joint reflection of the sun’s rays gives the appearance of a
luminous haze stretching along the zodiac, and brightest in the
neighbourhood of the sun. On particularly clear nights in the
tropics, it sometimes appears to complete the circle of the midnight
sky, from east to west, having been described, and frequently seen
thus by Mr. G. Jones, on the long voyage of the Japan expedition
from New York.'|'
     The earth is, therefore, situated within its outer border. But if
the bodies were spherical, and uniformly scattered between the earth
and the sun, the theory of their phases, and maximum brightness, as
seen from the earth, would lead us to expect a species of mock-suns,
about <U+FB01>fty-<U+FB01>ve degrees distant from the true sun, one at each extremity
of the light. As this is not observed, and as, on the contrary, both
terminations of the light are diffuse, the bodies which compose it must,
certainly, be more thinly scattered towards its edge, and it is even
probable that they must consist of shapelcss fragments, which is
exactly what the circumstances of the falls of aérolitcs would lead us
to expect.

and aérolites, differ from each other only in their magnitudes, we
must conclude that the substance fallen from the sky is a sample of
that of which the stellar universe is composed. And since in such
substance there is no chemical element unknown upon the earth, the
similarity of the composition of all the visible bodies of the universe,
already rendered probable by researches with the spectroscope, re

the concrete sciences of mineralogy, of botany, and zoology, and the
abstract sciences of chemistry and physics. These latter sustain a
necessary and very important relation to the whole process of develop
ment of our earth, from its earliest ages, andvwe <U+FB01>nd that the same
chemical laws which have presided over its changes, apply also to
those of extra-terrestrial matter. Recent investigations show the
presence in the sun, and even in the <U+FB01>xed stars—suns of other systems
———the same chemical elements as in our own planet. The spectro

scope, that marvellous instrument, has, in the hands of modern in
vestigators, thrown new light upon the composition of the farthest
bodies of the universe, and has made clear many points which the
telescope was impotent to resolve. The results of extra-terrestrial
spectroscopic research have lately been set forth in an admirable
manner by one of its most successful students, Mr. Huggins. We
see, by its aid, matter in all its stages, and trace the process of con
densation and the formation of worlds.       It is long since Herschel,
the <U+FB01>rst of his illustrious name, conceived the nebulae, which his
telescope could not resolve, to be the uncondensed matter from which
worlds are made. Subsequent astronomers, with more powerful glasses,
were able to show that many of these nebulae are really groups of stars,
and thus a doubt was thrown over the existence in space of nebulous
luminous matter; but the spectroscope has now placed the matter
beyond doubt. By its aid we <U+FB01>nd in the heavens, planets, bodies like
our earth, shining only by reflected light; suns, self-luminous,
radiating light from solid matter; and, moreover, true nebulae, or
masses of luminous gaseous matter. These three forms represent
three distinct phases in the condensation of the primeval matter, from
which our own and other planetary systems have been formed.
    This nebulous matter is conceived to be so intensely heated as to
be in the state of true gas or vapour, and, for this reason, feebly
luminous when compared with the sun. It would be out of place, on
the present occasion, to discuss the detailed results of spectroscopic
investigation, or the beautiful and ingenious methods by which modern
science has shown the existence in the sun, and in many other lu
minous bodies in space, of the same chemical elements that are met
with in our earth, and even in our own bodies.
    Calculations based on the amount of light and heat radiated from
the sun show that the temperature which reigns at its surface is so
great that we can hardly form an adequate idea of it. Of the chemical
relations of such intensely heated matter, modern chemistry has made
known to us some curious facts, which help to throw light on the
constitution and luminosity of the sun. Heat, under ordinary con
ditions, is favourable to chemical combination, but a higher tempe
rature reverses all a<U+FB02>inities. Thus, the so-called noble metals, gold,
silver, mercury, &c., unite with oxygen and other elements; but these
compounds are decomposed by heat, and the pure metals are re
generated. A similar reaction was many years since shown by Mr.
Grove with regard to water, whose elements-oxygen and hydrogen-—
when mingled and kindled by <U+FB02>ame, or by the electric spark, unite to
form water, which, however, at a much higher temperature, is again
resolved into its component gases. Hence, if we had these two gases
existing in admixture at a very high temperature, cold would actually
e<U+FB01>'ect their combination precisely as heat would do if the mixed
gases were at the ordinary temperature, and literally it would be
found that “ frost performs the e<U+FB01>'ect of <U+FB01>re.” The recent researches
of Henry Ste-Claire Deville and others go far to show that this

180                    Mr. T. Starry Hunt on the               [May 13,
breaking up of compounds, or dissociation of elements by intense
heat, is a principle of universal application ; so that we may suppose
that all the elements which make up the sun or our planet, would,
when so intensely heated as to be in that gaseous condition which all
matter is capable of assuming, remain uncombined—that is to say,
would exist together in the condition of what we call chemical ele
ments, whose further dissociation in stellar or nebulous masses may
even give us evidence of matter still more elemental than that revealed
by the experiments of the laboratory, where we can only conjecture
the compound nature of many of the so-cnlled elementary substances.
    The sun, then, is to be conceived as an immense mass of intensely
heated gaseous and dissociated matter, so condensed, however, that,
notwithstanding its excessive temperature, it has a speci<U+FB01>c gravity not
much below that of water; probably offering a condition analogous to
that which Cagniard de la Tour observed for volatile bodies when sub
mitted to great pressure at temperatures much above their boiling point.
The radiation of heat, going on from the surface of such an intensely
heated mass of uncombined gases, will produce a super<U+FB01>cial cooling,
which will permit the combination of certain elements and the pro
duction of solid or liquid particles, which, suspended in the still
dissociated vapours, become intensely luminous and form the solar
photosphere. The condensed particles, carried down into the in
tensely heated mass, again meet with a heat of dissociation; so that
the process of combination at the surface is incessantly renewed,
while the heat of the sun may be supposed to be maintained by the
slow condensation of its mass; a diminution by W‘wth of its present
diameter being sufficient, according to Helmholtz, to maintain the
present supply of heat for 21,000 years.
    This hypothesis of the nature of the sun and of the luminous
process going on at its surface is the one lately put forward by Faye,
and, although it has met with opposition, appears to be that which
accords best with our present knowledge of the chemical and physical
conditions of matter, such as we must suppose it to exist in the
condensing gaseous mass, which, according to the nebular hypothesis,
should form the centre of our solar system. Taking this, as we have
already done, for granted, it matters little whether we imagine the
different planets to have been successively detached as rings during
the rotation of the primal mass, as is generally conceived, or whether
we admit with Chacornac a process of aggregation or concretion,
operating within the primal nebular mass, resulting in the production
of sun and planets. In either case we come to the conclusion that
our earth must at one time have been in an intensely heated gaseous
condition, such as the sun now presents, self-luminous, and with a
process of condensation going on at <U+FB01>rst at the surface only, until by
cooling it must have reached the point where the gaseous centre was
exchanged for one of combined and lique<U+FB01>ed matter.
    Here commences the chemistry of the earth, to the discussion of
which the foregoing considerations have been only preliminary. So

long as the gaseous condition of the earth lasted, we may suppose the
whole mass to have been homogeneous; but when the temperature
became so reduced that the existence of chemical compounds at the
centre became possible, these which were most stable at the elevated
temperature then prevailing, would be <U+FB01>rst formed. _ Thus, for
example, while compounds of oxygen with mercury or even with
hydrogen could not exist, oxides of silicon, aluminium, calcium, mag
nesium, and iron might be formed and condense in a liquid form at
the centre of the globe. By progressive cooling, still other elements
would be removed from the gaseous mass, which would form the
atmosphere of the non-gaseous nucleus. We may suppose an arrange
ment of the condensed matters at the centre according to. their respec
tive speci<U+FB01>c gravities, and thus the fact that the density of the earth
as a whole is about twice the mean density of the matters which form
its solid surface may be explained. Metallic or metalloidal com
pounds of elements, grouped differently from any compounds known
to us, and far more dense, may exist in the centre of the earth.
    The process of combination and cooling having gone on until
those elements which are not volatile in the heat of our ordinary
furnaces, were condensed into a liquid form, we may here inquire
what would be the result, upon the mass, of a further reduction of
temperature. It is generally assumed that in the cooling of a liquid
globe of mineral matter, congelation would commence at the surface,
as in the case of water; but water o<U+FB02>'ers an exception to most other
liquids, inasmuch as it is denser in the liquid than in the solid form.
Hence ice <U+FB01>oats on water, and freezing water becomes covered with a
layer of ice, which protects the liquid below. With most other
matters, however, and notably with the various mineral and earthy
compounds analogous to those which may be supposed to have formed
the <U+FB01>ery-<U+FB02>uid earth, numerous and careful experiments show that the
products of solidi<U+FB01>cation are much denser than the liquid mass; so
that solidi<U+FB01>cation would have commenced at the centre, whose tem
perature would thus be the congealing point of these liquid compounds.
The important researches of Hopkins and Fairbairn on the in<U+FB02>uence
of pressure in augmenting the melting point of such compounds as
contract in solidifying, are to be considered in this connection.
    It is with the super<U+FB01>cial portions of the fused mineral mass of the
globe that we have now to do; since there is no good reason for sup
posing that the deeply seated portions have intervened in any direct
manner in the production of the rocks which form the super<U+FB01>cial
crust. This, at the time of its <U+FB01>rst solidi<U+FB01>cation, presented probably
an irregular, diversi<U+FB01>ed surface, from the result of contraction of the
congealing mass, which at last formed a liquid bath of no great depth,
surrounding the solid nucleus. It is to the composition of this crust
that we must direct our attention, since therein would be found all
the elements (with the exception of such as were still in the gaseous
form) now met with in the known rocks of the earth. This crust is
now everywhere buried beneath its own ruins, and we can only from

182                      Mr. T. Starry Hunt on the              [May 3L
chemical considerations attempt to reconstruct it. If we consider
the conditions through which it has passed, and the chemical affinities
which must have come into play, we shall see that they are just what
would now result if the solid land, sea, and air were made to react
upon each other under the in<U+FB02>uence of intense heat. To the chemist
it is at once evident that from this would result the conversion of all
carbonates, chlorides, and sulphates into silicates, and the separation
of the carbon, chlorine, and sulphur in the form of acid gases, which,
with nitrogen, watery vapour, and a probable excess of oxygen, would
form the dense primeval atmosphere. The resulting fused mass would
contain all the bases as silicates, and must have much resembled in
composition certain furnace-slags or volcanic glasses. The atmosphere,
charged with acid gases which surrounded this primitive rock must
have been of immense density. Under the pressure of such a high
barometric column, condensation would take place at a temperature
much above the present boiling point of water, and the depressed
portions of the half-cooled crust would be <U+FB02>ooded with a highly heated
solution of hydrochloric acid, whose action in decomposing the
silicates is easily intelligible to the chemist. The formation of
chlorides of the various bases, and the separation of silica, would go
 on until the affinities of the acid were satis<U+FB01>ed, and there would be a
 separation of silica, taking the form of quartz, and the production of
a sea-water holding in solution, besides the chlorides of sodium,
 calcium, and magnesium, salts of aluminium and other metallic bases.
 The atmosphere, being thus deprived of its volatile chlorine and
 sulphur compounds, would approximate to that of our own time, but
 differ in its greater amount of carbonic acid.
     We next enter into the second phase in the action of the atmosphere
upon the earth’s crust. This, unlike the <U+FB01>rst, which was subaqueous,
 or operative only on the portion covered with the precipitated water,
 is sub-aerial, and consists in the decomposition of the exposed parts
 of the primitive crust under the in<U+FB02>uence of the carbonic acid and
moisture of the air, which convert the complex silicates of the crust
into a silicate of alumina, or clay, while the separated lime, magnesia,
and alkalies, being converted into carbonates, are carried down into
the sea in a state of solution. The <U+FB01>rst e<U+FB02>'ect of these dissolved oar
bonates would be to precipitate the dissolved alumina and the heavy
metals, after which would result a decomposition of the chloride of
calcium of the sea-water, resulting in the production of carbonate of
lime or limestone, and chloride of sodium or common salt. This
process is one still going on at the earth’s surface, slowly breaking
down and destroying the hardest rocks, and, aided by mechanical
processes, transforming them into clays; although the action, from
the comparative rarity of carbonic acid in the atmosphere, is less
energetic than in earlier times, when the abundance of this gas, and
a higher temperature, favoured the chemical decomposition of the
rocks. But now, as then, every clod of clay formed from the decay
of a crystalline rock corresponded to an equivalent of carbonic acid

1867.]              Chemistry of the Primeval Earth.                  183
abstracted from the atmosphere, and equivalents of carbonate of lime
and common salt formed from the chloride of ca1cium~of the sea-water.
    It is very instructive, in this connection, to compare the composi
tion of the waters of the modern ocean with that of the sea in ancient
times, whose composition we learn from the fossil sea-waters which
are still to be found in certain regions, imprisoned in the pores of
the older strati<U+FB01>ed rocks. These are vastly richer in salts of lime
and magnesia than those of the present sea, from which have been
separated, by chemical processes, all the carbonate of lime of our lime
stones, with the exception of that derived from the sub-aerial decay of
calcareous and magnesian silicates belonging to the primitive crust.
    The gradual removal, in the form of carbonate of lime, of the
carbonic acid from the primeval atmosphere, has been connected with
great changes in the organic life of the globe. The air was doubtless
at <U+FB01>rst un<U+FB01>t for the respiration of warm-blooded animals, and we <U+FB01>nd
the higher forms of life coming gradually into existence as we ap
proach the present period of a purer air. . Calculations lead us to
conclude that the amount of carbon thus removed in the form of
carbonic acid has been so enormous, that we must suppose the earlier
forms of air-breathing animals to have been peculiarly adapted to live
in an atmosphere which would probably be too impure to support
modern reptilian life. The agency of plants in purifying the primi
tive atmosphere was long since pointed out by Brongniart, and our
great stores of fossil fuel have been derived from the decomposition,
by the ancient vegetation, of the excess of carbonic acid of the early
atmosphere, which through this agency was exchanged for oxygen gas.
In this connection the vegetation of former periods presents the curious
phenomenon of plants allied to those now growing beneath the tropics,
<U+FB02>ourishing within the polar circles. Many ingenious hypotheses have
been proposed to account for the warmer climate of earlier times, but
are at best unsatisfactory, and it appears to me that the true solution of
the problem may be found in the constitution of the early atmosphere,
when considered in the light of Dr. Tyndall’s beautiful researches on
radiant heat. He has found that the presence of a few hundredths
of carbonic acid gas in the atmosphere, while offering almost no
obstacle to the passage of the solar rays, would suffice to prevent
almost entirely the loss by radiation of obscure heat, so that the
surface of the land beneath such an atmosphere would become like a
vast orchard-house, in which the conditions of climate necessary to a
luxuriant vegetation would be extended even to the polar regions.
This peculiar condition of the early atmosphere cannot fail to have
in<U+FB02>uenced in many other ways the processes going on at the earth’s
surface. To take a single ,example: one of the processes by which
gypsum may be produced at the earth’s surface involves the simul
taneous production of carbonate of magnesia. This, being more
soluble than the gypsum, is not always now found associated with it;
but we have indirect evidence that it was formed and subsequently
carried away, in the case of many gypsum deposits, whose thickness

184                    Mr. T. Sierry Hunt on the                 [May 31,
indicates a long continuance of the process under conditions much
more perfect and complete than we can attain under our present
atmosphere. While studying this reaction I was led to inquire
whether the carbonic acid of the earlier periods might not have
favoured the formation of gypsum; and I found, by repeating the
experiments in an arti<U+FB01>cial atmosphere impregnated with carbonic
acid, that such was really the case. We may thence conclude that the
peculiar composition of the primeval atmosphere was the essential
condition under which the great deposits of gypsum, generally associ
ated with magnesian limestones, were formed.
     The reactions of the atmosphere which we have considered, would
have the e<U+FB02>'ect of breaking down and disintegrating the surface of the
primeval globe, covering it everywhere with beds of stratified rock of
mechanical or of chemical origin. These would now so deeply cover
the partially cooled surface that the amount of heat escaping from
below is inconsiderable, although in earlier times it was very much
greater, and the increase of temperature met with in descending into
the earth must have been many times more rapid than now. The
effect of this heat upon the buried sediments would be to soften them,
producing new chemical reactions between their elements, and con
verting them into what are known as crystalline or metamorphic rocks,
such as gnciss, greenstone, granite, &c. We are often told that granite
is the primitive rock or substratum of the earth, but this is not only
unproved, but extremely improbable. As I endeavoured to show in
the early part of this discourse, the composition of this primitive rock,
now everywhere hidden, must have been very much like that of a slag
or lava; and there are excellent chemical reasons for maintaining that
granite is in every case a rock of sedimentary origin——that is to say,
it is made up of materials which were deposited from water, like beds
of modern sand and gravel, and includes in its composition quartz,
which, so far as we know, can only be generated by aqueous agencies,
and at comparatively low temperatures.

compounds, all results of the reaction of the elements of sedimentary
rocks, heated in presence of the water which everywhere <U+FB01>lled their
pores. In the products thus generated we have a rational explanation
of the chemical phenomena of volcanoes, which are vents through
which these fused rocks and con<U+FB01>ned gases <U+FB01>nd their way to the surface
of the earth. In some cases, as where there is no disengagement of
gases, :the fused or half-fused rocks solidify in situ, or in rents or'
<U+FB01>ssures in the overlying strata, and constitute eruptive or plutonic
rocks like granite and basalt.
    This theory of volcanic phenomena was put forward in germ by
Sir John F. W. Herschel thirty years since, and, as I have during the
past few years endeavoured to show, it is the one most in accordance
with what we know both of the chemistry and the physics of the earth.

1867.]              Chemistry of the Primeval Earth.                   ‘185
That all volcanic and plutonic phenomena have their seat in the
deeply buried and softened zone of sedimentary deposits of the earth,
and not in its primitive nucleus, accords with the conclusions already
arrived at relative to the solidity of that nucleus, with the geological
relations of these phenomena as I have elsewhere shown; and also
with the remarkable mathematical and astronomical deductions of the
late Mr. Hopkins, of Cambridge, based upon the phenomena of
precession and nutation; those of Archdeacon Pratt ; and those of
Professor Thompson on the theory of the tides ; all of which lead to
the same c0nclusi0n—namely, that the earth, if not solid to the centre,
must have a crust several hundred miles in thickness, which would

temperature communicated by conduction to the sedimentary strata
reposing upon it.
    The old question between the plutonists and the neptunists, which
divided the scienti<U+FB01>c world in the last generation, was, in brief, this
whether <U+FB01>re or water had been the great agent in giving origin and
form to the rocks of the earth’s crust. While some maintained the
direct igneous origin of such rocks as gneiss, mica-schist, and serpen
tine, and ascribed to <U+FB01>re the <U+FB01>lling of metallic veins, others—the
neptunian school—~were disposed to shut their eyes to the evidences of
igneous action on the earth, and even sought to derive all rocks from
a primal aqueous magma. In the light of the exposition which I have
laid before you this evening, we can, I think, render justice to both of
these opposing schools. We have seen how actions dependent on
water and acid solutions have operated on the primitive plutonic mass,
and how the resulting aqueous sediments, when deeply buried, come
again within the domain of <U+FB01>re, to be transformed into crystalline and
so-ealled plntonic or volcanic rocks.
     The scheme which I have endeavoured to put before you in the
short time allotted, is, as I have endeavoured to show, in strict con
formity with known chemical laws and the facts of physical and
geological science. Did time permit, I would gladly have attempted
to demonstrate at greater length its adaptation to the explanation of
the origin of the various classes of rocks, of metallic veins and deposits,
of mineral springs, and of gaseous exhalations. I shall not, however,
have failed in my object, if, in the hour which we have spent together,
I shall have succeeded in showing that chemiltry is able to throw a
great light upon the history of the formation of our globe, and to
explain in a satisfactory manner some of the most dif<U+FB01>cult problems of
geology; and I feel that there is a peculiar <U+FB01>tness in bringing such
an exposition before the members of this Royal Institution, which has
been for so many years devoted to the study of pure science, and
whose glory it is, through the illustrious men who have <U+FB01>lled, and
those who now <U+FB01>ll, its professorial chairs, to have contributed more
than any other school in the world to the progress of modern chemistry
and physics.                                   .              [1,. S. H'J

THE discourse was delivered at the request of the excellent president
of the Royal Institution. The speaker had no new discovery to make
known, and the utmost he could hope to achieve was to give a few
old discoveries such a form as would interest an intellectual audience.
    A few of the more striking phenomena of electro-magnetism were
<U+FB01>rst exhibited by means of a helix and a core of soft iron. The ques
tion arose, “ suppose that core to be transparent, what would be the
e<U+FB01>'ect of its magnetization upon a beam of light passing through it ‘P "
Probably such a question presented itself to the mind of Faraday.
But iron was not transparent, and our great experimentalist had to
seek long before he found a transparent substance, which enabled him
to demonstrate the action of magnetism upon light.

plane of vibration and the plane of polarization.
    A plate of quartz, composed of two semicircles, the one belonging
to a right-handed and the other to a left-handed crystal, was placed
in front of the electric lamp, and through the plate was sent a beam
of plane polarized light.            The beam then passed through two
perforated masses of iron, which rested on the two ends of a powerful
electro-magnet—these pieces of iron were in fact the movable poles
of the magnet. Beyond the furthest pole was placed a Foucault’s
prism, through which the beam also passed, being <U+FB01>nally received
upon a white screen. A lens was introduced between the circular plate
of quartz and the magnet; and by this lens a magni<U+FB01>ed image of the
plate of quartz was thrown upon the screen.
    The speaker showed the changes of colour produced when the plane

1867.]      on some Experiments of Faraday, Biot, and Savart.         189
of polarization was caused to rotate. Bringing, for example, the
entire image of the quartz plate to a delicate puce, the slightest
rotation of the Foucault’s prism coloured one of the semicircles a
vivid red and the other a vivid green. Restoring the puee colour,
and placing a bar of the heavy glass with which Faraday <U+FB01>rst demon
strated the action of magnetism upon light from pole to pole of the
magnet, the beam was transmitted by the glass, and the image upon
the screen was unchanged.
    On new exciting the magnet, the uniformity of the colour dis
appeared ; one semicircle ran rapidly into a vivid red, the other into
a vivid green. The relative position of the colours changed when the
direction of the current was changed: when the current was inter
rupted, the puee colour was restored. Thus it was proved that the
act of magnetization produced the same effect as the mechanical
rotation of the plane of polarization; and this is the celebrated expe
riment which Faraday described as the magnetization of a ray of
light.
    The beautiful experiment of Biot on the in<U+FB02>uence of sonorous
vibrations on plane polarized light was next thrown into a form which
allowed the whole audience to see the effect. A rectangle of glass,
6 feet long, 2 inches wide, and about 1} of an inch thick, was clasped
by a clamp at its centre, being so placed between the polarizer and
analyzer that the beam crossed the glass rectangle near its centre.
The polarizing prisms were placed so as to darken the <U+FB01>eld of view. A
sweep of a wet cloth over the distant half of the glass rectangle brought
out its tone, and immediately a luminous disk a yard in diameter
<U+FB02>ashed out upon the screen. Evcrylsweep of the cloth threw the
glass into sonorous vibration and illuminated the screen.
    A plate of selenite was so placed between the polarizer and ana
lyzer as to show a system of vividly coloured rings. By a suitable
arrangement of the experiment, the colours were wholly obliterated
when the glass rectangle was thrown into longitudinal vibration.
    None of these e<U+FB02>'ects could be produced when the polarized beam
passed through the rectangle near one of its ends; for here, as is well
known, the necessary strains and pressures were absent.
    The remaining experiments had reference to the action of sonorous
vibrations upon jets of water. A vein was discharged obliquely from
the nipple of an ordinary gas burner. The vein broke into scattered
drops. By the light of the electric lamp, a dense shadow of the vein
was thrown upon a white screen; on sounding an organ pipe, or a
tuning-fork of the proper pitch, the drops suddenly gathered them
selves together, forming an apparently continuous band several feet in
length. On the suspension of the sound the drops broke asunder as
before. The minuteness of the vibration, which is competent to
produce this effect upon the vein, is extraordinary. After a tuning
fork had ceased to be heard, when placed against the support of the
    VOL. V.    (No. 46.)                                         P

nipple from which the vein issued, the drops gathered themselves
together, and remained in coalescence long subsequent to the apparent
subsidence of the motion.
     A jet of water was permitted to descend vertically. Its two portions,
the continuous and the discontinuous, were described. An arrange
ment was devised by which the vein was vividly illuminated from
above. The continuous portion was of dazzling brilliancy ; the point
of rupture being thus rendered strikingly manifest. On sounding the
proper note, the continuous vein shrunk almost up to its aperture.
The e<U+FB01>'ect of beats was very <U+FB01>ne; as they addressed the ear, the
lengthening and shortening of the luminous cylinder, in perfect syn
chronism with the beats, went on. Here also the amount of motion,
if only of the proper quality, which in<U+FB02>uences the vein, may be in<U+FB01>
nitesimal: the vein, in fact, declares the existence of the beats long
after the ear has ceased to hear them.

IT has been thought desirable to give you and the world some
image of MICHAEL FARADAY, as a scienti<U+FB01>c investigator and dis
coverer. The attempt to respond to this desire has been to me a
labour of di<U+FB02>icnlty, if also a labour of love. For however well
acquainted I may be with the researches and discoveries of that great
master,—however numerous the illustrations which occur to me of
the loftiness of Faraday’s character and the beauty of his life,-—still
to grasp him and his researches as a whole; to seize upon the ideas
which guided him, and connected them; to gain entrance into that
strong and active brain, and read from it the riddle of the w01'ld—this
is a work not easy of performance, and all but impossible amid the dis
traction of duties of another kind. That I should at one period or
another speak to you regarding Faraday and his work, is natural, if
not inevitable; but I did not expect to be called upon to speak so
soon. Still the bare suggestion that this is the <U+FB01>t and proper time
for speech sent me immediately to my task: from it I have returned
with such results as I could gather, and also with the wish that those
resultstwere more worthy than they are of the greatness of my theme.
    It is not my intention to lay before you a life of Faraday in the
ordinary acceptation of the term. The duty I have to perform is to
give you some notion of what he has done in the world; dwelling
incidentally on the spirit in which his work was executed, and intro
ducing such personal traits as may be necessary to the completion
of your picture of the philosopher, though by no means adequate to
give you a complete idea of the man.
    The newspapers have already informed you that Michael Faraday

 200                            Professor Tyndall                              [Jan
 was born at Newington Butts, on the 22nd of September, 1791, and that
 he fell <U+FB01>nally asleep at Hampton Court, on the 25th of August, 1867.
 Believing, as I do, in the general truth of the doctrine of hereditary
 transmission-sharing the opinion of Mr. Carlylehthat “a really able
 man never proceeded from entirely stupid parents ”—I once used the
 privilege of my intimacy with Mr. Faraday to ask him whether
 his parents showed any signs of unusual ability. He could remem
 ber none. His father, I believe, was a great sufferer during the later
 years of his life, and this might have masked whatever intellectual
 power he possessed. When thirteen years old, that is to say in 1804,
 Faraday was apprenticed to a bookseller and bookbinder in Bland
 ford-street, Manchester-square : here he spent eight years of his life,
after which he worked as a journeyman elsewhere.
     You have also heard the account of Faraday’s <U+FB01>rst contact with
 the Royal Institution: that he was introduced by one of the members
 to Sir Humphry Davy’s last lectures; that he took notes of those
 lectures, wrote them fairly out, and sent them to Davy, entreating him
 at the same time to enable him to quit trade, which he detested, and
 to pursue science, which he loved. Davy was helpful to the young
 man, and this should never be forgotten: he at once wrote to Faraday,
 and afterwards, when an opportunity occurred, made him his assistant?“
Mr. Gassiot has lately favoured me with the following reminiscence
 of this time :-—
                                           “ CLAPHAM Common, SURREY,
                                                       “ 28th November, 1867.
“ MY DEAR TYNDALL,
     “ Sir H. Davy was accustomed to call on the late Mr. Pepys in the Poultry
on his way to the London Institution, of which Pepys was one of the original
managers; the latter told me that on one occasion, Sir H. Davy, showing him
a letter said, ‘Pepys, what am I to do, here is a letter from a young‘man
named Faraday ; he has been attending my lectures and wants me to give him
employment at the Royal Institution, what can I do P’ ‘ Do,’ replied Pepys,
‘ put him to wash bottles; if he is good for anything, he will do it directly;
if he refuses, he is good for nothing.’ ‘ No, no,’ replied Davy; ‘ we must try
him with something better than that.’ The result was, that Davy engaged
him to assist in the Laboratory at weekly wages.
    “ Davy held the joint o<U+FB02>ice of Professor of Chemistry, and Director of the
Laboratory; he ultimately gave up the former to the late Professor Brande,
    * Here is Davy’s recommendation of Faraday, presented to the managers of
the Royal Institution, at a meeting on the 18th of March, 1813, Charles Hatchett,
Esq., in the chair :—
    “ Sir Humphry Davy has the honour to inform the managers that he has found
a person who is desirous to occupy the situation in the Institution lately <U+FB01>lled by
William Payne. His name is Michael Faraday. He is a youth of twenty-two
years of age. As far as Sir H. Davy has been able to observe or ascertain, he
appears well <U+FB01>tted for the situation. His habits seem good; his disposition active
and cheerful, and his manner intelligent. He is willing to engage himself on the
same terms as given to Mr. Payne at the time of quitting the Institution.
    “Resolved,—That Michael Faraday be engaged to <U+FB01>ll the situation lately
occupied by Mr. Payne, on the same terms.”

1868.]                    on Faraday as a Discoverer.           \              201
but he insisted that Faraday should be appointed Director of the Laboratory,
and, as Faraday told me, this enabled him on subsequent occasions to hold a
de<U+FB01>nite position in the Institution, in which he was always supported by Davy.
I believe he held that of<U+FB01>ce to the last.
                           “ Believe me, my dear Tyndall, yours truly,       ‘
   “Dr. Tyndall.”                                                “J. P. Gnssror.
      From a letter written by Faraday himself soon after his appoint
ment as Davy’s assistant, I extract the following account of his intro
duction to the Royal Institution :—
                                                  “ LONDON, Sept. 13th, 1813.
     “ As for myself I am absent (from home) nearly day and night except
occasional calls, and it is likely shall shortly be absent entirely, but this
(having nothing more to say and at the request of my. mother) I will
explain to you. I was formerly a bookseller and binder, but am now turned
philosopher,‘ which happened thus :—Whilst an apprentice, I, for amusement,
learnt a little chemistry and other parts of philosophy, and felt an eager desire
to proceed in that way further. After being a journeyman for six months under
a disagreeable master, I gave up my business, and through the interest of :1,
Sir H. Davy, <U+FB01>lled the situation of chemical assistant to the Royal Institution
of Great Britain, in which o<U+FB01>ice I now remain; and where I am constantly
 employed in observing the works of nature, and tracing the manner in which
 she directs the order and arrangement of the world. I have lately had pro
posals made to me by Sir Humphry Davy, to accompany him in his travels
through Europe and Asia as philosophical assistant. If I go at all I expect
it will be in October next—about the end, and my absence from home will
perhaps be as long as three years. But as yet all is uncertain.”
      This account is supplemented by the following letter, written by
Faraday to his friend De la Rive,T on the occasion of the death of
Mrs. Marcet. The letter is dated 2nd Sept, 1858 :—
“ MY DEAR FRIEND,
     “ Your subject interested me deeply every way; for Mrs. Marcet was a
good friend to me, as she must have been to many of the human race. I
entered the shop of a bookseller and bookbinder at the age of 13, in the year
1804, remained there eight years, and during the chief part of the time
bound books. Now it was in those books, in the hours after work, that I
found the beginning of my philosophy. There were two that especially helped
me, the ‘ Encyclopaedia Britannica,’ from which I gained my <U+FB01>rst notions of
electricity, and Mrs. Marcet’s ‘ Conversations on Chemistry,’ which gave me
my foundation in that science. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
     “ Do not suppose that I was a very deep thinker, or was marked as a pre
cocious person. I was a very lively, imaginative person, and could believe in
the ‘Arabian Nights’ as easily as in the ‘ Encyclopzedia.’ But facts were
important to me, and saved me. I could trust a fact, and always cross
examined an assertion. So when I questioned Mrs. Marcet’s book by such
little experiments as I could <U+FB01>nd means to perform, and found it true to the
    * Faraday loved this word and employed it to the last; he had an intense
dislike to the modern term physicist.

facts as I could understand them, I felt that I had got hold of an anchor in
chemical knowledge, and clung fast to it. Thence my deep veneration for Mrs.
Marcet—<U+FB01>rst, as one who had conferred great personal good and pleasure on
me; and then as one able to convey the truth and principle of those boundless
<U+FB01>elds of knowledge which concern natural things, to the young, untaught, and
inquiring mind.
    “ You may imagine my delight when I came to know Mrs. Mareet per
sonally; how often I cast my thoughts backward, delighting to connect the
past and the present; how often, when sending a paper to her as a thank
o<U+FB02>‘ering, I thought of my <U+FB01>rst instructress, and such like thoughts will remain
with me.
    “ I have some such thoughts even as regards your own father; who was, I
may say, the <U+FB01>rst who personally at Geneva, and afterwards by correspondence,
encouraged, and by that sustained me.”
     Twelve or thirteen years ago Mr. Faraday and myself quitted the
Institution one evening together, to pay a visit in Baker-street. He
took my arm at the door, and, pressing it to his side in his warm
genial way, said, “Come, Tyndall, I will now show you something
that will interest you.” We walked northwards, passed the house of
Mr. Babbage, which drew forth a reference to the famous evening
parties once assembled there.           We reached Blandford-street, and
after a little looking about, he paused before a stationer’s shop,
and then went in. On entering the shop, his usual animation seemed
doubled; he looked rapidly at everything it contained. To the left
on entering was a door, through which he looked down into a little
room, with a window in front facing Blandford-street. Drawing me
towards him, he said eagerly, “Look there, Tyndall; that was my
working-place. I bound books in that little nook.” A respectable
looking woman stood behind the counter: his conversation with me
was too low to be heard by her, and he now turned to the counter to
buy some cards as an excuse for our being there. He asked the woman
her name-—her predecessor’s namchhis predecessor’s name. “ That
won’t do,” he said, with good-humoured impatience, who was his pro
decessor ‘P ” “ Mr. Riebau,” she replied, and immediately added, as if
suddenly recollecting herself, “ He, sir, was the master of Sir Charles
Faraday.” “Nonsense!” he res onded, “there is no such person.”
Great was her delight when I to d her the name of her visitor; but
she assured me that as soon as she saw him running about the shop,
she felt»—though she did not know why-—that it must be “ Sir Charles
Faraday.”
     Faraday did, as you know, accompany Davy to Rome; he was
re-engaged by the managers of the Royal Institution on the 15th of
May, 1815. Here he made rapid progress in chemistry, and after a
time was entrusted with easy analyses by Davy. In those days the
Royal Institution published ‘ The Quarterly Journal of Science,’ the
precursor of our own ‘Proceedings.’ Faraday’s <U+FB01>rst contribution to
science appeared in that journal in 1816. It was an analysis of
some caustic lime from Tuscany, which had been sent to Davy by
the Duchess of Montrose. Between this period and 1818 various

  notes and papers were published by Faraday. In 1818 he experi
  mentcd upon “Sounding Flames.” Professor Auguste De la. Rive,
  father of our present excellent De la Rive, had investigated those
  sounding <U+FB02>ames, and had applied to them an explanation which com
  pletely accounted for a. class 'of sounds discovered by De la. Rive
  himself. By a few simple and conclusive experiments Faraday proved
  that the explanation was insul<U+FB01>cient. It is an epoch in the life of a.
  young man when he <U+FB01>nds himself correcting a person of eminence,
  and in Faraday’s case, where its e<U+FB01>‘ect was to develop a modest self
  trust, such an event could not fail to act pro<U+FB01>tably.
      From time to time between 1818 and 1820 Faraday published
  scienti<U+FB01>c notes and notices of minor weight. At this time he was
 acquiring, not producing; working hard for his master and storing
 and strengthening his own mind. He assisted Mr. Brande in his
 lectures, and so quietly, skilfully, and modestly was his work done,
 that Mr. Brande’s vocation at the time was pronounced “lecturing on
 velvet.” In 1820 Faraday published a chemical paper “on two new
 compounds of chlorine and carbon, and on a new compound of iodine,
 carbon, and hydrogen.” This paper was read before the Royal Society
 on the 21st of Dec. 1820, and it was the <U+FB01>rst of his that was honoured
 with a place in the ‘ Philosophical Transactions.’
      On the 12th of June, 1821, he married, and obtained leave to bring
 his young wife into his rooms at the Royal Institution. There for forty
 six years they lived together, occupying the suite of apartments which
 had been previously in the successive occupancy of Young, Davy, and
 Brande. At the time of her marriage Mrs. Faraday was twenty-one
 years of age, he being nearly thirty. Regarding this marriage I will
 at present limit myself to quoting an entry written in Faraday’s own
 hand in his book of diplomas, which caught my eye while in his
 company some years ago.       It ran thus :—
                                                       “ 25th January, 1847.
     “ Amongst these records and events, I here insert the date of one which, as
a. source of honour and happiness, far exceeds all the rest. We were married
on the 12th of June, 1821.
                                                             “ M. FABADAY.”
     Then follows the copy of the minutes, dated 21st May, 1821, which
gave him additional rooms, and thus enabled him to bring his wife
to the Royal Institution. A feature of Faraday’s character which I
have often noticed makes itself apparent in this entry. In his relations
to his Wife he added chivalry to affection.
Early Researches : Magnetic Rotations .' Liquefaction of Gases : Heavy
            Glass : Charles Anderson : Contributions to Physics.
     Oersted, in 1820, discovered the action of a voltaic current on
a magnetic needle ; and immediately afterwards the splendid intellect
of Ampere succeeded in showing that every magnetic phenomenon

 then known might be reduced to the mutual action of electric cur
 rents. The subject occupied all men’s thoughts ; and in this country
 Dr. Wollaston sought to convert the de<U+FB02>ection of the needle by the
 current into a permanent rotation of the needle round the current.
 He also hoped to produce the reciprocal effect of causing a current to
 rotate round a magnet. In the early part of 1821 Wollaston attempted
 to realize this idea in the presence of Sir Humphry Davy in the
 laboratory of the Royal Institution. This was well calculated to
 attract Faraday’s attention to the subject. He read much about it; and
 in the months of July, August, and September he wrote “ a history of
 the progress of electro-magnetism,” which he published-in Thomson’s
 ‘Annals of Philosophy.’ Soon afterwards he took up the subject of
 “ Magnetic Rotations,” and on the morning of Christmas day, 1821,
 he called his wife to witness for the <U+FB01>rst time the revolution of a
 magnetic needle round an electric current. Incidental to the “ historic
 sketch” he repeated ahnost all the experiments there referred to; and
 these, added to his own subsequent work, made him practical master
 of all that was then known regarding the voltaic current. In 1821
 he also touched upon a subject which subsequently received his closer
 attention——the vaporization of mercury at common temperatures;
 and immediately afterwards conducted, in company with Mr. Stodart,
 experiments on the alloys of steel. He was accustomed in after years
 to present to his friends razors formed from one of the alloys then
 discovered.
     During Faraday’s hours of liberty from other duties he took up
 subjects of inquiry for himself; and in the spring of 1823, thus self
 prompted, he began the examination of a substance which had long
 been regarded as the chemical element chlorine, in a solid form, but
 which Sir Humphry Davy, in 1810, had proved to be a hydrate of
 chlorine, that is, a compound of chlorine and water.              Faraday <U+FB01>rst
 analyzed this hydrate, and wrote out an account of its composition.
 This account was looked over by Davy, who suggested the heat
 ing of the hydrate under pressure in a sealed glass tube. This was
 done. The hydrate fused at a blood-heat, the tube became <U+FB01>lled with
 a yellow atmosphere and was found to contain two liquid substances.
 Dr. Paris happened to enter the laboratory while Faraday was at work.
 Seeing the oily liquid in his tube he rallied the young chemist for
 his carelessness in employing soiled vessels. On <U+FB01>ling oil‘ the end
 of the tube its contents exploded and the oily matter vanished.
 Early next morning Dr. Paris received the following note :—
 “ DEAR Sm,
      “ The oil you noticed yesterday turns out to be liquid chlorine.
                                                   “ Yours faithfully,
                                                            “ M. FARADAY.” *
 The gas had been lique<U+FB01>ed by its own pressure. Faraday then tried
 compression with a syringe, and succeeded thus in liquefying the gas.

1868.]                  on Faraday as a‘ Discoverer.                  \ 205
    To the published account of this experiment Davy added the fol
lowing n0te:—“ In desiring Mr. Faraday to expose the hydrate of
chlorine in a closed glass tube, it occurred to me that one of three
things would happen: that it would become <U+FB02>uid as a hydrate ; that
decomposition of water would occur;          . . . or that the chlorine
would separate in a <U+FB02>uid state.” Davy, moreover, immediately applied
the method of self-compressing atmospheres to the liquefaction of
mnriatic gas. Faraday continued the experiments and succeeded‘ in
reducing a number of gases till‘ then deemed permanent to the liquid
condition. In 1844 he returned to the subject, and considerably
expanded its limits. These important investigations established the
fact that gases are but the vapours of liquids possessing a very low
boiling-point, and gave a. sure basis to our views of molecular aggre
gation. The account of the <U+FB01>rst investigation was read before the
Royal Society on the 10th of April, 1823, and was published, in
Faraday’s name, in the ‘Philosophical Transactions.’ The second
memoir was sent to the Royal Society on the 19th of December, 1844.
I may add that while he was conducting his <U+FB01>rst experiments on the
liquefaction of gases, thirteen pieces of glass were on one occasion driven
by an explosion into Faraday’s eye.
    Some small notices and papers, including the observation that
glass readily changes colour in sunlight, follow here. In 1825 and
1826 Faraday published papers in the ‘Philosophical Transactions’
on “new compounds of carbon and hydrogen,” and on “sulpho
naphthalic acid.” In the former of these papers he announced the
discovery of Benzol, which, in the hands of modern chemists, has
become the foundation of our splendid aniline dyes. But he swerved
incessantly from chemistry into physics; and in 1826 we <U+FB01>nd him
engaged in investigating the limits of vaporization, and showing, by
exceedingly strong and apparently conclusive arguments, that even
in the case of mercury such a limit exists; much more he conceived
it to be certain that our atmosphere does not contain the vapour of
the <U+FB01>xed constituents of the earth’s crust. This question, I may say,
is likely to remain an open one. Mr. Rankine, for example, has lately
drawn attention to the odour of certain metals; whence comes this
odour, if it be not from the vapour of the metal ?
    In 1825 Faraday became a member of a committee, to which
Sir John Herschel and Mr. Dollond also belonged, appointed by the
Royal Society to examine, and if possible improve, the manufacture
of glass for optical purposes. Their experiments continued till 1829,
when the account of them constituted the subject of a “ Bakerian Lec
ture.” This lectureship, founded in 1774 by Henry Baker, Esq., of
the Strand, London, provides that every year a. lecture shall be given
before the Royal Society, the sum of four pounds being paid to the
lecturer.   The Bakerian Lecture, however, has long since passed from
the region of pay to that of honour, papers of mark only being chosen
for it by the council of the Society. Faraday’s <U+FB01>rst Bakerian Lecture,
“ On the Manufacture of Glass for Optical Purposes,” was delivered

  scription of processes, precautions, and results: the details were so
  exact and so minute, and the paper consequently so long, that three
  successive sittings of the Royal Society were taken up by the delivery
  of the lecture)“ This glass did not turn out to be of important prac
  tical use, but it happened afterwards to be the foundation of two of
  Faraday’s greatest diseoveriesrf
        The experiments here referred to, were commenced at the Falcon
  Glass Works, on, the premises of Messrs. Green and Pellatt, but
  Faraday could not conveniently attend to them there. In 1827 there
  fore a furnace was erected in the yard of the Royal Institution; and
  it was at this time, and with a view of assisting him at the furnace,
  that Faraday engaged Sergeant Anderson, of the Royal Artillery, the
  respectable, truthful, and altogether trustworthy man whose appearance
  here is so fresh in our memories. Anderson continued to be the reve
  rential helper of Faraday and the faithful servant of this Institution
  for nearly forty years.;[:
       In 1831 Faraday published apaper “ On a peculiar class of Optical
  Deceptions,” to which I believe the beautiful optical toy called the
  Chromatrope owes its origin. In the same year he published a paper
  on Vibrating Surfaces, in which he solved an acoustical problem which,
  though of extreme simplicity when solved, appears to have ba<U+FB02>'led many
  eminent men. The problem was to account for the fact that light
  bodies, such as the seed of lycopodium, collected at the vibrating parts
  of sounding plates, while sand ran to the nodal lines. Faraday showed
  that the light bodies were entangled in the little whirlwinds formed
  in the air over the places of vibration, and through which the heavier
   sand was readily projected. Faraday’s resources as an experimentalist
  were so wonderful, and his delight in experiment was so great, that he

       t I make the following extract from a letter from Sir John Herschel, written
   to me from Collingwood, on the 3rd of November, 1867 :—
       " I will take this opportunity to mention that I believe myself to have originated
   the suggestion of the employment of borate of lead for optical purposes. It was
   somewhere in the year 1822, as well as I can recollect, that I mentioned it to Sir
   James (then Mr.) South ; and, in consequence, the trial was made in his labora
   tory in Blackman-street, by precipitating and working a large quantity of borate
   of lead, and fusing it under a mu<U+FB02>ie in a porcelain evaporating dish. A ve
   limpid ithough sli htly yellow) glass resulted, the refractive index 1'866 ! (which
   you wil <U+FB01>nd set own in my table of refractive indices in my article ‘ Light,’
   ‘ Encyclopsedia Metropolitana’). It was, however, too soft for optical use as an
   object glass. This Faraday overcame, at least to a considerabie degree, by the
   introduction of silica."
       1 Regarding Anderson, Faraday writes thus in 1845:—“I cannot resist the
   occasion that is thus offered to me of mentioning the name of Mr. Anderson, who
   came to me as an assistant in the glass experiments, and has remained ever since in
   the laboratory of the Royal Institution. He assisted me in all the researches into
   which I have entered since that time; and to his care, steadiness, cxactitude, and
    faithfulness in the performance of all that has been committed to his charge, I am
    much indebted-M. F.”—Exp. Researches, vol. iii., p. 3, footnote.

Discovery of Magneto-electricity: Explanation of Arago’s Magnetism
      of Rotation: Terrestrial Magneto-electric Induction: The Extra
      Current.
    The work thus far referred to, though sufficient of itself to secure
no mean scienti<U+FB01>c reputation, forms but the vestibule of Faraday’s
achievements. He had been engaged within these walls for eighteen
years)‘ During part of the time he had drunk in knowledge from
Davy, and during the remainder he continually exercised his capacity
for independent inquiry. In 1831 we have him at the climax of his
intellectual strength, forty years of age, stored with knowledge and
full of original power. Through reading, lecturing, and experiment
ing, he had become thoroughly familiar" with electrical science: he
saw where light was needed and expansion possible. The phenomena
of ordinary electric induction belonged, as it were, to the alphabet of
his knowledge : he knew that under ordinary circumstances the pre
sence of an electri<U+FB01>ed body was su<U+FB01>icient to excite, by induction, an
unelectri<U+FB01>ed body. He lmew that the wire which carried an electric
current was an electri<U+FB01>ed body, and still that all attempts had failed
to make it excite in other wires a state similar to its own.
     What was the reason of this failure ‘P Faraday never could work
from the experiments of others, however clearly described. He know
well that from every experiment issued a kind of radiation, luminous
in different degrees to different minds, and he hardly trusted himself
to reason upon an experiment that he had not seen. In the autumn
of 1831 he began to repeat the experiments with electric currents,
which, up to that time, had produced no positive result. And here, for
the sake of younger inquirers, if not for the sake of us all, it is worth
while to dwell for a moment on a power which Faraday possessed
in an extraordinary degree. He united vast strength with perfect
<U+FB02>exibility. His momentum was that of a river which combines weight
and directness with the ability to yield to the <U+FB02>exures of its bed. The
intentness of his vision in any direction did not apparently diminish
his power of perception in other directions; and when he attacked a
subject, expecting results, he had the faculty of keeping his mind alert,
so that results di<U+FB02>'erent from those which he expected should not
escape him through pro-occupation.
     He began his experiments “ on the induction of electric currents"
by composing a helix of two insulated wires, which were wound
side by side round the same wooden cylinder One of these wires he
    * He used to say that it required twenty years of work to make a man in
Physical Science ; the previous period being one of infancy.

connected with a voltaic battery of ten cells, and the other with a
sensitive galvanometer. When connection with the battery was made,
and while the current <U+FB02>owed, no effect whatever was observed at the
galvanometer. But he never accepted an experimental result, until
he had applied to it the utmost power at his command. He raised
his battery from 10 cells to 120 cells, but without avail. The cur
rent <U+FB02>owed calmly through the battery wire without producing, during
its <U+FB02>ow, any sensible result upon the galvanometer.
    “During its <U+FB02>ow,” and this was the time when an e<U+FB02>'ect was ex
pected—but here Faraday’s power of lateral vision, separating, as
it were, from the line of expectation, came into play——he noticed that
a feeble movement of the needle always occurred at the moment when
he made contact with the battery; that the needle would afterwards
return to its former position and remain quietly there, unaffected by the
<U+FB02>owing current. At the moment, however, when the circuit was in
terrupted the needle again moved, and in a direction opposed to that
observed on the completion of the circuit.
    This result and others of a similar kind led him to the con
clusion “that the battery current through the one wire did in reality
induce a similar current through the other; but that it continued for
an instant only, and partook more of the nature of the electric wave
from a common Leyden jar than of the current from a voltaic battery.”
The momentary currents thus generated were called induced currents,
while the current which generated them was called the inducing current.
It was immediately proved that the current generated at making the
circuit was always opposed in direction to its generator, while that
developed on the rupture of the circuit coincided in direction with
the inducing current. It appeared as if the current on its <U+FB01>rst rush
through the primary wire sought a purchase in the secondary one,
and, by a kind of kick, impelled backward through the latter an
electric wave, which subsided as soon as the primary current was fully
established.
    Faraday for a time believed that the secondary wire, though quies
cent when the primary current had been once established, was not in
its natural condition, its return to that condition being declared by
the current observed at breaking the circuit. He called this hypo
thetical state of the wire the electro-tonic state: he afterwards aban
doned this hypothesis, but seemed to return to it in later life. The
term electro-tonic is also preserved by Professor Du Bois Reymond
to express a certain electric condition of the nerves, and Professor
Clerk Maxwell has ably de<U+FB01>ned and illustrated the hypothesis in the
tenth volume of the ‘ Transactions of the Cambridge Philosophical
Society.’
    The mere approach of a wire forming a closed curve to a second
wire through which a voltaic current <U+FB02>owed was then shown by
Faraday to be su<U+FB02>icient to arouse in the neutral wire an induced
current, opposed in direction to the inducing current ; the Withdrawal
of the wire also generated a current having the same direction as the

 inducing current; those currents existed only during the time of
approach or withdrawal, and when neither the primary nor the secon
dary wire was in motion, no matter how close their proximity might
be, no induced current was generated.
    Faraday has been called a purely inductive philosopher. A great
deal of nonsense is, I fear, uttered in this land of England about
induction and deduction. Some profess to befriend the one, some
the other, while the real vocation of an investigator, like Faraday,
consists in the incessant marriage of both. He was at this time full
of the theory of Ampere, and it cannot be doubted that numbers of
his experiments were executed merely to test his deductions from that
theory. Starting from the discovery of Oersted, the celebrated French
philosopher had shown that all the phenomena of magnetism then
known might be reduced to the mutual attractions and repulsions
of electric currents. Magnetism had been produced from electricity,
and Faraday, who all his life long entertained a strong belief in such
reciprocal actions, now attempted to effect the evolution of elec
tricity from magnetism. Round a welded iron ring he placed two
distinct coils of covered wire, causing the coils to occupy opposite
halves of the ring. Connecting the ends of one of the coils with
a galvanometer, he found that the moment the ring was magnetized
by sending a current through the other coil, the galvanometer needle
whirled round four or <U+FB01>ve times in succession, the action, as before,
was that of a pulse which vanished immediately. On interrupting
the circuit, a whirl of the‘ needle in the opposite direction occurred.
It was only during the time of magnetization or demagnetization that
these effects were produced. The induced currents declared a change
of condition only, and they vanished the moment the act of magne
tization or demagnetization was complete.
    The effects obtained with the welded ring were also obtained with
straight bars of iron. Whether the bars were magnetized by the
electric current, or were excited by the contact of permanent steel
magnets, induced currents were always generated during the rise and
during the subsidence of the magnetism. The use of iron was then
abandoned, and the same e<U+FB02>'ects obtained by merely thrusting a per
manent steel magnet into a coil of wire. A rush of electricity through
the coil accompanied the insertion of the magnet; an equal rush in the
opposite direction accompanied its withdrawal. The precision with
which Faraday describes these results, and the completeness with which
he de<U+FB01>nes the boundaries of his facts, are wonderful. The magnet,
for example, must not be passed quite through the coil, but only half
through, for if passed wholly through, the needle is stopped as by a
blow, and then he shows how this blow results from a reversal of the
electric wave in the helix. He next operated with the powerful perma
nent magnet of the Royal Society, and obtained with it, in an exalted
degree, all the foregoing phenomena.
    And now he turned the light of these discoveries upon the darkest
physical phenomenon of that day. Arago had discovered in 1824,

that a disk of non-magnetic metal had the power of bringing a
vibrating magnetic needle suspended over it rapidly to rest; and
that on causing the disk to rotate the magnetic needle rotated along
with it. When both were quiescent, there was not the slightest
measurable attraction or repulsion exerted between the needle and
the disk; still when in motion the disk was competent to drag after it
not only a light needle but a heavy magnet. The question had been
probed and investigated with admirable skill by both Arago and
Ampere, and Poisson had published a theoretic memoir on the subject;
 but no cause could be assigned for so extraordinary an action. It had
also been examined in this country by two celebrated mcn, Mr. Bab
bage and Sir John Herschel; but it still remained a mystery. Faraday
always recommended the suspension of judgment in cases of doubt. “ I
have always admired,” he says, “the prudence and philosophical reserve
shown by M. Arago in resisting the temptation to give a theory of the
effect he had discovered, so long as he could not devise one which was
perfect in its application, and in refusing to assent to the imperfect
theories of others.” Now, however, the time for theory had come.
 Faraday saw mentally the rotating disk under the operation of the
magnet <U+FB02>ooded with his induced currents; and from the known laws
of interaction between currents and magnets he hoped to deduce the
motion observed by Arago. That hope he realized, showing by actual
experiment that when his disk rotated currents passed through it,
their position and direction being such as must, in accordance with
the established laws of eleetro-magnetic action, produce the observed
rotation.
    Introducing the edge of his disk between the poles of the large
horseshoe magnet of the Royal Society, and connecting the axis and
the edge of the disk, each by a wire with a galvanometer, he ob
tained when the disk was turned round a constant <U+FB02>ow of electricity.
The direction of the current was determined by the direction of
the motion, the current being reversed when the rotation was reversed.
He now states the'law which rules the production of currents in
both disks and wires, and in so doing uses for the <U+FB01>rst time a phrase
which has since become famous. When iron <U+FB01>lings are scattered
over a magnet, the particles of iron arrange themselves in certain
determinate lines called magnetic curves.       In 1831, Faraday for the
<U+FB01>rst time called these curves “lines of magnetic force;” and he
showed that to produce induced currents neither approach to nor
withdrawal from a magnetic source, or centre, or pole, was essential,
but that it was only necessary to cut appropriately the lines of
magnetic force. Faraday’s <U+FB01>rst paper on magneto-electric induction,
which I have here endeavoured to condense, was read before the Royal
Society on the 24th of November, 1831.
    On the 12th of January, 1832, he communicated to the Royal
Society a second paper on Terrestrial Magneto-electric Induction,
which was chosen as the Bakerian Lecture for the year. He placed a
bar of iron in a coil of wire, and lifting the bar into the direction of the

dipping needle, he excited by this action a current in the coil. On
reversing the bar, a current in the opposite direction rushed through
the wire. The same effect was produced, when, on holding the helix
in the line of dip, a bar of iron was thrust into it. Here, however,
the earth acted on the coil through the intermediation of the bar of
iron. He abandoned the bar and simply set a copper-plate spinning
in a horizontal plane; he knew that the earth’s lines of magnetic force
then crossed the plate at an angle of about 70°. When the plate spun
round, the lines of force were intersected and induced currents gene
rated, which produced their proper e<U+FB02>'ect when carried from the
plate to the galvanometer. “ When the plate was in the magnetic
meridian, or in any other plane coinciding with the magnetic dip, then
its rotation produced no effect upon the galvanometer.”
     At the suggestion of a mind fruitful in suggestions of a profound
and philosophic character-I mean that of Sir John Herschel—Mr.
Barlow, of Woolwich, had experimented with a rotating iron shell.
Mr. Christie had also performed an elaborate series of experiments on
a rotating iron disk. Both of them had found that when in rotation
the body exercised a peculiar action upon the magnetic needle, de<U+FB02>ecting
it in a manner which was not observed during quiescence; but neither
of them was aware at the time of the agent which produced this extra
ordinary de<U+FB02>ection. They ascribed it to some change in the magnetism
of the iron shell and disk.
     But Faraday at once saw that his induced currents must come into
play here, and he immediately obtained them from an iron disk. With
a hollow brass ball, moreover, he produced the effects obtained by
Mr. Barlow. Iron was in no way necessary: the only condition of
success was that the rotating body should be of a character to admit
of the formation of currents in its substance : it must, in other words,
he a conductor of electricity. The higher the conducting power, the
more copious were the currents. He now passes from his little brass
globe to the globe of the earth. He plays like a magician with the
earth’s magnetism. He sees the invisible lines along which its mag
netic action is exerted, and sweeping his wand across these lines he
evokes this new power. Placing a simple loop of wire round a mag
netic needle he bends its upper portion to the west : the north pole of
the needle immediately swerves to the east : he bends his loop to the
east, and the north pole moves to the west. Suspending a common
bar magnet in a vertical position, he causes it to spin round its own
axis. Its pole being connected with one end of a galvanometer wire,
and its equator with the other end, electricity rushes round the galva
nometer from the rotating magnet. He remarks upon the “ singular
independence” of the magnetism and the body of the magnet which
carries it. The steel behaves as if it were isolated from its own
 magnetism.                          ,
     And then his thoughts suddenly widen, and~he asks himself whether
 the rotating earth does not generate induced currents as it turns round
 its axis from west to east.      In his experiment with the twirling
                                                              n 2

 2 12                            Professor Tyndall                               [Jan.
 magnet the galvanometer wire remained at rest; one portion of the
 circuit was in motion relatively to another portion. But in the case
 of the twirling planet the galvanometer wire would necessarily be
 carried along with the earth; there would be no relative motion.
 What must be the consequence? Take the ease of a telegraph wire
 with its two terminal plates dipped into the earth, and suppose the
 wire to lie in the magnetic meridian. The ground underneath the wire
 is in<U+FB02>uenced like the wire itself by the earth’s rotation; if a current
 from south to north be generated in the wire, a similar current from
 south to north would be generated in the earth under the wire; these
 currents would run against the same terminal plate, and thus nou
 tralize each other.
      This inference appears inevitable, but his profound vision per
 ceived its possible invalidity. He saw that it was at least possible that
 the difference of conducting power between the earth and the wire
 might give one an advantage over the other, and that thus a residual
 or differential current might be obtained. He combined wires of
 different materials, and caused them to act in opposition to each other:
 but found the combination ineffectual. The more copious <U+FB02>ow
 in the better conductor was exactly counterbalanced by the resist
 ance of the worst. Still though experiment was thus emphatic he
 would clear his mind of all discomfort by operating on the earth
itself. He went to the round lake near Kensington Palace, and
stretched 480 feet of copper wire, north and south, over the lake,
causing plates soldered to the wire at its ends to dip into the water.
The copper wire was severed at the middle, and the severed ends con
nected with a galvanometer. No effect whatever was observed. But
though quiescent water gave no effect, moving water might. He there
fore worked at London Bridge for three days during the ebb and <U+FB02>ow
 of the tide, but without any satisfactory result. Still he urges,
“Theoretically it seems a necessary consequence, that where water
is <U+FB02>owing there electric currents should be formed. If a line be
imagined passing from Dover to Calais through the sea, and returning
through the land, beneath the water, to Dover, it traces out a circuit
of conducting matter one part of which, when the water moves up or
down the channel,‘ is cutting the magnetic curves of the earth, whilst
the other is relatively at rest. . . . There is every reason to
believe that currents do run in the general direction of the circuit de
scribed, either one way or the other, according as the passage of the
waters is up or down the Channel.” This was written before the
submarine cable was thought of, and he once informed me that actual
 observation upon that cable had been found to be in accordance with
his theoretic deduction?‘
    "' I am indebted to a friend for the following exquisite morsel :—" A short time
after the publication of Faraday’s <U+FB01>rst researches in magneto-electricity, he attended
the meeting of the British Association at Oxford, in 1832.—On this occasion he was
requested by some of the authorities to repeat the celebrated experiment of eliciting
a spark from a magnet, employing for this purpose the large magnet in the

    Three years subsequent to the publication of these researches, that
is to say on the 29th of January, 1835, Faraday read before the Royal
Society a paper “On the in<U+FB02>uence by induction of an electric current
upon itself.” A shock and spark of a peculiar character had been
observed by a young man named William Jenkin, who must have
been a youth of some scienti<U+FB01>c promise, but who, as Faraday once in
formed me, was dissuaded by his own father from having anything to
do with science. The investigation of the fact noticed by Mr. Jenkin
led Faraday to the discovery of the extra current, or the current
induced in the primary wire itself at the moments of making and break
ing contact, the phenomena of which he described and illustrated in
the beautiful and exhaustive paper referred to.
    Seven and thirty years have passed since the discovery of magneto
electricity; but, if we except the extra current, until quite recently
nothing of moment was added to the subject. Faraday entertained
the opinion that the discoverer of a great law or principle had a
tion; to
right       the “spoils”—this
         and_guided      by the principle

                                                                     hisitswonderful
mind, aided by his wonderful ten <U+FB01>ngers, overran in a single autumn
this vast domain, and hardly left behind him the shred of a fact to
be gathered by his successors.
     And here the question may arise in some minds, What is the use
of it all? The answer is, that if man’s intellectual nature thirsts for
knowledge, then knowledge is useful because it satis<U+FB01>es this thirst.
If you demand practical ends, you must, I think, expand your de<U+FB01>ni
tion of the term practical, and make it include all that elevates and
enlightens the intellect, as well as all that ministers to the bodily
health and comfort of men. Still, if needed, an answer of another
kind might be given to the question, “ What is its use ‘9” As far as
electricity has been applied for medical purposes it has been almost
 exclusively Faraday’s electricity. You have noticed those lines of
wire which cross the streets of London. It is Faraday’s currents that
 speed from place to place through these wires. Approaching the point
 of Dungeness the mariner sees an unusually brilliant light, and from
Ashmolean Museum. To this he consented, and a large party assembled to witness
the experiments, which, I need not say, were perfectly successful. Whilst he was
repeating them a dignitary of the university entered the room. and addressing him
self to Professor Daniell,who was standing near Faraday, inquired what was going on,
The Professor explained to him as popularly as possible this striking result of Fara
day’s great discovery. The Dean listened with attention and looked earnestly at the
brilliant spark, but a moment after he assumed a serious countenance and shook
his head; ‘I am sorry for it,’ said he as he walked away; in the middle of the
room he stopped for a moment and repeated, ‘ I am sorry for it ; ’ then walking
 towards the door, when the handle was in his hand he turned round and said, ‘ Indeed
 I am sorry for it; it is putting new arms into the hands of the incendiary.’     This
 occurred a short time after the papers had been <U+FB01>lled with the doings of the hay
 rick burners. An erroneous" statement of what fell from the Dean’s mouth was
 printed at the time in one of the Oxford papers. He is there wrongly stated to
 have said, ‘ It is putting new arms into the hands of the in<U+FB01>del.’ ”

These are Faraday’s sparks exalted by suitable machinery to sunlike
splendour. At the present moment the Board of Trade and the
Brethren of the Trinity House, as well as the Commissioners of
Northern Lights, are contemplating the introduction of the magneto
electric light at numerous points upon our coasts ; and future genera
tions will be able to refer to those guiding stars in answer to the
question, What has been the practical use of the labours of Faraday ‘2
But I would again emphatically say that his work needs no such justi
<U+FB01>cation, and that if he had allowed his vision to be disturbed by
considerations regarding the practical use of his discoveries, those
discoveries would never have been made by him. “I have rather,”
he writes in 1831, “been desirous of discovering new facts and new
relations dependent on magneto-electric induction, than of exalting
the force of those already obtained; being assured that the latter
would <U+FB01>nd their full development hereafter.”
    In 1817, when lecturing before a private society in London on
the element chlorine, Faraday thus expresses himself with reference
to this question of utility :—“ Before leaving this subject, I will point
out the history of this substance, as an answer to those who‘are in the
habit of saying to every new fact, ‘ What is its use?’ Dr. Franklin
says to such, ‘ What is the use of an infant?’ The answer of the
experimentalist is, ‘Endeavour to make it useful.’ When Scheele
discovered this substance it appeared to have no use; it was in its
infancy and useless state, but having grown up to maturity, witness
its powers, and see what endeavours to make it useful have done.”
                            Points of Character.
     A point highly illustrative of the character of Faraday now comes
into view. He gave an account of his discovery of magneto-electricity
in a letter to his friend M. Hachette, of Paris, who communicated the
letter to the Academy of Sciences. The letter was translated and
published; and immediately afterwards two distinguished Italian
philosophers took up the subject, made numerous experiments, and
published their results before the complete memoirs of Faraday had
met the public eye. This evidently irritated him. He reprinted
the paper of the learned Italians in the ‘ Philosophical Magazine,’ ac
companied by sharp critical notes from himself. He also wrote a
letter dated Dec. 1st, 1832, to Gay Lussac, who was then one of the
editors of the ‘ Annales de Chimie,’ in which he analyzed the results of
the Italian philosophers, pointing out their errors, and defending himself
from what he regarded as imputations on his character. The style of
this letter is unexceptionable, for Faraday could not write otherwise
than as a gentleman; but the letter shows that had he willed it he
could have hit hard. We have heard much of Faraday’s gentleness
and sweetness and tenderness. It is all true, but it is very incomplete.
You cannot resolve a powerful nature into these elements, and Faraday’s

1868.]                    on Faraday as a Discoverer.                     215
character would have been less admirable than it was had it not em
braced i'orces and tendencies to which the silky adjectives “ gentle”
and “tender ” would by no means apply. Underneath his sweetness
and gentleness was the heat of a volcano. He was a man of excitable
and <U+FB01>ery nature ; but through high self-discipline he had converted the
<U+FB01>re into a central glow and motive power of life, instead of permitting
it to waste itself in useless passion. “ He that is slow to anger,” saith
the sage, “is greater than the mighty, and he that ruleth his own spirit
than he that taketh a city.” Faraday was not slow to anger, but he
completely ruled his own spirit, and thus, though he took no cities, he
captivated all hearts.
     As already intimated, Faraday had contributed many of his minor
papers—-including his <U+FB01>rst analysis of caustic lime-to the ‘ Quarterly
Journal of Science.’ In 1832 he collected those papers and others
together in a small octavo volume, labelled them, and prefaced them
thus :—
                  “PAPERS, NOTES, NOTICES, &c., &c.,
                               published in octave,
                                    up to 1832.
                                  M. FARADAY.”
    “ Papers of mine, published in octave, in the Quarterly Journal of Science,
and elsewhere, since the time that Sir H. Davy encouraged me to write the
analysis of caustic lime.
    “ Some, I think, (at this date) are good; others moderate; and some bad.
But I have put all into the volume, because of the utility they have been of
to me,—and none more than the bad,—in pointing out to me in future, or
rather, after times, the faults it became me to watch and to avoid.
     “As I never looked over one of my papers a year after it was written,
without believing both in philosophy and manner it could have been much
better done, I still hope the collection may be of great use to me.

     “None more than the bad!” This is a bit of Faraday’s inner
 most nature; and as I read these words, I am almost constrained to
 retract what I have said regarding the'<U+FB01>re and excitability of his
 character. But is he not all the more admirable, through his ability
 to tone down and subdue that <U+FB01>re and that excitability, so as to render
 himself able to write thus as a little child? I once took the liberty of
 censuring the conclusion of a letter of his to the Dean of St. Paul’s.
 He subscribed himself “humbly yours,” and I objected to the adverb.
 “Well, but, Tyndall,” he said, “ I am humble; and still it would be
 a great mistake to think that I am not also proud.” This duality ran
 through his character. A democrat in his de<U+FB01>ance of all authority
 which unfairly limited his freedom of thought, and still ready to
  stoop in reverence to all that was really worthy of reverence, in the
  customs of the world or the characters of men.
      And here, as well as elsewhere, may be introduced a letter which
 bears upon this question of self-control, written long years subsequent
 to the period at which we have now arrived. I had been at Glasgow

in 1855, at a meeting of the British Association. On a certain day,
I communicated a paper to the physical section, which was followed
by a brisk discussion. Men of great distinction took part in it, the
late Dr. Whewell among the number, and it waxed warm on both
sides.   I was by no means content with this discussion; and least
of all with my own part in it. This discontent affected me for some
days, during which I wrote to Faraday, giving him no details, but
expressing in a general way my dissatisfaction. I give the following
extract from his reply :—

“ MY DEAR TYNDALL,
    “ These great meetings, of which I think very well altogether, advance
science chie<U+FB02>y by bringing scienti<U+FB01>c men together, and making them to know
and be friends with each other; and I am sorry when that is not the effect
in every part of their course. I know nothing except from what you tell me,
for I have not yet looked at the reports of the proceedings; but let me, as
an old man, who ought by this time to have pro<U+FB01>ted by experience, say
that when I was younger, I found I often misinterpreted the intentions of
people, and found they did not mean what at the time I supposed they meant ;
and, further, that as a general rule, it was better to be a little dull of appre
hension, where phrases seemed to imply pique, and quick in perception, when
on the contrary they seemed to imply kindly feeling. The real truth never
fails ultimately to appear; and opposing parties if wrong are sooner convinced
when replied to forbearingly, than when overwhelmed. All I mean to say is,
that it is better to be blind to the results of partisanship, and quick to see
good will. One has more happiness in oneself, in endeavouring to follow the
 things that make for peace. You can hardly imagine how often I have been
heated in private when opposed, as I have thought unjustly and superciliously,

      Identity of Electricities : First Researches on Electra-Chemistry.
     I have already once used the word “discomfort” in reference to
the occasional state of Faraday’s mind when experimenting. It was
to him a discomfort to reason upon data which admitted of doubt.
He hated what he called “doubtful knowledge,” and ever tended
either to transfer it into the region of undoubtful knowledge, or of
certain and de<U+FB01>nite ignorance. Pretence of all kinds, whether in life
or in philosophy, was hateful to him. He wished to know the reality
of our nescience as well as of our science. “Be one thing or the
other,” he seemed to say to an unproved hypothesis; “ come out as a
    * Faraday would have been rejoiced to learn that, during its last meeting at
Dundee, the British Association i‘ilustrated in a striking manner the function
which he here describes as its principal one. In my own case, a brotherly welcome
was everywhere manifested.     In fact, the differences of really honourable and
sane ‘men are never beyond healing.                       '

  solid truth, or disappear as a convicted lie.” After making the great
  discovery which I have attempted to describe, a doubt seemed to beset
  him as regards the identity of electricities. “ Is it right,” he seemed
  to ask, “ to call this agency which I have discovered electricity at all?
  Are there perfectly conclusive grounds for believing that the elec
  tricity of the machine, the pile, the gymnotus and torpedo, magneto
  electricity and thermo-electricity, are merely different manifestations
  of one and the same agent?” To answer this question to his own
  satisfaction, he formally reviewed the knowledge of that day. He
  added to it new experiments of his own, and <U+FB01>nally decided in favour
  of the “Identity of Eleetricities.” His paper upon this subject was
  read before the Royal Society on the 10th and 17th of January, 1833.
       After he had proved to his own satisfaction the identity of electri
  cities, he tried to compare them quantitatively together. The terms
  quantity and intensity, which Faraday constantly used, need a word of
' explanation here. He might charge a single Leyden jar by twenty
  turns of his machine, or he might charge a battery of ten jars by the
  same number of turns. The quantity in both cases would be sensibly
   the same, but the intensity of the single jar would be the greatest, for
   here the electricity would be less diffused. Faraday <U+FB01>rst satis<U+FB01>ed
   himself that the needle of his galvanometer was caused to swing
   through the same are by the same quantity of machine electricity,
   whether it was condensed in a small battery or diffused over a large
   one. Thus the electricity developed by thirty turns of his machine
   produced, under very variable conditions of battery surface, the same
   de<U+FB02>ection. Hence he inferred the possibility of comparing, as regards
   quantity, electricities which differ greatly from each other in intensity.
        His object now is to compare frictional with voltaic electricity.
   Moistening bibulous paper with the iodide of potassium-a favourite
   test of his—and subjecting it to the action of machine electricity,
   he decomposed the iodide, and formed a brown spot where the iodine
   is liberated. Then he immersed two wires, one of zinc, the other
   of platinum, each 113th of an inch in diameter, to a depth of %ths of an
   inch in acidulated water during eight beats of his watch, or etwths of a
   second; and found that the needle of his galvanometer swung through
   the same are, and coloured-his moistened paper to the same extent,
   as thirty turns of his large electrical machine. Twenty-eight turns of
    the machine produced an effect distinctly less than that produced by
    his two wires. Now, the quantity of water decomposed by the wires
    in this experiment totally eluded observation; it was immeasurably
    small; and still that amount of decomposition involved the develop
    ment of a quantity of electric force which, if applied in a proper form,
    would kill a rat, and no man would like to bear it.
        In his subsequent researches “on the absolute quantity of elec
    tricity associated with the particles or atoms of matter,” he endeavours
    to give an idea of the amount of electrical force involved in the
    decomposition of a single grain of water. He is almost afraid to
    mention it, for he estimates it at 800,000 discharges of his large

be equal to a very great <U+FB02>ash of lightning; while the chemical action
of a single grain of water on four grains of zinc would yield elec
tricity equal in quantity to a powerful thunderstorm. Thus his mind
rises from the minute to the vast, expanding involuntarily from the
smallest laboratory fact till it embraces the largest and grandest
natural phenomena)“
     In reality, however, he is at this time only clearing his way, and
he continues laboriously to clear it for some time afterwards. He
is digging the shaft, guided by that instinct towards the mineral lode
which was to him a rod of divination. “ Er riecht die Wahrhez't,” said
the lamented Kohlrausch, an eminent German, once in my hearing :—
“ He smells the truth.” His eyes are now steadily <U+FB01>xed on this
wonderful voltaic current, and he must learn more of its mode of
transmission.
     On the 23rd of May, 1833, he read a paper before the Royal Society
“On a new Law of Electric Conduction.” He found that though the
current passed through water, it did not pass through ice :—why not,
since they are one and the same substance? Some years subsequently
he answered this question by saying that the liquid condition enables
the molecule ‘of water to turn round so as to place itself in the proper
line of polarization, while the rigidity of the solid condition prevents
this arrangement.

 and salts, and sulphurets, and found them all insulators when solid, and
 conductors when fused. In all cases, moreover, except one—and this
 exception he thought might be apparent only—he found the passage
 of the current across the fused compound to be accompanied by its de
 composition. Is then the act of decomposition essential to the act of
 conduction in these bodies ‘2 Even recently this question was warmly
 contested. Faraday was very cautious latterly in expressing himself
 upon this subject; but as a matter of fact he held that an in<U+FB01>nitesimal
 quantity of electricity might pass through a compound liquid without
 producing its decomposition; De la Rive, who has been a great worker
 on the chemical phenomena of the pile, is very emphatic on the other
side. Experiment, according to him and others, establishes in the
 most conclusive manner that no trace of electricity can pass through a
 liquid compound without producing its equivalent decomposition.1'

     Faraday has now got fairly entangled amid the chemical phenomena
of the pile, and here his previous training under Davy must have been
of the most important service to him. Why, he asks, should decompo
sition thus take place? what force is it that wrenches the locked
constituent of these compounds asunder? On the 20th of June, 1833,
he read a paper before the Royal Society “ On Electro-Chemical De
compositionf.’ in which he seeks to answer these questions. The notion
had been entertained that the poles, as they are called, of the decom
posing cell, or in other words the surfaces by which the current enters
and quits the liquid, exercised electric attractions upon the consti
tuents of the liquid and tore them asunder. Faraday combats this notion
with extreme vigour. Litmus reveals, as you know, the action of an
acid by turning red, turmeric reveals the action of an alkali by turning
brown. Sulphate of soda, you know, is a salt compounded of the alkali
soda and sulphuric acid. The voltaic current passing through a so
lution of this salt so decomposes it, that sulphuric acid appears at one
pole of the decomposing cell and alkali at the other. Faraday steeped
a piece of litmus paper and a piece of turmeric paper in a solution of
sulphate of soda: placing each of them upon a separate plate of glass,
he connected them together by means of a string moistened with the
same solution. He then attached one of them to the positive con
ductor of an electric machine, and the other to the gas-pipes of
this building. These he called his “ discharging train.” On turn
ing the machine the electricity passed from paper to paper through
the string, which might be varied in length from a few inches to
seventy feet without changing the result.          The <U+FB01>rst paper was
reddened, declaring the presence of sulphuric acid; the second was
browned, declaring the presence of the alkali soda. The dissolved
salt, therefore, arranged in this fashion, was decomposed by the ma
chine exactly as it would have been by the voltaic current. When
instead of using the positive conductor he used the negative ; the posi
tions of the acid and alkali were reversed. Thus he satis<U+FB01>ed himself
that chemical decomposition by the machine is obedient to the laws
which rule decomposition by the pile.
     And now he gradually abolishes those so-called poles to the attrac
tion of which electric decomposition had been ascribed. He connected
 a piece of turmeric paper moistened with the sulphate of soda with the
 positive conductor of his machine; then he placed a metallic point in
 connection with his discharging train opposite the moist paper, so that
the electricity shall discharge through the air towards the point. The
 turning of the machine caused the corners of the piece of turmeric
 paper opposite to the point to turn brown, thus declaring the presence
 of alkali. He changed the turmeric for litmus paper, and placed it,
 not in connection with his conductor, but with his discharging train,
 a metallic point connected with the conductor being <U+FB01>xed at a couple
 of inches from the paper ; on turning the machine, acid was liberated
 at the edges and corners of the litmus. He then placed a series of
 pointed pieces of paper, each separate piece being composed of two

  machine. The pieces of paper were separated from each other by
  spaces of air. The machine was turned ; and it was always found that
  at the point where the electricity entered the paper, litmus was red
  dened, and at the point where it quitted the paper, turmeric was
  browned. “ Here,” he urges, “the poles are entirely abandoned, but
  we have still electro-chemical decomposition.” It is evident to him that
  instead of being attracted by the poles, the bodies separated are
  ejected by the current.     The e<U+FB02>‘ects thus obtained with poles of air
  he also succeeded in obtaining with poles of water. The advance in
  Faraday’s own ideas made at this time is indicated by the word
  “ejected.” He afterwards reiterates this view: the evolved sub
  stances are expelled from the decomposing body. and “ not drawn out by
  an attraction.”
     Having abolished this idea of polar attraction, he proceeds to enun
  ciate and develop a theory of his own. He refers to Davy’s celebrated
  Bakerian Lecture given in 1806, which he says “is almost entirely oc
  cupied in the consideration of electro-chemical decompositions.” The
  facts recorded in that lecture Faraday regards as of the utmost value.
  But “the mode of action by which the effects take place is stated very
  generally ; so generally indeed, that probably a dozen precise schemes
  of electro-chemical action might be drawn up, differing essentially from
  each other, yet all agreeing with the statement there given.”
      It appears to me that these words might with justice be applied
  to Faraday’s own researches at this time. They furnish us with results
  of permanent value; but little help can be found in the theory advanced
  to account for them. It would, perhaps, be more correct to say that the
  theory itself is hardly presentable in any tangible form to the intellect.
  Faraday looks, and rightly looks, into the heart of the decomposing
  body itself: he sees, and rightly sees, active within it the forces which
  produce the decomposition, and he rejects, and rightly rejects, the
  notion of external attraction; but beyond the hypothesis of decomposi
  tions and recompositions, enunciated and developed by Grothuss and
  Davy, he does not, I think, help us to any de<U+FB01>nite conception as to
  how the force reaches the decomposing mass and acts within it. Nor,
  indeed, can this be done, until we know the true physical process
  which underlies what we call an electric current.
      Faraday conceives of that current as “ an arts of power having con
  trary forces exactly equal in amount in opposite directions ;” but this
  de<U+FB01>nition, though much quoted and circulated, teaches us nothing
  regarding the current. An “axis” here can only mean a direction;
  and what we want to be able to conceive of is, not the axis along which
  the power acts, but the nature and mode of action of the power itself.
  He objects to the vagueness of De la Rive; but the fact is that both
‘ he and De la Rive labour under the same difficulty. Neither wishes
  to commit himself to the notion of a current compounded of two elec
  tricities <U+FB02>owing in two opposite directions; but the time had not

    come, nor is it yet come, for the displacement of this provisional
    <U+FB01>ction by the true mechanical conception.         Still, however indistinct
    the theoretic notions of Faraday at this time may be, the facts which
    are rising before him and around him are leading him gradually, but
    surely, to results of incalculable importance in relation to the philo
    sophy of the voltaic pile.
        He had always some great object of research in view, but in the
   pursuit of it he frequently alighted on facts of collateral interest, to
   examine which he sometimes turned aside from his direct course.
   Thus we interrupted

   solids, to induce the combination of gaseous bodies.” This inquiry,
   which was received by the Royal Society on the 30th of November,
   1833, though not so important as those which precede and follow
   it, illustrates throughout his strength as an experimenter. The
   power of spongy platinum to cause the combination of oxygen and
   hydrogen had been discovered by Dobereiner in 1823, and had been
   applied by him in the construction of his well-known philosophic
   lamp. It was shown subsequently by Dulong and Thenard that even
   descence
   a platinum by wire,

                                          cleansed,  may be raised to incan.
       In his experiments on the decomposition of water, Faraday found that
  the positive platinum plate of the decomposing cell possessed in an ex
  traordinary degree the power of causing oxygen and hydrogen to com
  bine. He traced the cause of this to the perfect cleanness of the positive
  plate. Against it was liberated oxygen, which with the powerful a<U+FB01>‘inity
  of the “nascent state,” swept away all impurity from the surface against
  which it was liberated. The-bubbles of gas liberated on one of the
_ platinum plates or wires of a decomposing cell are always much
  smaller, and they rise in much more rapid succession than those from
  the other. Knowing that oxygen is sixteen times heavier than hydrogen,
  I have more than once concluded, and, I fear, led others- into the error
  of concluding, that the smaller and more quickly rising bubbles must
  belong to the lighter gas. The thing appeared so obvious that I
  did not give myself the trouble of looking at the battery, which
  would at once have told me the nature of the gas. But Faraday
  would never have been satis<U+FB01>ed with a deduction if he could have
  reduced it to a fact. And he has taught me that the fact here is
  the direct reverse of what I supposed it to be. The small bubbles
  are oxygen, and their smallness is due to the perfect cleanness of the
  surface on which they are liberated. The hydrogen adhering to the
  other electrode swells into large bubbles, which rise in much slower
  succession; but when the current is reversed the hydrogen is libe
  rated upon the cleansed wire, and then its bubbles also become small.

                   Laws of Electra-Chemical Decomposition.
     In our conceptions and reasonings regarding the forces of nature,
we perpetually make use of symbols which, when they possess a high
representative value we dignify with the name of theories. Thus
prompted by certain analogies we ascribe electrical phenomena to the
action of a peculiar <U+FB02>uid, sometimes <U+FB02>owing, sometimes at rest. Such
conceptions have their advantages and their disadvantages; they a<U+FB02>'ord
peaceful lodging to the intellect for a time, but they also circumscribe
it, and by and by, when the mind has grown too large for its lodging,
it often <U+FB01>nds difficulty in breaking down the walls of what has become
its prison instead of its home?
     No man ever felt this tyranny of symbols more deeply than
Faraday, and no man was ever more assiduous than he to liberate
himself from them and the terms which suggested them. Calling Dr.
Whewell to his aid in 1833, he endeavoured to displace by others all
terms tainted by a foregone conclusion. His paper on Electro-chemical
decomposition, received by the Royal Society on the 9th of January,
1834, opens with the proposal of a new terminology. He would avoid
the word “ current ” if he couldT He does abandon the word “poles ”
as applied to the ends of a decomposing cell, because it suggests
the idea of attraction, substituting for it the perfectly neutral term
electrodes. He applied the term electrolyte to every substance which
can be decomposed by the current, and the act of decomposition he
calls electrolysis. All these terms have become current in science.
He called the positive electrode the Anode, and the negative one the
Cathode, but these terms, though frequently used, have not enjoyed
the same currency as the others. The terms Am'on and Cation,
which he applied to the constituents of the decomposed electrolyte,
and the term ion, which included both anions and cations, are still
less frequently employed.
     Faraday now passes from terminology to research; he sees the
necessity of quantitative determinations, and seeks to supply him
self with a measure of voltaic electricity. This he <U+FB01>nds in the
quantity of water decomposed by the current. He tests this mea
sure in all possible ways, to assure himself that no error can arise
from its employment. He places in the course of one and the same
current a series of cells with electrodes of different sizes, some of them
plates of platinum, others merely platinum wires, and collects the gas
liberated on each distinct pair of electrodes. He <U+FB01>nds the quantity of

     1' In 1838 he expresses himself thus :—“ The word current is so expressive ' in
common language that when applied in the consideration of electrical phenomena,
we can hardly divest it sufficiently of its meaning, or prevent our minds from being
prejudiced by it."——Emp. Researches, vol. i., p. 515.    (§ 1617.)

gas to be the same for all.      Thus he concludes that when the same
quantity of electricity is caused to pass through a series of cells
containing acidulated water, the clectro-chemical action is independent
of the size of the electrodes. He next proves that variations in in
tensity do not interfere with this equality of action. Whether his
battery is charged with strong acid or with weak ; whether it consists
of <U+FB01>ve pairs or of <U+FB01>fty pairs; in short, whatever be its source, when
the same current is sent through his series of cells, the same amount
of decomposition takes place in all. He next assures himself that the
strength or weakness of his dilute acid does not interfere with this law.
Sending the same current through a series of cells containing mixtures
of sulphuric acid and water of different strengths, he <U+FB01>nds, however
the proportion of acid to water might vary, the same amount of gas to be
collected in all the cells. A crowd of facts of this character forced upon
Faraday’s mind the conclusion that the amount of electro-chemical
decomposition depends, not upon the size of the electrodes, not upon
the intensity of the current, not upon the strength of the solution, but
solely upon the quantity of electricity which passes through the cell.
The quantity of electricity he concludes is proportional to the amount
of chemical action. On this law Faraday based the construction of his
celebrated voltameter, or measurer of voltaic electricity.
    But before he can apply this measure he must clear his ground of
numerous possible sources of error. The decomposition of his acidu
lated water is certainly a direct result of the current; but as the
varied and important researches of MM. Becquerel, De la Rive, and
others had shown, there are also secondary actions, which may materi
ally interfere with and complicate the pure action of the current. These
actions may occur in two ways: either the liberated ion may seize upon
the electrode against which it is set free, forming a chemical compound
with thatitself,
trolyte          and thus
            electrode;  or itintroduce
                               may seizeinto
                                          upon

                                                           chemical     elec—
over and above those due to the current.          Faraday subjected these
secondary actions to an exhaustive examination.           Instructed by his
experiments, and rendered competent by them to distinguish between
primary and secondary results, he proceeds to establish the doctrine
of “ de<U+FB01>nite electro-chemical decomposition.”
    Into the same circuit he introduced his voltameter, which con
sisted of a graduated tube <U+FB01>lled with acidulated water and provided
with platinum plates for the decomposition of the water, and also a
cell containing chloride of tin. Experiments already referred to had
taught him that this substance, though an insulator when solid, is a
conductor when fused, the passage of the current being always accom
panied by the decomposition of the chloride. He wished now to ascor
tain what relation this decomposition bore to that of the water in his
voltameter.
    Completing his circuit, he permitted the current to continue until
“ a reasonable quantity of gas” was collected in the voltameter. The
circuit was then broken, and the quantity of tin liberated compared

224;                       Professor Tyndall                         [Jan.
with the quantity of gas. The weight of the former was 3'2 grains,
that of the latter 049742 of a grain. Oxygen, as you know, unites
with hydrogen in the proportion of 8 to 1 to form water. Calling the
equivalent, or, as it is sometimes called, the atomic weight of hydro
gen 1, that of oxygen is 8; that of water is consequently 8 + l, or 9.
Now if the quantity of water decomposed in Faraday’s experiment be
represented by the number 9, or in other words by the equivalent of
water, then the quantity of tin liberated from the fused chloride is
found by an easy calculation to be 57'9, which is almost exactly the
chemical equivalent of tin. Thus both the water and the chloride
were broken up in proportions expressed by their respective equi
valents. The amount of electric force which wrenehed asunder the
constituents of the molecule of water was competent, and neither more
nor less than competent, to wrench asunder the constituents of the
molecules of the chloride of tin. The fact is typical. With the
indications of his voltameter he compared the decomposition of other
substances both singly and in series. He submitted his conclusions
to numberless tests. He purposely introduced secondary actions. He
endeavoured to hamper the ful<U+FB01>lment of those laws which it was the
intense desire of his mind to see established. But from all these
di<U+FB01>iculties emerged the golden truth, that under every variety of cir
cumstances the decompositions of the voltaic current are as de<U+FB01>nite in
their character as those chemical combinations which gave birth to
the atomic theory. This law of electro-chemical decomposition ranks,
in point of importance‘, with that of de<U+FB01>nite combining proportions in
chemistry.
                   Origin of Power a the Voltaic Pile.
     In one of the public areas of the town of Como stands a statue,
with no inscription on its pedestal save that of a single name, “Volta.”
The bearer of that name occupies a place for ever memorable in the
history of science. To him we owe the discovery of the voltaic pile,
to which, for a brief interval, we must now turn our attention.
    The objects of scienti<U+FB01>c thought being the passionless laws and phe
nomena of external nature, one might suppose that their investigation
and discussion would be completely withdrawn from the region of
the feelings, and pursued by the cold dry light of the intellect alone.
This, however, is not always the case. Man carries his heart with him
into all his works. You cannot separate the moral and emotional from
the intellectual; and thus it is that the discussion of a point of science
may rise to the heat of a battle—<U+FB01>eld. The <U+FB01>ght between the rival
optical theories of Emission and Undulation was of this <U+FB01>erce cha
meter; and scarcely less <U+FB01>erce for many years was the contest as to
the origin and maintenance of the power of the voltaic pile. Volta
himself supposed it to reside in the contact of di<U+FB01>'erent metals. Here
was exerted his “ electro~motive force,” which tore the combined elec

 tricities asunder and drove them as currents in opposite directions.
 To render the circulation of the current possible, it was necessary to
 connect the metals by a moist conductor; for when any two metals
 were connected by a third, their relation to each other was such that
 a complete neutralization of the electric motion was the result.
 Volta’s theory of metallic contact was so clear, so beautiful, and
 apparently so complete, that the best intellects of Europe accepted it
 as the expression of natural law.
     Volta himself knew nothing of the chemical phenomena of the pile;
 but as soon as these became known, suggestions and intimations
 appeared that chemical action, and not metallic contact, might be the
 real source of voltaic electricity. This idea was expressed by Fabroni
 in Italy and by Wollaston in England. It was developed and main
 tained by those “ admirable electricians,” Becquerel, of Paris, and De
 la Rive, of Geneva. The contact theory, on the other hand, received
 its chief development and illustration in Germany. It was long the
 scienti<U+FB01>c creed of the great chemists and natural philosophers of that
 country, and to the present hour there may be some of them unable to
liberate themselves from the fascination of their <U+FB01>rst-love.
     After the researches which I have endeavoured to place before you,
it was impossible for Faraday to avoid taking a side, in this controversy.
 He did so in a paper “ On the Electricity of the Voltaic Pile,” received
by the Royal Society, on the 7th of April, 1834. His position in the
controversy might have been predicted. He saw chemical e<U+FB02>'ects
going hand-in-hand with electrical effects, the one being proportional
to the other; and, in the paper now before us, he proved that when
the former were excluded, the latter were sought for in vain. He pro
duced a current without metallic contact; he discovered liquids which,
though competent to transmit the feeblest currents-competent there
fore to allow the electricity of contact to <U+FB02>ow through them if it were able
to form a current-were absolutely powerless when chemically inactive.
     One of the very few experimental mistakes of Faraday occurred in
this investigation. He thought that with a single voltaic cell he had
obtained the spark before the metals touched, but he subsequently dis
covered his error. To enable the voltaic spark to pass through air
before the terminals of the ‘battery were united, it was necessary to
ments;        all the elements

                                   of the battery

                                                                      to ele—
task of urging the spark across the shortest measurable space of air.
Nor, indeed, could the action of the battery, the different metals of
which were in contact with each other, decide the point in question.
Still as regards the identity of eleotricities from various sources, it
was at that day of great importance to determine whether or not the
voltaic current could jump as a spark across an interval before con
tact. Faraday’s friend, Mr. Gassiot, solved this problem. He erected
a battery of 4000 cells, and with it urged a stream of sparks from

    The memoir on the “ Electricity of the Voltaic Pile,” published in
1834, appears to have produced but little impression upon the sup
porters of the contact theory. These indeed were men of too great
intellectual weight and insight lightly to take up, or lightly to abandon
a theory. Faraday therefore resumed the attack in a paper communi
cated to the Royal Society, on the 6th of February, 1840. In this
paper he hampered his antagonists by a crowd of adverse experiments.
He hung difficulty after di<U+FB02>iculty about the neck of the contact theory,
until in its efforts to escape from his assaults it so changed its character
as to become a thing totally di<U+FB02>'erent from the theory proposed by
Volta. The more persistently it was defended, however, the more
clearly did it show itself to be a congeries of devices, bearing the
stamp of dialectic skill rather than that of natural truth.
    In conclusion, Faraday brought to bear upon it an argument which,
had its full weight and purport been understood at the time, would have
instantly decided the controversy. “ The contact theory,” he urged,
“ assumes that a force which is able to overcome powerful resistance,
as for instance that of the conductors, good or bad, through which the
current passes, and that again of the electrolytic action where bodies
are decomposed by it, can arise out of nothing: that without any
change in the acting matter, or the consumption of any generating
force, a current shall be produced which shall go on for ever against
a constant resistance, or only be stopped, as in the voltaic trough, by
the ruins which its exertion has heaped up in its own course. This
would indeed be a, creation of power, and is like no other force in
nature. We have many processes by which the form of the power
may be so changed, that an apparent conversion of one into the other
takes place. So we can change chemical force into the electric
current, or the current into chemical force. The beautiful experiments
of Seebeck and Peltier show the convertibility of heat and electricity;
and others by Oersted and myself show the convertibility of electricity
and magnetism. But in no case, not even in those of the Gymnotus and
Torpedo, is there a pure creation or a production of power without a cor
responding exhaustion of something to supply it.”
    These words were published more than two years before either
Mayer printed his brief but celebrated essay on the Forces of Inorganic
Nature, or Mr. Joule published his <U+FB01>rst famous experiments on the
Mechanical Value of Heat. They illustrate the fact that before any
great scienti<U+FB01>c principle receives distinct enunciaticn by individuals,
it dwells more or less clearly in the general scienti<U+FB01>c mind. The
intellectual plateau is already high, and our discoverers are those who,
like peaks above the plateau, rise a little above the general level of
thought at the time.
    But many years prior, even to the foregoing utterance of Faraday,
a similar argument had been employed. I quote here with equal
pleasure and admiration the following passage written by Dr. Roget
so far back as 1829. Speaking of the contact theory, he says :—“ If
there could exist a power having the property ascribed it to by the

 1868.]                   on Faraday as a Discoverer.                          227
 hypothesis, namely, that of giving continual impulse to a <U+FB02>uid in
 one constant direction, without being exhausted by its own action,
 it would differ essentially from all the known powers in nature. All
 the powers and sources of motion with the operation of which we are
 acquainted, when producing these peculiar e<U+FB02>'ects, are expended in
 the same proportion as those e<U+FB01>'ects are produced; and hence arises the
 impossibility of obtaining by their agency a perpetual e<U+FB02>'ect ,' or in other
 words a perpetual motion. But the electro-motive force, ascribed by
 Volta to the metals, when in contact, is a force which, as long as a free
 course is allowed to the electricity it sets in motion, is never expended,
and continues to be excited with undiminished power in the production
of a never-ceasing e<U+FB02>‘ect. Against the truth of such a supposition the
probabilities are all but in<U+FB01>nite.” When this argument, which he em
ployed independently, had clearly <U+FB01>xed itself in his mind, Faraday never
cared to experiment further on the source of electricity in the voltaic
pile. The argument appeared to him “ to remove the foundation itself
of the contact theory,” and he afterwards let it crumble down in peace.‘
Researches on Frictional Electricity: Induction: Conduction: Speci<U+FB01>c
             Inductive Capacity: Theory of Contiguous Particles.
     The burst of power which had <U+FB01>lled the four preceding years with an
amount of experimental work unparalleled in the history of science
partially subsided in 1835, and the only scienti<U+FB01>c paper contributed
by Faraday in that year was a comparatively unimportant one, “ On
an improved Form of the Voltaic Battery.” He brooded for a time:
his experiments on electrolysis had long <U+FB01>lled his mind; he looked,
as already stated, into the very heart of the electrolyte, endeavour
ing to render the play of its atoms visible to his mental eye. He
had no doubt that in this case what is called “the electric current ”
was propagated from particle to particle of the electrolyte ; he accepted
the doctrine of decomposition and recomposition which, according to
Grothuss and Davy, ran from electrode to electrode. And the thought
impressed him more and more that ordinary electric induction was also
transmitted and sustained by the action of “ contiguous particles.”
    * To account for the electric current, which was really the core of the whole
discussion, Faraday demonstrated the impotence of the contact theory as then
enunciated and defended. Still, it is certain that two different metals, when
brought into contact, charge themselves, the one with positive and the other with
negative electricity.  I had the pleasure of going over this ground with Kohl
rausch in 1849, and his experiments left no doubt upon my mind that the contact
electricity of Volta was a reality, though it could produce no current. With one
of the beautiful instruments devised by himself‘, Sir William Thomson has ren
dered this point capable of sure and easy demonstration; and he and others now
hold what may be called a contact theory, which, while it takes into account
the action of the metals, also embraces the chemical phenomena of the circuit.
Helmholtz, I believe, was the <U+FB01>rst to give the contact theory this new form, in his
celebrated essay, Ueber die Erhaltung der Kraft, p. 45.                 2

     His <U+FB01>rst great paper on frictional electricity was sent to the Royal
 Society on the 30th of November, 1837. We here <U+FB01>nd him face to
 face with an idea which beset his mind throughout his whole subse
 quent life,——the idea of action at a distance. It perplexed and bewil
 dered him. In his attempts to get rid of this perplexity he was often
 unconsciously rebelling against the limitations of the intellect itself.
 He loved to quote Newton upon this point: over and over again he
 introduces his memorable words, “That gravity should be innate,
 inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon
 another at a distance through a vacuum and without the mediation of
 anything else, by and through which this action and force may be
 conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity, that I
 believe no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty
 of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent
 acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent
be material or immaterial I have left to the consideration of my
readers.“
     Faraday does not see the same dii<U+FB01>culty in his contiguous particles.
And yet by transferring the conception from masses to particles we
simply lessen size and distance, but we do not alter the quality of the con
ception. Whatever dif<U+FB01>culty the mind experiences in conceiving of
action at sensible distances, besets it also when it attempts to conceive
of action at insensible distances. Still the investigation of the point
whether electric and magnetic effects were wrought out through the
intervention of contiguous particles or not, had a physical interest
altogether apart from the metaphysical di<U+FB01>iculty. Faraday grapples
with the subject experimentally. By simple intuition he sees that
action at a distance must be exerted in straight lines. Gravity, he
knows, will not turn a corner, but exerts its pull along a right line;
‘hence his aim and effort to ascertain whether electric action ever takes
place in curved lines. This once proved, it would follow that the
action is carried on by means of a medium surrounding the electri<U+FB01>ed
bodies. His experiments in 1837, reduced, in his opinion, this point
to demonstration. He then found that he could electrify by induction
an insulated sphere placed completely in the shadow of a body which
screened it from direct action. He pictured the lines of electric force
bending round the edges of the screen, and reuniting on the other side
of it; between
tance           his insulated
       and he proved   that in sphere
                               many cases
                                       and the      augmentation

lessening, increased the charge of the sphere. This he ascribed to the
coalescence of the, lines of electric force at some distance behind the
screen.                                           '
    Faraday’s theoretic views on this subject have not received
general acceptance, but they drove him to experiment, and experiment
with him was always proli<U+FB01>c of results. By suitable arrangements
he places a metallic sphere in the middle of a large hollow sphere,

leaving a space‘ of something more than half-an-inch between them.
The interior sphere was insulated, the external one uninsulated. To
the former he communicated a de<U+FB01>nite charge of electricity. It acted
by induction upon the concave surface of the latter, and he examined
how this act of induction was effected by placing insulators of various
kinds between the two spheres. He tried gases, liquids, and solids, but
the solids alone gave him positive results. He constructed two instru
ments of the foregoing description, equal in size and similar in form.
The interior sphere of each communicated with the external air by a
brass stem ending in a knob. The apparatus was virtually a Leyden
jar, the two coatings of which were the two spheres, with a thick and
variable insulator between them. The amount of charge in each jar was
determined by bringing a proof-plane into contact with its knob, and
measuring by a torsion balance the charge taken away. He <U+FB01>rst
charged one of his instruments, and then dividing the charge with the
other, found that when air intervened in both cases, the charge was
equally divided. But when shell-lac, sulphur, or spermaceti was inter
posed between the two spheres of one jar, while air occupied this
interval in the other, then he found that the instrument occupied by
the “solid dielectric” takes more than half the original charge. A
portion of the charge was absorbed in the dielectric itself. The elec
tricity took time to penetrate the dielectric. Immediately after the
discharge of the apparatus no trace of electricity was found upon its
knob. But after a time electricity was found there, the charge having
gradually returned from the dielectric in which it had been lodged.
Different insulators possess this power of permitting the charge to
enter them in different degrees. Faraday <U+FB01>gured their particles as
polarized, and he concluded that the force of induction is propagated
from particle to particle of the dielectric from the inner sphere to the
outer one. This power of propagation possessed by insulators he
calls their “ Speci<U+FB01>c Inductive Capacity.”
    Faraday visualizes with the utmost clearness the state of his con
tiguous particles ; one after another they become charged, each suc
ceeding particle depending for its charge upon its predecessor. And
now he seeks to break down the wall of partition between conductors
and insulators. “ Can we not,” he says, “by a gradual chain of asso
ciation carry up discharge from its occurrence in air through spermaceti
and water to solutions, and then on to chlorides, oxides, and metals,
without any essential change in its character? ” Even copper, he
urges, offers a resistance to the transmission of electricity. The action
of its particles differs from those of an insulator only in degree. They
are charged like the particles of the insulator, but they discharge with
greater ease and rapidity; and this rapidity of molecular discharge is
what we call conduction. Conduction then is always preceded by
atomic induction; and when through some quality of the body, which
Faraday does not de<U+FB01>ne, the atomic discharge is rendered slow and
di<U+FB01>icult, conduction passes into insulation.
    Though they are often obscure, a <U+FB01>nc vein of philosophic thought

230                            Professor Tyndall                             [Jam
runs through those investigations. The mind of the philosopher
dwells amid those agencies which underlie the visible phenomena of
Induction and Conduction; and he tries by the strong light of his
imagination to see the very molecules of his dielectrics. It would,
however, be easy to criticize these researches, easy to show the loose
ness, and sometimes the inaccuracy, of the phraseology employed;
but this critical spirit will get little good out of Faraday. Rather let
those who ponder his works seek to realize the object he set before
him, not permitting his occasional vagueness to interfere with their
appreciation of his speculations. We may see the ripples, and eddies,
and vortices of a <U+FB02>owing stream, without being able to resolve all
these motions into their constituent elements; and so it sometimes
strikes me that Faraday clearly saw the play of <U+FB02>uids and ethers and
atoms, though his previous training did not enable him to resolve
what he saw into its constituents, or describe it in a manner satisfac
tory to a mind versed in mechanics. And then again occur, I confess,
dark sayings, difficult to be understood, which disturb my con<U+FB01>dence
in this conclusion. It must, however, always be remembered that he
works at the very boundaries of our knowledge, and that his mind
habitually dwells in the “boundless contiguity of shade” by which
that knowledge is surrounded.
    In the researches now under review the ratio of speculation and
reasoning to experiment is far higher than in any of Faraday’s
previous works. Amid much that is entangled and dark we have
<U+FB02>ashes of wondrous insight and utterances which seem less the product
of reasoning than of revelation. I will con<U+FB01>ne myself here to one
example of this divining power :—By his most ingenious device of a
rapidly rotating mirror, Wheatstone had proved that electricity re
quired time to pass through a wire, the current reaching the middle
of the wire later than its two ends. “ If,” says Faraday, “the two
ends of the wire in Professor Wheatstone’s experiments were imme
diately connected with two large insulated metallic surfaces exposed
to the air, so that the primary act of induction, after making the
contact for discharge, might be in part removed from the internal
portion of the wire at the <U+FB01>rst instance, and disposed for the moment
on its surface jointly with the air and surrounding conductors, then I
venture to anticipate that the middle spark would be more retarded
than before. And if those two plates were the inner and outer
coatings of a large jar or Leyden battery, then the retardation of the
spark would be much greater.” This was only a prediction, for the
experiment was not made."E Sixteen years subsequently, however, the
proper conditions came into play, and Faraday was able to show
that the observations of Werner Siemens, and Latimer Clark, on
subterraneous and submarine wires were illustrations, on a grand
   * If Sir Charles Wheatstone could be induced to take up his measurements
once more, varying the substances through which, and the conditions under which
the current is propagated, he might render great service to science, both theoretic
and experimental.

scale, of the principle which he had enunciated in 1838. The wires
and the surrounding water act as a Leyden jar, and the retardation
of the current predicted by Faraday manifests itself in every message
sent by such cables.
    The meaning of Faraday in these memoirs on Induction and Con
duetion is, as I have said, by no means always clear; and the di<U+FB01>‘i
culty will be most felt by those who are best trained in ordinary theo
retic conceptions. He does not know the reader’s needs, and he there
fore does not meet them. For instance, he speaks over and over again
of the impossibility of charging a body with one electricity, though the
impossibility is by no means evident. The key to the di<U+FB02>ieulty is
this. He looks upon every insulated conductor as the inner coating of
a Leyden jar. An insulated sphere in the middle of a room is to his
mind such a coating; the walls are the outer coating, while the air be
tween both is the insulator, across which the charge acts by induction.
Without this reaction of the walls upon the sphere you could no more,
according to Faraday, charge it with electricity than you could charge
a Leyden jar, if its outer coating were removed. Distance with him is
immaterial. His strength as a generalizer enables him to dissolve the
idea of magnitude; and if you abolished the walls of the room—even
the earth itself—he would make the sun and planets the outer coating
of his jar. I dare not contend that Faraday in these memoirs made
all his theoretic positions good. But a pure vein of philosophy runs
through these writings ; while his experiments and reasonings on the
forms and phenomena of electrical discharge are of imperishable
importance.

     The last of these memoirs was dated from the Royal Institution
in June, 1838. It concludes the <U+FB01>rst volume of his ‘Experimental
Researches on Electricity.’ In 1840, as already stated, he made his
<U+FB01>nal assault on the contact theory, from which it never recovered.*
He was now feeling the effects of the mental strain to which he had
been subjected for so many years. During these years he repeatedly
broke down. His wife alone witnessed the extent of his prostration,
and to her loving care we, and the World, are indebted for the
enjoyment of his presence here so long. He found occasional relief
in a theatre. He frequently quitted London and went to Brighton
and elsewhere, always choosing a situation which commanded a view
of the sea, or of some other pleasant horizon, where he could sit and
gaze and feel the gradual revival of the faith that
                             “ Nature never did betray
                   The heart that loved her.”
But very often for some days after his removal to the country he
would be unable to do more than sit at a window and look out upon
the sea and sky.                           '

     In 1841, his state became more serious than it had ever been
 before. A published letter to Mr. Richard Taylor, dated March
 11, 1843, contains an allusion to his previous condition. “ You are
 aware,” he says, “that considerations regarding health have prevented
 me from working or reading on science for the last two years.” This,
 at one period or another of their lives, seems to be the fate of most
 great investigators. They do not know the limits of their consti
 tutional strength until they have transgressed them. It is, perhaps,
 right that they should transgress them, in order to ascertain where
 they lie. Faraday, however, though he went far towards it, did not
 push his transgression beyond his power of restitution. In 1841
 Mrs. Faraday and he went to Switzerland, under the affectionate
 charge of her brother, Mr. George Barnard, the artist. This time of
 suffering throws fresh light upon his character. I have said that
 sweetness and gentleness were not its only constituents; that he
 was also <U+FB01>ery and strong. At the time now referred to his <U+FB01>re was
 low and his strength distilled away; but the residue of his life was
 neither irritability nor discontent. He was un<U+FB01>t to mingle in society,
 for conversation‘ was a pain to him; but let us observe the great
 Man-child when alone. He is at the village of Interlaken, enjoying
 Jungfrau sunsets, and at times watching the Swiss nailers making
 their nails. He keeps a little journal, in which he describes the
 process of nail-making, and incidentally throws a luminous beam upon
himself.
    “ August 2nd, 1841. Clout nail-making goes on here rather considerably,
and is a very neat and pretty operation to observe. I love a smith’s shop and
anything relating to smithery. My father was a smith.”
     From Interlaken he went to the Falls of the Giessbach, on the
pleasant lake of Brientz. And here we have him watching the shoot
of the cataract down its series of precipices. It is shattered into
foam at the base of each, and tossed by its own recoil as water-dust
through the air. The sun is at his back, shining on the drifting
spray, and he thus describes and muses on what he sees :
    “ August 12th, 1841. To-day every fall was foaming from the abundance
of water, and the current of wind brought down by it was in some places too
strong to stand against. The sun shone brightly, and the rainbows seen from
various points were very beautiful. One at the bottom of a <U+FB01>ne but furious fall
was very ploasant,—there it remained motionless whilst the gusts and clouds
of spray swept furiously across its place and were dashed against the rock.
It looked like a spirit strong in faith and steadfast in the midst of the storm of
passions sweeping across it, and though it might fade and revive, still it held
on to the rock as in hope and giving hope. And the very drops, which in the
whirlwind of their fury seemed as if they would carry all away, were made to
revive it and give it greater beauty.”

    But we must quit the man and go on to the discoverer: we shall
return for a brief space to his company by and by.           Carry your
thoughts back to his last experiments, and see him endeavouring
to prove that induction is due to the action of contiguous particles.
He knew that polarized light was a most subtle and delicate inves
tigator of molecular condition. He used it in 1834 in exploring his
electrolytes, and he tried it in v1838 upon his dielectrics. At that
time he coated two opposite faces of a glass cube with tinfoil, con
nected one coating with his powerful electric machine and the other
with the earth, and examined by polarized light the condition of the
glass when thus subjected to strong electric in<U+FB02>uence. He failed
to obtain any e<U+FB01>'ect, still he was persuaded an action existed, and
required only suitable means to call it forth.           '
    After his return from Switzerland he was beset by these thoughts:
they were more inspired than logical; but he resorted to magnets
and proved his inspiration true. His dislike of “doubtful know
ledge” and his e<U+FB02>brts to liberate his mind from the thraldom of
hypotheses have been already referred to. Still this rebel against
theory was incessantly theorizing himself. His principal researches
are all connected by an undercurrent of speculation. Theoretic
ideas were the very sap of his intellect—the source from which all
his strength as an experimenter was derived. While once sauntering
with him through the Crystal Palace, at Sydenham, I asked him what
directed his attention to the magnetization of light. It was his
theoretic notions. ' He had certain views regarding the unity and
convertibility of natural forces ; certain ideas regarding the vibrations
of light and their relations to the lines of magnetic force; these views
and ideas drove him to investigation. And so it must always be : the
great experimentalist must ever be the habitual theorist, whether or not
he gives to his theories formal enunciation.
    Faraday, you must have been informed, endeavoured to improve
the manufacture of glass for optical purposes. But though he pro
duced a heavy glass of great refractive power, its value to optics did
not repay him for the pains and labour bestowed on it. Now, however,
we reach a result established by means of this same heavy glass, which
made ample amends for all.
    In November, 1845, he announced his discovery of the “ Magneti
zation of Light, and the Illumination of the Lines of Magnetic Force.”
This title provoked comment at the time, and caused misapprehension.
He therefore added an explanatory note; but the note left his meaning
as entangled as before. In fact, Faraday had notions regarding the
magnetization of light which were peculiar to himself, and untrans
latable into the scienti<U+FB01>c language of the time. Probably no other
philosopher of his day would have employed the phrases just quoted
as appropriate to the discovery announced in 1845. But Faraday
was more than a philosopher; he was a prophet, and often wrought

by an inspiration to be understood by sympathy alone. The prophetic
element in his character occasionally coloured and even injured the
utterance of the man of science; but subtracting that element, though
you might have conferred on him intellectual symmetry, you would
have destroyed his motive force.
     But let us pass from the label of this casket to the jewel it con
tains. “ I have long,” he says, “ held an opinion almost amounting to
conviction, in common I believe with many other lovers of natural
knowledge, that the various forms under which the forces of matter
are made manifest have one common origin; in other words, are so
directly related and mutually dependent, that they are convertible, as
it were, into one another, and possess equivalents of power in their
action. . . . . This strong persuasion,” he adds, “extended to the
powers of light.” And then he examines the action of magnets
upon light. From conversation with him and Anderson, I should
infer that the labour preceding this discovery was very great. The
world knows little of the toil of the discoverer. It sees the climber
jubilant on the mountain-top, but does not know the labour ex
pended in reaching it. Probably hundreds of experiments had been
made on transparent crystals before he thought of testing his heavy
glass. Here is his own clear and simple description of the result of
his <U+FB01>rst experiment with this substance :—-—“.A piece of this glass, about
two inches square, and 0'5 of an inch thick, having <U+FB02>at and polished
edges, was placed as a diamagnetic* between the poles (not as yet
magnetized by the electric current), so that the polarized ray should
pass through its length; the glass acted as air, water, or any other
transparent substance would do ; and if the eye-piece were previously
turned into such a position that the polarized ray was extinguished, or
rather the image produced by it rendered invisible, then the intro
duction of the glass made no alteration in this respect. In this state
of circumstances, the force of the electro-magnet was developed by
 sending an electric current through its coils, and immediately the
image of the lamp-<U+FB02>ame became visible, and continued so long as
the arrangement continued magnetic. On stopping the electric cur
rent, and so causing the magnetic force to cease, the light instantly
disappeared. These phenomena could be renewed at pleasure, at any
 instant of time, and upon any occasion, showing a perfect dependence
of cause and effect.”
      In a beam of ordinary light the particles of the luminiferous ether
 vibrate in all directions perpendicular to the line of progression; by
the act of polarization, performed here by Faraday, all oscillations but
 those parallel to a certain plane are eliminated. When the plane of
 vibration of the polarizer coincides with that of the analyzer, a portion
     * “By a diamagnetic,” says Faraday, "I mean a body through which lines of
magnetic force are passing, and which does not by their action assume the usual
magnetic state of iron or loadstone.”     Faraday subsequently used this term in a
 different sense from that here given, as will immediately appear.

of the beam passes through both; but when these two planes are at
right angles to each other, the beam is extinguished. If by any means,
while the polarizer and analyzer remain thus crossed, the plane of
vibration of the polarized beam between them could be changed, then
the light would be, in part at least. transmitted. In Faraday’s ex
periment this was accomplished. His magnet turned the plane of
polarization of the beam through a certain angle, and thus enabled it
to get through the analyzer ; so that “the magnetization of light and

     To him, as to all true philosophers, the main value of a fact was
its position and suggestiveness in the general sequence of scienti<U+FB01>c
truth. Hence, having established the existence of a phenomenon, his
habit was to look at it from all possible points of view, and to develop
its relationship to other phenomena. He proved that the direction of
the rotation depends upon the polarity of his magnet ; being reversed
when the magnetic poles are reversed. He showed that when a
polarized ray passed through his heavy glass in a direction parallel to
the magnetic lines of force, the rotation is a maximum, and that when
the direction of the ray is at right angles to the lines of force there
is no rotation at all. He also proved that the amount of the rotation
is proportional to the length of the diamagnetic through which the ray
passes. He operated with liquids and solutions. Of aqueous solutions
he tried 150 and more, and found the power in all of them. He then
examined gases; but here all his efforts to produce any sensible action
upon the polarized beam were ineffectual. He then passed from mag
nets to currents, enclosing bars of heavy glass, and tubes containing
liquids and aqueous solutions within an electro-magnctic helix. A cur
rent sent through the helix caused the plane of polarization to rotate,
 and always in the direction of the current. The rotation was reversed
when the current was reversed. In the case of magnets, he observed a
 gradual, though quick, ascent of the transmitted beam from a state of
darkness to its maximum brilliancy when the magnet was excited. In
the case of currents, the beam attained at once its maximum.          This he
showed to be due to the time required by the iron of the electro-magnet
to assume its full magnetic power, which time vanishes when a current
without iron is employed. “ In this experiment,” he says, “ we may,
I think, justly say that a ray of light. is electri<U+FB01>ed, and the electric
forces illuminated.” In the helix, as with the magnets, he submitted
air to magnetic in<U+FB02>uence “carefully and anxiously,” but could not
discover any trace of action on the polarized ray.
     Many substances possess the power of turning the plane of polari
zation without the intervention of magnetism. Oil of turpentine and
quartz are examples : but Faraday showed that, while in one direction,
that is, across the lines of magnetic force, his rotation is zero, aug
monting gradually from this until it attains its maximum, when the
 direction of the ray is parallel to the lines of force, in the oil of

turpentine, the rotation is independent of the direction of the ray.
But he showed that a still more profound distinction exists between
the magnetic rotation and the natural one. I will try to explain how.
Suppose a tube with glass ends containing oil of turpentine to be
placed north and south. Fixing the eye at the south end of the tube,
let a polarized beam be sent through it from the north. To the
observer in this position the rotation of the plane of polarization, by
the turpentine, is right-handed. Let the eye be placed at the north
end of the tube and a beam be sent through it from the south: the
rotation is still right-handed. Not so, however, when a bar of heavy
glass is subjected to the action of an electric current. In this case
if, in the <U+FB01>rst position of the eye, the rotation be right-handed, in
the second position it is left-handed: These considerations make it
manifest that if a polarized beam, after having passed through the oil
of turpentine in its natural state, could, by any means, he re<U+FB02>ected
back through the liquid, the rotation impressed upon the direct beam
would be exactly neutralized by that impressed upon the re<U+FB02>ected one.
Not so with the induced magnetic effect. Here it is manifest that
the rotation would be doubled by the act of re<U+FB02>ection. Hence Fara
day concludes that the particles of the oil of turpentine which rotate
by virtue of their natural force, and those which rotate in virtue of
the induced force, cannot be in the same condition. The same remark
applies to all bodies which possess a natural power of rotating the
plane of polarization.
     And then he proceeded with exquisite skill and insight to take ad
vantage of this conclusion. He silvered the ends of his piece of heavy
glass, leaving, however, a narrow portion parallel to two edges dia
gonally opposed to each other unsilvered. He then sent his beam
through this uncovered portion, and by suitably inclining his glass
caused the beam within it to reach his eye, <U+FB01>rst direct, and then after
two, four, and six re<U+FB02>ections. These corresponded to the passage of
the ray once, three times, <U+FB01>ve times, and seven times through the
glass. He thus established with numerical accuracy the exact pro
portionality of the rotation to the distance traversed by the polarized
beam. Thus in one series of experiments where the rotation acquired
by the direct beam was 12°, that acquired by three passages through
the glass was 36°, while that acquired by <U+FB01>ve passages was 60°.
But even when this method of magnifying was applied, he failed with
various solid substances to obtain any effect; and in the case of air,
though he employed to the utmost the power which these repeated
re<U+FB02>ections placed in his hands, he failed to produce the slightest
sensible rotation.
     These failures of Faraday to obtain the effect with gases, seem to
indicate the true seat of the phenomenon. The luminiferous ether
surrounds and is in<U+FB02>uenced by the ultimate particles of matter. The
symmetry of the one involves that of the other. Thus, if the molecules
of a crystal be perfectly symmetrical round any line through the
crystal, we may safely conclude that a ray will pass along this line

 1868.] -                on Faraday as a Discoverer.                           237
as through ordinary glass. It will not be doubly refracted. From
the symmetry of the liquid <U+FB01>gures, known to be produced in the planes
of freezing, when radiant heat is sent through ice, we may safely infer
symmetry of aggregation, and hence conclude that the line perpendi
cular to the planes of freezing is a line of no double refraction : that it
is, in fact, the optic axis of the crystal. The same remark applies to
the line joining the opposite blunt angles of a crystal of Iceland spar.
 The arrangement of the molecules round this line being symmetrical,
the condition of the ether depending upon these molecules shares their
 symmetry; and there is, therefore, no reason why the wave-length
 should alter with the alteration of the azimuth round this line. An
 nealed glass has its molecules symmetrically arranged round every
line that can be drawn through it ; hence it is not doubly refractive,
But let the substance be either squeezed or strained in one direction,
the molecular symmetry, and with it the symmetry of the ether, is
immediately destroyed and the glass becomes doubly refractive.
Unequal heating produces the same effect. Thus mechanical strains
reveal themselves by optical effects ; and there is little doubt that in
Faraday’s experiment it is the magnetic strain that produces the rota
tion of the plane of polarization.*
   Discovery of Diamagnetism—Researches on Magne-Crystallic Action.
      Faraday’s next great step in discovery was announced in a memoir
on the “Magnetic Condition of all Matter,” communicated to the
Royal Society on the 18th of December, 1845. One great source of
his success was the employment of extraordinary power. As already
stated, he never accepted a negative answer to an experiment until he
had brought to bear upon it all the force at his command. He had
over and over again tried steel magnets and ordinary electro-magnets
on various substances, but without detecting anything different from the
ordinary attraction exhibited by a few of them. Stronger coercion,
however, developed a new action. Before the pole of an electro
magnet, he suspended a fragment of his famous heavy glass; and
observed that when the magnet was powerfully excited the glass fairly
retreated from the pole. It was a clear case of magnetic repulsion.
He then suspended a bar of the glass between two poles; the bar
retreated when the poles were excited, and set its length equatorially
     * The power of double refraction conferred on the centre of a glass rod, when
it is caused to sound the fundamental note due to its longitudinal vibration, and
the absence of the same power in the case of vibrating air (enclosed in a glass
organ-pipe), seems to be analogous to the presence and absence of Faraday‘s effect
in the same two substances.
     Faraday never, to my knowledge, attempted to give, even in conversation, a
picture of the molecular condition of his heavy glass when subjected to magnetic
in<U+FB02>uence. In a mathematical investigation of the subject, published in the
Proceedings of the Royal Society for 1856, Sir William Thomson arrives at the
conclusion that the “ diamagnetic ” is in a state of molecular rotation.

or at right angles to the line joining them. When an ordinary
magnetic body was similarly suspended, it always set axially, that is,
from pole to pole.
    Faraday called those bodies which were repelled by the poles of
a magnet, diamagnetl'c bodies; using this term in a sense different
from that in which he employed it in his memoir on the magneti
zation of light. The term magnetic he reserved for bodies which
exhibited the ordinary attraction. He afterwards employed the term
magnetic to cover the whole phenomena of attraction and repulsion,
and used the word paramagnetic to designate such magnetic action as
is exhibited by iron.
    Isolated observations by Brugmanns, Becquerel, le Baillif, Saigy,
and Seebeck had indicated the existence of a repulsive force exercised
by the magnet on two or three substances; but these observations,
which were unknown to Faraday, had been permitted to remain with
out extension or examination. Having laid hold of the fact of repul
sion, Faraday immediately expanded and multiplied it. He subjected
bodies of the most various qualities to the action of his magnet :—
mineral salts, acids, alkalis, ethers, alcohols, aqueous solutions, glass,
phosphorus, resins, oils, essences, vegetable and animal tissues, and
found them all amenable to magnetic in<U+FB02>uence. No known solid or
liquid proved insensible to the magnetic power when developed in
suf<U+FB01>cientit strength.

So that if you could suspend a men between the poles of a magnet,
his extremities would retreat from the poles until his length became
equatorial.
    Soon after he had commenced his researches on diamagnctism,
Faraday noticed a remarkable phenomenon which <U+FB01>rst crossed my
own path in the following way :——In the year 1849, while working
in the cabinet of my friend, Professor Knoblauch, of Marburg, I sus
pended a small copper coin between the poles of an electro-magnet.
On exciting the magnet, the coin moved towards the poles and then
suddenly stopped, as if it had struck against a cushion. On breaking
the circuit, the coin was repelled, the revulsion being so violent as
to cause it to spin several times round its axis of suspension. A Silber
groschen similarly suspended exhibited the same deportment. For a
moment I thought this a new discovery; but on looking over the
literature of the subject, it appeared that Faraday had observed, multi
plied, and explained the same effect during his researches on dia
magnetism. His explanation was based upon his own great discovery
of magneto-electric currents. The effect is a most singular one.- A
weight of several pounds of copper may be set spinning between the
electro-magnetic poles; the excitement of the magnet instantly stops
the rotation. Though nothing is apparent to the eye, the copper, if
moved in the excited magnetic <U+FB01>eld, appears to move through a viscous
<U+FB02>uid ; while, when a <U+FB01>at piece of the metal is caused to pass to and
fro like a saw between the poles, the_ sawing of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld

resembles the cutting through of cheese or butter)‘ This virtual frictionv
of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld is so strong that copper by its rapid rotation
between the poles might probably be fused. We may easily dismiss
this experiment by saying that the heat is due to the electric currents
excited in the copper. But so long as we are unable to reply to the
question, “What is an electric current?” the explanation is only
provisional. For my own part, I look with profound interest and
hope on the strange action here referred to.
    Faraday’s thoughts ran intuitively into experimental combina
tions, so that subjects whose capacity for experimental treatment
would to ordinary minds seem to be exhausted in a moment, were
shown by him to be all but inexhaustible. He has now an object in
view, the <U+FB01>rst step towards which is the proof that the principle of
Archimedes is true of magnetism. He forms magnetic solutions of
various degrees of strength, places them between the poles of his
magnet, and suspends in the solutions various magnetic bodies. He
proves that when the solution is stronger than the body plunged in
it, the body, though magnetic, is repelled; and when an elongated
piece of it is surrounded by the solution it sets, like a diamagnetic
body, equatorially between the excited poles. The same body when
suspended in a solution of weaker magnetic power than itself is
attracted as whole, while an elongated portion of it sets axially.
    And now theoretic questions rush in upon him. Is this new
force a true repulsion, or is it merely a differential attraction?
Might not the apparent repulsion of diamagnetic bodies be really
due to the greater attraction of the medium by which they are sur
rounded?     He tries the rarefaetion of air, but <U+FB01>nds the effect in
sensible. He is averse to ascribing a capacity of attraction to space,
or to any hypothetical medium supposed to <U+FB01>ll space. He therefore
inclines, but still with caution, to the opiniory that the action of a
magnet upon bismuth is a true and absolute repulsion, and not merely
the result of differential attraction. And then he clearly states a
theoretic view su<U+FB02>icient to account for the phenomena. “ Theoreti
cally,” he says, “ an explanation of the movements of the diamagnetic
bodies, and all the dynamic phenomena consequent upon the action of
magnets upon them, might be offered in the supposition that magnetic
induction caused in them a contrary state to that which it produced
in ordinary matter.” That is to say, while in ordinary magnetic
in<U+FB02>uence the exciting pole excites adjacent to itself the contrary
magnetism, in diamagnetic bodies the adjacent magnetism is the
same ‘as that of the exciting pole. This theory of reversed polarity,
however, does not appear to have ever laid deep hold of Faraday’s
mind; and his own experiments failed to give any evidence of its
truth. He therefore subsequently abandoned it, and maintained the
non-polarity of the diamagnetic force.
     He then entered a new, though related <U+FB01>eld of inquiry.      Having

2410                           Professor Tyndall                            [Jam
dealt with the metals and their compounds, and having classi<U+FB01>ed all
of them that came within the range of his observation under the two
heads magnetic and diamagnetic, he began the investigation of the
phenomena presented by crystals when subjected to magnetic power.
The action of crystals had been in part theoretically predicted by
Poisson)‘ and actually discovered by Pliicker, whose beautiful results,
at the period which we have now reached, profoundly interested
all scienti<U+FB01>c men. Faraday had been frequently puzzled by the de
portment of bismuth, a highly crystalline metal. Sometimes elongated
masses of the substance refused to set equatorially, sometimes they set
persistently oblique, and sometimes even, like a magnetic body, from
pole to pole. “ The effect,” he says, “occurs at a single pole; and it
 is then striking to observe a long piece of a substance so diamagnetic
as bismuth repelled, and yet at the same moment set round with force,
axially, or end on, as a piece of magnetic substance would do.” The
 effect perplexed him; and in his efforts to release himself from this
perplexity, no feature of this new manifestation of force escaped his
 attention. His experiments are described in a memoir communicated
 to the Royal Society on the 7th of December, 1848.
      I have worked long myself at magne-crystallic action, amid all
the light of Faraday’s and Pliicker’s researches. The papers now
before me were objects of daily and nightly study with me eighteen
or nineteen years ago ; but even now, though their perusal is but the
last of a series of repetitions, they astonish me. Every circum
stance connected with the subject ; every shade of deportment; every
variation in the energy of the action; almost every application which
could possibly be made of magnetism to bring out in detail the cha
racter of this new force, is minutely described. The <U+FB01>eld is swept
clean and hardly anything experimental is left for the gleaner. The
phenomena he concwdes are altogether different from those of mag
netism or diamagnetism; they would appear in fact to present to us
“a new force, or a new form of force, in the molecules of matter,”
which for convenience sake he designates by a new word, as “ the
magne-crystallic force.”
      He looks at the crystal acted upon by the magnet. From its mass
he passes, in idea, to its atoms, and he asks himself whether the power
which can thus seize upon the crystalline molecules, after they have
been <U+FB01>xed in their proper positions by crystallizing force, may not,
when they are free, be able to determine their arrangement? He
therefore liberates the atoms by fusing the bismuth. He places the
fused substance between the poles of an electro-magnet, powerfully
excited; but he fails to detect any action. I think it camfot be
doubted that an action is exerted here, that a true cause comes into
play; but its magnitude is not such as sensibly to interfere with the
force of crystallization, which, in comparison with the diamagnetic
force, is enormous. “Perhaps,” adds Faraday, “if a longer time
    *‘ See Sir William Thomson on ltlagne-crystallic Action, ‘ Phil. Mag; 1851.

1868.]                   on Faraday as a Discoverer.                     241
were allowed and a permanent magnet used, a better result might be
obtained. I had built many hopes upon the process.” This expression,
and his writings abound in such, illustrates what has been already
said regarding his experiments being suggested and guided by his
theoretic conceptions. His mind was full of hopes and hypotheses,
but he always brought them to an experimental test. The record of
his planned and executed experiments would, I doubt not, show a
high ratio of hopes disappointed to hopes ful<U+FB01>lled; but every case of
ful<U+FB01>lment abolished all memory of defeat; disappointment was swal
lowed up in victory.
     After the description of the general character of this new force,
Faraday states with the emphasis here reproduced its mode of action:
“ The law of action appears to be that the line or axis of MAGNE-GRYSTAL
LIG force (being the resultant of the action of all the molecules) tends
to place itself parallel, or as a tangent, to the magnetic curve, or line of
magnetic force, passing through the place where the crystal is situated.”
The magne-crystallic force, moreover, appears to him “to be clearly
distinguished from the magnetic or diamagnetic forces, in that it
causes neither approach nor recession, consisting not in attraction or
repulsion, but in giving a certain determinate position to the mass
under its in<U+FB02>uence.” And then he goes on “very carefully to examine
and prove the conclusion that there was no connection of the force
with attractive or repulsive in<U+FB02>uences.” . With the most re<U+FB01>ned
ingenuity he shows that, under certain circumstances, the’ magne
crystallic force can cause the centre of gravity of a highly magnetic
body to retreat from the poles, and the centre of gravity of a highly
diamagnetic body to approach them. His experiments root his mind
more and more <U+FB01>rmly in the conclusion that it is “ neither attraction
nor repulsion causes the set, or governs the <U+FB01>nal position” of the
crystal in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld. That the force which does so is there
fore “distinct in its character and effects from the magnetic and
diamagnetic forms of force. On the other hand,” he continues, “it
has a most manifest relation to the crystalline structure of bismuth
and other bodies, and therefore to the power by which their mole
cules are able to build up the crystalline masses.”
     And here follows one of those expressions which characterize the
conceptions of Faraday in regard to force generally :—-“It appears to
me impossible to conceive of the results in any other way than by a
mutual reaction of the magnetic force, and the force of the particles
of the crystal upon each other.” He proves that the action of the
force though thus molecular is an action at a distance; he shows
that a bismuth crystal can cause a freely suspended magnetic needle
to set parallel to its magne-crystallic axis. Few living men are aware
of the di<U+FB01>iculty of obtaining results like this, or of the delicacy necessary
to their attainment. “But though it thus takes up the character of a
force acting at a distance, still it is due to that power of the particles
which makes them cohere in regular order and gives the mass its
crystalline aggregation, which we call at other times the attraction

   of aggregation, and so often speak of as acting at imensible distances.”
    Thus he broods over this new force, and looks at it from all possible
   points of inspection. Experiment follows experiment, as thought fol
   lows thought. He will not relinquish the subject as long as a hope
   exists of throwing more light upon it. He knows full well the ano
   malous nature of the conclusion to which his experiments lead him.
   But experiment to him is <U+FB01>nal, and he will not shrink from the
   conclusion. “ This force,” he says, “ appears to me to be very strange
   and striking in its character. It is not polar, for there is no attraction
   or repulsion.” And then, as if startled by his own utterance, he adds:
   ——“What is the nature of the mechanical force which turns the crystal
   round, and makes it a<U+FB02>'ect a magnet?” . . . “ I do not remember,”
   he continues, “heretofore such a case of force as the present one,
   Where a body is brought into position only, without attraction or
   repulsion.”
       Pliicker, the celebrated geometer already mentioned, who pursued
   experimental physics for many years of his life with singular devotion
   and success, visited Faraday in those days, and repeated before him
   his beautiful experiments on magneto-optic action. Faraday repeated
  and veri<U+FB01>ed Pliicker’s observations, and concluded, what he at <U+FB01>rst
  seemed to doubt, that Pliicker’s results and magne-crystallic action
  have the same origin.
       At the end of his papers, when he takes a last look along the line
  of research, and then turns his eyes to the future, utterances quite as
  much emotional as scienti<U+FB01>c escape from Faraday. “I cannot,” he
  says, at the end of his <U+FB01>rst paper on magne-crystallic action, “conclude
  this series of researches Without remarking how rapidly the knowledge
  of molecular forces grows upon us, and how strikingly every investi
  gation tends to develop more and more their importance, and their
  extreme attraction as an object of study. A few years ago magnetism
  was to us an occult power, affecting only a few bodies, now it is found
  to in<U+FB02>uence all bodies, and to possess the most intimate relations with
  electricity, heat, chemical action, light, crystallization, and through it,
  with the forces concerned in cohesion; and we may, in the present
  state of things, well feel urged to continue in our labours, encouraged
 by the hope of bringing it into a bond of union with gravity itself.”
                           Supplementary Remarks.
      A brief space will, perhaps, be granted me here to state the
 further progress of an investigation which interested Faraday so much.
 Drawn by the fame of Bunsen as a teacher, in the year 1848 I became
 a student in the University of Marburg, in Hesse-Cassel. Bunsen
 behaved to me as a brother as well as a teacher, and it was also
 my happiness to make the acquaintance and gain the friendship of
 Professor Knoblauch, so highly distinguished by his researches on
 Radiant Heat. Pliicker’s and Faraday’s investigations <U+FB01>lled all minds
‘at the time, and towards the end of 1849, Professor Knoblauch and

   1868.]                 on Faraday as a Discoverer.                   243
  myself commenced a joint investigation of the entire question. Long
  discipline was necessary to give us due mastery over it. Employing
  a method proposed by Dove, we examined the optical properties of
  our crystals ourselves; and these optical observations went hand in
  hand with our magnetic experiments. The number of these experi
  ments was very great, but for a considerable time no fact of importance
  was added to those already published. At length, however, it was
  our fortune to meet with various crystals whose deportment could not
  be brought under the laws of r<U+FB01>agne-crystallie action enunciated by
  Pliicker. We also discovered instances which led us to suppose that
  the magne-crystallic force was by no means independent, as alleged,
  of the magnetism or diamagnetism 0f the mass of the crystal. Indeed,
  the more we worked at the subject, the more clearly did it appear to
  us that the deportment of crystals in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld was due, not
  to a force previously unknown, but to the modi<U+FB01>cation of the known
  forces of magnetism and diamagnetism by crystalline aggregation.
      An eminent example of magne-crystallic action adduced by Pliicker
  and experimented on by Faraday, was Iceland spar. It is what in optics
  is called a negative crystal, and according to the law of Pliicker, the
  axis of such a crystal was always repelled by a magnet. But we
  showed that it was only necessary to substitute, in whole or in part,
 carbonate of iron for carbonate of lime, thus changing the magnetic
 but not the optical character of the crystal, to cause the axis to be
 attracted. That the deportment of magnetic crystals is exactly anti
 thetical to that of diamagnetic crystals isomorphous with the magnetic
 ones, was proved to be a general law of action. In all cases, the line
 which in a diamagnetic crystal set equatorially, always set itself in
 an isomorphous magnetic crystal axially. By mechanical compression
 other bodies were also made to imitate the Iceland spar.
      These and numerous other results bearing upon the question were
 published at the time in the ‘Philosophical Magazine’ and in ‘Pog
 gendo<U+FB02>"s Annalcn ; ’ and the investigation of diamagnetism and magne
 crystallic action was subsequently continued by me in the laboratory
 of Professor Magnus of Berlin. In December, 1851, after I had
 quitted Germany, Dr. Bence Jones went to the Prussian capital to

 mention that though my aim and object in that lecture was to subvert
the notions both of Faraday and Pliicker, and to establish in oppo
sition to their views what I regarded as the truth, it was very far
from producing in Faraday either enmity or anger. At the con
clusion of the lecture, he quitted his accustomed seat, crossed the
theatre to the corner into which I had shrunk, shook me by the hand,
                                                               ‘I 2

and brought me back to the table. Once more, subsequently, and in
connection with a related question, I ventured to differ from him still
more emphatically. It was done out of trust in the greatness of his
character; nor was the trust misplaced. He felt my public dissent
from him; and it pained me afterwards to the quick to think that I
had given him even momentary annoyance. It was, however, only
momentary. His soul was above all littleness and proof to all
egotism. He was the same to me afterwards that he had been before;
the very chance expression which led me to conclude that he felt my
dissent being one of kindness and affection.
     It required long subsequent effort to subdue the complications
of magne-cry'stallic action, and to bring under the dominion of ele
mentary principles the vast mass of facts which the experiments of
Faraday and Pliicker had brought to light. It was proved by Reich,
Edmond Becquerel, and myself, that the condition of diamagnetic
bodies in virtue of which they were repelled by the poles of a magnet,
was excited in them by those poles ; that the strength of this condition
rose and fell with, and was proportional to, the strength of the acting
magnet. It was not then any property possessed permanently by the
bismuth, and which merely required the development of magnetism to
act upon it, that caused the repulsion, for then the repulsion would
have been simply proportional to the strength of the in<U+FB02>uencing
magnet, whereas experiment proved it to augment as the square of
rentstrength.

 established between magnetic and diamagnetic bodies. After this the
deportment of magnetic bodies, “ normal” and “abnormal,” crystal
 line, amorphous, and compressed, was compared with that of crystal
line, amorphous, and compressed diamagnetic bodies ; and by a series
 of experiments, executed in the laboratory of this Institution, the most
 complete antithesis was established between magnetism and diamag
 netism. This antithesis embraced the quality of po1arity,—the theory
of rever sed polarity, <U+FB01>rst propounded by Faraday, being ‘proved to be
true. The discussion of the question was very brisk. On the conti
 nent Professor Wilhelm Weber was the ablest and most successful
 supporter of the doctrine of diamagnetic polarity; and it was with an
 apparatus, devised by him and constructed under his own superin
 tendence, by Leyser of Leipzig, that the last demands of the oppo
 nents of diamagnetic polarity were satis<U+FB01>ed. The establishment of
 this point was absolutely necessary to the explanation of magne
 crystallic action.
     With that admirable instinct which always guided him, Faraday had
 seen that it was possible, if not probable, that the diamagnetic force
acts with different degrees of intensity in di<U+FB02>'erent directions, through
the mass of a crystal. In his studies on electricity he had sought an
experimental reply to the question whether crystalline bodies had not
different speci<U+FB01>c inductive capacities in different directions,‘but he
failed to establish any di<U+FB01>'erence of the kind. His <U+FB01>rst attempt to

1868.]                   on Faraday as a Discoverer.                   245
establish differences of diamagnetic action in di<U+FB01>‘erent directions
through bismuth, was also a failure: but he must have felt this to
be a point of cardinal importance, for he returned to the subject in
1850, and proved that bismuth was repelled with different degrees of
force in different directions. It seemed as if the crystal were com
pounded of two diamagnetic bodies of different strengths, the substance
being more strongly repelled across the magne-crystallic axis than
along it. The same result was obtained independently, and extended to
various other bodies, magnetic as well as diamagnetic, and also to com
pressed substances, a little subsequently by myself. The law of action
in relation to this point is, that in diamagnetic crystals, the line along
which the repulsion is a maximum, sets equatorially in the magnetic
<U+FB01>eld; while in magnetic crystals the line along which the attraction
is a maximum sets from pole to pole. Faraday had said that the
magne-crystallic force was neither attraction nor repulsion. Thus far
he was right. It was neither, taken singly, but it was both. By the
combination of the doctrine of diamagnetic polarity with these dif
ferential attractions and repulsions, and by paying due regard to the
character of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld, every fact brought to light in the
domain of magne-crystallic action received complete explanation.
The most perplexing of those facts were shown to result from the
action of mechanical couples, which the proved polarity both of mag
netism and diamagnetism brought into play. Indeed the thoroughness
with which the experiments of Faraday were thus explained, is the
most striking possible demonstration of the marvellous precision with
which they were executed.
         Magnetism of Flame and Gases: Atmospheric Magnetism.
    When an experimental result was obtained by Faraday it was
instantly enlarged by his imagination. I am acquainted with no mind
whose power and suddenness of expansion at the touch of new physi
cal truth could be ranked with his. Sometimes I have compared the
action of his experiments on his mind to that of highly combustible
matter thrown into a furnace: every fresh entry of fact was accom
panied by the immediate development of light and heat. The light,
which was intellectual, enabled him to see far beyond the boundaries
of the fact itself, and the heat, which was emotional, urged him to the
conquest of this newly-revealed domain. But though the force of his
imagination was enormous, he bridled it like a mighty rider, and never
permitted his intellect to be overthrown.
    In virtue of the expansive power which his vivid imagination
conferred upon him, he rose from the smallest beginnings to the
grandest ends. Having heard from Zantedeschi that Bancalari had
established the magnetism of <U+FB02>ame, he repeated the experiments and
augmented the results. He passed from <U+FB02>ames to. gases, examining and‘
revealing their magnetic and diamagnetic powers; and then he sud

246                         Professor Tyndall                       [Jan,
denly rose from his bubbles of oxygen and nitrogen to the atmospheric
envelope of the earth itself, and its relations to the great question of
terrestrial magnetism. The rapidity with which these ever-augment
ing thoughts assumed the form of experiments is unparalleled. His
power in this respect is often best illustrated by his minor inves
tigations, and, perhaps, by none more strikingly than by his paper
“On the Diamagnetic Condition of Flame and Gases,” published
as a letter to Mr. Richard Taylor, in ‘The Philosophical Magazine’
for December, 1847. After verifying, varying, and expanding the
results of Bancalari, he submitted to examination heated air-currents,
produced by platinum spirals, placed in the magnetic <U+FB01>eld, and
raised to ineandescence by electricity. He then examined the mag
netic deportment of gases generally. Almost all of these gases are
invisible; but he must, nevertheless, track them in their unseen
courses. He could not effect this by mingling smoke with his gases,
for the action of his magnet upon the smoke would have troubled his
conclusions. He, therefore, “ caught” his gases in tubes, carried
them out of the magnetic <U+FB01>eld, and made them reveal themselves at a
distance from the magnet.
     Immersing one gas in another, he determined their differential
action; results of the utmost beauty being thus arrived at. Perhaps
the most important are those obtained with atmospheric air and
its two constituents. Oxygen, in various media, was strongly attracted
by the magnet; in coal-gas, for example, it was powerfully magnetic,
whereas nitrogen was diamagnetic. Some of the effects obtained
 with oxygen in coal-gas were strikingly beautiful. When the fumes
 of chloride of ammonia (a diamagnetic substance) were mingled
 with the oxygen, the cloud of chloride behaved in a most singular
 manner :-—“ The attraction of iron <U+FB01>lings,” says Faraday, “ to a mag
 netic pole is not more striking than the appearance presented by
 the oxygen under these circumstances.” On observing this deportment
 the question immediately occurs to him,—Can we not separate the
 oxygen of the atmosphere from its nitrogen by magnetic analysis?
 It is the perpetual occurrence of such questions that marks the great
 experimenter. The attempt to analyze atmospheric air by magnetic
 force proved a failure, like the previous attempt to in<U+FB02>uence crystal
 lization by the magnet. The enormous comparative power of the force
 of crystallization was then assigned as a reason for the incompetence
 of the magnet to determine molecular arrangement: in the present in
 stance the magnetic analysis is opposed by the force of diffusion, which
 is also very strong comparatively. The same remark applies to, and is‘
 illustrated by, another experiment subsequently executed by Faraday.
 Water is diamagnetic, sulphate of iron strongly magnetic. He enclosed
 “ a dilute solution of sulphate of iron in a tube, and placed the lower
 end of the tube between the poles of a powerful horseshoe magnet for
 days together,” but he could produce “ no concentration of the solu
 tion in the part near the magnet.”    Here also the diffusibility of the
 salt was too powerful for the force brought against it.

1868.]                  on Faraday as a Discoverer.                     247
    The experiment last referred to is recorded in a paper presented
to the Royal Society on the 2nd of August, 1850, in which he pursues
the investigation of the magnetism of gases. Newton’s observations on
soap-bubbles were often referred to by Faraday. His delight in a soap
bubble was like that of a boy, and he often introduced them in his
lectures, causing them, when <U+FB01>lled with air, to <U+FB02>oat on invisible seas of
carbonic acid, and otherwise employing them as means of illustration.
He now <U+FB01>nds them exceedingly useful in his experiments on the mag
netic condition of gases. A bubble of air in a magnetic <U+FB01>eld occupied
by'air was unaffected, save through the feeble repulsion of its envelope.
A bubble of nitrogen, on the contrary, was repelled from the magnetic
axis with a force far surpassing that of a bubble of air. The deport
ment of oxygen in air “ was very impressive, the bubble being pulled
inward, or towards the axial line, sharply and suddenly, as if the oxy
gen were highly magnetic.”
    He next labours to establish the true magnetic zero, a problem
not so easy as might at <U+FB01>rst sight be imagined. For the action
of the magnet upon any gas, while surrounded by air, or any other
gas, can only be differential; and if the experiment were made in
vacuo, the action of the envelope, in this case necessarily of a certain
thickness, would trouble the result. While dealing with this subject
Faraday makes some note-worthy observations regarding space. In
reference to the Torricellian vacuum, he says, “ Perhaps it is hardly
necessary for me to state that I <U+FB01>nd both iron and bismuth in such vacua,
perfectly obedient to the magnet. From such experiments, and also
from general observations and knowledge, it seems manifest that the
lines of magnetic force can traverse pure space, just as gravitating force
docs, and as statical electrical forces do, and therefore space has a mag
netic relation of its own, and one that we shall probably <U+FB01>nd hereafter
to be of the utmost importance in natural phenomena. But this cha
meter of space is not of the same kind as that whicli, in relation to
matter, we endeavour to express by the terms magnetic and diamag
netic. To confuse these together would be to confound space with
matter, and to trouble all the conceptions by which we endeavour to
understand and work out a progressively clearer view of the} mode of
action, and the laws of natural forces. It would be as if in gravitation
or electric forces, one were to confound the particles acting on each
other with the space across which they are acting, and would, I think,
shut the door to advancement. Mere space cannot act as matter acts,
even though the utmost latitude be allowed to the hypothesis of an
ether; and admitting that hypothesis, it would be a large additional
assumption to suppose that the lines of magnetic force are vibrations
carried on by it, whilst as yet we have no proof that time is required
for their propagation, or in what respect they may, in general character,
assimilate to or differ from the respective lines of gravitating lumini
ferous or electric forces.”
    Pure space he assumes to be the true magnetic zero, but he pushes
his inquiries to ascertain whether among material substances there

 248                        Professor Tyndall                       [Jan.
 may not be some which resemble space. If you follow his experi
 ments you will soon emerge into the light of his results. A torsion
 beam was suspended by a skein of cocoon silk; at one end of the
 beam was fixed a cross-piece 13 inches long. Tubes of exceedingly thin
 glass, filled with various gases, and hermetically sealed, were sus
 pended in pairs from the two ends of the cross-piece. The position
 of the rotating torsion head was such that the two tubes were at oppo
 site sides of, and equidistant from, the magnetic axis, that is to say
 from the line joining the two closely approximated polar points of an
 electro magnet. His object was to compare the magnetic action of
 the gases in the two tubes. When one tube was filled with oxygen,
 and the other with nitrogen, on the supervention of the magnetic
 force, the oxygen was pulled towards the axis, the nitrogen being
 pushed out. By turning the torsion head they could be restored to
 their primitive position of equidistance, where it is evident the
 action of the glass envelopes was annulled. The amount of torsion
 necessary to re-establish equidistance, expressed the magnetic differ
 ence of the substances compared.
     And then he compared oxygen with oxygen at different pressures.
 One of his tubes contained the gas at the pressure of 30 inches of
mercury, another at a pressure of 15 inches of mercury, a third at a
 pressure of 10 inches, while a fourth was exhausted as far as a good
 air-pump renders exhaustion possible. “When the first of these was
compared with the other three, the effect was most striking.” It was
drawn towards the axis when the magnet was excited, the tube con
taining the rarer gas being apparently driven away, and the greater
 the difference between the densities of the two gases, the greater was
the energy of this action.
     And now observe his mode of reaching a material magnetic zero.
When a bubble of nitrogen was exposed in air in the magnetic field, on
the supervention of the power, the bubble retreated from the magnet.
A less acute observer would have set nitrogen down as diamagnetic;
but Faraday knew that retreat in a medium composed in part of
oxygen might be due to the attraction of the latter gas, instead of to
the repulsion of the gas immersed in it. But if nitrogen be really
diamagnetic, then a bubble or bulb filled with the dense gas will over
come one filled with the rarer gas. From the cross-piece of his
Torsion-balance he suspended his bulbs of nitrogen, at equal distances
from the magnetic axis, and found that the rarefaction, or the conden
sation of the gas in either of the bulbs had not the slightest influence.
When the magnetic force was developed, the bulbs remained in their
first position, even when one was filled with nitrogen, and the other as
far as possible exhausted. Nitrogen, in fact, acted “like space itself;”
it was neither magnetic nor diamagnetic.
     He cannot conveniently compare the paramagnetic force of oxygen
with iron, in consequence of the exceeding magnetic intensity of
the latter substance; but he does compare it with the sulphate of
iron, and finds that, bulk for bulk, oxygen is equally magnetic with

1868.]                 on Faraday as a Discoverer.                       249
a solution of this substance in water “containing seventeen times
the weight of the oxygen in crystallized proto-sulphate of iron, or
3.4 times its weight of metallic iron in that state of combination.”
By its capability to deflect a fine glass fibre, he finds that the attraction
of his bulb of oxygen, containing only 0.117 of a grain of the gas,
at an average distance of more than an inch from the magnetic axis,
is about equal to the gravitating force of the same amount of oxygen
as expressed by its weight.
    These facts could not rest for an instant in the mind of Faraday
without receiving that expansion, to which I have already referred.
“It is hardly necessary,” he writes, “for me to say here that this oxygen
cannot exist in the atmosphere exerting such a remarkable and high
amount of magnetic force, without having a most important influence
on the disposition of the magnetism of the earth, as a planet; especially,
if it be remembered that its magnetic condition is greatly altered by
variations of its density and by variations of its temperature. I
think I see here the real cause of many of the variations of that force,
which have been, and are now so carefully watched on different parts
of the surface of the globe. The daily variation, and the annual varia
tion, both seem likely to come under it; also very many of the irre
gular continual variations, which the photographic process of record
renders so beautifully manifest. If such expectations be confirmed,
and the influence of the atmosphere be found able to produce results
like these, then we shall probably find a new relation between the
aurora borealis and the magnetism of the earth, namely, a relation
established, more or less, through the air itself in connection with the
space above it; and even magnetic relations and variations, which are
not as yet suspected, may be suggested and rendered manifest and
measurable, in the further development of what I will venture to call
Atmospheric Magnetism. I may be over-sanguine in these expectations,
but as yet I am sustained in them by the apparent reality, simplicity,
and sufficiency of the cause assumed, as it at present appears to my
mind.     As soon as I have submitted these views to a close considera
tion, and the test of accordance with observation, and, where appli
cable, with experiments also, I will do myself the honour to bring
them before the Royal Society.”
     Two elaborate memoirs are then devoted to the subject of Atmo
spheric Magnetism; the first sent to the Royal Society on the 9th
of October, and the second on the 19th of November, 1850.            In these
memoirs he discusses the effects of heat and cold upon the magnetism
 of the air, and the action on the magnetic needle, which must result
from thermal changes. By the convergence and divergence of the
 lines of terrestrial magnetic force, he shows how the distribution of
 magnetism, in the earth's atmosphere, is affected. He applies his re
 sults to the explanation of the annual and of the diurnal variation: he
 also considers irregular variations, including the action of magnetic
 storms. He discusses, at length, the observations at St. Petersburg,
 Greenwich, Hobarton, St. Helena, Toronto, and the Cape of Good

 the key to the variations observed at all these places.
      In the year 1851 I had the honour of an interview with Humboldt
 in Berlin, and his parting words to me then were, “ Tell Faraday that

 Faraday’s memoirs on atmospheric magnetism lost much of their force
 —perhaps too much——through the important discovery of the re
 lation of the variation of the declination to the number of the solar
spots. But I agree with him and M. Edmond Becquerel, who worked
independently at this subject, in thinking that a body so magnetic as
oxygen, swathing the earth, and subject to variations of temperature,
diurnal and annual, must a<U+FB01>'ect the manifestations of terrestrial mag
netism?“ The air that stands upon a single square foot of the
earth’s surface is, according to Faraday, the equivalent in magnetic
force to 8160lbs. of crystallized proto-sulphate of iron. Such a
substance cannot be absolutely neutral as regards the deportment of
the magnetic needle. But Faraday’s writings on this subject are so
voluminous, and the theoretic points are so novel and intricate, that
I shall postpone the complete analysis of these researches to a time
when I can lay hold of them more completely than my other duties
allow me to do now.
             Speculations: Nature of Matter : Lines of Force.
     The scienti<U+FB01>c picture of Faraday would not be complete without
a reference to his speculative writings. On Friday, January 19,
1844, he opened the weekly evening-meetings of the Royal Institution
by a discourse entitled “A speculation touching Electric Conduction
and the nature of Matter.” In this discourse he not only attempts
the overthrow of Dalton’s Theory of Atoms, but also the subversion
of all ordinary scienti<U+FB01>c ideas regarding the nature and relations of
Matter and Force. He objected to the use of the term atom :—“I
have not yet found a mind,” he says, “ that did habitually separate it
from its accompanying temptations; and there can be no doubt that
the words de<U+FB01>nite proportions, equivalent, primes, &c., which did and
do fully express all the facts of what is usually called the atomic
theory in chemistry, were dismissed because they were not expressive
enough, and did not say all that was in the mind of him who used
the word atom in their stead.”
     Amoment will be granted me to indicate my own view of Faraday’s
position here. The word “ atom” was not used in the stead of de<U+FB01>nite
proportions, equivalents, or primes. These terms represented facts
    * This persuasion has been greatly Strengthened by the recent perusal of a
paper by Mr. Baxcndell.

that followed from, but were not equivalent to the atomic theory.
Facts cannot satisfy the mind: and the law of de<U+FB01>nite combining
proportions being once established, the question “ why should com
bination take place according to that law ‘3” is inevitable. Dalton
answered this question by the enunciation of the Atomic Theory, the
flmdamental idea of which is, in my opinion, perfectly secure. The
objection of Faraday to Dalton might be urged with the same sub
stantial force against Newton: it might be stated with regard to the
planetary motions that the laws of Kepler revealed the facts ,- that
the introduction of the principle of gravitation was an addition to the
facts. But this is the essence of all theory. The theory is the back
ward guess from fact to principle; the conjecture, or divination re
garding something, which lies behind the facts, and from which they
<U+FB02>ow in necessary sequence. If Dalton’s theory then account for the
de<U+FB01>nite proportions observed in the combinations of chemistry, its
justi<U+FB01>cation rests upon the same basis as that of the principle of
gravitation. All that can in strictness be said in either case is that
the facts occur as if the principle existed.
     The manner in which Faraday himself habitually deals with his
hypotheses is revealed in this lecture. He incessantly employed them
to gain experimental ends, but he incessantly took them down, as an
architect removes the scaffolding when the edi<U+FB01>ce is complete. “ I
cannot but doubt,” he says, “that he who as a mere philosopher has
most power of penetrating the secrets of nature, and guessing by hypo
thesis at her mode of working, will also be most careful for his own
safe progress, and that of others, to distinguish the knowledge which
consists of assumption, by which I mean theory and hypothesis, from
that which is the knowledge of facts and laws.” Faraday himself,
in fact, was always “ guessing by hypothesis,” and making theoretic
divination the stepping-stone to his experimental results.
     I have already more than once dwelt on the vividness with which
he realized molecular conditions: we have a <U+FB01>ne example of this
strength and brightness of imagination in the present “ speculation.”
He grapples with the notion that matter is made up of particles, not
in absolute contact, but surrounded by interatomio space. “Space,”
he observes, “must be taken as the only continuous part of a body
so constituted. Space will permeate all masses of matter in every
direction like a net, except that in place of meshes it will form cells,
isolating each atom from its neighbours, itself only being continuous.”
     Let us follow out this notion; consider, he argues, the case of a
non-conductor of electricity, such for example as shell-lac, with its
molecules, and their intermolecular spaces running through the mass.
 In its case space must be an insulator; for if it were a conductor it
 would resemble “a <U+FB01>ne metallic web” penetrating the lac in every
 direction. But the fact is that it resembles the wax of black sealing
 wax which surrounds and insulates the particles of conducting carbon,
 interspersed throughout its mass. In the case of shell-lac, therefore,
 space is an insulator.

      But now take the case of a conducting metal. Here we have as
 before, the swathing of space round every atom. If space be an in
 sulator there can be no transmission of electricity from atom to atom.
 But there is transmission; hence space is a conductor. Thus he endea
 vours to hamper the atomic theory. “The reasoning,” he says, “ends
 in a subversion of that theory altogether; for if space be an insulator
 it cannot exist in conducting bodies, and if it be a conductor it cannot
 exist in insulating bodies. Any ground of reasoning,” he adds, as if
 carried away by the ardour of argument, “which tends to such con
 clusions as these must in itself be false.”
      He then tosses the atomic theory from horn to horn of his
 dilemmas. What do we know, he asks, of the atom apart from its
 force? You imagine a nucleus which may be called a, and surround
 it by forces which may be called m; “to my mind the a or nucleus
 vanishes, and the substance consists in the powers of m.          And indeed
 what notion can we form of the nucleus independent of its powers?
What thought remains on which to hang the imagination of an a in
dependent of the acknowledged forces.”. Like Boscovich he abolishes
 the atom and puts a “centre of force” in its place.
     With his usual courage and sincerity he pushes his view to its
utmost consequences. “This view of the constitution of matter,” he
continues, “would seem to involve necessarily the conclusion that
matter fills all space, or at least all space to which gravitation extends;
for gravitation is a property of matter dependent on a certain force,
and it is this force which constitutes the matter.        In that view matter
is not merely mutually penetrable;" but each atom extends, so to say,
throughout the whole of the solar system, yet always retaining its
own centre of force.”
     It is the operation of a mind filled with thoughts of this profound,
strange, and subtle character that we have to take into account in
dealing with Faraday's later researches. A similar cast of thought
pervades a letter addressed by Faraday to Mr. Richard Phillips, and
published in the “Philosophical Magazine’ for May, 1846. It is en
titled ‘Thoughts on Ray-vibrations, and it contains one of the most
singular speculations that ever emanated from a scientific mind. It
must be remembered here, that though Faraday lived amid such specu
lations he did not rate them highly, and that he was prepared at any
moment to change them or let them go. They spurred him on, but
they did not hamper him. His theoretic notions were fluent; and
when minds less plastic than his own attempted to render those
fluxional images rigid, he rebelled. He warns Phillips, moreover,
that from first to last “he merely threw out as matter for speculation
the vague impressions of his mind; for he gave nothing as the result
of sufficient consideration, or as the settled conviction, or even pro
bable conclusion at which he had arrived.”
   * He compares the interpenetration of two atoms to the coalescence of two dis
tinct waves, which though for a moment blended to a single mass, preserve their
individuality, and afterwards separate,

     The gist of this communication is that gravitating force acts in
lines across space, and that the vibrations of light and radiant heat
consist in the tremors of these lines of force. “This notion,” he says,
“as far as it is admitted, will dispense with the ether, which, in an
other view, is supposed to be the medium in which these vibrations
take place.” And he adds further on, that his view “endeavours to
dismiss the ether but not the vibrations.”       The idea here set forth is
the natural supplement of his previous notion that it is gravitating
force which constitutes matter, each atom extending, so to say, through
out the whole of the solar system.
  . The letter to Mr. Phillips winds up with this beautiful conclu
S1On :
    “I think it likely that I have made many mistakes in the preceding
pages, for even to myself my ideas on this point appear only as the shadow of
a speculation, or as one of those impressions upon the mind which are allow
able for a time as guides to thought and research. He who labours in experi
mental inquiries, knows how numerous these are, and how often their apparent
fitness and beauty vanish before the progress and development of real natural
truth.”
     Let it then be remembered that Faraday entertained notions re
garding matter and force altogether distinct from the views generally
held by scientific men. Force seemed to him an entity dwelling along
the line in which it is exerted.        The lines along which gravity acts
between the sun and earth seem figured in his mind as so many elastic
strings: indeed he accepts the assumed instantaneity of gravity as
 the expression of the enormous elasticity of the “lines of weight.”
 Such views, fruitful in the case of magnetism, barren as yet in the case
 of gravity, explain his efforts to transform this latter force. When he
 goes into the open air and permits his helices to fall, to his mind's
 eye they are tearing through the lines of gravitating power, and
 hence his hope and conviction that an effect would and ought to be
 produced. It must ever be borne in mind that Faraday's difficulty
 in dealing with these conceptions was at bottom the same as that of
 Newton; that he is in fact trying to overleap this difficulty, and with
 it probably the limits prescribed to the intellect itself.
     The idea of lines of magnetic force was suggested to Faraday by
 the linear arrangement of iron filings when scattered over a magnet.
 He speaks of and illustrates by sketches, the deflection, both con
 vergent and divergent, of the lines of force, when they pass respec
 tively through magnetic and diamagnetic bodies. These notions of
 concentration and divergence are also based on the direct observation
 of his filings. So long did he brood upon these lines; so habitually
 did he associate them with his experiments on induced currents, that
 the association became “indissoluble,” and he could not think without
 them. “I have been so accustomed,” he writes, “to employ them,
 and especially in my last researches, that I may have unwittingly
 become prejudiced in their favour, and ceased to be a clear-sighted
 judge. Still, I have always endeavoured to make experiment the test

  254                          Professor Tyndall                           [Jan.
  and controller of theory and opinion; but neither by that nor by
  close cross-examination in principle, have I been made aware of any
 error involved in their use.”
      In his later researches on magne-crystallic action, the idea of lines
 of force is extensively employed; it indeed led him to an experiment
 which lies at the root of the whole question. In his subsequent re
 searches on Atmospheric Magnetism the idea receives still wider appli
 cation, showing itself to be wonderfully <U+FB02>exible and convenient. Indeed
  without this conception the attempt to seize upon the magnetic actions,
 possible or actual, of the atmosphere would be di<U+FB01>icult in the extreme;
 but the notion of lines of force, and of their divergence and conver
 gence, guides Faraday without perplexity through all the intricacies
 of the question. After the completion of those researches, and in a
 paper forwarded to the “Royal Society on the 22nd of October, 1851,
 he devotes himself to the formal development and illustration of his
 favourite idea. The paper bears the title “ On lines of magnetic force,
 their de<U+FB01>nite character, and their distribution within a magnet and
 through space.” A deep re<U+FB02>ectiveness is the characteristic of this
 memoir. In his experiments, which are perfectly beautiful and pro
 foundly suggestive, he takes but a secondary delight. His object is
 to illustrate the utility of his conception of lines of force. “ The
 study of these lines,” he says, “has at different times been greatly
 in<U+FB02>uential in leading me to various results which I think prove their
utility as well as fertility.”
     Faraday for a long period used the lines of force merely as “a
 representative idea.” He seemed for a time averse to going further
in expression than the lines themselves, however much further he may
have gone in idea. That he believed them to exist at all times round
a magnet, and irrespective of the existence of magnetic matter, such
as iron <U+FB01>lings, external to the magnet, is certain. No doubt the space
 round every magnet presented itself to his imagination as traversed
 by loops of magnetic power, but he was chary in speaking of the phy
 sical substratum of these loops. Indeed it may be doubted whether
 the physical theory of lines of force presented itself with any distinct
 ness to his own mind. The possible complicity of the luminiferous
 ether in magnetic phenomena was certainly in his thoughts. “How
 the magnetic force,” he writes, “is transferred through bodies or
through space we know not ; whether the result is merely action at a
distance, as in the case of gravity; or by some intermediate agency,
as in the case of light, heat, the electric current, and (as I believe)
static electric action. The idea of magnetic <U+FB02>uids, as applied by
some, or of magnetic centres of action, does not include that of the
latter kind of transmission, but the idea of lines of force does.” And
he continues thus :—“I am more inclined to the notion that in the
transmission of the [magnetic] force there is such an action [an in
termediate agency] external to the magnet, than that the e<U+FB01>'ects are
merely attraction and repulsion at a distance. Such an a<U+FB02>‘ection may
be a function of the ether; for‘ it is not at all unlikely that, if there be an

 1868.]          t        on Faraday as a Discoverer.                         255
 ether, it should have other uses than simply the conveyance of radiations.”
 When he speaks of the magnet in certain cases, “ revolving amongst
its own forces,” he appears to have some conception of this kind in
 view.
     A great part of the investigation completed in October, 1851,
 was taken up with the motions of wires round the poles of a magnet,
and the converse. He carried an insulated wire along the axis of a
bar magnet from its pole to its equator, where it issued from the
magnet, and was bent up so as to connect its two ends. A complete
circuit, no part of which was in contact with the magnet, was thus
obtained. He found that when the magnet and the external wire
were rotated together no current was produced; whereas, when either
 of them was rotated and the other left at rest currents were evolved.
He then abandoned the axial wire, and allowed the magnet itself to
take its place; the result was the same?“ It was the relative motion
of the magnet and the loop that was effectual in producing a current.
     The lines of force have their roots in the magnet, and though they
may expand into in<U+FB01>nite space, they eventually return to the magnet.
Now these lines may be intersected close to the magnet or at a
distance from it. Faraday <U+FB01>nds distance to be. perfectly imma
terial so long as the number of lines intersected is the same. For
example, when the loop connecting the equator and the pole of his
bar-magnet performs one complete revolution round the magnet, it is
manifest that all the lines of force issuing from the magnet are once
intersected. Now it matters not whether the loop be ten feet or ten
inches in length, it matters not how it may be twisted and contorted,
it matters not how near to the magnet or how distant from it the loop
may be, one revolution always produces the same amount of current
electricity, because in all these cases all the lines of force issuing from
the magnet are once intersected and no more.
     From the external portion of the circuit he passes in idea to the
internal, and follows the lines of force into the body of the magnet
itself. His conclusion is that there exists lines of force within the
magnet of the same nature as those without. What is more, they are
exactly equal in amount to those without. They have a relation in
direction to those without; and in fact are continuations of them.
. . . “ Every line of force, therefore, at whatever distance it may be
taken from the magnet, must be considered as a closed circuit, passing
in some part of its course through the magnet, and having an equal
amount of force in every part of its course.”
     All the results here described were obtained with moving metals.
“ But,” he continues with profound sagacity, “ mere motion would not
generate a relation, which had not a foundation in the existence of
some previous state; and therefore the quiescent metals must be in
some relation to the active centre of force,” that is to the magnet. He
    * In this form the experiment is identical with one made twenty years earlier.

here touches the core of the whole question, and when we can state
the condition into which the conducting wire is thrown before it is
moved, we shall then be in a position to understand the physical
constitution of the electric current generated by‘ its motion.
     In this inquiry Faraday worked with steel magnets, the force of
which varies with the distance from the magnet. He then sought a
umform <U+FB01>eld of magnetic force, and found it in space as affected by
the magnetism of the earth. His next memoir, sent to the Royal
Society on the 31st of December, 1851, is “ On the employment of the
Induced Magneto-electro Current as a test and measure of magnetic
forces.” He forms rectangles and rings, and by ingenious and simple
devices collects the opposed currents which are developed in them by
rotation across the terrestrial lines of magnetic force. He varies the
shapes of his rectangles while preserving their areas constant, and
<U+FB01>nds that the constant area produces always the same amount of cur
rent per revolution. The current depends solely on the number of
lines of force intersected, and when this number is kept constant the
current remains constant too. Thus the lines of magnetic force are
continually before his eyes, by their aid he colligates his facts, and
through the inspirations derived from them he vastly expands the
boundaries of our experimental knowledge. The beauty and exacti
tude of the results of this investigation are extraordinary. I cannot
help thinking while I dwell upon them that this discovery of mag
neto-electricity is the greatest experimental result ever obtained by -
an investigator. It is the Mont Blanc of Faraday’s own achieve
ments. He always worked at great elevations, but a higher than this
he never subsequently attained.
Unity and C'onvertibr'lity of Natural Forces: Theory of the Electric Current.
    The terms unity and convertibility, as applied to natural forces,
are often employed in these investigations, many profound and
beautiful thoughts respecting these subjects being expressed in Fara
day’s memoirs. Modern inquiry has however much augmented our
knowledge of the relationship of natural forces, and it seems worth
while to say a few words here, tending to clear up certain miscon
ceptions which appear to exist among philosophic writers regarding
this relationship.
   The whole stock of energy or working-power in the World consists of
attractions, repulsions, and motions.    If the attractions and repulsions
are so circumstanced as to be able to produce motion, they are sources
of working-power, but not otherwise. Let us for the sake of simplicity
con<U+FB01>ne our attention to the case of attraction. The attraction exerted
between‘ the earth and a body at a distance from the earth’s surface is
a source of working-power; because the body can be moved by the
attraction, and in falling to the earth can perform work. When it
rests upon the earth’s surface it is not a source of power or energy,

 1868.]                 on Faraday as a Discoverer.                   257
 because it can fall no further. But though it has ceased to be a
 source of energy, the attraction of gravity still acts as a force, which
 holds the earth and weight together.
     The same remarks apply to attracting atoms and molecules. As
 long as distance separates them, they can move across it in obedience
 to the attraction, and the motion thus produced may, by proper appli
 ances, be caused to perform mechanical work. When, for example,
 two atoms of hydrogen unite with one of oxygen, to form water,
 the atoms are <U+FB01>rst drawn towards each other-they move, they clash,
 and then by virtue of their resiliency, they recoil and quiver. To
 this quivering motion we give the name of heat. Now this quiver
 ing motion is merely the redistribution of the motion produced by
 the chemical a<U+FB01>inity; and. this is the only sense in which chemical
affinity can be said to be converted into heat. We must not imagine
the chemical attraction destroyed, or converted into anything else.
For the atoms when mutually clasped to form a molecule of Water,
are held together by the very attraction which <U+FB01>rst drew them towards
each other. That which has really been expended is the pull exerted
through the space by which the distance between the atoms has been
diminished.
     If this be understood it will be at once seen that gravity may
in this sense be said to be convertible into heat; that it is in reality
no more an outstanding and inconvertible agent, as it is sometimes
stated to be, than chemical a<U+FB01>inity. By the exertion of a certain
pull through a certain space a body is caused to clash with a certain
de<U+FB01>nite velocity against the earth. Heat is thereby developed, and
this is the only sense in which gravity can be said to be converted
into heat. ‘In no case is the force which produces the motion annihi
lated or changed into anything else. The mutual attraction of the
earth and weight exists when they are in contact as when they were
separate; but the ability of that attraction to employ itself in the
production of motion does not exist.
     The transformation, in this case, is easily followed by the mind’s
eye. First, the weight as a whole is set in motion by the attraction
of gravity. This motion of the mass is arrested by collision with
the earth, being broken up into molecular tremors, to which we give
the name of heat.
     And when we reverse the process, and employ those tremors of heat
to raise a weight, as is done through the intermediation of an elastic
<U+FB02>uid in the steam-engine, a certain de<U+FB01>nite portion of the molecular
motion is destroyed in raising the weight. In this sense, and this
sense only, can the heat be said to be converted into gravity, or more
correctly, into potential energy of gravity. It is not that the destruc
tion of the heat has created any new attraction, but simply that the
old attraction has now a power conferred upon it, of exerting a certain
de<U+FB01>nite pull in the interval between the starting-point of the falling
weight and its collision with the earth.
     So also as regards magnetic attraction: when a sphere of iron

placed at some distance from a magnet rushes towards the magnet,
and has its motion stopped by collision, an effect mechanically the
same as that produced by the attraction of gravity occurs. The mag
netic attraction generates the motion of the mass, and the stoppage
of that motion produces heat.      In this sense, and in this sense only,
is there a transformation of magnetic work into heat. And if by the
mechanical action of heat brought to bear by means of a suitable
machine, the sphere be torn from the magnet and again placed at a
distance, a power of exerting a pull through that distance, and pro
ducing a new motion of the sphere, is thereby conferred upon the
magnet; in this sense, and in this sense only, is the heat converted
into magnetic potential energy.        ‘
      When, therefore, writers on the conservation of energy speak of
tensions being “ consumed ” and “ generated,” they do not mean thereby
 that old attractions have been annihilated and new ones brought into
 existence, but that, in the one case, the power of the attraction to
 produce motion has been diminished by the shortening of the dis
 tance between the attracting bodies, and that in the other case the
 power of producing motion has been augmented by the increase of
 the distance. These remarks apply to all bodies, whether they be
 sensible masses or molecules.
      Of the inner quality that enables matter to attract matter we
 know nothing; and the law of conservation makes no statement re
 garding that quality. It takes the facts of attraction as they stand,
 and a<U+FB01>rms only the constancy of working-power. That power may
 exist in the form of MOTION; or it may exist in the form of FORCE,
 with distance to act through. The former is dynamic energy, the latter
 is potential energy, the constancy of the sum of both being affirmed
 by the law of conservation. The convertibility of natural forces con
  sists solely in transformations of dynamic into potential, and of
 potential into dynamic energy, which are incessantly going on. In
 no other sense has the convertibility of force, at present, any scienti<U+FB01>c
  meaning.
       By the contraction of a muscle a man lifts a weight from the earth.
  But the muscle can contract only through the oxidation of its own
  tissue or of the blood passing through it. Molecular motion is thus
  converted into mechanical motion. Supposing the muscle to contract
  without raising the weight, oxidation would also occur, but the whole
  of the heat produced by this oxidation would be liberated in the muscle
  itself: Not so when it performs external work; to do that work a
  certain de<U+FB01>nite portion of the heat of oxidation must be expended.
  It is so expended in pulling the weight away from the earth. If the
  weight be permitted to fall, the heat generated by its collision with
  the earth would exactly make up for that lacking in the muscle during
  the lifting of the weight. In the case here supposed, we have a con
  version of molecular muscular action into potential energy of gravity;
  and a conversion of that potential energy into heat; the heat, how
   ever, appearing at a distance from its real origin in the muscle. The

  1868.]                 on Faraday as a Discoverer.                    259
 whole process consists of a transference of molecular motion from the
 muscle to the weight, and gravitating force is the mere go-between, by
 means of which the transference is effected.
       These considerations will help to clear our way to the conception
 of the transformations which occur when a Wire is moved across the
 lines of force in a magnetic <U+FB01>eld. In this case it is commonly said We
 have a conversion of magnetism into electricity. But let us endeavour
 to understand what really occurs. For the sake of simplicity, and
 with a view to its translation into a different one subsequently, let us
 adopt for a moment the provisional conception of a mixed <U+FB02>uid in the
 wire, composed of positive and negative electricities in equal quantities
 and therefore perfectly neutralizing each other when the wire is still.
 By the motion of the wire, say with the hand, towards the magnet,
 what the Germans call a Scheidungs-Kraft-a separating force—is
 brought into play. This force tears the mixed <U+FB02>uids asunder, and
 drives them in two currents, the one positive and the other negative,
 in two opposite directions through the wire. The presence of these
 currents evokes a force of repulsion between the magnet and the wire;
 and to cause the one to approach the other, this repulsion must be
overcome. The overcoming of this repulsion is, in fact, the work
 done in separating and impelling the two electricities. When the
wire is moved away from the magnet, a Scheidungs-Kraft, or sepa
rating force, also comes into play ; but now it is an afiraction that has
to be surmounted. In surmounting it, currents are developed in
directions opposed to the former ; positive takes the place of negative,
and negative the place of positive; the overcoming of the attraction
being the work done in separating and impelling the two electricities.

again attracted. In this case muscular force is expended during
the act of separation; but the attraction of the magnet effects the
reunion.     In the case of the moving wire, also we overcame a re
sistance in separating it from the magnet, and thus far the action
is mechanically the same as the separation of the sphere of iron.
But after the wire has ceased moving, the attraction ceases; and so
far from any action occurring similar to that, which draws the iron
sphere back to the magnet, we have to overcome a repulsion to bring
them together.
     There is no potential energy conferred either by the removal or by
the approach of the wire, and the only power really transformed or
converted, in the experiment, is muscular power. Nothing that could
in strictness be called a conversion of magnetism into electricity
occurs. The muscular oxidation that moves the wire fails to produce
within the muscle its due amount of heat, a portion of that heat equiva
lent to the resistance overcome, appearing in the moving wire instead.
     Is this effect an attraction and a repulsion at a distance? If so,
why should both cease when the wire ceases to move? In fact, the
deportment of the wire resembles far more that of a body moving in
     '                                                         u 2

   the motion is suspended. Let us imagine the case of a liquid so
   mobile that the hand may be passed through it to and fro, without
   encountering any sensible resistance. It resembles the motion of a
   conductor in the unexcited <U+FB01>eld of an electro-magnetf Now let us
   suppose a body placed in the liquid, or acting on it, which confers
   upon it the property of viscosity; the hand would no longer move
   freely. During its motion, but then only, resistance would be encoun
   tered and overcome. Here we have rudely represented the case of
   the excited magnetic <U+FB01>eld, and the result in both cases would be sub
   stantially the same. In both cases heat would, in the end, be generated
  outside of the muscle, its amount being exactly equivalent. to the
  resistance overcome.
       Let us push the analogy a little further; suppose in the case
  of the <U+FB02>uid rendered viscous, as assumed a moment ago, the viscosity
  not to be so great as to prevent the formation of ripples when the
  hand is passed through the liquid. Then the motion of the hand,
, before its <U+FB01>nal conversion into heat, would exist for a time as wave
  motion, which on subsiding would generate its due equivalent of heat.
   This intermediate stage, in the case of our moving wire, is repre
   sented by the period during which the electric current is <U+FB02>owing through
  it; but that current, like the ripples of our liquid, soon subsides,
  being, like them, converted into heat.
       Do these words shadow forth anything like the reality? Such
  speculations cannot be injurious if they are enunciated without dog
  matism. I do confess that ideas such as these here indicated exercise
  a strong fascination on my mind. Is then the magnetic <U+FB01>eld really
  viscous, and if so, what substance exists in it and the wire to produce
  the viscosity? Let us <U+FB01>rst look at the proved e<U+FB01>'ects, and afterwards
  turn our thoughts back upon their cause. When the wire approaches
  the magnet, an action is evoked within it, which travels through it
  with a velocity comparable to that of light. One substance only in
  the universe has been hitherto proved competent to transmit power
  at this velocity; the luminiferous ether. Not only its rapidity of
  progression but its ability to produce the motion of light and heat,
  indicates that the electric current is also motion.* Further, there is
  a striking resemblance between the action of good and bad conductors
  as regards electricity, and the action of diathermanous and adiather
  manous bodies as regards radiant heat. The good conductor is
  diathermanous to the electric current; it allows free transmission
  without the development of heat. The bad conductor is adiather
  manous to the electric current, and hence the passage of the latter is
  accompanied by the development of heat. I am strongly inclined to
  hold the electric current, pure and simple, to be a motion of the ether
      * Mr. Clerk Maxwell has recently published an exceedingly important
  investigation connected with this question. Even in the non-mathematical por
  tions of the memoirs of Mr. Maxwell, the admirable spirit of his philosophy is
  su<U+FB01>iciently revealed. As regards the employment of scienti<U+FB01>c imagery, I
  hardly know his equal in power of conception and clearness of de<U+FB01>nition.

  propagated through their ether without sensible transfer to their atoms,
  while in the case of bad conductors this transfer is e<U+FB02>'ected, the trans

        I do not know whether Faraday would have subscribed to what is
  here written; probably his habitual caution would have prevented him
. from committing himself to anything so de<U+FB01>nite. But some such idea
  <U+FB01>lled his mind and coloured his language through all the later years
  of his life. I dare not say that he has been always successful in
  the treatment of these theoretic notions. In his speculations he mixes
  together light and darkness in varying proportions, and carries us
  along with him through strong alternations of both. It is impossible
  to say how a certain amount of mathematical training would have
  affected his work. We cannot say what its in<U+FB02>uence would have been
  upon that force of inspiration that urged him on ; whether it would
  have daunted him, and prevented him from driving his adits into
  places, where no theory pointed to a lode. If so, then we may rejoice

  Faraday’s purely speculative writings often lack that precision which
  the mathematical habit of thought confers. Still across them <U+FB02>ash
  frequent gleams of prescient wisdom which will excite admiration
  throughout all time, while the facts, relations, principles, and laws
  which his experiments have established are sure to form the body of
  grand theories yet to come.
                                   SUMMARY.
        When from an Alpine height the eye of the climber ranges over
  the mountains, he <U+FB01>nds that for the most part they resolve them
  selves into distinct groups, each consisting of a dominant mass
  surrounded by peaks of lesser elevation. The power which lifted the
  mightier eminences, in nearly all cases lifted others to an almost equal
  height. And so it is with the discoveries of Faraday. As a general
  rule, the dominant result does not stand alone, but forms the culmi
  nating point of a vast and varied mass of inquiry. In this way, round
  about his great discovery of Magneto-electric Induction, other weighty
  labours group themselves. His investigations on the Extra Current;
  on the Polar and other Condition of Diamagnetic Bodies; on Lines
  of Magnetic Force, their de<U+FB01>nite character and distribution; on the
  employment of the Induced Magneto-electric Current as a measure
  and test of Magnetic Action; on the Revulsive Phenomena of the
       * One important di<U+FB01>‘erence, of course, exists between the effect of motion in
  the magnetic <U+FB01>eld, and motion in a resisting medium. In the former case the
  heat is generated in the moving conductor, in the latter it is in part generated in
   the medium.

magnetic <U+FB01>eld, are all, notwithstanding the diversity of title, researches
in the domain of magneto-electric induction.
    Faraday’s second group of researches and discoveries embrace
the chemical phenomena of the current. The dominant result here
is the great law of de<U+FB01>nite Electro~chemical Decomposition, around
which are massed various researches on Electro-chemical Conduc
tion, and on Electrolysis both with the Machine and with the Pile.
To this group also belong his analysis of the Contact Theory, his
inquiries as to the Source of Voltaic Electricity, and his <U+FB01>nal develop
ment of the Chemical Theory of the pile.
    His third great discovery is the Magnetization of Light, which I
should liken to the Weisshorn among mountains—high, beautiful, and
alone.
    The dominant result of his fourth group of researches is the dis
covery of Diamagnetism, announced in his memoir as the Magnetic
Condition of all Matter, round which are grouped his inquiries on the
Magnetism of Flame and Gases; on Magne-crystallic action, and on
Atmospheric Magnetism, in its relations to the annual and diurnal
variation of the needle, the full signi<U+FB01>cance of which is still to be
shown.
    These are Faraday’s most massive discoveries, and upon them his
fame must mainly rest. But even without them, sufficient would
remain to secure for him a high and lasting scienti<U+FB01>c reputation. We
should still have his researches on the Liquefaction of Gases; on
Frictional Electricity; on the Electricity of the Gymnotus; on the
source of power in the Hydro-electric machine, the two last investiga
tions being untouched in the foregoing memoir ; on Electro-magnetic
Rotations; on Regelation; all his more purely Chemical Researches,
including his discovery of Benzol. Besides these he published a
multitude of minor papers, most of which, in some way or other,
illustrate his genius. I have made no allusion to his power and
sweetness as a lecturer. Taking him for all in all, I think it will be
conceded that Michael Faraday was the greatest experimental philo
sopher the world has ever seen; and I will add the opinion, that the
progress of future research will tend not to dim or to diminish, but to
enhance and glorify the labours of this mighty investigator.
                     Innusrnarross or CHARACTER.
    Thus far I have con<U+FB01>ned myself to topics mainly interesting to
the man of science, endeavouring, however, to treat them in a manner
unropellent to the general reader who might wish to obtain a notion
of Faraday as a worker. On others will fall the duty of presenting to
the world a picture of the man. But I know you will permit me to
 add to the foregoing analysis a few personal reminiscences and re
 marks, tcnding to connect Faraday with a wider world than that of
 science—namcly, with the general human heart.

     One word in reference to his married life, in addition to what
 has been already said, may <U+FB01>nd a place here. As in the former case,
 Faraday shall be his own spokesman. The following paragraph,
though written in the third person, is from his hand :—“ On the 12th
of June, 1841, he married, an event which more than any other con
tributed to his earthly happiness and healthful state of mind. The
union has continued for twenty-eight years and has in no wise changed,
except in the depth and strength of its character.”
    Faraday’s immediate forefathers lived in a little place called Clap
ham Wood Hall, in Yorkshire. Here dwelt Robert Faraday and
Elizabeth his wife, who had ten children, one of them, James Faraday,
born in 1761, being father to the philosopher. A family tradition
exists that the Faradays came originally from Ireland. Faraday
himself has more than once expressed to me his belief that his blood
was in part Celtic, but how much of it was so, or when the infusion
took place, he was unable to say. He could imitate the Irish brogue,
and his wonderful vivacity may have been in part due to his extrac
tion. But there were other qualities which we should hardly think
of deriving from Ireland. The most prominent of these was his sense
of order, which ran like a luminous beam through all the transac
tions of his life. The most entangled and complicated matters fell
into harmony in his hands. His mode of keeping accounts excited the
admiration of the managing board of this Institution. And his science
was similarly ordered. In his Experimental Researches, he numbered
every paragraph, and welded their various parts together by incessant
reference. , His private notes of the Experimental Researches, which
are happily preserved, are similarly numbered: their last paragraph
bears the <U+FB01>gure 16,041. His working qualities, moreover, showed
the tenacity of the Teuton. His nature was impulsive, but there was
a force behind the impulse which did not permit it to retreat. If in
his warm moments he formed a resolution, in his cool ones he made
that resolution good. Thus his <U+FB01>re was that of a solid combustible,
not that of a gas, which blazes suddenly, and dies as suddenly away.
    And here I must claim your tolerance for the limits by which I am
con<U+FB01>ned. No materials for a life of Faraday are in my hands, and
what I have now to say, has arisen almost wholly out of our close
personal relationship.
    Letters of his, covering a period of sixteen years, are before me,
each one of which contains some characteristic utterance ;-—strong, yet
delicate in counsel, joyful in encouragement, and warm in a<U+FB02>‘ection.
References which would be pleasantto such of them as still live are
made to Humboldt, Biot, Dumas, Chevreul, Magnus, and Arago. Acci
dent brought these names prominently forward; but many others would
be required to complete his list of continental friends. He prized the
love and sympathy of men—prized it almost more than the renown
which his science brought him. Nearly a dozen years ago it fell to
my lot to write a review of his “Experimental Researches” for the
‘ Philosophical Magazine.’   After he had read it, he took me by the

  ‘l 64                        Professor Tyndall                             [J
   hand, and said, "Tyndall, the sweetest reward of my work is the
   sympathy and goodwill which it has caused to <U+FB02>ow in upon me from
   all quarters of the world.” Among his letters I <U+FB01>nd little sparks of
   kindness, precious to no one but myself, but more precious to me than
   all. He would peep into the laboratory when he thought me weary,
   and take me upstairs with him to rest. And if I happened to be
   absent he would leave a little note for me, couched in this or some
   other similar form :—“ Dear Tyndall,—I was looking for you, because
   we were at tea—we have not yet done—will you come up ?” I frequently
   shared his early dinner; almost always, in fact, while my lectures
   were going on. There was no trace of asceticism in his nature. He
   preferred the meat and wine of life to its locusts and wild honey. Never
   once during an intimacy of <U+FB01>fteen years did he mention religion to me,
   save when I drew him on to the subject. He then spoke to me with
   out hesitation or reluctance; not with any apparent desire to
   “improve the occasion,” but to give me such information as I sought.
   He believed the human heart to be swayed by a power to which science
   or logic opened no approach, and right or wrong, this faith, held in
   perfect tolerance of the faiths of others, strengthened and beauti<U+FB01>ed
   his life.
        From the letters just referred to, I will select three for publication
   here. I choose the <U+FB01>rst, because it contains a passage revealing the
   feelings with which Faraday regarded his vocation, and also because
   it contains an allusion which will give pleasure to a friend.

        The contemplation of Nature, and his own relation to her, produced
   in Faraday a kind of spiritual exaltation which makes itself manifest
   here. ‘His religious feeling and his philosophy could not be kept
  apart; there was an habitual over<U+FB02>ow of the one into the other.

     Whether he or another was its exponent, he appeared to take
equal delight in science. A good experiment would make him
almost dance with delight. In November, 1850, he wrote to me
thus :—-“ I hope some day to take up the point respecting the mag
netism of associated particles. In the mean time I rejoice at every
addition to the facts and reasoning connected with the subject.
When science is a republic, then it gains; and though I am no
republican in other matters, I am in that.” All his letters illustrate
this catholicity of feeling. Ten years ago, when going- down to
Brighton, he carried with him a little paper I had just completed,
and afterwards wrote to me. His letter is a mere sample of the
sympathy which he always showed to me and my work.

    The third letter will come in its proper place towards the end.
    While once conversing with Faraday on science in its relations to
commerce and litigation, he said to me, that at a certain period of his
career, he was forced de<U+FB01>nitely to ask himself, and <U+FB01>nally to decide,
whether he should make wealth or science the pursuit of his life. He
could not serve both masters, and he was therefore compelled to choose
between them. After the discovery of magneto-electricity his' fame
was so noised abroad, that the commercial world would hardly have
considered any remuneration too high for the aid of abilities like
his. Even before he became so famous, he had done a little “pro
fessional business.” This was the phrase he applied to his purely
commercial work. His friend, Richard Phillips, for example, had in
duced him to undertake a number of analyses, which produced, in the
year 1830, an addition to his income of more than a thousand pounds;
and in 1831, a still greater addition. He had only to will it to raise
in 1832 his professional business income to £5000 a year. Indeed,
this is a wholly insu<U+FB02>icient estimate of what he might, with ease, have
realized annually during the last thirty years of his life.
    While re-studying the Experimental Researches with reference
to the present memoir, the conversation with Faraday here alluded to,
came to my recollection, and I sought to ascertain the period when
the question, “ wealth or science,” had presented itself with such em

266                        Professor Tyndall                     [Jam
phasis to his mind. I <U+FB01>xed upon the year 1831 or 1832, for it seemed
beyond the range of human power to pursue science as he had done
during the subsequent years, and to pursue commercial work at
the same time. To test this conclusion I asked permission to see his
accounts, and on my own responsibility, I will state the result. In
1832, his professional business-income, instead of rising to £5000,
or more, fell from £1090 48. to £155 98. From this it fell with
slight oscillations to £92 in 1837, and to zero in 1838. Between
1839 and 1845, it never, except in one instance, exceeded £22 ; being
for the most part much under this. The exceptional year referred
to was that in which he and Sir Charles Lyell were engaged by
Government to write a report on the Haswell Colliery explosion, and
then his business-income rose to £112. From the end of 1845 to
the day of his death, Faraday’s annual professional business-income
was exactly zero. Taking the duration of his life into account, this
son of a blacksmith, and apprentice to a bookbinder, had to decide
between a fortune of £150,000 on the one side, and his undowered
science on the other. He chose the latter, and died a poor man.
But his was the glory of holding aloft among the nations the scienti<U+FB01>c
fame of England for a period of forty years.
   i The outward and visible signs of fame were also of less account
to him than to most men. He had been loaded with scienti<U+FB01>c honours
from all parts of the world. Without, I imagine, a dissentient voice,
he was regarded as the prince of the physical investigators of the
present age. The highest scienti<U+FB01>c position in this country he had,
however, never <U+FB01>lled.    When the late excellent and lamented Lord
Wrottesley resigned the presidency of the Royal Society, a deputa
tion from the council, consisting of his lordship, Mr. Grove, and
Mr. Gassiot, waited upon Faraday, to urge him to accept the presi
dent’s chair. All that argument or friendly persuasion could do was
done to induce him to yield to the wishes of the council, which
was also the unanimous wish of scienti<U+FB01>c men. A knowledge of
the quickness of his own nature had induced in Faraday the habit
of requiring an interval of re<U+FB02>ection, before he decided upon any
question of importance. In the present instance he followed his
usual habit, and begged for a little time. On the following morning
I went up to his room, and said on entering, that I had come to
him with some anxiety of mind. He demanded its cause, and I
responded, “Lest you should have decided against the wishes of the
deputation that waited on you yesterday.” “You would not urge
me to undertake this responsibility,” he said. “I not only urge
you,” was my reply, “but I consider it your bounden duty to accept
it.” He spoke of the labour that it would involve; urged that it
was not in his nature to take things easy; and that if he became
president, he would surely have to stir many new questions, and
agitate for some changes. I said that in such cases he would <U+FB01>nd
himself supported by the youth and strength of the Royal Society.
This, however, did not seem to satisfy him. Mrs. Faraday came

  1868.]                 on Faraday as a Discoverer.                   267
  into the room, and he appealed to her. Her ‘decision was adverse,
  and I deprecated her decision. “Tyndall,” he said at length, “I
  must remain plain Michael Faraday to the last; and let me now tell
  you, that if I accepted the honour which the Royal Society desires to
  confer upon me, I would not answer for the integrity of my intellect
  for a single year.” I urged him no more, and Lord Wrottesley had
  a most worthy successor in Sir Benjamin Brodie.
      After the death of the Duke of Northumberland, our Board of
  Managers wished to see Mr. Faraday <U+FB01>nish his career as President of
  the Institution, which he had entered on weekly wages more than
  half a century before. But he would have nothing to do with the
  presidency. He wished for rest, and the reverent affection of his
  friends was to him in<U+FB01>nitely more precious than all the honours of
  o<U+FB01>'lcial life.
       The <U+FB01>rst requisite of the intellectual life of Faraday was the inde
  pendence of his mind; and though prompt to urge obedience where
  obedience was due, with every right assertion of manhood he intensely
  sympathised. Even rashness on the side of honour found from him
  ready forgiveness, if not open applause. The wisdom of years, tempered
  by a character of this kind, rendered his counsel peculiarly precious to
  men sensitive like himself. I often sought that counsel, and, with
  your permission, will illustrate its character by one or two typical
  instances.
       In 1855, I was appointed examiner under the Council for Military
  Education. At that time, as indeed now, I entertained strong con
  victions as to the enormous utility of physical science to officers of
  artillery and engineers, and whenever opportunity offered, I expressed
  this conviction without reserve. I did not think the recognition,
  though considerable, accorded to physical science in those examinations,
  at all proportionate to its importance; and this probably rendered me
  more jealous than I otherwise should have been of its claims.
       In Trinity College, Dublin, a school had been organized with
  reference to the Woolwich examinations, and a large number of
  exceedingly well instructed young gentlemen were sent over from
  Dublin, to compete for appointments in the artillery and engineers.
' The result of one examination was particularly satisfactory to me;
  indeed the marks obtained appeared so eloquent, that I forbore saying
  a word about them. My colleagua, however, followed the usual
  custom of sending in brief reports with their returns of marks. After
  the results were published, a leading article appeared in ‘ The Times,’
  in which the reports were largely quoted; praise being bestowed on
  all the candidates, except the excellent young fellows who had passed
  through my hands.
       A letter from Trinity College drew my attention to this article,
  bitterly complaining, that whereas the marks proved them to be the
  best of all, the science candidates were wholly ignored. I tried to
  set matters right by publishing, on my own responsibility, a letter
  in ‘The Times.’ The act I-knew could not bear justi<U+FB01>cation from

  26 3                        Professor Tyndall                       [Jan.
' the War O<U+FB01>'ice point of view; and I expected and risked the dis
  pleasure of my superiors. The merited reprimand promptly came.
  “Highly as the Secretary of State for War might value the expression
  of Professor Tyndall’s opinion, he begged to say that an examiner
  appointed by His Royal Highness the Commander-in-Chief had no
  right to appear in the public papers as Professor Tyndall has done,
  without the sanction of the War O<U+FB02>ice.” Nothing could be more
  just than this reproof, but I did not like to rest under it. I wrote a
  reply, and previous to sending it, took it up to Faraday. We sat
  together before his <U+FB01>re, and he looked very earnest, as he rubbed
  his hands and pondered. The following conversation then passed
  between us :—
       F. You certainly have received a reprimand, Tyndall; but the
  matter is over, and if you wish to accept the reproof, you will hear
  no more about it.
       T. But I do not wish to accept it.
       F. Then you know what the consequence of sending that letter
  will be?
       T. I do.
       F. They will dismiss you.
       T. I know it.
       F. Then send the letter!
       The letter was <U+FB01>rm, but respectful; it acknowledged, the justice
  of the censure, but expressed neither repentance nor regret. Faraday,
  in his gracious way, slightly altered a sentence or two to make it more
  respectful still. It was duly sent, and on the following day I entered
  the Institution with the conviction that my dismissal was there before
  me. Weeks, however, passed. At length the well-known envelope
  appeared, and I broke the seal, not doubting the contents. They were
  very different from what I expected. “ The Secretary of State for
  War has received Professor Tyndall’s letter, and deems the explana
  tion therein given perfectly satisfactory.” I have often wished for an
  opportunity of publicly acknowledging this liberal treatment, proving,
  as it did; that Lord Panmure could discern and make allowance for a
  good intention, though it involved an offence against routine. For
  many years subsequently it was my privilege to act under that excel
  lent body, the Council for Military Education.
       On another occasion of thi!‘ kind, having encouraged me in a
  somewhat hardy resolution I had formed, Faraday backed his encou
  ragement by an illustration drawn from his own life. The subject‘
  will interest you, and it is so sure to be talked about in the world,
  that no avoidable harm can arise from its introduction here.
      In the year 1835, Sir Robert Peel wished to Offer Faraday a pension,
  but that great statesman quitted of<U+FB01>ce before he was able to realize his
  wish. The Minister who founded these pensions intended them, I
  believe, to be marks of honour, which even proud men might accept
  without compromise of independence. ‘ When, however, the intimation
  <U+FB01>rst reached Faraday, in an uno<U+FB02>icial way, he wrote a letter announcing

1868.]                  on Faraday a: a Discoverer.                   269
his determination to decline the pension; and stating that he was quite
competent to earn his livelihood himself. That letter still exists, but
it was never sent, Faraday’s repugnance having been overruled by his
friends.    When Lord Melbourne came into office, he desired to see
Faraday; and probably in utter ignorance of the man—for, unhappily
for them and us, Ministers of State in England are only too often
ignorant of great Englishmen—his lordship said something that must
have deeply displeased his visitor. The whole circumstances were
once communicated to me, but I have forgotten the details. The
term “ humbug,” I think, was incautiously employed by his lordship,
and other expressions were used of a similar kind. Faraday quitted
the Minister with his own resolves, and that evening he left his card
and a short and decisive note at the residence of Lord Melbourne,
stating that he had manifestly mistaken his lordship’s intention of
honouring science in his person, and declining to have anything
whatever to do with the proposed pension. The good-humoured
nobleman at <U+FB01>rst considered the matter a capital joke; but he was
afterwards led to look at it more seriously. An excellent lady, who
was a friend both to Faraday and the Minister, tried to arrange
matters between them; but she found Faraday very di<U+FB02>icult to move
from the position he had assumed. After many fruitless e<U+FB02>'orts, she
at length begged of him to state what he would require of Lord Mel
bourne to induce him to change his mind. He replied, “I should
require from his lordship what I have no right or reason to expect that
he would grant :—a written apology for the words he permitted him
self toI use
able,        to me.”
         thought, alikeThe
                        to the

                                                   the philosopher.
     Considering the enormous strain imposed on Faraday’s intellect,
the boy-like buoyancy even of his later years was astonishing. He
was often prostrate, but he had immense resiliency, which he brought
into action by getting away from London whenever his health failed. I
have already indicated the thoughts which <U+FB01>lled his mind during the
evening of his life. He brooded on magnetic media and lines of
force; and the great object of the last investigation he ever undertook
was the decision of the question whether magnetic force requires time
for its propagation. How he proposed to attack this subject we may
never know. But he has left some beautiful apparatus behind ; deli
cate wheels and pinions, and associated mirrors, which were to have
been employed in the investigation. The more conception of such an
inquiry is an illustration of his strength and hopefulness, and it is
impossible to say to what results it might have led him. But the
work was too heavy for his tired brain'. It was long before he could
bring himself to relinquish it, and during this struggle he often suf
 fered from fatigue of mind. It was at this period, and before he
resigned himself to the repose which marked the last two years of his
 life, that he wrote to me the following letter,—-one of many priceless
 letters now before me,—which reveals more than anything another
 pen could express, the state of his mind at the time. I was ‘some

times censured in his presence for my doings in the Alps, but his
constant reply was, “let him alone, he knows how to take care of
himself.” In this letter, anxiety on this score reveals itself, for the
<U+FB01>rst time.
                                        “ HAMPTON Goun'r, 1st Aug., 1864.
“MY Dam TYNDALL,
    “ I do not know whether my letter will catch you, but I will risk it
though feeling very un<U+FB01>t to communicate with a man whose life is as vivid
and active as yours; but the receipt of your kind letter makes me to know
that though I forget, I am not forgotten, and though I am not able to remem
ber at the end of a line what was said at the beginning of it, the imperfect
marks will convey to you some sense of what I long to say. We had heard of
your illness through Miss Moore, and I was therefore very glad to learn that
you are now quite well ; do not run too many risks, or make your happiness
depend too much upon dangers, or the hunting of them. Sometimes the very
thinking of you and what you may be about wearies me with fears, and then
the cogitations pause and change, but without giving me rest. I know that
much of this depends upon my own worn-out nature, and I do not know why
I write it, save that when I write to you I cannot help thinking it, and the
thoughts stand in the way of other matter.

     This weariness subsided when he relinquished his work, and I
have a cheerful letter from him, written in the autumn of 1865.
But towards the close of that year he had an attack of illness, from
which he never completely rallied. He continued to attend the Friday
Evening Meetings, but the advance of in<U+FB01>rmity was apparent to us
all. Complete rest became <U+FB01>nally essential to him, and he ceased to
appear amongst us. There was no pain in his decline to trouble the
memory of those who loved him. Slowly and peacefully he sank
towards his <U+FB01>nal rest, and when it came, his death was a falling asleep.
In the fulness of his honours and of his age he quitted us; the good
<U+FB01>ght fought, the work of duty——shall I not say of glory-done.
The “Jane” referred to in the. foregoing letter is Faraday’s niece,
Miss Jane Barnard, who with an affection raised almost to religious
devotion, watched him and tended him to the end.
     I saw Mr. Faraday for the <U+FB01>rst time on my return from Marburg
in 1850. I came to the Royal Institution, and sent up my card
with a copy of the paper which Knoblauch and myself had just com
pleted. He came down and conversed with me for half-an-hour. I
could not fail to remark the wonderful play of intellect and kindly
feeling exhibited by his countenance. When he was in good health
the question of his age would never occur to you. In the light and
laughter of his eyes you never thought of his gray hairs. He was

1868.]                 on Faraday as a Discoverer.                   271
then on the point of publishing one of his papers on magnelcrystallic
action, and he had time to refer in a <U+FB02>attering note to the memoir I
placed in his hands.    I returned to Germany, worked there for nearly
another year, and in June, 1851, came back <U+FB01>nally from Berlin to
England. Then, for the <U+FB01>rst time, and on my way to the meeting of
the British Association, at Ipswich, I met a man who has since
made his mark upon the intellect of his time, who has long been, and
who by the strong law of natural a<U+FB02>inity must continue to be a
brother to me. We were both without de<U+FB01>nite outlook at the time,
needing proper work, and only anxious to have it to perform. The
chairs of Natural History and of Physics being advertised as
vacant in the University of Toronto, we applied for them, he for
the one, I for the other; but, possibly guided by a prophetic instinct,
the University authorities declined having anything to do with either
of us. If I remember aright, we were equally unlucky elsewhere.
     One of Faraday’s earliest letters to me had reference to this
Toronto business, which he thought it unwise in me to neglect. But
Toronto had its own notions, and in 1853, at the instance of Dr. Bence
Jones, and on the recommendation of Faraday himself, a chair of
physics at the Royal Institution was o<U+FB01>'ered to me. I was tempted at
the same time to go elsewhere, but a strong attraction drew me to his
side. Let me say that it was mainly his and other friendships, precious
to me beyond all expression, that caused me to value my position here
more highly than any other that could be o<U+FB02>'ered to me in this land.
Nor is it for its honour, though surely that is great, but for the strong
personal ties that bind me to it, that I now chie<U+FB02>y prize this place. -
You might not credit me were I to tell you how lightly I value the
honour of being Faraday’s successor compared with the honour of
having been Faraday’s friend. His friendship was an energy and
inspiration; his “mantle” is a burden almost too heavy to be borne.
     Sometimes during the last year of his life, by the permission or
 invitation of Mrs. Faraday, I went up to his rooms to see him. The
 deep radiance, which in his time of strength <U+FB02>ashed with such extra
 ordinary power from his countenance, had subsided to a calm and
 kindly light, by which my latest memory of him is warmed and
 illuminated. I knelt one day beside him on the carpet and placed
 my‘ hand upon his knee, he stroked it affectionately, smiled, and
 murmured, in a low, soft voice, the last words that I remember as
 having been spoken to me by Michael Faraday.
     It was my wish and aspiration to play the part of Schiller to
 this Goethe ; and he was at times so strong and joyful,—his body
 so active, and his intellect so clear,—as to suggest to me the thought
 that he, like Goethe, would see the younger man laid low. Destiny
 ruled otherwise, and now he is but a memory to us all. Surely no
 memory could be more beautiful. He was equally rich in mind and
 heart. The fairest traits of a character sketched by Paul, found in
 him perfect illustration. For he was “blameless, vigilant, sober, of
good behaviour, apt to teach, not given to <U+FB01>lthy lucre.” He had not

  tact with the great. The life of his spirit and of his intellect were
 so full, that the things which men most strive after were absolutely
indifferent to him. “Give me health and a day,” says the brave
 Emerson, “and I will make the pomp of emperors ridiculous.” In
an eminent degree Faraday could say the same. What to him was
the splendour of a palace compared with a thunderstorm upon Brighton
Downs ?— what among all the appliances of royalty to compare with
the setting sun? I refer to a thunderstorm and a sunset, because
.these things excited a kind of ecstasy in his mind, and to a mind
open to such ecstasy the pomps and pleasures of the world are usually
of small account. Nature, not education, rendered Faraday strong
and re<U+FB01>ned. A favourite experiment of his own was representative
of himself. He loved to show that water in crystallizing excluded
all foreign ingredients, however intimately they might be mixed with
it. Out of acids, alkalis, or saline solutions, the crystal came sweet
and pure. By some such natural process in the formation of this
man, beauty and nobleness coalesced, to the exclusion of everything
vulgar and low. He did not learn his gentleness in the world, for
he withdrew himself from its culture; and still this land of England
contained no truer gentleman than he. Not half his greatness was
incorporated in his science, for science could not reveal the bravery
and delicacy of his heart.

                        On Public School Education.
 So far from being half <U+FB01>nished, the real battle for educational reform
has hardly begun. Latin and Greek still continue to be the all but
 exclusive staple of our education, and though a classical training
 conducted on wise principles and with reasonable methods is of the
 highest value, yet the many and serious evils which our present system
of it involves have been resolutely ignored. The yoke of the Greek
and Latin languages has been made needlessly humiliating and need
lessly heavy: taken alone, it is doubtful whether they furnish the best
mental discipline for any, but certain that they do not furnish even a
good discipline for all; and they remain to this day entrenched behind
a mountain-heap of fallacies, of which no small number ought to have
been banished ignominiously to the region of the most exploded
errors.

of it is a complete and disastrous failure; and that it is so may be
largely demonstrated alike by the criticism of its enemies, and the
repeated confessions of its friends.    And if this be so, it is our clear
duty as Englishmen, as patriots, nay, even as mere honest men, to make
that system more worthy of its immense importance and of our national
prestige.
    It would be easy to adduee the testimony of many eminent scholars
to the humiliating ignorance on a multitude of subjects which has
been the inevitable result of years exclusively devoted to two dead
languages; but the case of the vast majority of boys who do not
become scholars in any sense of the word is still more to be deplored.
People read glowing estimates of Greek and Roman literature, and
take them for a defence of classical education. There could not be a
greater delusion. Hundreds of boys after years of expensive training
know far less, and have far less real culture, than their sisters who
have only had the modest aid of a single governess. They know
nothing, except perhaps the merest and most useless smattering of
    VoL. V. (No. 48.)                                              x

modern languages, of history, of mathematics, or of science; and if
they want to pass in a competitive examination they must be hastily
sent to some professional tutor to have their minds crammed for the
purpose like a hurriedly-packed portmanteau. The parent comforts
himself that their education has been purely literary ; but this purely
literary education has somehow left them with a bad handwriting, with
very vague notions of spelling, and with minds that can <U+FB01>nd satisfaction
in nothing higher than sensational novels. The parents take refuge in
the belief that at least their boys know Latin and Greek ; but this is
in<U+FB01>nitely far from being the case; of the vocabulary they possibly
know a little, but of the grammar less, and of the literature nothing at
all. It is certain that they will never open a Greek or Latin book
again; and for these paltry and miserable results they have all but
sacri<U+FB01>ced the happy seed-time during which so much might have been
accomplished. The evidence of these facts, evidence given by most
friendly witnesses, stands in the Commission Reports undisputed and
indisputable. It shows that for many a boy the years of school-life
are wasted. It is as though he stood in the midst of a boundless plain,
waving on every side with golden corn, in the midst of which, trained
to despise the sickle as vulgar, and the harvest as utilitarian, he had
been taught for years to occupy his time in plucking a few petals of
the scarlet poppies, which are crumpled as he gathers them, and which
grow rank and <U+FB02>accid even during the few moments that he holds them
in his hand.
     The question then is, not whether education is to be literary or
scienti<U+FB01>c, but whether it is to be scienti<U+FB01>c or m'l ; the struggle is not
between science and literature, but between something and nothing,
between science and nescience, between intellectual culture and its
almost total absence. It is a melancholy fact, but it is a fact, that at
present we struggle almost in vain against the two potent elements of
 intellectual progress—extravagant athleticism on the one hand, and
 promiscuous sensation-reading on the other, of which the one poisons
 and e<U+FB02>'eminates the mind, the other often tasks and overstrains the
 body ; the one absorbs the strenuous ambition which might have been
 devoted to nobler objects, the other wastes the inestimable leisure
 which might else have been rich in mental and moral bene<U+FB01>ts for
 our country and for mankind.
     What, then, is to be done ?   Some would say, “ substitute for your
 simulacrum of Greek and Latin, an education which, if less pretentious,
 shall at least be real and sound, in modern languages, in literature,
 and, above all, in science.” But it would be a great disaster if there
 were supposed to be any antagonism between science and litera
 ture; both are indispensable ; each of them is an absolutely essential
 factor in an education pretending to be liberal. Yet our present
 system is neither literary nor scienti<U+FB01>c, whereas it is perfectly certain
 that it might be both.
     If, however, schoolmasters assert and assume that a boy cannot
 be taught both literature and science, and if by literature we are to

1868.]                 on Public School Education.                   275
understand Latin and Greek, then, while entirely disputing the asser
tion, our choice would be clear to abandon Latin and Greek altogether
for English, for modern languages, and for science. But an education
may be literary, in a very high sense of the word, Without embracing
the two dead languages; and many a boy would know far more of
literature than he has now any opportunity of doing, if he con<U+FB01>ned
himself to the magni<U+FB01>cent poetry and unsurpassable eloquence which
he may <U+FB01>nd in large abundance in the neglected treasure-house of our
great English authors.
    Such a training would be more useful than any which a boy now
receives in Greek and Latin. There is an absurd prevalence of the
“ worship of inutility.” If it be assumed—and it is a very question
able assumption-that it is mainly by words that we learn things, even
then we should be inexcusable for wasting six or seven long precious
years in not learning Greek and Latin. Many great linguists have
added nothing to human knowledge, and the Greeks, our vaunted
models of style and insight, knew no word of any language but their
own, and were absolutely unacquainted with the terms and principles
of their own grammar. Yet, were they illiterate ‘P They knew little
of words, but they made up for it by thoughtwby that power of deep
re<U+FB02>ection which makes facts luminous with meaning——by that earnest
concentration of resolute attention on which have dawned some of
the most splendid daybreaks of human discovery.
    And, it were necessary to make a choice between a classical and
a scienti<U+FB01>c training, there are many obvious reasons for regarding the
latter as the more natural, the better, and the happier of the two. The
reason why people doubt it now, is because the majority are so pro
foundly ignorant of what science is, and what a training in science
really implies. But no such exclusive choice is necessary. We ought
to teach both literature and science; and to do so is perfectly possible,
though not perhaps with our present programmes, our present methods,
or possibly even with our present teachers. No system ought to be
regarded as intellectually satisfactory which does not produce the
following results :—That every boy of average ability leaving school
at 18 or 19 should be able to read at sight any easy author in Greek
and Latin; that he should be well grounded in arithmetic, algebra,
and geometry; that he should understand French and German, and if
possible speak one of the two ; that he should be able to read his own
language well, to write it intelligently, and to show some familiarity
with its greatest literaturef; that he should have a sound knowledge of
history and geography; and lastly, that he should be acquainted with
the nature and greatest results of the sciences in general, and have a
more minute, practical, and experimental acquaintance with one of
them at least,
     The remainder of the discourse was devoted to illustrating and
proving the fact that such results, or results closely analogous to them,
had constantly been attained in past times, are at the present moment
frequently attained in other countries, and might at any moment be

which has been immensely diminished by the growth of modern civili

         SIR HENRY HoHLAND, Bart. M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. President,
                                      in the Chair.
                         PROFESSOR HUxLEY, LL.D. F.R.S.
       On the Animals which are most nearly intermediate between Birds
                                      and Reptiles.
 THosE who hold the doctrine of Evolution (and I am one of them)
 conceive that there are grounds for believing that the world, with all
 that is in it and on it, did not come into existence in the condition in
 which we now see it, nor in anything approaching that condition.
       On the contrary, they hold that the present conformation and com
 position of the earth's crust, the distribution of land and water, and
 the infinitely diversified forms of animals and plants which constitute
 its present population, are merely the final terms in an immense series
 of changes which have been brought about, in the course of immeasur
 able time, by the operation of causes more or less similar to those
 which are at work at the present day.
       Perhaps this doctrine of Evolution is not maintained consciously
 and in its logical integrity by a very great number of persons.” But
 many hold particular applications of it without committing themselves
      * The only complete and systematic statement of the doctrine with which I
 am acquainted is that contained in Mr. Herbert Spencer's ‘System of Philosophy;’
 a work which should be carefully studied by all who desire to know whither
  scientific thought is tending.

1868.]                  between Birds and Reptiles.                  279
to the whole; and many, on the other hand, favour the general doctrine
without giving an absolute assent to its particular applications.
     Thus, one who adopts the nebular hypothesis in Astronomy, or is
a Uniformitarian in Geology, or a Darwinian in Biology, is, so far, an
adherent of the doctrine of Evolution.
     And, as I can testify from personal experience, it is possible to
have a complete faith in the general doctrine of Evolution and yet to
hesitate in accepting the Nebular, or the Uniformitarian, or the Dar
winian hypotheses in all their integrity and fullness. For many of the
objections which are brought against these various hypotheses affect
them only, and even if they be valid, leave the general doctrine of
Evolution untouched.
     On the other hand, it must be admitted that some arguments which
are adduced against particular forms of the doctrine of Evolution,
would very seriously a<U+FB01>ect the whole doctrine if they were proof
against refutation.
     For example, there is an objection which I see constantly and
con<U+FB01>dently urged against Mr. Darwin’s views, but which really strikes
at the heart of the whole doctrine of Evolution, so far as it is applied
to the organic world.
     It is admitted on all sides that existing animals and plants are
marked out by natural intervals into sundry very distinct groups :—
Insects are widely different from Fish-Fish from Reptiles—-Reptiles
from llrIammals—-—and so on. And out of this fact arises the very per
 tinent objection, How is it, if all animals have proceeded by gradual
 modi<U+FB01>cation from a common stock, that these great gaps exist?
. We, who believe in Evolution, reply, that these gaps were once
 non-existent; that the connecting forms existed in previous epochs of
 the world’s history, but that they have died out.
     Naturally enough then we are asked to produce these extinct forms
 of life. Among the innumerable fossils of all ages which exist, we
 are asked to point to those which constitute‘ such connecting forms.
     Our reply to this requestis, in most cases, an admission that such
 forms are not forthcoming, and we account for this failure of the
 needful evidence by the known imperfection of the geological record.
 We say that the series of formations with which we are acquainted is
 but a small fraction of those which have existed, and that between
 those which we know there are great breaks and gaps.
     I believe that these excuses have very great force ; but I cannot
 smother the uncomfortable feeling that they are excuses.
     If a landed proprietor is asked to produce the title-deeds of his
 estate, and is obliged to reply that some of them were destroyed in a
 <U+FB01>re a century ago, that some were carried off by a dishonest attorney,
 and that the rest are in a safe somewhere, but that he really cannot
 lay his hands upon them; he cannot, I think, feel pleasantly secure,
 though all his allegations may be correct and his ownership indis
 putable. But a doctrine is a scienti<U+FB01>c estate, and the holder must
 always be able to produce his title-deeds, in the way of direct evi

 280                    Professor Huxley on Animals              [Feb. 7,_
 dence, or take the penalty of that peculiar discomfort to which I have
 referred.
      You will not be surprised, therefore, if I take this opportunity of
pointing out that the objection to the doctrine of Evolution, drawn
from the supposed absence of intermediate forms in the fossil state,
 certainly does not hold good in all cases. In short, if I cannot
 produce the complete title-deeds of the doctrine of animal Evolution,
 I am able to show a considerable piece of parchment evidently
 belonging to them.
      To super<U+FB01>cial observation no two groups of beings can appear to
 be more entirely dissimilar than Reptiles and‘ Birds. Placed side by
 side, a Humming-bird and a Tortoise, an Ostrich and a Crocodile,
 offer the strongest contrast, and a Stork seems to have little but
 animality in common with the Snake it swallows.
      Careful investigation has shown, indeed, that these obvious differ
 ences are of a much more super<U+FB01>cial character than might have been
 suspected, and that Reptiles and Birds do really agree much more
 closely than Birds with Mammals, or Reptiles with Amphibians. But
 still, “though not as wide as a church-door or as deep as a we ,”
 the gap between the two groups, in the present world, is considerable
enough.
      Without attempting to plunge you into the depths of anatomy,
and con<U+FB01>ning myself to that osseous system to which those who desire
to compare extinct with living animals are almost entirely restricted,
I may mention the following as the most important differences between
all the Birds and Reptiles which at present exist.
      1. The pinion of a Bird, which answers to the hand of a man or‘
to the forepaw of a Reptile, contains neither more nor fewer than
three <U+FB01>ngers. These answer to the thumb and the two succeeding
<U+FB01>ngers in man, and have their metacarpals connected together by <U+FB01>rm
bony union, or ankylosed. Claws are developed upon the ends of
at most two of the three <U+FB01>ngers (that answering to the thumb and the
next), and are sometimes entirely absent.        ’
     No Reptile with Well-developed forelimbs has so few as three
<U+FB01>ngers; nor are the metacarpal bones of these ever united together;
nor do they present fewer than three claws at their terminations.
     2. The breast-bone of a Bird becomes converted into a membrane
bone, and ossi<U+FB01>cation commences in it from at least two centres.
     The breast-bone of no Reptile becomes converted into membrane
bone, nor does it ever ossify from several distinct centres.              -
     3. A considerable number of caudal and lumbar, or dorsal, ver
tebrae unite together with the proper sacral vertebrae of a Bird to
form its “sacrum.” In Reptiles the same region of the spine is consti
tuted by the one or two sacral vertebrae.
     4. In Birds the haunch-bone' (ilium) extends far in front of, as
well as behind, the acetabulum ; the ischia and pubes are directed
backwards, almost parallel with it and with one another; the ischia
do not unite in the ventral middle line of the body.
                                            !

 1868.]                 between Birds and Reptiles.        ‘           281
      In Reptiles, on the contrary, the haunch-bone is not produced in
 front of the acetabulum; and the axes of the ischia and pubes diverge
 and lie more or less at right angles to that of the ilium. The ischia
 always unite in the middle ventral line of the body.
      5. In all Birds the axis of the thigh-bone lies nearly parallel with
 the median plane of the body (as in ordinary Mammalia) in the
 natural position of the leg. In Reptiles it stands out at a more or less
 open angle with the median plane.
      6. In Birds one half of the tarsus is inseparably united with the
 tibia, the other half with the metatarsal bone of the foot. This is not
 the case in Reptiles.
      7. Birds never have more than four toes, the <U+FB01>fth being always
 absent.    The metatarsal of the hallux, or great toe, is always short
 and incomplete above. The other metatarsals are ankylosed together,
 and unite with one half of the tarsus, so as to form a single bone,
 which is called the tarsometatarsus.
      Reptiles with completely developed hind-limbs have at fewest
four toes, the metatarsals of which are all complete and distinct from
one another.
     Although all existing Birds differ thus de<U+FB01>nitely from existing
Reptiles, one comparatively small section comes nearer Reptiles than
the others.      These are the Ratitaz, or struthious birds, comprising
the Ostrich, Rhea, Emeu, Cassowary, Apterym, and the but recently
extinct      they be really extinct) birds of New Zealand, Dimmis, &c.,
which attained gigantic dimensions. All these birds are remarkable
for the small size of their wings, the absence of a crest or keel upon
the breastbone, and of a complete furcula; in many cases, for the late
union of the bones of the pinion, the foot, and the skull. In this last
character, in the form of the sternum, of the shoulder-girdle, and in
some peculiarities of the skull, these birds are more reptilian than the
rest; but the total amount of approximation to the reptilian type is
but small, and the gap between Reptiles and Birds is but very slightly
narrowed by their existence.
     How far can this gap be <U+FB01>lled up by a reference to the records of
the life of past ages ?
     This question resolves itself into two :
     1. Are-any fossil Birds more reptilian than any of those now
living?
     2. Are any fossil Reptiles more bird-like than living reptiles?
And I shall endeavour to show that both these questions must be
answered in the a<U+FB02>irmative.
     It is very instructive to note by how more a chance it is we
happen to know that a fossil bird, more reptilian in some respects
than any now living, once existed.
     Bones of birds have been obtained from rocks of very various
dates in the Tertiary series without revealing any forms but such as
would range themselves among existing families.

282                       Professor Huxley on Animals            [Feb 7,
    Afew years ago the great Mesozoic formations had yielded only
the few fragmentary ornitholites which have been discovered in the
Cambridge greensand, and which are insu<U+FB01>icient for the complete
determination of the a<U+FB02>inities of the bird to which they belonged.
    However, the very <U+FB01>ne calcareous mud of the ancient oolitie sea
bottom which has now hardened into the famous lithographic slate of
Solenhofen, and has preserved innumerable delicate organisms of the
existence of which we should otherwise have been, in all probability,
totally ignorant, in 1861 revealed the impression of a feather to the
famous palaeontologist, Herman von Meyer. Von Meyer named the
unknown bird to which this feather belonged Archaaopteryac lithographica,
and in the same year, the independent discovery by Dr. Haberlein of
the precious skeleton of the Archwopterym itself, which now adorns
the British Museum,*‘ demonstrated the chief characters of this very
early bird. But it must be remembered that this feather and this
imperfect skeleton are the sole remains of birds which have yet been
obtained in all that great series of formations known as Wealden and
Oolite, which partly lie‘ above and partly correspond with, the Solen
hofen slates.
     Though some palaaontologists may be forced by a sense of con
sistency to declare that the class of birds was created in the sole
person of Archceopterym during the deposition of the Solenhofen slates,
and disappeared during the Wealden, to be re-created in the Greensand,
to vanish once more during the Cretaceous epoch and reappear in the
Tertiaries, I incline to the hypothesis that many birds beside Ar
chwopteryx existed throughout all this period of time, and that we
know nothing about them, simply because we do not happen to have
hit upon those deposits in which their remains are preserved.
     Now, what is this Archazopieryx like? Unfortunately, the skull is
lost, but the leg and foot, the pelvis, the shoulder-girdle, and the
feathers, so far as their structure can be made out, are completely
those of existing ordinary birds.
     On the other hand, the tail is very long, and more like that of a
reptile than that of a bird in this respect. Two digits of the manus
have curved claws, much stronger than those of any existing bird; and,
 to all appearance, the metacarpal bones are quite free and disunited.
     Thus it is a matter of fact that, in certain particulars, the oldest
known bird does exhibit a closer approximation to reptilian structure
than any modern bird.
     Are any fossil reptiles more bird-like than those which now
 exist?
     As in the case of birds, the Tertiary formations yield no trace of
reptiles which depart from the type of the existing groups. But other
 wise than is true of birds, the newest of the Mesozoic formations,
 the Chalk, makes us acquainted with reptiles which, at <U+FB01>rst sight, seem

 Transactions ’ for 1863.

1868.]                   between Birds and Reptiles.                    283
to approach birds in a very marked manner. These are those <U+FB02>ying
reptiles, the Pterodactyles, which resemble the great majority of birds
in the presence of air-cavities in their bones, in the wonderfully bird
like aspect of their coracoid and scapula, and in their broad sternum
with its median crest.      Furthermore, in some of the Pterodactyles,
the premaxillte and the symphysial part of the mandibles were pro
longed into beaks, which appear to have been sheathed in horn, while
the rest of each jaw was armed with teeth.
     But hem-sheathed beaks are found in reptiles as well as in birds ;
the structure of the scapulocoracoid arch and of the sternum, and
the pneumaticity of the bones, vary greatly among birds themselves;
and these characters of the Pterodactyles may be merely adaptive
modi<U+FB01>cations.
     On the other hand, the manus has four free digits, the three inner
of which are strongly clawed, while the fourth is enormously prolonged,
in total contrast to the abortion of the corresponding digit in birds.
The pelvis is as wholly unlike that of birds as is the hind-limb and
foot.
     Thus it appears that Pterodactyles, among Reptiles, approach birds
much as Bats, among Mammals, may be said to do so. They are a
sort of reptilian Bats* rather than links between Reptiles and Birds,
and it is precisely in those organs which, in birds, are the most charac
teristically ornithie, the manus and the pes, that they depart most
widely from the ornithic type.
     Clearly then the passage from Reptiles to Birds is not from the
<U+FB02>ying Reptile to the <U+FB02>ying Bird. Let us try another line. I have
already observed that, in the existing world, the nearest approximation
to Reptiles is presented by certain land Birds, the Ostriches and their
allies, all of which are devoid of the power of <U+FB02>ight by reason of the
small relative size of their fore-limbs and of the character of their
feathers.
     Can we <U+FB01>nd any extinct Reptiles which approached these <U+FB02>ightless
birds, not merely in the weakness of their fore-limbs, but in other and
more important characters ?
   I imagine that we can, if we cast our eyes in what at <U+FB01>rst sight seems
to be a most unlikely direction.
     The Dinosauria, a group of extinct reptiles, containing the genera
Iguanodo-n, Hadrosaurus, Megalosaurus, Poikilopleuron, Scelidosaurus,
Plateoeaurus, &c., which occur throughout the whole series of the Me
sozoic rocks, and are, for the most part, of gigantic size, appear to me
to furnish the required conditions.
     In none of these animals are the skull, or the cervical region of the
vertebral column, completely known, while the sternum and the menus
have not yet been obtained in any of the genera. In none has any
trace of a clavicle been observed.
    * It will be understood that I do not suggest any direct a<U+FB02>inity between
Pterodactyles and Bats.

     With regard to the characters which have been positively deter
mined, it has been ascertained, that:
     1. From four to six vertebrae enter into the composition of the
sacrum, and become connected with the ilia in a manner which is
partly ornithic, partly reptilian.
     2. The ilia are prolonged forwards in front of the acetabulum as
duced isbehind

           greatlyit,increased  resemblance

margin of the bone, and the extensive perforation of the <U+FB02>oor of the
acetabulum.
     3. The other two components of the 0s innominatum have not been
observed actually in place; indeed, only one of them is known at all,
but that one is exceedingly remarkable from its strongly drnithic
character. It is the bone which has been called “ clavicle” in Mega
losaurus and Iguanodon by Cuvier and his successors, though the
sagacious Buckland had hinted its real nature?‘ But these bones are
not in the least like the clavicles of any animal which possesses a
clavicle, while they are extremely similar to the ischia of such a bird
as an ostrich; and in the only instance in which they have been found
in tolcrably undisturbed relation with other parts of the skeleton,
namely, in the Maidstone Iguanodon, they lie, one upon each side of
the body, close to the ilia. I hold it to be certain that these bones
belong to the pelvis, and not to the shoulder-girdle, and I think it
probable that they are ischia; but I do not deny that they may be pubes.
     4. The head of the femur is set-on at right angles to the shaft of
the bone, so that the axis of the thigh-bone must have been parallel
with the middle vertical plane of the body, as in birds.
     5. The posterior surface of the external condyle of the femur pre
sents a strong crest, which passes between the head of the <U+FB01>bula and
the tibia as in birds. There is only a rudiment of this structure in
other reptiles.
     6. The tibia has a great anterior or “ procnemial” crest, convex on
the inner, and concave on the outer, side. Nothing comparable to this
exists in other reptiles, but a correspondingly developed crest exists
in the great majority of birds, especially such as have great walking
or swimming powers.
     7. The lower extremity of the <U+FB01>bula is much smaller than the
other; it is, proportionally, a more slender bone than in other reptiles.
In birds the distal end of the <U+FB01>bula thins away to a point, and it is
a still more slender bone.
     8. Scelidosaurus has four complete toes, but there is a rudiment of
a <U+FB01>fth metatarsal. The third or middle toe is the largest, and the
metatarsal of the hallux is much smaller at its proximal than at its
distal end.
    * The so-callcd “ coracoid" of Megalosaur-us is the ilium.     I am indebted to
Professor Phillips, and to the splendid collection of Mcgalosaurian remains which
he has formed at Oxford, for most important evidence touching this reptile.

    Igaanodon has three large toes, of which the middle is the longest.
The slender proximal end of a <U+FB01>rst metatarsal has been found adherent
to the inner face of the second, so that if the hallux was completely
developed it was probably very small. No rudiment of the outer too
has been observed.
    It is clear, from the manner in which the three principal meta
tarsals articulate together, that they were very intimately and <U+FB01>rmly
united, and that a su<U+FB02>icient base for the support of the body was
afforded by the spreading out of the phalangeal regions of the toes.
    From the great di<U+FB01>'erence in size between the fore and hind limbs,
Mantel], and more recently Leidy, have concluded that the Dino
sauria (at least, Iguanodon and Hadrosaurus) may have supported them
selves, for a longer or shorter period, upon their hind legs. But the
discovery made in the weald, by Mr. Beckles, of pairs of large three
toed foot-prints, of such a size and at such a distance apart that it is
di<U+FB01>'lcult to believe they can have been made by anything but an
Iguanodon, lead to the supposition that this vast reptile, and perhaps
others of its family, must have walked, temporarily or permanently,
upon its hind legs.
    However this may be, there can be no doubt that the hind quarters
of the Dinosauria wonderfully approached those of birds‘ in their
general structure, and therefore that these extinct Reptiles were more
closely allied to birds than any which now live.
    But a single specimen, obtained from those Solenhofen slates, to the
accident of whose existence and usefulness in the arts palzeontology is
so much indebted, affords a still nearer approximation to the “ missing
link ” between reptiles and birds. This is the singular reptile which
has been described and named Compsognathas longipes by the late
Andreas Wagner, and some of the more recondite ornithic a<U+FB02>inities of
which have been since pointed out by Gegcnbaur. Notwithstanding
its small size (it was not much more than two feet in length), this
reptile must, I think, be placed among, or close to, the Dinosauria ;
but it is still more bird-like than any of the animals which are ordi
narily included in that group.
     Compsognathus longipes has a light head, with toothed jaws, sup
ported upon a very long and slender neck. The ilia are prolonged in
front of and behind the acetabulum. The pubes seem to have been
remarkably long and slender (a circumstance which rather favours the
interpretation of the so-called “clavicles” of Igaanodon as pubes).
The fore-limb is very small. The bones of the manus are unfor
tunately scattered, but only four claws are to be found, so that
possibly each manus may have had but two clawed digits.
    The hind limb is very large, and disposed as in birds. As in the
latter class, the femur is shorter than the tibia, a circumstance in
which C'ompsognathns is more ornithic than the ordinary Dinosauria.
    The proximal division of the tarsus is ankylosed with the tibia, as
in birds. In the foot the distal tarsals are not united with the three

286               Professor Huxley on Birds and Reptiles.         [Feb. 7,
long and slender metatarsals, which answer to the second, third, and
fourth toes. Of the fifth toe there is only a rudimentary metatarsal.
The hallux is short, and its metatarsal appears to be deficient at its
proximal end.
    It is impossible to look at the conformation of this strange reptile
and to doubt that it hopped or walked, in an erect or semi-erect
position, after the manner of a bird, to which its long neck, slight
head, and small anterior limbs must have given it an extraordinary
resemblance.
     I have now, I hope, redeemed my promise to show that, in past
times, birds more like reptiles than any now living, and reptiles more
like birds than any now living, did really exist.
     But, on the mere doctrine of chances, it would be the height of
improbability that the couple of skeletons, each unique of its kind,
which have been preserved in those comparatively small beds of Solen
hofen slate, which record the life of a fraction of Mesozoic time, should
be the relics, the one of the most reptilian of birds, and the other of
the most ornithic of reptiles.
     And this conclusion acquires a far greater force when we reflect
upon that wonderful evidence of the life of the Triassic age, which is
afforded us by the sandstones of Connecticut. It is true that these have
yielded neither feathers nor bones; but the creatures which traversed
them when they were the sandy beaches of a quiet sea, have left
innumerable tracks which are full of instructive suggestion. Many
of these tracks are wholly undistinguishable from those of modern
birds in form and size; others are gigantic three-toed impressions,
like those of the Weald of our own country; others are more like
the marks left by existing reptiles or Amphibia.
     The important truth which these tracks reveal is, that, at the
commencement of the Mesozoic epoch, bipedal animals existed which
had the feet of birds, and walked in the same erect or semi-erect
fashion. These bipeds were either birds or reptiles, or more probably
both; and it can hardly be doubted that a lithographic slate of Triassic
age would yield birds so much more reptilian than Archaeopteryx, and
reptiles so much more ornithic than Compsognathus, as to obliterate
completely the gap which they still leave between reptiles and birds.
     But if, on tracing the forms of animal life back in time, we meet,
as a matter of fact, with reptiles which depart from the general type
to become bird-like, until it is by no means difficult to imagine a crea
ture completely intermediate between Dromaeus and Compsognathus,
surely there is nothing very wild or illegitimate in the hypothesis
that the phylum of the class Aves has its root in the Dinosaurian rep
tiles; that these, passing through a series of such modifications as are
exhibited in one of their phases by Compsognathus, have given rise to
the Ratitae; while the Carinatae are still further modifications and
 differentiations of these last, attaining their highest specialization in
the existing world in the Penguins, the Cormorants, the Birds of Prey,
the Parrots, and the Song-birds.

1868.]                Professor Roscoe on Vanadium.                   287
     However, as many completely differentiated birds in all probability
existed even in the Triassic epoch, and as we possess hardly any know
ledge of the terrestrial reptiles of that period, it may be regarded as
certain that we have no knowledge of the animals which linked
Reptiles and Birds together historically and genetically; and that the
Dinosanria, with C'ornpsognathus, Archteopteryw, and the struthious Birds,
only help us to form a reasonable conception of what these interme
diate forms may have been.
     In conclusion, I think I have shown cause for the assertion that
the facts of Palaeontology, so far as Birds and Reptiles are concerned,
are not opposed to the doctrine of Evolution, but, on the contrary, are
quite such as that doctrine would lead us to expect; for they enable
us to form a conception of the manner in which Birds may have been
evolved from Reptiles, and thereby justify us in maintaining the
superiority of the hypothesis, that Birds have been so originated, to
all hypotheses which are devoid of an equivalent basis of fact.

       SIR HENRY HOLLAND, Bart. M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. President,
                               in the Chair.

         On Vanadium, one of the Trr'valent Group of Elements.
THE metal vanadium (so called from Vanadis, a cognomen of the
 Scandinavian goddess Freia) was discovered in 1830 by Sefstrom in
 the celebrated Swedish bar-iron made from the Taberg ore. From
 this source, even when using many pounds of the iron, Sefstrom
 obtained only minute quantities of the new substance, but he found
 it in somewhat larger amount in the slag or cinder produced in the
 reduction of the iron ore. Sefstrom ascertained some of the most
 peculiar characters of the substance, proved it to be a new element,
 and prepared some of its compounds in the pure state. The reac
 tions by which vanadium can be separated and distinguished from
 all the other elements are: (1) The formation of a soluble sodium
 vanadate when the vanadium compounds are fused with sodium car
 bonate; (2) the formation of an insoluble ammonium vanadate when
 sal-ammoniac is added to the solution of a soluble vanadate; (3) the
 production of a splendid blue solution when this ammonium salt, dis
 solved in hydrochloric acid, is warmed with reducing agents such as
 oxalic acid.

288             _   Professor Roscoe 1m Vanadium,            [Feb 14
    Sefstrom not having leisure to prosecute the full examination of
the properties of the new metal, handed over his preparations to
Berzelius; and it is to the investigations of the great Swede (1831)
that we owe almost all our acquaintance with the chemistry of vana
dium.                                                 ,
    Since Berzelius’s time vanadium has been discovered in many
minerals, of which a lead-ore containing lead vanadate and called by
the mineralogists vanadinite, is the most important. It has also been
found in many iron ores, in clay, bricks, and even in caustic soda.
Still the quantity of the substance found in all these various sources
has been extremely small; so much so, that the vanadium compounds
must be reckoned amongst the greatest of chemical rarities, and we
<U+FB01>nd them quoted in the price lists of dealers in chemicals at 18. 6d.
per grain, or 351. per ounce ! It is clear that our knowledge of the
chemical properties of a substance so rare must necessarily be but in
complete, as the di<U+FB01>iculties of obtaining exact or satisfactory results
with small quantities of material are evident; and, in fact, the state
ments of the only persons who have worked upon the subject re
cently (Schafarik Czudnowioz), instead of giving us any more reliable
information respecting the character of vanadium, have only served
to throw doubt upon some of the conclusions of Berzelius, and thus to
render our knowledge even less complete than it appeared to be.
    Hence it was with much satisfaction that, in February, 1865, the
speaker came into possession of a plentiful source of vanadium in a
by-product obtained in the preparation of cobalt from the copper
bearing beds of the lower Keuper Sandstone of the Trias at Alderley
Edge, in Cheshire. The manager of the works was puzzled to know
why a blue solution, supposed by him to contain copper, did not
deposit the red metal upon a strip of zinc ; the speaker recognized
this reaction as due to the presence of vanadium, and secured the
whole of the by-product, which he found to contain about 2 per cent.
of the rare metal. The exact position of the vanadium mineral in
the sandstone beds cannot now be stated, as the mine (at Mottram
St. Andrews) from which the cobalt ore was obtained is now closed,
and cannot be entered. The general characters of the deposit are,
however, Well known, and exhibit points of great interest ; they have
been well described by Mr. Hull as follows :—
    “ The ‘edge’ or escarpment of Alderley rises from the eastern
side of the plain of Cheshire gradually towards the cast, but with a
steep and abrupt ridge towards the north. This northern bank is
richly wooded, and has a very beautiful aspect when viewed from a
distance, as it contrasts strongly with the almost level plain which
sweeps away to the northward and westward from its base. The
ridge has here been upheaved along the line of a large fault, bearing
east and west, throwing down at its base the Red Marl; and on the
other side bringing up the soft sandstone of the Bunter, capped by a
mural cliff of lower Keuper Conglomerate, which often breaks out in
conspicuous masses through the foliage. The beds rise from the

escarpment is continued southward for some distance facing the east.”

    The beds in the above series which claim the greatest share of our
attention are those at the base of the Keuper series, for in these
occur the copper and other minerals. The copper, as both blue and
green carbonate, occurs disseminated throughout the sand, the ore
coating the outside of the grains of sand and the pebbles of quartz.
In addition to copper, bands containing lead both as carbonate and
sulphide (galena) occur, also bands and veins of cobalt ochre, oxide of
manganese, and iron ochre in workable quantity. The copper is ex
tracted from the ore by solution in hydrochloric acid and precipita
tion as metal by scrap iron. The ordinary copper liquor, as Well as
the oxide of iron precipitated by lime from the solution of the
chloride, does not contain any trace of vanadium, nor was the speaker
able to detect any of this metal in the ore as at present worked.
    Following, in the main, the process of preparation adopted by
Sefstrom, the speaker obtained from the above-mentioned lime pre
cipitate several pounds of pure ammonium vanadate, from which all
the other compounds of vanadium can be prepared.
    What now were the conclusions to which Berzelius arrived from
his experiments concerning the constitution of the vanadium com
pounds? He corroborated Sefstriim’s statement, that the most cha
racteristic feature of the substance is the existence of an acid-forming
oxide, termed vanadic acid, produced whenever any of the oxides are
heated in the air. Berzelius also discovered two other oxides of
vanadium, of which he ascertained the composition; and likewise a
volatile chloride. To the highest oxide he gave the formula V0,,
to the second V 0,, and to the lowest (or suboxide) V O ; whilst the
chloride was represented by V 01,. The atomic weight of the metal
be ascertained to be V: 68'5. Berzelius came to this conclusion
from the following experimentally ascertained facts: (1) That on
passing hydrogen over heated vanadic acid a constant loss of weight
occurred, and the suboxide was formed; (2) that when dry chlorine

is passed over the suboxide thus prepared, the volatile chloride was
formed, and a residue of vanadic acid remained, which was exactly
equal in weight to one-third of the acid originally taken for reduction.
Hence assuming that the lowest oxide contains one atom of oxygen
(an assumption borne out by the analysis of the chloride), the acid
must contain three atoms of oxygen," and the following formulae repre
sent the composition of these compounds according to Berzelius:—
           Vo        VO,          VO,       WC1,          (V=68.5)
The interest attaching to the conclusions which Berzelius fairly drew
from his experiments was much heightened by an observation made
by Rammelsberg in 1856, as to the exact crystalline form of the
mineral vanadinite, a double salt of lead vanadate and lead chloride.
    So long ago as 1780 Werner had observed the identity of crystal
line form of two minerals, viz. apatite, a phosphato-fluoride of cal
cium, and pyromorphite, a phosphato-chloride of lead; to which may
be added, mimetesite, an arsenato-chloride of lead.         These minerals all
have an analogous composition, being represented by the formulae—
                   Apatite          3 (Ca, P. O.)+Call,
                   Pyromorphite 3 (Pb, P. O.)+PbCl,
                  fMimetesite       3 (Pb, As, O...)+Pb Cls.
They are truly isomorphous, crystallizing in hexagonal prisms, termi
nated with hexagonal pyramids, having the same angles and the same
length of axes. Rammelsberg added to this list the mineral vanadi
nite, which he ascertained by measurement to be strictly isomorphous
with the foregoing, and to be as follows. The angle P on P was in
      1) Wanadinite . 142° 30' | 3) Pyromorphite 142° 15'
      2) Apatite . . 142° 20'            4) Mimetesite . 142° 7'
and the relation of the length of the axis:
                 1) 1 : 0.727              3)    1   :   0.736
                 2) 1 : 0.732              4)    1   :   0.739.
So far, indeed, has the identity of crystalline form been traced, that
crystals have been found which at one end consisted of vanadinite,
and at the other of pyromorphite (Heddle). Now judging from the
    * Berzelius concludes that the acid does not contain two atoms of metal,
inasmuch as no alum could be formed with potassium sulphate corresponding to
those formed by well-known sesquioxides.

                            3 (Pb, W.O.)+PbCl,"
 the oxide of vanadium contained in the mineral having a formula
 V.O., agreeing with the corresponding oxides of phosphorus and
 arsenic, P. O, and As, O. In making this assumption, we are, how
 ever, at once confronted with the unyielding chemical facts of Berze
 lius, according to which the oxide in question must be represented by
 the formula VO, and contains three, and not five, atoms of oxygen.
     It is, then, evident that we have here either to do with an excep
 tion to the law of Isomorphism, or else Berzelius's views are erro
 neous. Until this latter has been proved to be the case, chemists
 have, however, only been justified in assuming the former alternative
 to be the correct explanation.
      The speaker stated that in order to endeavour to clear up this
 question, he had most carefully repeated Berzelius's experiments, and
 that he had confirmed them in every particular; but having pursued
 the subject further than Berzelius, he had at last come to conclusions
 concerning the constitution of the vanadium compounds totally dif
 ferent from those drawn by the Swedish chemist, and had succeeded
 in obtaining the key to the enigma presented by the above anomalous
 crystallographic relations.
     The speaker has proved that the substance supposed by Berzelius
 to be Wanadium, W = 68.5, is not the metal, but an oxide, and that
 the true atomic weight of the metal is 68.5–16=52.5 (or rather,
 according to the speaker's exact determinations of the atomic weight,
 673–16=51:3).f The highest oxide, the vanadic acid, WO, of Ber
 zelius, hence becomes a pentoxide, W. O., corresponding to P, O, and
 As, O, and the isomorphism of vanadinite with the pyromorphite
 group of minerals is fully explained.         The suboxide of Berzelius is
 a tri-oxide, W, O, whilst the terchloride (WCl) of Berzelius is an
 oxychloride, having the formula V O Cls, and corresponding to oxy
chloride of phosphorus, PO Cls. The oxide supposed by Berzelius
 to be the metal contains 51.3 parts by weight of vanadium to 16 parts
by weight of oxygen, and the vanadic oxide of Berzelius also exists,

                                                                  }o
    t In his paper on Vanadium, read before the Royal Society (Dec. 19, 1867),
the author ventured to predict that the difference between the number he obtained
(67.3) and that found by Berzelius (68.5) was probably owing to the fact that
the vanadium compounds employed by Berzelius contained traces of phosphorus,
which render the perfect reduction of the vanadic acid in hydrogen impossible.
Most fortunately this supposition has been singularly verified, inasmuch as Dr.
Frankland has kindly placed in the speaker’s hands a small specimen of vanadiate
of ammonia found in Faraday's collection, and labelled, “Sent to me by Berzelius,
1831.” On examination, this sample was found to contain considerable quantities
of phosphorus, thus confirming the speaker's previously expressed opinion.

  oxides the empirical formula; V, O, and V, 0, may be given.                       Thus
  we have the following as representing the true composition of these
  vanadium compounds :—

         Each of the four oxides can be obtained in the anhydrous state;
  the dioxide is prepared as a grey metallic powder, by passing the
  vapour of the oxytriohloride mixed with hydrogen over red-hot carbon.
   The trioxide is obtained by the reduction of vanadic acid in a current
  of hydrogen, and the tetroxide is formed by the slow oxidation of the
' trioxide.
         The lowest or dioxide of vanadium (V202) is obtained in solution
  by the reducing action of nascent hydrogen evolved from zinc, cad
  mium, or sodium amalgam upon the sulphuric acid solution of vanadic
  acid, which, passing through all stages of blue and green colour, ulti
  mately assumes a permanent lavender tint. This solution of V, O, in
  sulphuric acid acts as a most powerful reducing agent, bleaching indigo
  solution and other vegetable colouring matters as rapidly as chlorine ;
  it also absorbs oxygen with avidity from the air, forming a deep brown
  solution. The other oxides of vanadium may be obtained in solution
  by the action of various reducing agents on the sulphuric solution of
  vanadic acid. Thus, by the action of nascent hydrogen evolved from
-magnesium a permanent green tint is obtained, and the vanadium
  is contained in solution as the trioxide, V,O,; whilst if moderate
  reducing agents, such as sulphurous acid, sulphuretted hydrogen, or
  oxalic acid are employed, the colour of the liquid does not pass beyond
  the blue stage, and the vanadium is contained in solution as tetroxide,
  V2 0,.* The different colours of solutions containing these oxides
  was exhibited by means of the magnesium light.
         The fact that the lemon-coloured chloride (the terchloride of
  Berzelius) contains oxygen was clearly demonstrated during the
  discourse by passing the vapour from a few grammes of the substance,
  together with perfectly pure hydrogen gas, over red-hot carbon. A
  portion of the oxygen of the oxychloride unites with the carbon to
  form carbonic acid, and the presence of this gas was shown by the
  precipitation of barium carbonate in clear baryta water contained in
  two test-tubes placed one before the other. At the commencement of
  the experiment, the carbonic acid was entirely absorbed by the small
        * In his communication to the Royal Society (Bakerian LecturefProc. Royal
   Soc, XVL, 220), the author gave the empirical formula V O and V 0a to the 1st
  and 3rd oxides of vanadium, as the molecular weights of these oxides have not
  been determined, and it is uncertain whether they obey the law of even atomicities,
  p11;i ljike the only corresponding compounds, the nitrogen oxides, are exceptions to
       s aw.
        On consideration, the author has, however, thought it best to adopt the doubled
  formula as urged by Sir Benjamin Brodie on the occasion above referred to.

containing heated copper oxide after the red-hot carbon, for the pur
pose of oxidizing any carbonic oxide gas which might be formed, inas
much as carbonic acid was always left in su<U+FB02>icient quantity to give a
considerable precipitate. No method has been found for separating
the whole of the oxygen from the oxychloride, and hence it has been
impossible to make the above experiment quantitatively. Solid oxy-_
chlorides are obtained by the action of hydrogen upon the oxytri
chloride, one of which resembles mosaic gold, possessing a bright
metallic bronze-like lustre, and having been taken for the metal by
Schafarik.
     The atomic weight of vanadium was determined (1) by reducing
the pentoxide to trioxide in a current of hydrogen. (2) By the
analysis of the oxytrichloride. The atomic weight obtained as the
mean of a large number of well-agreeing experiments is 51 '3.
     The metal itself has not yet been obtained, but a compound of
vanadium and nitrogen has been prepared, shown by direct analysis
to contain 14 parts by weight of nitrogen to 51'3 parts by weight of
vanadium, corresponding to the formula VN. The existence of this
compound is proof positive of the true atomic weight of the metal,
and the nitride serves as the point of departure from which to seek
for the metal and the true chlorides of vanadium, one of which, V 01,,
has already been prepared by the action of chlorine upon the nitride.
 It is a dark brown liquid, which decomposes when thrown into water,
forming a green solution containing V,l 03. The speaker demonstrated
 the fact that the oxychloride, V O 016, when thrown into water decom
 poses with formation of a yellow solution of vanadium pentoxide, V2 0,,
 whilst the trichloride, V G1,, on being similarly treated yields a green
 solution containing the metal in solution as trioxide, V, 08.    He then
 compared these reactions with the decomposition of the corresponding
 phosphorus compounds, P 0 Cl, and P 01,, forming P2 O5 and P, 0,,
 and rendered these reactions visible by obtaining a precipitate of
 yellow silver phosphate in the <U+FB01>rst case, and of black metallic silver
 in the second.
      The characters of the vanadates themselves bear out the analogy
 of the highest oxide with the corresponding oxides of phosphorus
 and arsenic. In the <U+FB01>rst place, all the naturally occurring vanadates
 are tribasic ; secondly, the true character of vanadic acid is shown to
 be tribasic, by the fact that, when the pentoxide is fused with sodium
 carbonate, three atoms of C 02 are liberated, and the. normal or ortho
 vanadate, NaQVQOa (corresponding to Na,P,0,), is formed; thirdly,
 the so-called mono-vanadates are monobasic salts, corresponding to the

 monobasic phosphates, and may be termed meta-vanadates, thus, NaVO,
 and Ba 2 VO, whilst the so-called bi-vanadates are anhydro-salts.
     All the reactions by which Berzelius explained the facts he dis
 covered, can equally well be represented according to the new atomic
 weight and constitution; thus:—

     The speaker stated that the foregoing facts clearly pointed out
 that vanadium, hitherto standing in no definite relation to other ele
 ments, must be regarded as a member of the well-known Trivalent
 or Triad class of elementary substances, comprising nitrogen, phos
 phorus, boron, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth.
     It is true that we are still but imperfectly acquainted with many
 of the characters of vanadium, but the more its nature is studied, the
more points of family resemblance will be discovered, and the more
close will the ties be found, which bind it to the great Triad family.
     The following tabular statement of the compounds of the most im
portant members of this group clearly shows their common relations:—

recent years been shown to be a compound body.

                                  On Hamlet.
  THE speaker, after a few words as to certain modes of estimating
  greatness, came more directly to consideration of the transcendent
  merits of ‘Hamlet.’ “For,” said the speaker, “here <U+FB01>rst I would say,
  however much the other plays may exceed any other mau’s execution,
  however much many of them may exceed any other poet’s conception,
  yet npre-eminently does ‘Hamlet’ stand out beyond all other works in
  this its conception. And mark the difference as to the kind of con
  ception which is exhibited in ‘Hamlet.’ In the ‘ Tempest,’ in the
- ‘Midsummer Night’s Dream,’ in ‘Macbeth,’ there is the most wonderful
  conception of the feelings and nature of spiritual beings—supernatural
  beings, transferred to this nether world, and acting a part in it. This
  element is not wanting in Hamlet. The Ghost comes and speaks as‘a
  disembodied spirit might well be supposed to speak having his cause
  to prompt him ; but, after all, the wonder of wonders in the conception
  in this play is not in its supernatural, but in the natural elements.
  Hamlet himself is the marvellous creation. Some may think it more
  wonderful to seem to know and depict to the life spiritual natures; but
  to me it does not seem so, at least not when such a character as that
  of Hamlet is placed in the opposite scale. We have, too, better means
  of judging of men than of spirits how true the depiction is to nature.
 ‘In the present instance, we admit this truth to nature in Hamlet; and
  yet we see how impossible it is that such a nature should ever have
  been conceived at all if Shakespeare had not portrayed and expressed
  it. We see, believe, know, that Hamlet is all nature-mature of the
  highest order, moral, intellectual, I believe too, physical-We see all
  these excellences, in the most wonderful combination, under the
  hardest trial, working out their results, till we are assured it would be
  a philosophical heresy of the deepest dye to question a single point
  as to truth to nature in the character; and yet the character is so
  hard to —make out that no two men seem to be agreed as to Hamlet’s
  feelings, motives, thoughts, actions, or the true key to them. See then
                                a

  296                       Rev. M. W. Mayow                       [Feb. 21,
  here the pro-eminence of the creation and portrayal of such a character
  over others. Grant that Othello, Caliban, Prospcro, Lear, Macbeth, or
  their equivalents, might be reproduced in a thousand, or ten thousand
  years, you feel the world must run out a million before you would have
  another Hamlet: that is, that practically neither he (nor his equivalent)
  will ever be reproduced at all. You see there might be-there is-there
  has been one such man (he is a true man, no monster even in excel
  lences) since the world began. Now that he stands before you, you
  recognize and confess this; but you see also that if Shakespeare had
  not, Prometheus-like, put life in him, he would never have been at
  all. And this, above and independently of all other characters in the
  play-this, apart from all other considerations: all beauty of dialogue,
  all skill in execution, melody in versi<U+FB01>cation, general truth of senti
  ment, wisdom, interest, morality; beyond all these things—this wonder
  of conception in this particular ‘quintessence of dust’ places ‘Hamlet,’
  in my judgment,_<U+FB01>rst and foremost above all the other plays in order
  of merit.”                                                             -
       The speaker then proceeded to say that amid the raging contests
  as to the true key to Hamlet’s character and actions (which time did
  not permit him to go through), he felt bound to say a few words as
  to his own conception of Hamlet, lest he should seem to hold him up to
  admiration without even a theory of the excellences or consistency of
  his character. “ The following,” he said, “is in my conceit, something
  of what Shakespeare intended: A man, as evidently of the ,highest
  rank, so likewise of the highest intellect; of the most perfect form,
  the most delicate organization, the utmost natural piety, the most
  exquisite human affections, the most cultivated understanding, proved ‘
  in all ways of re<U+FB02>ection, argument, repartee (Hamlet is absolutely the
  quickest-witted man ever drawn),-—this man meeting with the hardest
  trials—1st, his father’s death ; 2nd, his mother’s incestuous marriage
  with his uncle; and 3rd, and chief of all, the revelation of his father’s
  murder, and of the murderer,—
                    lThe serpent that did sting thy father’s life,
                     Now wears his crown ;'
  and the mission of vengeance entrusted to him by the Ghost, apparently
  permitted to revisit the earth solely for the purpose of con<U+FB01>ding to
_ him this knowledge, and enjoining upon him this duty. All this utterly
  harassing him——ifyou will, dismaying him; but not deranging his in
  tellect (I cannot admit that); till he is in the most dire perplexity
  how to act. All which difficulties, too, the very subtilty of his faculties,
  and the perfection of his organization, intellectual and moral, only
  increase and enhance, because on every side he sees objections, and
  arguments, and possible dangers, and even sins, in whatever he may
  do, which a blunter intellect, or a duller heart, or less quickened
   feelings, or a less active conscience would never have seen or felt at
  all.   Thus the very balance of his excellences, and the perfection of

his faculties, made him to be poised in inaction, and (as he says
himself)
   I           ‘ Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
                 And thus the native hue of resolution
                 Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought;
                 And enterprises of great pith and moment
                 With this regard, their currents turn awry,
                 And lose the name of action.’                         '
Add to all this his passionate, tender, true love for the gentle and
beautiful Ophelia-and what a new cause of distress is there! Oh, how
it cracked his heart-strings to reckon this among the ‘trivial fond
records’ which were now no more to have any part in his life or
thoughts!    What wonder, then, that these things strove hard to upset
his reason (though I must maintain they did not)? or what wonder
that to an undiscerning dull world he appears to be full of nothing
but an incomprehensible irresolution ? ”
     Mr. Mayow then went through, in some detail, the evidence of the
restraining thoughts which addressed themselves to such a mind and
heart as Hamlet’s ; and dwelt upon his manifest unwillingness to kill
his uncle, especially until he had tested the Ghost’s truth by the
device of the play. He admitted-nay, claimed—that even after
being satis<U+FB01>ed by that proof of the king’s guilt, he had yet the utmost
abhorrence of his task, and pointed to this trait in his character as
the sufficient explanation of the fearful scene, where, <U+FB01>nding the king
at his prayers, he refuses to kill him, on the professed plea that to do
so would be “hire and salary, not revenge.” Citing Dr. Johnson’s
criticism-“ This speech in which Hamlet, represented as a virtuous
character, is not content with taking blood for blood, but contrives
damnation for the man that he would punish, is too horrible to be
read or to be uttered,”—Mr. Mayow remarked that the criticism would
be just if Dr. Johnson’s understanding of the act and its motive were
correct. But he thought it well admitted of another and a different
reading, wherein we might <U+FB01>nd one of the most marvellous instances
of Shakespeare’s surpassing genius, by which he gives us insight into
the recesses of Hamlet’s mind, and shows us the unlimited resources
of his intellect. Here he came upon the king, alone and utterly
defenceless before him, when there was no possible di<U+FB01>‘iculty in killing
him. As he said,—-“ Now might I do it pat ; ” but he had no mind to
do it. When it came to the point he abhorred the deed. Even
though by the test of the play he was wholly satis<U+FB01>ed of the king’s
guilt, yet his old dislike and detestation of the act remained. And
yet what plea could he <U+FB01>nd for not now executing his mission? Here
the quickness of his intellect hit upon the only possible hindrance
or objection,—that thus to take him at his prayers would be to send
him to heaven, and so no vengeance. The thought served its turn.
He had found a cause for delay. He let the king escape, and all that

malignity of his heart and nature, but of the inexhaustible fertility of
his imagination and his argumentative powers, by which he could in a
moment dress up all which should look like a reason in the perfection
of words, as well as in the most absolute completeness and plausibility
of invention. After noticing some minor evidences, con<U+FB01>rmatory of
this view of Hamlet’s character, the speaker pointed to the <U+FB01>nal
catastrophe of the play as entirely consistent with it; inasmuch as at
the last, even after he knew the fresh and fresh instances of the king’s
villany, it is more upon excitement and impulse than upon reason
or deliberation that he acts, and this, too, upon the new and deep
provocation of his mother’s death, and when, if be any longer delayed,
his mission of retribution could not be executed at all.
     The speaker then proceeded at considerable length to the question
of Hamlet’s madness. Was it real or feigned? Or feigned at <U+FB01>rst,
and in his own intention, but passing on afterwards beyond his own
control into a real derangement of mind, even without his knowing it
himself, as many great critics—Dr. Oonolly for instance, and, in some
measure, even Coleridge—seem to think ‘P To this, however, Mr. Mayow
 could not for a moment assent. He did not believe Hamlet was mad,
not in any degree, nor upon any point. He was over-wrought, worn,
 sick at heart, perplexed, oppressed by all which was laid upon him to
 suffer and to do ; but there was, he thought, no evidence to show, either
as to Shakespeare’s intention, or as to his own conduct, any perversion
 of his reason, any cloud upon his intellect, any delusion upon his
mind, as to any single matter in which he was concerned. If any
maintained the contrary theory, it could not be too much to ask, what
 and where was the delusion. Of course it was not to be taken as a
 delusion that he saw the ghost, or received his mission from him. This
was a postulate of the whole play, and was to be taken for granted by
 all, as indeed others of whose sanity there was no question, saw and
 heard him as well as Hamlet. Then by a somewhat lengthened
 examination of the prince’s perception in their true character of all
 the persons, things, and circumstances around him, the speaker arrived
 at the conclusion that no single matter could be pointed out in relation
 to which he was under any delusion whatever.
      But beyond such negative proof, there existed many positive proofs
 of his sanity. Over and above other things, such as his dialogues
 with Horatio, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern, with the players and
 the grave-diggers, the speaker directed attention especially to his
 soliloquies, and the immediate transition from his feigned disjoint~
 edness of mind, to the most sound appreciation of everything, upon his
 being left alone. In a single moment, said the speaker, he is himself,
 and shows himself competent to deal with every thought and every
 circumstance.    And this was not the mere coming to a lucid interval,
 but the having the entire command of himself so as at his own mere
will, at all times, and in a moment, to come to this lucid interval, as
the advocates of his madness must call it. Among many other in
 stances of this sort and kind, Mr. Mayow noticed, especially, the

1868.]         ,              '   on Hamlet.                         299 ,
few words uttered by him, immediately upon the players leaving him
 subsequently to his <U+FB01>rst idea of the play. On their going out he
 says,--“ Now I am alone.”           Those four words seemed to be an
 absolute proof of sanity, “ Now I am alone.” The restraint is off me.
I know all I have been doing, all I have been acting, and now I can
unbend and commune with my soul, and ask it, Why I am so tardy in
what I have to do ? or, Whether there be not some need for caution and
further testing the truth of the ghost’s story before committing myself
irrevocably to carry out his behest?
     The speaker arrived at the same conclusion from an examination
of the closet scene with his mother, and particularly the test of sanity
which he offers when he says
                                      “ Ecstacy!
                 My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
                 And makes as healthful music : *      "‘    ‘
                 *    *    *     * bring me to the test,
                 And I the matter will re-word; which madness
                 Would gambol from."
     Of which, in spite of all cavillers, Mr. Mayow a<U+FB01>irmed that he
could not doubt Shakespeare himself intended it to be a true test of a
sound mind; “and if so,” he said, “I will back him to have drawn it
rightly, against the world and all other authorities in it, and I hope
and think,” he added, “that I shall go near to have your sulfrages
with me in the wager.”
     The speaker then examined what he believed by the advocates of
the insane theory was considered their stronghold,-Hamlet’s cruel
behaviour, as they a<U+FB01>irm, to Ophelia, of which they conceive the only
explanation must be that he was mad ; in short, that the only way in
which to save his character as a gentleman is to give him up as a
lunatic. But the speaker thought all this admitted of another and a
better explanation. It must not be forgotten, <U+FB01>rst, that he had made
it a special object to get it reported and believed that he was mad.
It was part of his scheme, and by his conversation with Ophelia he
certainly took means to obtain currency for such report and rumour ;
whilst, secondly, it must be borne in mind that he felt bound to break
o<U+FB02>' wholly his thoughts of love (what this cost him, the scene after
wards at her funeral showed), and yet he would feel it was even more
cruel simply to withdraw himself from her without a reason, than to
act as he did, whilst at the same time to explain was impossible. To
let his feigned madness then take such a turn of severity and sarcasm
as might revolt her mind from him, and almost disgust vher with his
presence, might well be in his motives for his conduct towards her.
At the same time, thirdly, a large part of his dialogue with her, and
the extreme severity of his re<U+FB02>ections upon women (“to a nunnery go,”
&c.), may most naturally be traced and set down to the heart-breaking
bitterness of his thoughts in connection, not with Ophelia, but with his
mother, and to the shame which he felt she had cast on the whole race

of women. “All this,” said the speaker, after giving various instances
of the sarcasms, “seems to me but the natural outcome of his most
acute and metaphysical mind when once he let it run free into the
appearance of being unhinged under the motives which I have men

genius the world has ever known.”

difficult to understand him, and therefore also to represent him. Let
it be observed, he is up to everything, sees everything, knows every
thing, understands everything, weighs and appreciates everything (aye
at a single glance), and is able to excel in everything. He is so ready
and perfect in everything, and by instinct so throws himself into every
pursuit, that even under the pressure of his great trial he cannot shake
o<U+FB01>' this his nature. However repressed in his communings with himself,
it bursts out afresh continually in his intercourse with others. See it
in his converse with Horatio, Polonius, Rosencrantz, and Guildenstern;
in his directions to the players; in his composition of the scene in
serted in the play ; in his talk with the grave-diggers; in all he does and
says everywhere; not least in the triumphant and though bombastic,
yet most true and pathetic outbreak of doggerel upon the termination
of the play, and the king's abrupt departure “ frighted with false <U+FB01>re.”
                  “Why, let the strucken deer go weep,
                      The hart ungalled play;
                    For some must watch, while some must sleep:
                      Thus runs the world away."
    Now these characteristics were amongst the things which made the
great difficulty, almost impossibility, of acting Hamlet satisfactorily.
The player is disposed to put too much way, if it may be so said, on
the boat in order to steer it. He cannot combine the interest which
Hamlet, from the activity of his mind, still takes in other things with
his great concern in his main pursuit and mission. Whereas Hamlet’s
fancy is so various, his wit so ready, his versatility so great, his in
terest in all he touches so vivid, that this one strong absorbing current,
which the actor gives him as to his mission of vengeance, is to a

 certain extent contrary to his bent, and to a sort of waywardness which
 is a part of him, and which is very hard to render. Thus (to take an
 example) it has been said no player has ever been able to give rightly
 the words, “ Well said, old mole, can’st work so fast i’ the earth,”
 so as to combine with the recklessness and levity of the phrase, and
the turn of thought shown in it, the due and deep reverence for his
father which was an absolute and integral part of Hamlet’s nature.
      There was one further proof in illustration of all this power and
versatile intellect in Hamlet which the speaker was unwilling wholly
to pass over, because it was furnished by a test which he did not
remember to have seen elsewhere applied. He would assert that Hamlet
was so “ myriad-minded,” so had the intellect, feeling, perceptions of
every one else, and that we are so unconsciously conscious of this (if
the expression might be used), that we should recognize a very large
number of other speeches as natural in his person. He would say,
try other people’s sayings throughout the other plays in the mouth
of Hamlet, and it will be found he might have said them—he would
not say all, but to an enormous extent-with perfect justness and con
sistency, though of so very various and different kinds.
     And this would be found to be all the more remarkable because,
for the most part, Shakespeare’s speeches in the mouths of their dif
ferent speakers are entirely characteristic, suitable only to those who
utter them. They are not at all, as a rule, interchangeable, and no
one but the man who does say them should say them. So that it has
been a<U+FB02>irmed, perhaps with a little exaggeration of phrase but yet
certainly with an underlying truth, “Were all Shakespeare's plays
to be acted at once, they would require upwards of 700 performers,
besides crowds and suites, yet of all these personages not one in the
least resembles another ; there is no repetition; this variety, coupled
with the perfect truth to nature in each case, is marvellous, one is
almost tempted to say, miraculous?"E Now this would be found true
to the extent that we ought to be able, when a few lines of any dis
tinctive bearing are recited, even if we do not remember the passage,
to give at least a good guess at the speaker. For instance, take the
lmes :—
                 . . . “ Ol that a man might know
                 But     sui<U+FB01>ce't'h
                 The itend  of this that
                                     day'sthe
                                            business

                 And then the end is known.”
     Now whose speech is this ? Any man perhaps in an amiious pant
ing expectation of some great event might say the <U+FB01>rst two lines
                 . . . “O! that a man might know
                 The end of this day’s business e’er it come."

sophy; the calm resignation to what shall be; the very turn of the

  phrase-not the end will be known, but the end is known-points to
  one man as the speaker—Brutus, before the battle of Philippi. And
  yet Hamlet might have said the words, and given expression to their
  sentiment in every part. Take other different speakers, and yet the
  rule would hold good. Who but himself would seem able to say the
  majestic lines of Prospero, describing the lapse and fall of the earth
  and all that therein is ?—

     Sm HENRY HOLLAND, Bart. M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. President,
                                   in the Chair.
                    A. VERNON Hancoua'r, Esq. M.A.
                           SECRETARY OF THE CHEMICAL SOCIETY.
           On the Rate at which Chemical Actions take place.
THE science of Chemistry may be de<U+FB01>ned as the science which inves
tigates the relations of the different kinds of matter one to another.
The conception of different kinds of matter,—each of which has its
particular character, its own colour and crystalline form, its own hard
ness and brittleness or the reverse, its own conducting powers, its own
speci<U+FB01>c heat and speci<U+FB01>c gravity, and many other peculiarities of its
own, and each of which is homogeneous, the smallest particle having
all these properties equally with the largest mass,—is the fundamental
conception of Chemistry.
     And the whole world to a chemist is only a mixture of such different
kinds of matter, whose mode of aggregation has been and is being
determined by physical and vital forces which are foreign to his
science, but whose resemblances and differences, and whose changes
under changed conditions or by contact one with another, form the
subject of his study.
    In the study of any chemical change there are two things to be
discovered: <U+FB01>rst, the result of the change,—what kinds of matter have
ceased to exist and what have come into existence; and secondly, the
course of the change; as to which such inquiries as the following pre
sent themselves,—at what rate does the change occur, and under What
conditions ? Is it simple, or does it consist of several changes? Are
these dependent or independent, successive or simultaneous ?-—with
many others of a more hypothetical kind as to the molecular nature of

 1868.]            at which O'hemical Actions take place.              305'
the change. A familiar example of this twofold nature of chemical
inquiry may be drawn from the case of a <U+FB01>re, a chemical change which
has been more watched than any other. We know all that is to be
known as to the result of the change, when we have discovered that
the coals are a mixture of various hydrocarbons with a small quantity
of metallic salts, that the air is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, and
that when the <U+FB01>re has burnt out, there exists, instead of so much coal
and so much air, a quantity of carbonic acid and water, the salts, which
form the ash, and the nitrogen remaining mainly as they were. But
there is still much besides this to be found out as to the burning of the
<U+FB01>re. How, for example, is the rate at which it burns aifected by the
draught, or by the density of the air, or by the breaking up of the fuel,
or by access of the sun’s rays? What are the substances, formed
from the heated coal, which actually burn? Does the reduction of the
products of combustion by carbon play an important part in the phe
nomenon ? Such questions as these relate to the course of the chemical
change.
    The two lines of inquiry thus indicated have been pursued with
very unequal vigour. ‘ The study of the results of chemical action has
engrossed the attention of chemists almost to the exclusion of the
study of their course. And, indeed, so great is the number of different
kinds of matter, all capable of undergoing a multitude of changes by
the action of heat or electricity or by contact with others, giving rise
thus to new kinds of matter capable of similar changes, that this part
of the science appears absolutely boundless. The direction which
chemistry has taken in consequence of this superabundance of mate
rials may, perhaps, be contrasted with that taken by physical science.
If the number of distinct‘physical forces met with in nature, such as
gravity, magnetism, electricity, heat, light, &c., instead of being quite
a small number, had been a large number, and these forces had proved
to be convertible not only one into another but into an in<U+FB01>nite variety
of other distinct forces, physical experiméntalists might have occupied
themselves wholly with establishing the transmutations of one kind of
force into another and creating new modes of force, instead of studying
minutely, as they have done, the conditions under which the existing
forces are produced, and the laws which govern their distribution and
transformation.                                                      '
    It is, however, not only the vastness of the chemical <U+FB01>eld, and the
particular satisfaction which so solid a result as the creation of a new
kind of matter brings to the mind of the investigator, which has led
to the neglect of the study of the course of chemical changes. This
study is beset with peculiar di<U+FB02>iculties, and indeed, out of the vast
number of chemical changes whose results are known, there are but
very few whose course can readily be observed. The principal reason
of this is the velocity with which such changes take place; and this
velocity is apt to be the greatest in the case of the simple chemical
actions which are most suitable for investigation. Either, then, we
must contrive some mode of estimating a very great velocity, as has
    Von. V. (No. 48.)                                            z

been done for the measurement of the rate at which light and elec
tricity travel, or we must select a change—and this the variety of
chemistry makes possible—which proceeds at a rate convenient for
observation.
     Examples of the different velocity of chemical changes are furnished
by the precipitation of a barium and of a calcium salt from their solu
tions upon the addition of a sulphate. With the former, the change
is apparently instantaneous. The result is known, but the course can
not be observed. With the latter, the change is gradual, and it would
be possible to determine its rate at di<U+FB02>'erent temperatures and with
di<U+FB01>'erent quantities of the two salts in solution.
     The decomposition of a hyposulphite in an acid solution is another
 example of a gradual, observable change.                       4
     We may compare, also, the reduction of a chromate by a sulphite
 and by an oxalate. The former occupies no appreciable time; the
 actual time is, doubtless, greater in a more dilute solution and at a
 lower temperature, but we cannot discern any difference. But with
 an oxalate for reducing agent, though the <U+FB01>nal result of the change
 is the same, the action takes a long time to accomplish itself, and it
 would be quite practicable to observe in what way different circum
 stances affect its rate.
      But in order to discover the laws which govern the rate of any
 chemical change, some exact mode of measuring the rate is necessary.
 It remains to show how this may be accomplished in certain cases.
      A solution of ammonium nitrite, heated to a temperature of about
 80° C. in a flask provided with a gas delivery tube, gives off a quantity
 of nitrogen, which may be collected over the pneumatic trough. By
 keeping the temperature constant, and collecting the gas evolved
 during successive equal intervals of time in similar cylinders, it is
 possible at once to show the regular diminution in the volume of gas
 which is caused by the constant diminution of the quantity of salt in
  solution. And by making the experiment and measuring the quan
  tities of gas with accuracy, it would be possible to discover the relation
  between the amount of change going on at any moment and the
  amount of salt in solution, and also, by making the experiment at
 different temperatures, to discover how the temperature of the solution
  affects the rate at which the action takes place.
      The reduction of a permanganate‘by an oxalate in an acid solution
 furnishes another case of a gradual measurable change, and has been
  more fully studied. Here it is possible to start the change at any
  moment by adding the measured quantity of permanganate to the
  other ingredients and mixing rapidly. It is also possible to stop it
  at any moment by adding a solution of iodide to the mixture; and the
  iodine which is set free by the action of the residual permanganate
  corresponds to it in quantity and can readily be estimated. By
  making a number of such experiments, differing from one another only
  in the time during which the gradual change is allowed to proceed, its
  course may be traced throughout with any required degree of minute

ness.   The results obtained in many series of such experiments are
given in the ‘Philosophical Transactions for 1866,’ p. 206. The
general conclusion to which they lead is that the total amount of
change occurring at any moment is directly proportional, all other
conditions being alike, to the amount of permanganate in the solution.
    The last chemical change which has been investigated from this
point of view, is that whicli takes place when dilute acid solutions of
an iodide and a dioxide,'such as barium or sodium dioxide, are mixed
together. By arranging suitably the dilution, acidity, and tempe
rature of the solution, the change may be made to proceed at any rate
that is most convenient for measurement. One of the products of the
change is iodine, a substance for which we have, in its action on
starch, a most delicate test. By bringing a small known quantity of
hyposulphite into the liquid, all the iodine that is formed by the
gradual reaction of peroxide and iodide is reconverted into iodide, and
this continues till iodine enough has been formed to remove all the
hyposulphite. As soon as the last particle of hyposulphite has been
removed (converted into tetrathionate), free iodine appears‘ in the
solution, and the moment of its appearance may be noted by carefully
watching the colour of the liquid. By adding successive quantities
of hyposulphite, and observing the interval which elapses between
successive reappearances of the blue colour of the iodide of starch<U+FB01>éit
is possible accurately to determine the rate at which the change is
proceeding. An account of a number of experiments made in this
way, and of their results, is to be found in the ‘ Philosophical Trans
actions for 1867,’ p. 117. Each set of observations determines at
what rate the dioxide is reduced under certain de<U+FB01>nite conditions;
and by making di<U+FB01>'erent series of experiments, in which the several
conditions affecting the rate of change are systematically varied, it is
possible to discover the laws of connection between each of the
conditions and the amount of change. Having discovered these laws,
our knowledge of the change is so far complete, and we can predict
with certainty the time that would be required for any given amount
of change under any given circumstances.
    The following propositions embody the principal conclusions to
which the examination of these cases of gradual chemical change has
led :—
    1. The rate at which a chemical change proceeds is constant
under constant conditions, and is independent of the time that has
elapsed since the change commenced.
    2. When any substance is undergoing a chemical change, of
which no condition varies, excepting the diminution of the changing
substance, the amount of change occurring at any moment is directly
proportional to the quantity of the substance.
    3. When two or more substances act one upon another, the amount
of action at any moment is directly proportional to the quantity of
each of the substances.
    4. When the rate of any chemical change is affected by the

   presence of a substance, which itself takes no part in the change,
   the acceleration or retardation produced is directly proportional to

       5. The relation between the rate of a chemical change occurring
   in a solution, and the temperature of the solution, is such, that for
   every additional degree the number expressing the rate is to be multi
   plied by a constant quantity.                         ’

           On some of the Conditions of Mental Development.
IF you will carefully consider what it is that you have done most often
during this day, I think you can hardly avoid being drawn to this con
clusion : that you have really done nothing else from morning to night
but change your mind. You began by waking up. Now that act of
waking is itself a passage of the mind from an unconscious to a
conscious state, which is about the greatest change that the mind can
undergo. Your <U+FB01>rst idea upon waking was probably that you were
going to rest for some time longer ; but this rapidly passed away, and
was changed into a desire for action, which again transformed itself
into volition, and produced the physical act of getting up. From this
arose a series of new sensations ; that is to say, a change of mind from
the state of not perceiving or feeling these things to the state of feel
ing them. And so afterwards. Did you perform any deliberate
action? There was the change of mind from indecision to decision,
from decided desire to volition, from volition to act. Did you perform
an impulsive action ‘5' Here there is the more sudden and conspicuous
change marked by the word impulsive; as if your mind were a shuttle
cock, which has its entire state of motion suddenly changed by the
impulse of the battledore: conceive the shuttlecock descending quite
regularly with a gentle corkscrew motion——the battlcdore intervenes—
instantaneously the shuttlecock <U+FB02>ies off in a totally unexpected direc
tion, having apparently no relation to its previous motion; and you
will see how very apt and expressive a simile you use when you speak
of certain people as having an impulsive temperament. Have you felt
happy or miserable ‘? It was a change in your way of looking at things
in general; a transition, as Spinoza says, from a lower to a higher
state of perfection, or vice 've'rsd. In a word, whatever you have done,
or felt, or thought, you will <U+FB01>nd upon re<U+FB02>ection that you could not
possibly be conscious of anything else than a change of mind.
    But then, you will be inclined to say, this change is only a small
thing after all. It does not penetrate beyond the surface of the mind,

312                          Mr. Kingdo'n Cli<U+FB01>‘ord                  [March 6,
so to speak. Your character, the general attitude which you take up with
regard to circumstances outside, remains the same throughout the day :
even for great numbers of days. You can distinguish between indi
vidual people to such an extent that you have a general idea of how a
given person will act when placed in given circumstances. Now for
this to be the case, it is clear that each person must have retained his
individual character for a considerable period, so that you were able to
take note of his behaviour in different cases, to frame some sort of
general rules about it, and from them to calculate what he would do in
any supposed given case. But is it true that this character or mark
by which you know one person from another is absolutely <U+FB01>xed and
unvarying? Do you not speak of the character of a child growing
into that of a man; of a man in new circumstances being quite a dif
ferent person from what he was before ? Is it not regarded as the
greatest stroke of art in a novelist that he should be able not merely
to draw a character at any given time, but also to sketch the growth of
it through the changing circumstances of life? In fact, if you con
sider a little further, you will see that it is not even true that a.
character remains the same for a single day : every circumstance,
however trivial, that in any way affects the vmind, leaves its mark,
in<U+FB01>nitely small it may be, imperceptible in itself, but yet more inde
lible than the stone-carved hieroglyphics of Egypt. And the sum of
all these marks is precisely what we call the character, which is thus
itself a history of the entire previous life of the individual; which is
therefore continually being added to, continually growing, continually
in a state of change.
     Let me illustrate this relation by the examplaof the motion of a
planet. People knew, ages and ages ago, that a planet was a thing
constantly moving about from one place to another; and they made
continual attempts to discover the character of its motion, so that by
observing the general way in which it went on, they might be able to
tell where it would be at any particular time. And they invented
 most ingenious and complicated ways of expressing this character:
                         “ Cycle on epicycle, orb on orb,"
 nomy,

 system, he would have tendered some good advice: But the fact was
 that they were all wrong, and the real case was by no means so
 complicated as they supposed it to be. Kepler was the <U+FB01>rst to discover
 what was the real character of a planetary orbit; and he did this in
 the case of the planet Mars. He found that this planet moved in an
 ellipse or oval curve round the sun which was situated rather askew
 near the middle. But upon further observation, this was found to be
 not quite exact; the orbit itself is revolving slowly round the sun, it
 is getting elongated and then <U+FB02>attened in turns, and even the plane in
 which the motion takes place sways slowly from side to side of its
 mean position. Thus you see that although the elliptic character of

1868.]       on some of the Conditions of Mental Dcvelopement.          313
the motion does represent it with considerable exactness for a long
time together, yet this character itself must be regarded as incessantly
in a state of gradual change. But the great point of the comparison
to aid in the conception of which, in fact, I have used the comparison
at all ~~is this: that for no two seconds together does any possible
ellipse accurately represent the orbit. It is impossible for the planet
to move a single inch on its way, without the oval having slightly
turned round, become slightly elongated or shortened, and swayed
slightly out of its plane; so that the oval which accurately represented
the motion at one end of the inch would not accurately represent the
motion at the other end. The application is obvious. In like manner
it is true that the character which will roughly represent the law of a
man’s actions for some considerable time, will not accurately represent
that law for two seconds together. N0 action can take place in
accordance with the character without modifying the character itself;
just as no motion of a planet could take place along its orbit without
a simultaneous change in the orbit itself.
     But I will go even further. Historians are accustomed to say that
at any given point of a nation’s history there is a certain general type
which prevails among the various changes of character which different
men undergo. There is some kind of law, they say, which regulates
the slow growth of each character from childhood to age; so that if
you compared together all the biographies you would <U+FB01>nd a sort of
family likeness, suggesting that some common force had acted upon
them all to make these changes. This force they call the Spirit of the
Age. The spirit, then, which determines all the changes of character
that take place, which is, therefore, more persistent than character itself,
is this, at last, a thing absolutely <U+FB01>xed, permanent, free from <U+FB02>ue
tuations? No: for the entire history of humanity is an account of
its continual changes. It tells how there were great waves of change
which spread from country to country, and swept over whole continents,
and passed away; to be succeeded by similar waves. No history can
be philosophical which does not trace the origin and course of these:
things far more important than all the kings and rulers and battles
and dates which some people imagine to be history.
     To recapitulate. The mind is changing so constantly that we only
know it by its changes. The law of _these changes, which we call
character, is also a thing which is continually changing though more
slowly. And that law or force which governs all the changes of cha
racter in a given people at a given time, which we call the spirit of
the age, this also changes, though more slowly still.
     Now it is a belief which, whether true or not, we are all of us
constantly acting upon, that these changes have some kind of <U+FB01>xed
relation to the surrounding circumstances. In every part of our con
duct towards other people we proceed constantly upon the assumption
that what they will do is to a certain extent, and in some way or other,
dependent upon what we do. If I want a man to treat me with kind
ness and respect, I have to behave in a certain way towards him. If

I Want to produce a more special and de<U+FB01>ned effect, I have recourse to
threats or promises. ‘And even if I want to produce a. certain change
of mind in myself, I proceed upon the same assumption that in some
way or other, and to a certain extent, I am dependent on the sur
rounding circumstances. People tie knots in their handkerchiefs to
make themselves remember things; they also read de<U+FB01>nite books with
a view of putting themselves into de<U+FB01>nite mental states or moods; and
attempts are constantly made to produce even a further and more
permanent effect, to effect an alteration in character. What else is
the meaning of schools, prisons, reformatories, and the like? Some
have actually gone further than this : there have not been wanting
enterprising and far-seeing statesmen who have attempted to control
and direct the Spirit of the Age. New in all these cases in which we
use means to an end, we are clearly proceeding on the assumption that
 there is some <U+FB01>xed relation of cause and effect, in virtue of which the
Jneans we adopt may be antecedently expected to bring about the end
 we are in pursuit of. We are all along assuming, in fact, that changes
 of mind are connected by some <U+FB01>xed laws or relations with surround
 ing circumstances. Now this being so, since every mind is thus
 continually changing its character for better or worse, and since the
 character of a race or nation is subject to the same constant change ;
 since also these changes are connected in some de<U+FB01>nite manner with
 surrounding circumstances; the question naturally presents itself,
 What is that attitude of mind which is likely to change for the better ?
 All the individuals of a race are changing in character, all changing
 in different directions, with every possible degree of divergence; also
 the average character itself, the Spirit of the Age, is either changing
 in some one de<U+FB01>nite direction, or tending to split into two di<U+FB01>'erent
 characters: an individual, therefore, may be going with the race or
 dropping out of it; a portion of the race may be going right or wrong.
 Let us suppose that some portion of the race is going right and im
 proving: the question is, in what way are we to distinguish that
 individual who is improving with the race, from the others who are
 either dropping out of the march altogether or going wrong ‘?
      Now what I have proposed to myself to do to-night is this, merely
 to suggest a method by which this question may ultimately be
 answered. I shall also endeavour afterwards to point out what I
 conceive to be one or two results of this method : but this part will
 be of minor importance; the results depend upon my application of
 the method, can be only partially true, and may be wholly false; the
 method itself I believe to be altogether a true one, and one which
 must ultimately lead to the correct results.
      It consists in observing and making use of a certain analogy,
 namely, the analogy between the mind and the visible forms of organic
 life. You know that every animal and every plant is constantly going
 through a series of changes. The <U+FB02>ower closes at night and opens in
 the morning; trees are bare in winter and covered with leaves in
 siunnzer; while the growth of every organism from birth to maturity

cannot fail to strike you as a forcible illustration of the gradual change
of character in the human mind. In fact, it is the peculiarity of living
things not merely that they change under the in<U+FB02>uence of surrounding
circumstances, but that any change which takes place in them is not
lost but retained, and, as it were, built into the organism to serve as
the foundation for future actions. If you cause any distortion in the
growth of a tree and make it crooked, whatever you may do afterwards
to make the tree straight, the mark of your distortion is there ; it is
absolutely indelible; it has become part of the tree’s nature, and will
even be transmitted in some small degree to the seeds. If, however,
you take a piece of inanimate matter-a lump of gold, say, which is
yellow and quite hard-you melt it, and it becomes liquid and green
here an enormous change has been produced; but let it cool; it returns
to the solid and yellow condition, and looks precisely as before-there
is no trace whatever of the actions that have been going on. No one
can tell by examining a piece of gold how often it has been melted
and cooled in geologic ages by changes of the earth’s crust, or even in
the last year by the hand of man. Anyone who cuts down an oak
can tell by the rings in its trunk how many times winter has frozen it
into widowhood and summer has warmed it into life. A living being
must always contain within itself the history not merely of its own
existence but of all its ancestors. Seeing then that in its continual
changes and in the preservation of the records of those changes every
organism resembles the mind, so that toqthis extent they belong to the
same order of phenomena, may we not reasonably suppose that the
laws of change are alike, if not identical, in the two cases ? This is
of course a mere supposition, not deducible from anything which we
have yet observed, which requires therefore to be tested by facts. I
shall endeavour to show that the supposition is well founded; that
such laws of change as have been observed in animals and plants do
equally hold good in the case of the mind. I shall then endeavour to
<U+FB01>nd out what we mean by higher and lower in the two cases, and
to show, in fact, that We mean much the same thing. Supposing all
this to have been done, the question will have been stated in a form
which it is possible to answer. I shall then make an attempt to give
part of the answer to it.
      In investigating the laws of change of organic beings I shall make
 use of what is called the evolution-hypothesis, which, as applied to
 this subject, is much the same thing as the Darwinian theory, though
 it is not by any means tied down to the special views of Mr. Darwin.
 But I shall use this merely as an hypothesis; and the validity of the
 method of investigation which I have suggested is entirely independent
 of the truth of that hypothesis. If you will pardon me for a short time,
 I should like to illustrate somewhat further what I mean by this.
      When Kepler found out what was the form of the orbit described
 by the planet Mars, he thought that the planet was driven by some
 force which acted in the direction in which the planet was going. I
 have known people who learned a certain amount of astronomy for

316                        Mr. Kingdcn Gli<U+FB01>'ord                [March 6,
nautical purposes, whose ideas were very similar to those of Kepler.
They thought that the sun’s rotation was what caused the planets to
revolve about him, just as if you spin a teaspoon in the middle of a
cup of tea, it makes the bubbles go round and round. But Newton
discovered that the real state of the case was far different. If you
fasten a ball on to the end of an elastic string, and then swing it
round and round, you can make the ball describe an orbit very similar
to that of the planet, so that your hand is not quite in the centre of it.
Now here the pulling force does not act in the direction in which the
ball is going, but always in the direction of your hand, and yet the ball
revolves about your hand and never actually comes to it. Newton
supposed that the case of the planet was similar to that of the ball;
that it was always pulled in the direction of the sun, and that this
attraction or pulling of the sun produced the revolution of the planet
in the same way that the traction or pulling of the elastic string pro
duces the revolution of the ball. W'hat there is between the sun and the
planet that makes each of them pull the other, Newton did not know;
nobody knows to this day; and all we are now able to assert positively
is that the known motion of the planet is precisely what would be
produced if it were fastened to the sun by an elastic string, having a
certain law of elasticity. Now observe the nature of this discovery,
the greatest in its consequences that has ever yet been made in
physical science :—
    I. It begins with a hypothesis, by supposing that there is an
analogy between the motion of a planet and the motion of a ball
at the end of a string.      .
    II. Science becomes independent of the hypothesis, for we merely
use it to investigate the properties of the motion, and do not trouble
ourselves further about the cause of it.
    I will take another example. It has been supposed for a long
time that light consists of waves transmitted through an extremely
thin ethereal jelly that pervades all space; it is easy to see the very
rapid tremor which spreads through a jelly when you strike it at one
point. From this hypothesis we can deduce laws of the propagation
of light, and of the way in which different rays interfere with one
another, and the laws so deduced are abundantly con<U+FB01>rmed by experi
ment. But here also science kicks down the ladder by which she
has risen. In order to explain the phenomena of light it is not
necessary to assume anything more than a periodical oscillation be
tween two states at any given point of space. What the two states
are nobody knows; and the only thing we can assert with any degree
of probability is that they are not states of merely mechanical displace
ment like the tremor of a jelly; for the phenomena of <U+FB02>uorescence
appear to negative this supposition. Here again, then, the same two
remarks may be made. The scienti<U+FB01>c discovery appears <U+FB01>rst as the
hypothesis of an analogy; and science tends to become independent
of the hypothesis.

1868.]     on some of the Conditions of Mental Developement.        317
    The theory of heat is another example. If you hold one end of a
poker in the <U+FB01>re, the other end becomes hot, even though it is not
exposed to the rays of the <U+FB01>re. Fourier, in trying to <U+FB01>nd the laws of
this spread of heat from one part of a body to another part, made the
hypothesis that heat was a <U+FB02>uid which <U+FB02>owed from the hot end into
the cold as water <U+FB02>ows through a pipe. From this hypothesis the
laws of conduction were deduced; but in the process it was found that
the very same laws would <U+FB02>ow from other hypotheses. In fact, what
ever can be explained by the motion of a <U+FB02>uid can be equally well
explained either by the attraction of particles or by the strains of a
solid substance; the very same mathematical calculations result from
the three distinct hypotheses; and science, though completely inde
pendent‘of all three, may yet choose one of them as serving to link
together different trains of physical inquiry.
    Now the same two remarks which may be made in all these cases
apply equally to the evolution hypothesis. It is grounded on a
supposed analogy between the growth of a species and the growth
of an individual. -It supposes, for instance, that the race of crabs
has gone through much the same sort of changes as every crab goes
through now, in the course of its formation in the egg, its pristine
shape utterly unlike what it afterwards attains, its gradual meta
morphosis and formation of shell and claws. By this analogy the
laws of change are suggested, and these are afterwards checked and
corrected by the facts. But as before, science tends to become inde
pendent of hypothesis. The laws of change are established for present
and <U+FB01>nitely distant times; but they give us no positive information
about the origin of things.      So, therefore, if I make use of this
hypothesis to represent to you the laws of change that are deduced
from it; you will see that the truth of those laws and the conclusions
which may be drawn from them are in no way dependent on the truth
of the hypothesis.
    There are certain errors current about the nature of the evolution
theory which I wish particularly to guard against. In the <U+FB01>rst place it
is very commonly supposed that all existing animals can be arranged
in one continuous chain, from the highest to the lowest; that the
transition is gradual all through, and that nature makes no jumps.
This idea was worked out into a system of classi<U+FB01>cation by Linnaeus,
and survived among naturalistsi'until the time of Cuvier. “ They were
bent,” says Agassiz, “upon establishing one continual uniform series
to embrace all animals, between the links of which it was supposed
there were no unequal intervals.” . . ' . “They called their \system
la chatne des étres.” The holders of the Darwinian theory am then
supposed to believe that all these forms grew out of one another,‘
beginning with the lowest and ending with the highest; so that any
one animal of the series has in the course of its evolution passed
through all the lower forms. And as the species is thus supposed to
have grown up through the chain, and the lower species to be con
tinually growing into the higher, so it is imagined that every indi

  vidual creature, in the course of its production, passes through the
  lower adult forms; that a chicken, for instance, while it is being
  formed in the egg, becomes in succession a snail, an insect, a fish,
  and a reptile, before it becomes a bird. Now that all these ideas are
  entirely wrong, I need hardly remind you; and I have mentioned
  them in order that there may be no mistake about the theory which I
  am using as an analogy. So far is it from being possible to arrange
  existing organisms in a single line or chain, that they cannot be
  adequately represented even in the manner which is attempted in
  the following diagram taken from Spencer's “Principles of Biology,’

       In the next place, no existing organism could possibly grow into
  any other. What is really supposed is this:—that if you went back

1868.]     on some of the Conditions of Mentat Developement.         319
a million years or so, and made a picture like this one, representing
the forms that existed then, no single spot which is covered in one
<U+FB01>gure would be covered in the other; but the general arrangement
would be very similar, except that all the groups would be nearer to
the centre or radiant point, and therefore nearer to each other. And
if you made a third picture, representing the state of things another
million years or so further back, then they would be still nearer to
gether; and at a distance of time too vast to be represented, they
would all converge into this radiant point. So the theory is that at
that stupendous distance of time all species were alike, mere specks
of jelly: that they gradually diverged from each other and got more
and more different, till at last they attained the almost in<U+FB01>nite variety
that we now <U+FB01>nd. If you will imagine a tree with spreading branches,
like an oak; then the outside leaves at any time may be taken to re
present all the existing species at a given time. It is quite impossible
to arrange them in any serial order. As the tree grows, the outer
leaves diverge, and get further from the trunk and from each other;
and two extremities that have once diverged never converge and grow
together again. But even this simile is insufficient; for species may
diverge in a far greater variety of directions than the branches of a
tree. Space has not dimensions enough to represent the true state of
the case.
      Von Baer’s doctrine of developement is illustrated by the same
<U+FB01>gure. If you took embryos of polypes, and snails, and cuttle-<U+FB01>sh,
and insects, and crabs, and <U+FB01>sh and frogs, and if you could watch
their gradual growth into these several animals: at <U+FB01>rst they would
be all absolutely alike and indistinguishable. Then, after a little
while, you would <U+FB01>nd that they might be sorted off into these four
great classes. Afterwards these groups might be divided into smaller
groups, representing orders; then these into families and genera; last
of all would appear those differences which would separate them into
 sp ecies.
      The evolution-hypothesis, then, represents a race of animals or
 plants as a thing slowly changing: and it also represents these changes
 as connected by <U+FB01>xed laws with the action of the surrounding cir
 cumstances, or, as it is customary to say, the environment. Now the
 action of the environment on a race is of two kinds, direct and
 indirect. That part which is called direct action is very easily under
 stood. There is no di<U+FB02>iculty in seeing how changes of climate
 might produce changes in the colour of the skin, or how new condi
 tions which necessitated the greater use of any organ would lead to
 the increase of that organ, as we know that muscles may be made
 to swell with exercise ; and changes thus made habitual would in time
 be inherited. But the indirect action of the environment, which is
 called natural selection, is still more important. The mode of its
  operation may be seen from an example. There are two butter<U+FB02>ies
  in South America, nearly resembling one another in form, but one of
  which has a very sweet taste and is liked by the birds, while the other

320                        Mr. Kingdon Gli<U+FB02>‘ord                [March 6,
is bitter and distasteful to them. Now suppose that, for some reason
or other, sweet butter<U+FB02>ies were occasionally produced with markings
similar to the bitter ones, these, being mistaken by the birds for bitter
ones, would run less chance- of being eaten, and therefore more chance
of surviving and leaving offspring. If this peculiarity of marking is
at all inheritable, then the number of sweet butter<U+FB02>ies with bitter
marks will in the next generation be greater in proportion to the
whole number than before; and, as this process goes on, the sweet
butter<U+FB02>ies which retain their distinguishing marks will be all weeded
out by the birds, and the entire species will have copied the markings
of the bitter species. This has actually taken place : the one species
has mimicked the markings of the other. Here we see the working
of Natural Selection. Any variation in an individual which gives him
an advantage in the struggle for life is more likely to be transmitted
to offspring than any other variation, because the individual is more
likely to survive; so that nature gradually weeds out all those forms
which are not suited to the environment, and thustends to produce
equilibrium between the species and its surrounding circumstances.
Changes, then, are produced in a species by the selection of advan
tageous changes which happen to be made in individuals. Now there
are three kinds of change that are produced in individuals : change of
size, or growth; change of structure, that is to say, change in the
shape and arrangement of the parts, as when the cartilaginous skeleton
of an infant becomes hardened into bone; and change of function,
that is to say, change in the use which is made of any part of the
organism. I have one or two remarks to make about the <U+FB01>rst of these,
namely, growth, or change of size. Every organism is continually
taking in matter through the external surface to feed the inside. A
certain quantity of this is needed to make up for the waste that is
continually going on. But let us suppose, to begin with, that an
organism has more surface than it absolutely wants to make up for
waste, then a certain portion of the assimilated matter, or food, will
remain over, and the organism will increase in size. But, you say,
if this is all that is meant by growth, why does it not go on for
ever‘! The explanation is very simple. I take this cube, which has
six sides, each a square inch; let us suppose it to represent an animal,
and imagine, to begin with, that two of the sides by themselves are
capable of feeding the whole mass, then the nutrition taken in by the
other four sides is left over, and the mass must increase in size.
Imagine it now grown to twice the linear dimensions, that is to say,
to a cube every side of which is two inches. The mass to be fed is
now eight times what it was, while the surface is only four times as
great; of the twenty-four square inches of surface sixteen are taken
up with feeding the mass, while only eight, or one-third, are left to
supply the materialsv for growth. Still there is an overplus, and the
organism will grow. Let it now acquire three times its original
height and breadth and thickness, the mass is twenty-seven times as
great, and the surface only nine times : that is to say, while there are

 1868.]     on some of the Conditions of Mental Development.         321
twenty-seven cubic inches to be fed, there are just <U+FB01>fty-four square
inches to feed them. There is no longer any overplus; the organism
will stop growing. And it is a general rule that, in any case, when a
thing grows its mass increases much faster than its surface. However
much, therefore, the feeding power of the surface may be in excess to
begin with, the mass must inevitably catch it up, and the growth
will stop.
     Now the changes of an individual mind may be reduced to the
same three types :—
        Growth.
        Change of structure.
        Change of function.
    First then, what is the growth of the mind ? It is the acquisition of
new knowledge ; not merely of that which is required to make up for
our wonderful power of forgetting, for oblivion is really a far more
marvellous thing than memory; but of a certain overplus which goes
to increase the entire mass of our mental experiences. Now I do not
know whether there is any race between surface and mass here as in
the case of an organism; but it is certainly true that whereas in child
hood the amount we forget is very little, and our powers of acquisition
preponderate immensely over our powers of oblivion; as we grow up,
the powers of oblivion gain rapidly upon the acquisitive ones, and
<U+FB01>nally catch them up; the growth ceases as soon as this balance is
attained. So that in this <U+FB01>rst law, you see, there is an entire analogy
between the two cases.
    In the next place, the mind experiences changes of structure ; that -
is to say, changes in the shape and arrangement of its parts. Ideas
which were only feebly connected become aggregated into a close
and compact whole. The ideas of several different qualities, for
instance, which we never thought of as connected with each other,
are brought together by the qualities being found to exist in the same
object. In this way we form conceptions of things, which gradually
get so compact that we cannot even in thought separate them into
their component parts. Portions of our knowledge which we held as
distinct are connected together by scienti<U+FB01>c theories; images which
were scattered all about are bound up into living bundles by the artist,
and so we <U+FB01>nd them re-arranged.
    Lastly, changes of function take place. Everybody knows how
the mental faculties open out and become visible as a child grows up.
Men acquire faculties by practice. And without any conscious seek
ing, you must know how often we wake up as it were and <U+FB01>nd ourselves
gifted with new powers. We have found evidence then of the existence
of our three types of change,_—growth, structure, and function.
    The actions therefore which go on between the environment and
the individual may be reduced to the same three types in the case of the
mind as in the ease of any visible organism. Being somewhat encou
raged by this result, let us go back to our original question, What
    Von. V. (No. 48.)                                        2 A

322                          Mr. Kingdon Clifford                [March 6,
is that attitude of mind which is likely to change for the better?
What is the meaning of better?
    Although it is quite impossible to arrange all existing organisms
in a serial chain, yet we certainly have a general notion of higher
and lower. A bird weregard as higher than a fish, and a dog is higher
than a snake. And if we return to our illustration of the tree, we shall
see that at every point, at any given time, there is a definite direction
of developement. So that though we might not be able to say which
of two co-existing organisms was the higher, yet by comparing a
species with itself at a time shortly after, we might say whether it
had degenerated or improved. Now by examining various cases, we
shall find that there are six marks of improvement:—
     The parts of the organism get more different.
             35     33     35       95      connected.
    The organism gets more different from the environment.
              35       5*       connected with the environment.
     The organism gets more different from other individuals.
              35       35       connected with other individuals.
     The processes in fact which result in developement are made up
of differentiation and integration: differentiation means the making
things to be different, integration means the binding them together
into a whole; these are applied to the parts of the organism, the
organism and surrounding nature, the organism and other organisms.
Differentiation of parts is illustrated by the figure on the opposite page.
[Spencer's “Principles of Biology, vol. ii., p. 187.]
     Integration of parts means the connected play of them; so that
one being touched the rest are affected. Differentiation from the en
vironment takes place in weight, composition, and temperature. A
polype is little else than sea-water, which it inhabits; a fish is several
degrees of temperature above it, and made of quite different materials;
till at last a mammal is 70° or 80° above the surrounding matter, and
made of still more different materials. Integration with the environ
ment means close correspondence with it; actions of the environment
are followed by corresponding actions of the animal. Differentiation
from other organisms means individuality; integration with them
sociality.
   In a similar way we have a sort of general notion of higher and
lower stages of mental developement. I will endeavour to show that
 this general notion resolves itself into a measure of the extent to
which the same six processes have gone on, namely:—
         Separation of parts,
         Connection of parts,
         Separation from the environment,
         Closer correspondence with the environment,
         Separation from other individuals.
         Sociality.

 1868.]    on some of the Conditions of Mental Developement.          323
    The only conception we can form of a purely unconscious state is
one in which all is exactly alike, or rather, in which there is no dif
ference.
                There is not one thing with another
                But Evil saith to Good: My brother,

                They shall not strive not cry for ever:
                No man shall choose between them: never
                  Shall this thing end and that thing be.
    The <U+FB01>rst indication of consciousness is a. perception of difference.
The child’s eyes follow the light. Immediately this colourless, homo
geneous universe splits up into two parts, the light part and the dark
part. A line is drawn across it, it is made heterogeneous, and the <U+FB01>rst
thing that exists is a distinction. Then other lines are drawn; appear
ance is separated into white, black, blue, red, and so on.    This is the
<U+FB01>rst process, the di<U+FB02>‘erentiation of the parts of consciousness. But by
                                                            2 A 2

324                        Mr. Kingdo'n Clzi<U+FB02>'ord             [March 6,
 and-by a number of these lines of distinction are found to enclose a
 de<U+FB01>nite space ; they assume relations to one another; the lines white,
 round, light, capable of being thrown at people, include the conception
 of a ball; this gains coherence, becomes one, a thing, holding itself
 together, not only separated from the rest of unconsciousness, but con
 nected in itself into a distinct whole, integrated. Here we have the
 second process. And throughout our lives the same two processes go
 hand in hand ; whatever we perceive is a line of demarcation between
 two different things ; we can be conscious of nothing but a separation,
 a change in passing from one thing to another. And these different
 lines of demarcation are constantly connecting themselves together,
marking out portions of our consciousness as complete wholes, and
making them cohere. Just as‘a sculptor clears away from a block of
 marble now this piece and now that, making every time a separation
 between what is to be kept and what is to be chipped off, till at last
 all these chippings manifest the connection that ran through them, and
the <U+FB01>nished statue stands out as a complete whole, a positive thing
made up of contradictory negations: so is a conception formed in the
mind.
     And this conception, when it is thus made into a whole, integrated,
 by an act of the mind, what does it immediately appear to be ? Why,
something outside of ourselves, a real thing, di<U+FB01>'erent from us.   This
 is the third process, the process of diferentiation from the environ
ment. This is beautifully described by Cuvier, who pictures the
<U+FB01>rst man wandering about in ecstacies at the discovery of so many
new parts of himself; till gradually he learns that they are not him
self, but things outside. This notion, then, of a thing being real,
 existing external to ourselves, is due to the active power of the mind
which regards it as one, which binds together all its boundaries. And
this goes on as long as we live. Constantly we frame to ourselves
more complicated combinations of ideas, and by giving them unity
make them real. And, at the same time, the converse process is
equally active. While more and more of our ideas are put outside of
us and made real, our minds are continually growing more and more
into accordance with the nature of external things; our ideas become
truer, more conformable to the facts; and at the same time they
answer more surely and completely to changes in the environment;
a new experience is more rapidly and more completely connected
with the sum of previous experiences. But there is more than this.
The action of these two laws taken together does in fact amount to the
creation of new senses. Men of science, for example, have to deal
with extremely abstract and general conceptions. By constant use
and familiarity, these, and the relations between them, become just as
real and external as the ordinary objects of experience; and the per
ception of new relations among them is so rapid, the correspondence
of the mind to external circumstances so great, that a real scienti<U+FB01>c
sense is developed, by which things are perceived as immediately and
truly as I see you now. Poets and painters and musicians also are

  1868.]     on some of the Conditions of Mental Developement.         325
  so accustomed to put outside of them the idea of beauty, that it becomes
  a real external existence, a thing which they see with spiritual eyes,
 and then describe to you, but by no means create, any more than we
 seem to create these ideas of table and forms and light, which we put
 together long ago. There is no scienti<U+FB01>c discoverer, no poet, no
 painter, no musician, who will not tell you that he found ready-made
 his discovery or poem or picture-—that it came to him from outside,
 and that he did not consciously create it from within. And there
 is reason to think that these senses or insights are things which
 actually increase among mankind. It is certain at least, that the
 scienti<U+FB01>c sense is immensely more developed now than it was three
 hundred years ago ; and though it may be impossible to <U+FB01>nd any absolute
 standard of Art, yet it is acknowledged that a number of minds which
 are subject to artistic training will tend to arrange themselves under
 certain great groups, and that the members of each group will give
 an independent yet consentient testimony about artistic questions.
 And this arrangement into schools, and the de<U+FB01>niteness of the con
clusions reached in each, are on the increase. So that here, it would
seem, are actually two new senses, the scienti<U+FB01>c and the artistic, which
the mind is now in the process of forming for itself. There are two
remaining marks of developement: differentiation from surrounding
minds, which is the growth of individuality; and closer corre
spondence with them, wider sympathies, more perfect understanding
of others. These, you will instantly admit, are precisely the twin
characteristics of a man of genius. He is clearly distinct from the
people that surround him, that is how you recognize him; but then
this very distinction must be such as to bind him still closer to them,
extend and intensify his sympathies, make him want their Wants,
rejoice over their joys, be cast down by their sorrows. Just as the
throat is a complicated thing, quite different from the rest of the body,
but yet is always ready to cry when any other part is hurt.
     We have thus got a tolerably de<U+FB01>nite notion of what mental
developement means. It is a process of simultaneous differentiation
and integration which goes on in the parts of consciousness, between
the mind and external things, between the mind and other minds.
And the question I want answered is, what attitude of mind tends to
further these processes ‘?
     I have now done all that it was my business to do, namely, I have
stated the question in a form in which it is possible to answer it.
There is no doubt that by a careful study of the operations of nature
we shall be able to <U+FB01>nd out what actions of an organism are favourable
to its higher developement. Having formulated these into a law, we
shall be able to interpret this law with reference to the mind.
     But now I am going to venture on a partial answer to this ques
tion. What I am going to say is mere speculation, and requires to be
veri<U+FB01>ed by facts.
     The changes which take place in an organism are of two kinds.
Some are produced by the direct action of things outside, and these

326                      Mr. Kingdo'n Clifford                  [March 6,
are to a great extent similar to the changes which we observe in inani
mate things. When a tree is bent over by the wind, and gets ulti
matcly <U+FB01>xed in this position, the change is in no way di<U+FB01>'erent from
that which takes place when we bend a wire and it does not entirely
return to its former straightness. Other changes are produced by the
spontaneous action of that store of force which by the process of
growth is necessarily accumulated within the organism. Such are all
those apparently disconnected motions which make up the great dis
tinction between living things and dead. Now my speculation is, that
advantageous permanent changes are always produced by the sponta
neous action of the organism, and not by the direct action of the
environment. This, I think, is most clear when we take an extreme
case. Let us suppose a race of animals that never had any changes
produced by their spontaneous activity. The race must at a certain
time have a de<U+FB01>nite amount of plasticity, that is, a de<U+FB01>nite power of
adapting itself to altered circumstances by changing in accordance
with them. Every permanent e<U+FB02>'ect of the environment upon them is
a crystallization of some part which before was plastic ; for the part
must have been plastic for the e<U+FB01>'ect to be produced at all; and as the
e<U+FB02>'ect is permanent, the part has to that extent lost in plasticity. As
this goes on, the race of animals will bind up in itself more and more
of its history, but will in that process lose the capability of change
which it once had ; at last it will be quite <U+FB01>xed, crystallized, incapable
of change. Then it must inevitably die out in time; for the environ-
ment must change sooner or later, and then the race, incapable of
changing in accordance with it, must be killed off. On the other
hand, any addition to the organism which is made by its spontaneous
activity is an addition of something which has not yet been acted
upon by the environment, which is therefore plastic, capable of inde
<U+FB01>nite modi<U+FB01>cation, in fact, an increase of power. The bending of a
tree by the wind is a positive disadvantage to it if the wind should
ever happen to blow from the other side. But when a plant, for no
apparent reason, grows long hairs to its seed-the material for which
may have been accidentally supplied by the environment, while its
use in this way is a spontaneous action of the plant—this is a. de<U+FB01>nite
increase of power ; for the new organ may be modi<U+FB01>ed in any conceiv
able way to suit the exigencies of the environment, may cling to the
sides of beasts, and so help the distribution of the seed, or e<U+FB01>'ect the
same object by being caught by the wind. Activity, in fact, is the
<U+FB01>rst condition of developement. A very good example of this occurs
in Professor Huxley’s lizards, of which you heard two or three weeks
ago. About the time marked by the primary strata it appears that
there was a race of lizards, thirty feet high, that walked on their hind
legs, balancing themselves by their long tails, and having three toes
like birds. This race diverged in three directions. Some of them
yielded to the immediate promptings of the environment, found it
convenient to go on all fours and eat <U+FB01>sh; they became crocodiles.
Others took to exercising their fore-legs violently, developed three

 1868.]     on some of the Conditions of Mental Developement.         327
long <U+FB01>ngers, and became birds. The rest were for a long while unde
cided whether they would use their arms or their legs most; at length
they diverged, and some became pterodactyles and others kangaroos.
For Mr. Seeley, of Cambridge, has discovered marsupial bones in
pterodactyles, that is to say, bones like those which were supposed
peculiar to the order of mammals to which the kangaroo belongs.
     Assuming now that this law is true, and that the developement of
an organism proceeds from its activities rather than its passivities, let
us apply it to the mind. What, in fact, are the conditions which
must be satis<U+FB01>ed by a mind in process of upward developement, so far
as this law gives them ‘1’
     They are two; one positive, the other negative. The positive
condition is that the mind should act rather than assimilate, that its
attitude should be one of creation rather than of acquisition. If
scienti<U+FB01>c, it must not rest in the contemplation of existing theories,
or the learning of facts by rote ; it must act, create, make fresh powers,
discover new facts and laws. And if the analogy is true, it must create
things not immediately useful. I am here putting in a word for those
abstruse mathematical researches which are so often abused for having
no obvious physical application. The fact is that the most useful
parts of science have been investigated for the sake of truth, and not
for their usefulness. A new branch of mathematics, which has sprung
up in the last twenty years, was denounced by the Astronomer Royal
before the university of Cambridge as doomed to be forgotten, on
account of its uselessness. Now it turns out that the reason why
we cannot go further in our investigations of molecular action is that
we do not know enough of this branch of mathematics. If the mind is
artistic, it must not sit down in hopeless awe before the monuments of
the great masters, as if heights so lofty could have no heaven beyond
tlnm. Still less must it tremble before the conventionalism of one age,
when its mission may be to form the whole life of the age succeeding.
No amount of erudition or technical skill or critical power can absolve
the mind from the necessity of creating, if it would grow. And the
power of creation is not a matter of static ability, so that one man
absolutely can do these things and another man absolutely cannot; it
is a matter of habits and desires. The results of things follow not
from their state but from their tendency. The <U+FB01>rst condition then
of mental developement is that the attitude of the mind should be
creative rather than acquisitive: or, as it has been well said, that
intellectual food should go to form mental muscle and not mental
fat.
     The negative condition is plasticity: the avoidance of all such
crystallization as is immediately suggested by the environment. A
mind that would grow must let no ideas become permanent except

of absolute receptivity; admitting all, being modi<U+FB01>ed by all, but per
manently biassed by none. To become crystallized, <U+FB01>xed in opinion
and mode of thought, is to lose the great characteristic of life, by

which it is distinguished from inanimate nature: the power of
adapting itself to circumstances.
     This is true even more of the race. There are nations in the East
so enslaved by custom that they seem to have lost all power of change
except the capability of being destroyed. Propriety, in fact, is the
crystallization of a race. And if we consider that a race, in propor
tion as it is plastic and capable of change, may be regarded as young
and vigorous, while a race which is fixed, persistent in form, unable
to change, is as surely effete, worn out, in peril of extinction; we
shall see, I think, the immense importance to a nation of checking
the growth of conventionalities. It is quite possible for conventional
rules of action and conventional habits of thought to get such power
that progress is impossible, and the nation only fit to be improved
away. In the face of such a danger it is not right to be proper.

      SIR HENRY Hol.IAND, Bart. M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. President,

                          W. STANLEY JEvoNs, M.A.
   PROFESSOR AND COBDEN LECTURER ON POLITICAL ECONOMY IN OWENS COLLEGE, MANCHESTER.
                 On the Probable Exhaustion of our Coal Mines.
I. THE coal raised from the coal mines of the United Kingdom in
the year 1866 amounted to more than one hundred million tons (more
exactly 101,630,544 tons), according to the excellent returns published
by Mr. Robert Hunt, of the Mining Record Office. Reflecting upon
the full significance of this fact it may be asserted:—
     1. That the coal trade of this kingdom is the greatest trade, in
regard to the bulk and weight of the commodity, ever carried on.
     2. That every pound of that vast quantity of coal may be regarded
as a pound of the most intrinsically useful and valuable substance ever
discovered.                            -
     3. That the power and usefulness of coal is felt in every branch
of industry, and in almost every operation which we carry on.
    4. That Britain possesses the aid of this most invaluable substance
in an altogether peculiar degree; and
     5. That we cannot hope to stand very long in this most happy
position.
     II. So vast a quantity as 100,000,000 tons cannot be represented
to the eye or mind. Its bulk is 30 times as great as that of the
greatest single work of human hands, the Pyramid of Cheops. Greater

quantities of commodities are brought into British ports at present,
than are recorded in the history of any nation, and yet it would take
more than seven times as many vessels as those which enter our ports
in a year to carry the quantity of coal we use.
    More than half of the whole carrying power of the railways of the
United Kingdom, devoted to goods traffic, is occupied in the con
veyance of coal. So far as we can judge from returns, which do not
always distinguish the kinds of goods carried, the goods tra<U+FB01>ic of the
railways of the United Kingdom in 1865 was as follows :
                                                         Tons

    III. This vast trade in coal can only be accounted for by consi
dering the wonderful qualities with which coal is endowed. It is the
MAINSPBING or con MATERIAL INDUSTRY. It may be called the real
Philosopher’s Stone, which supplies us cheaply and plentifully with
everything that can conduce to the service of man. This extreme
usefulness of coal is due—
    1. To the enormous power which is latent in it, and is brought
forth when we burn it ;
    2. To the fact, now so clearly revealed by science, that force is the
key to all the changes of matter.
    By aid of the mechanical equivalent of heat, we can ascertain that
good coal contains latent force su<U+FB01>icient to raise its own weight
11,422,000 feet, or about 2100 miles against the force of gravity.
The coal raised in 1866 may further be calculated to contain force
equal to that which would be exerted by 530,000,000 horses, or
2,650,000,000 men, working eight hours a day for 300 working days
in the year.
    IV. This vast power is turned to use in an inde<U+FB01>nite multitude of
ways, which may thus be rudely classi<U+FB01>ed.

     It is only by thus collecting together the multitudinous uses of
 coal that we can gain an adequate idea of its importance to us and the
certainty that its use will extend.
     V. Comparing, now, the present yield of coal (100,000,000 tons
 annually) with the quantity which Mr. Hull believes to lie in these
 islands, within 4000 feet of the surface and in workable condition
 (83,544,000,000 tons), we <U+FB01>nd that we might continue to consume
 coal at our present annual rate for 835 years at least; but when We
 remember that our consumption has increased by 36 millions in the
 last twelve years (from about 65 millions in 1854 to 101,000,000
 in 1866), and that the causes of increase still continue in existence,
 we cannot attribute any importance to the above calculation. There is
 no appearance that steam navigation or railways have at all approached
 their full developement in this country; while in the steam-plough,
 in schemes of steam-drainage or water-supply, the employment of
 steam-produced hydraulic pressure, in the use of small gas-engines

in workshops, and in a multitude of other ways, we have some indica
tion of the increased future demand for coal.
     VI. Economy, it may be pointed out, does not tend to reduce the
industrial consumption of coal, but acts in the opposite direction:
by increasing the pro<U+FB01>tableness of coal-labour, it extends its use.
Almost every improvement in the engine for the last century and a
half has been directed to economizing the consumption of coal; and
yet the use of the engine and the quantities of coal consumed ad
vanced pari passu with its economical performance.
     It is altogether irrational to argue that progressive economy, which
has coexisted with and been the partial cause of advancing consump
tion in the past, will have the opposite effect in the future.
     VII. As regards the law of increase of coal consumption, both
experience and theory lead us to believe that the increase takes place
in a geometrical series, by multiplication rather than by mere addition.
The following numbers will illustrate the difference in question :—
  Arithmetieal Series, increasing by addition            ..  1   2   3   4  5     6  7   8
 Geometrical Series, increasing by multiplication 1              2 4 8     16    32 64 128
     The following table will show that when we can get accurate
statistics of the consumption of coal we <U+FB01>nd the increments inde
<U+FB01>nitely increasing, in the manner rather of a geometrical than of an
arithmetical series.

      The above and other statistics quoted in the ‘Goal Question,"\'
 Chapters IX. X. and XI., show that our industry grows by multipli
 cation, and by multiplication at a rising rather than at ‘a falling rate.
 The temporary depressions of trade which occur at intervals may
 sometimes seem to check the rapidity of this increase; but we have
 only to wait a year or two to see our industry advancing again with
 growing strides.                                                              _

       It is impossible to view, without some degree of alarm, so rapid an
 increase of the coal trade as the preceding <U+FB01>gures indicate. Without
 doubt our production will advance to 200 millions before very many
 years are past; and the alarming calculation may be made that if we went
 on increasing our production of coal for 110 years as rapidly as we have
 done during the last 12 years, our coal seams would be worked out to
 a depth of 4000 feet. But such a supposition is put forward, not as a
 serious possibility, but as'a reductio ad absurdum.                     The conclusion to
 be drawn from it is simply that the nation cannot possibly progress in
 material wealth for 110 years more as rapidly as it has done in the
 present century. The limited extent of our coal-<U+FB01>elds would not
 allow us to go on increasing the draught of coal as lavishly as we
 have done. But it is the very necessity of changing from a highly
progressive to a less progressive or stationary condition, that is most
grievous. Population and production, when once set in motion, move
with a certain impetus, and it is the check to such motion which is
distressing and threatening.
      VIII. The subject wears a more serious aspect still when we con
sider the coal resources and production of other countries as well as
our own.
      According to the latest returns which are at hand, it would seem
that the total known produce of coal in the world is thus distributed
over the chief nations :—

     ' I am kindly informed by Mr.‘ Hunt that when the returns of the consumption
of coal in 1867 are completed, the total will probably amount to 104,000,000 tons,
showing continued increase in spite of the depression of trade.

     It would appear then that of the total known produce of coal in
 the world we raise considerably more than half (57 per cent.),
 although we form probably not more than one in forty of the popu
 lation of the world. If to our own coal produce we add that of the
 United States and our colonies, we may conclude that the Teutonic
 race enjoys 73 per cent., or almost 3 parts out of 4, of the coal raised.
It is hardly possible to over-estimate the forces acting in our favour
 which are represented by this partial monopoly of the most powerful
material agent of civilization.
     The total quantity of coal existing can hardly be said to be known
 in the case of any one country; but some notion of the comparative
 coal resources of different countries may be gained from the following
statement of the area of the coal-measures in the chief coal-producing
countries, as estimated by Professor Rogers :

     Though Great Britain is far more abundantly provided with coal
than any continental nation, our resources sink into insigni<U+FB01>cance
beside those of North America, and no very long period will elapse
before this comparative poverty in coal will make itself felt.
    IX. It is continually suggested, indeed, that before coal is at all
likely to be exhausted, some substitute will be found for it, and appeal
is made to some old proverb, like Necessity is the mother of invention.
But it requires very little philosophy to see that the proverb is very
partially true. We live in a chronic state of necessity and dif<U+FB01>culty,

elements of the electric battery have always been practically furnished
by the reducing power of coal. If coal then become, as there is every
reason to suppose it will, a cheaper and cheaper source of electricity,

 334                  Prof. Jevons on Coal Exhaustion.          [March 13,
it is obviously absurd to suppose that electricity should supersede the
power of coal.
     It is conceivable, indeed, that in the course of ages some wholly new
source of power might be discovered; but there is no reason to suppose
that this island, which forms but the one four-hundredth part of the
total land-area of the globe, would be as richly endowed with the new
 source of power as it is with coal. If the sun’s beams are in the future
to be the direct source of power, it is the plains of Africa or of Aus
 tralia that will be the seats of industry and not this cloud-obscured
 Isle.
     X. The conclusions ‘we must come to on this subject are then as
follows :
     1. The power of coal is extending itself and making itself more
 Widely and deeply felt every day. It is more and more taking the
place of wind, horse, or manual power, and is becoming the universal
assistant.
     2. We are naturally led every day to extend our consumption of
so invaluable a substance, and experience shows that the more We use
 the more extensive are our augmentations.
     3. Our consumption is already commensurable with our total
supply; that is to say, we can form some notion how long our supply
will endure with a stationary consumption.
     4. As this consumption increases by multiplication, our national
life becomes shortened, and it is apparent that the increase cannot go
on very long at the present rate.
     5. The moment we are forced to draw in, other nations, pos
sessing far more extensive <U+FB01>elds of coal compared with their annual
consumption, will be enabled to approach and ultimately to pass us.
     6. The exhaustion of our mines, as it will probably manifest itself
within the next hundred years, will consist not in any stoppage of
supplies, but an increase of cost, and the impossibility of increasing
the consumption each year as at present.
     XI. At some future time then, when coal will be even a more use
ful agent than at present, we shall stand in a position of comparative
inferiority. For such a time we can best prepare ourselves, not by short
sighted restrictions on the consumption or evaporation of coal, but by
freeing the nation' from its burdens of debt and ignorance and pan
perism. We have many great tasks to perform, which can only be
undertaken with a fair hope of success when the nation is in a state of
high prosperity and progress. It will be too late to think of such
great undertakings when our progress is checked, and the pressure of
population and the want of employment are grievously felt. It is in
a period of free expansion like the present that we can alone take any
effectual measures for raising appreciably the standard of education,
comfort, and morality of the people; and if we do not use the abundant
wealth which our coal resources now afford us to ful<U+FB01>l such duties,
we undoubtedly misuse it.

                         On Alloys and their Uses.
THE object of this discourse was to show experimentally why alloys
    used inmay
are Alloys       be, chemically
             preference           component metals.
                         to their considered,  divided into three classes ‘ :
    1. Chemical combinations.
    2. Mechanical mixtures.
    3. Solutions of the one metal in the other which has become solid,
or, for shortness sake, solidi<U+FB01>ed solutions of the one metal in the
other.
    Under the term chemical combination such alloys may be con
sidered which are the result of the combination of two metals when
these unite together with great energy and evolution of heat, producing
an alloy the physical and chemical properties of which we cannot
foresee. As an example of such alloys those of gold, with tin, lead, or
zine may be quoted ; for if to melted tin, lead, or zinc, gold be added,
the two metals unite together with great energy and produce an alloy
which is exceedingly brittle and totally un<U+FB01>t for practical purposes.
    It is for this reason that the more expensive metals, silver and
copper, are used for alloying gold for the purposes of coinage, &c.
    With regard to such alloys which may be looked upon as mecha
nical mixtures, like oil and water, or rather as ether and water, for no
two metals are known which, like oil and water, do not dissolve at all
in one another, but a few metals are known which, like ether and
water, dissolve slightly in one another, for ether will dissolve a certain
amount of water, and water a certain amount of ether. If ether and
water be mixed together, say in equal parts, two layers will be formed,
the top one being ether containing a little water, the lower one water
containing a little ether.    Two metals, for instance, which behave in
exactly a similar manner to ether and water are lead and zinc, for lead
when fused with zine will dissolve 1'6 per cent. zinc, and zinc in its
turn will take up 1'2 per cent. lead.
    If these two metals be fused together, say in equal parts, they will
separate into two layers, like ether and water, the top one, being the
speci<U+FB01>cally lighter, zinc, with a small percentage of lead, the lower one
lead, with a small percentage of zinc. If such an alloy be made and

  336                       Professor Matthiessen             [March 20,
  cast in a mould, the difference in the behaviour of the two ends may
  be easily shown; for the top one is so brittle that it cannot be bent
  without breaking, whereas the lower one may be bent with ease.
       Such chemical combinations and mechanical mixtures are, however,
  comparatively rare ; and for alloys in common use, practice has almost
  invariably chosen such alloys as may be considered as belonging to the
 third class, rejecting those of the <U+FB01>rst and second as worthless for
  practical purposes.
      Under the term solidi<U+FB01>ed solutions of the one metal in the other,
 such alloys may be considered, which, like the chlorides of potassium
 and sodium when fused together, produce a mass having some of the
 physical properties totally different from those of the component salts.
  It cannot be assumed that the chloride of sodium enters into chemical
  combination with the chloride of potassium. One important property
  of a solidi<U+FB01>ed solution is, that the components are homogeneously
 di<U+FB02>'used in one another, so that even under the most powerful micro
  scope they can no longer be distinguished from one another.
      Alloys are used because they possess certain physical properties to
 a far greater extent‘ than their component metals. The physical pro
 perties may be divided into two classes.                               .
      1. Those which in all cases are imparted to the alloy, approxi
 mately in the ratio in which they are possessed by the component
 metals.
      2. Those which in some cases are, and in others are not, imparted
 to the alloy in the ratio in which they are possessed by the component
 metals.
      To the <U+FB01>rst belong Speci<U+FB01>c Gravity, Speci<U+FB01>c Heat, and Expansion
 due to heat. It is easy to show this experimentally; the speci<U+FB01>c
 gravity of an alloy may be shown to be equal to the mean of those of
 its component metals, by hanging on the one side of a balance the
 alloy and on the other side the metals composing it unalloyed, and
 then placing them both in water.
      The speci<U+FB01>c heat of an alloy may be proved equal to that of its
 components by placing the alloy and its components in boiling water,
 and then in equal volumes of cold water; when the rise of tempera
 ture in the two cases will be found the same as may be shown by a
 differential-air thermometer.
     A brass bar placed in any apparatus for showing expansion by
heat is seen to expand exactly as much as a composite bar, of which
one portion is of copper, the other of zinc. The length of the zinc
portion being proportional to the amount of zinc in brass.
     To the second class of physical properties belong, Conduction for
Heat and Electricity, Hardness, Tenacity, &c.
     As a basis for the conclusion which will be drawn, the electric con
ducting power for alloys may be taken. Researches into this subject
have shown that when tin, lead,'zine, or cadmium are‘alloyed together,
such alloys conduct electricity in the ratio of the relative volumes
of the component metals, whilst in all other cases no such simple

 1868.]             ‘     on Alloys and their Uses.                   \337
relation exists between the conducting power of the metals and their
alloys. If, for instance, gold be alloyed with silver, say in equal
volumes, the conducting power of an alloy will‘ be 15, that of silver
being 100, and that of gold 80.
     If curves be drawn to represent the conducting power of different
series of alloys, three typical forms will be observed: the <U+FB01>rst repre
sented by nearly a straight line, the second by the letter L, and the
third by the letter U.
    Wiedemann and Franz have proved experimentally that the values
obtained for the conducting power of metals and alloys, for heat and
electricity, are identically the same; and the truth of this statement
may be shown by the following experiment :—If bars of gold and
silver and some gold-silver alloys be <U+FB01>xed so that one end of all of
them is in a hot-water box and the other end in the bulb of a small
air-thermometer, the depression in the columns of the liquid in the
tubes of the air-thermometers will indicate the relative conducting
powers (approximately) of the several bars; and if through the tops of
the columns of liquid a line be drawn, such line will form a curve
similar to that referred to as obtained for the electric conducting
power.
     That this is true is thus shown :
     By the side of this apparatus is placed another of this construction:
Into the bulbs of several air-thermometers are <U+FB01>xed wires of the same
size and length, and of the same materials as were used in the heat
conducting experiment. One end of each wire is soldered to one
thick copper wire, and the other end to another similar wire. These
two wires are connected to the poles of a battery. The current will
then divide itself, and a portion will pass through every wire propor
tional to the conducting power of that wire. This current will heat ’
the wire and cause the liquid in the tubes connected with the air
thermometers to descend, and the line drawn through the top of the
columns will be nearly similar to the curve already mentioned, which
is formed by the bulbs in which the heat-conducting bars are <U+FB01>xed.
    The analogy between the relation existing in this case and in some
others may be shown experimentally as follows :—
    Sonority. When bars of alloys and their component metals are
struck, a great difference will be found in the note produced ; and in
almost every case where the experiment has been made, the most
sonorous alloy was found to correspond in composition approximately
with that at the turning point of the electric conducting power curve.
     Tenacity. When wires of the same diameter of metals and alloys
are broken by traction, those of the alloys will require a much greater
force than their component metals ; and it may be deduced from what
is known, that those alloys the composition of which corresponds to the
turning point of the conducting power curve are more tenacious than
any other alloy composed of the same metals.
    Elasticity. When spirals of wires of metals and their alloys are
weighted to an equal extent, the alloys will be found on removing the

weights to possess the property of resuming their original form in a
much higher degree than their component metals. Here again the
alloys corresponding in composition to those of the turning point of
the conducting power curves are the most elastic.
    From what has been said, and from the experiments described,
the conclusion may be drawn that the chemical composition of the
practically-used two metal-alloys correspond to those situated at the
turning points of the heat and electric conducting power curves, and
that if a two-metal alloy of a special physical property be required,
it would be as well to try that alloy the composition of which would
correspond to the turning point of the curve representing the electric
conducting power of the alloys of the two metals.

               WILLIAM B. CARPENTER, M.D. V.P.R.S.
                On the Unconscious Activity of the Brain.
Man’s conscious life essentially consists in an action and re-action
between his Mind and all that is outside it,—the Me and the Not-Me.
But this action and re-action cannot take place, in his present stage of
existence, without the intervention of a material instrument, whose
function it is to bridge over the hiatus between the individual con
sciousness and the external world, and thus to bring them into mutual
communication. So long, therefore, as either the mental or the bodily
part of Man was studied to the exclusion of the other, no true pro
gress could be made in Psychological Science ; and thus it was that the
bygone controversies between the Spiritualists and the Materialists,
in which the disputants on either side looked at his composite nature
from that side only, were barren of any other good result than that of
bringing into view phenomena that might otherwise have escaped atten
tion. But the Psychologist who looks at his subject in the light of
that more advanced philosophy of the present day which regards
Matter merely as the vehicle of Force, has no di<U+FB02>iculty in seeing where
both sets of disputants were right and both wrong; and, laying the
foundations of his Science broad and deep in the whole constitution of
the individual Man and his relations to the world external to him,
aims to build it up with the materials furnished by experience of

every kind, mental and bodily, normal and abnormal,—ignoring no
fact, however strange, that can be attested by valid evidence, and accept
ing none, however authoritatively sanctioned, that will not stand the
test of thorough scrutiny.
     It is with the view of promoting the advance of such a Psychology,
that the lecturer desires to bring into more distinct recognition a doc
trine which has been familiar to the Metaphysicians of Germany from
Leibnitz to the present time, under the names “ Latent Thought,” or
the “Preconscious Activity of the Soul,” and was systematically ex
pounded in this country by Sir William Hamilton: whilst in Physio
logical language it may be designated as the “ Unconscious Action of
the Brain,”

in terms of Metaphysics or in terms of Physiology, provided it be
recognized as having a positive scientific basis. But since, in the
systems of Philosophy long prevalent in this country, consciousness,
has been almost uniformly taken as the basis of all strictly Mental
activity, it seems convenient to designate as Functions of the Nervous
System all those operations which lie below that level. And there is
this advantage in approaching the subject from the Physiological
side,——that the study of the Automatic actions of other parts of the
Nervous System furnishes a clue, by the guidance of which we may
be led to the scienti<U+FB01>c elucidation of many phenomena that would
otherwise remain obscure and meaningless.
     Referring to a discourse delivered by him March 12, 1852, “On
the In<U+FB02>uence of Suggestion in modifying and directing Muscular Move
ment independently of Volition,” Dr. Carpenter reminded his audience
that the doctrine of Idea-motor action therein set forth had been
referred to by Professor Faraday as furnishing an adequate scienti<U+FB01>c
rationale of the phenomena of “ Table-turning” and “ Table-talking,”
which developed themselves epidemically soon afterwards. Whilst the
ordinary phenomena of “ Table-talking” present a most curious body of
illustrations of that principle, cases have occasionally occurred in the
experience of persons above suspicion of intentional deception, in which
the answers given by the movements of the tables were not only
    * Dr. Laycock, in an able essay on the ‘Re<U+FB02>ex Action of the Brain,’ pub
lished in 1844, brought together a number of phenomena which justi<U+FB01>ed his
extension of the doctrine of Re<U+FB02>ex action from the Spinal Cord to the Brain;
but as he did not draw a distinction between the re<U+FB02>ex action of the Sensory Ganglia
(Sensori-motor) and that of the Cerebrum (Ideo-mo’mr), and did not assert that
either could take place without consciousness, he was not understood at the time
to a<U+FB02>irm this position, though it appears from his subsequent statements that he
certainly meant to do so.    The lecturer, having long previously taught the doc
trine of the re<U+FB02>ex action of the Sensory Ganglia, and having been convinced by
Dr. Laycock’s reasoning that it might be extended to the Cerebrum, was led by a
consideration of the anatomical relations of the Cerebrum to the Sensory Ganglia
to believe that a succession of changes might take place automatically in the
former, of which the results only might rise to consciousness; and to this kind of
activity he gave the designation of “ Unconscious Cercbration."      2     2
                                                                        B

unknown to the qucstioncrs, but were even contrary to their belief at the
time, and yet afterwards proved to be true. Such cases afford typical
examples of the doctrine of “ Unconscious Cerebration ;” for in several
of them it was capable of being distinctly shown, that the answers,
although contrary to the belief of the questioners at the time, were
true to facts of which they had been formerly cognizant, but which
had vanished from their recolleetion,—the residua of these forgotten
impressions giving rise to Cerebral changes which prompted the re
sponses, without any consciousness, on the part of the agents, of the
latent springs of their actions.
     In order, however, to present the doctrine in its proper scienti<U+FB01>c
aspect by giving it a de<U+FB01>nite physiological basis, Dr. Carpenter re
capitulated what he considered to be the fundamental doctrines
relating to the original or primary, and the acquired or secondary
Automatic actions of the principal divisions of the Cerebro-Spinal
centres. These may be distinguished as,—
         1. The Sensory
         2.              Ganglia
                 Spinal Cord      ,
                              (including the Medulla Oblongata) ;
         3. The cerebellum;
         4. The Cerebram.
     Leaving out of consideration the cerebellum, of which the function
has not yet been satisfactorily determined, and <U+FB01>xing our attention
upon the other centres, we <U+FB01>nd that each of them, in addition to its
original or primary Automatic actions, comes to be the instrument of a
 set of secondary Automatic actions, which, though originally prompted
by the Will, and still remaining under its control, are habitually per
 formed without any Volitional agency.
     Thus the primary function_of the Spinal Cord as an independent
 centre consists in the performance of the motions of Respiration and
 Swallowing, which are essential to the maintenance of life; and in
 many of the lower animals it is certain that the ordinary movements
 of Locomotion have the same primary Automatic character. In Man,
 however, the power of performing these movements is acquired by a
 process of education; yet when once the co-ordination has been
 established, the movements are performed Automatically,—continuing
 when set going by one act of the Will, until they are checked by
 another act. Of this we have daily experience in the continuance of
 the act of walking, whilst the attention is closely and continuously
 occupied upon an internal train of thought ; each movement suggesting
 the succeeding one; and the repetition being thus inde<U+FB01>nitely pro
 longed, until, the attention being recalled, the Automatic impulse is
 superseded by Volitional control.
     The primary Automatic action of the Sensory Ganglia, again,
 seems to be chie<U+FB02>y connected with movements of protection,- as in the
 sneezing produced by the application of irritants to the nasal surface,
or the closure of the eyelids at a <U+FB02>ash of light.’ But their secondarily
Automatic agency may be distinctly traced in the guidance of the

1868.]             on the Unconscious Activity of the Brain.                   341
habitual movements of locomotion, performed under the conditions
previously stated. Thus a man in a state of profound abstraction
walks through a crowded street, without jostling his fellow-passengers
or bruising himself against lamp-posts; and he follows the line of
direction which is most familiar to him, even though at starting he'
had intended to take some other.
     The in<U+FB02>uence of habiludes acquired by experience, which take the
place in Man of the intuitive capacities of the lower animals, is pecu
liarly well seen in that co-ordination of the Visual and Tactile per
ceptions, by which we acquire our notions of the forms and relations
of external objects, and regulate our muscular movements in accord
ance with those notions. A Bird just come forth from the egg will
peek at an insect with perfect aim ; but an Infant is long in learning
to grasp at a bright object held within its reach, being obviously
unable in the <U+FB01>rst instance either to estimate its distance, or to com
bine the muscular actions needed for its prehension. And the obser
vation of numerous cases in which sight has been <U+FB01>rst obtained after
tactile familiarity with external objects had been fully acquired, enables
it to be positively affirmed that no object can be immediately recog
nized by sight alone, when seen for the <U+FB01>rst time under such circum
stances."5
     This class of facts is of great importance in our present inquiry;
because we have here a distinct instance of the formation of judgments
on the basis of an acquired experience, by a. process of which, even when we
give our attention to it, we are altogether unconscious. Thus when we
obtain a conception of solid form by the mental combination of two
dissimilar pictures in the Stereoscope, that conception seems to be so
necessary and immediate, that its formation might be supposed to be
the result of an original intuition, if we had no means of tracing out
the antecedent stages of the process, and of thus satisfying ourselves
that it is secondary or acquired. The faculty to which it is due may
be said to be the resultant of our whole previous training in this direc
tion; which not merely enables us to recognize the forms and relations
of objects of which we have some antecedent knowledge, so that they
are in some degree suggested by the single picture, but also to create
(‘so to speak) forms and relations of which the single picture gives us
no adequate idea. The Physiologist can scarcely doubt, that as the
Nervous system, like every other part of the organism, grows to the
mode in which it is habitually exercised, a direct channel of instru
mental action here comes to take the place of the circuit through which
the process was originally performed ; so that the acquired intuition of
Man, in regard to the forms and relations of external objects, comes to
    "‘ Thus, in a case published about three years ago by Mr. Critchett, of a young
woman who <U+FB01>rst obtained sight at the age of nineteen, it is recorded that when a
pair of scissors was <U+FB01>rst held before her, although she correctly described their
shape and metallic lustre, she had not the least idea of their identity with the
implement she had been accustomed to handle; but when told what it was, laughed
 at what she called her own stupidity.

whilst probably far exceeding it in completeness and range.
     The relation of the Cerebrum, or Brain proper, to the Spinal Cord
and Sensory Ganglia, can only be properly studied by the light of
Comparative Anatomy; and from this we learn that instead of being
(as was formerly supposed) the centre of the whole system, in direct
connection with the organs of sense and with the muscular apparatus,
it is a superadded organ, the development of which seems to bear a
pretty constant relation to the degree in which Intelligence supersedes

tiality resides, is connected with the Sensory Tract at their base (which
is the real centre of convergence for the sensory nerves of the whole
body) by Commissural <U+FB01>bres, long since termed by Reil, with sagacious
foresight, “nerves of the internal senses ;” and its anatomical relation
 to the Sensorium is thus precisely the same as that of the Retina, which
 is a ganglionic expansion connected with the Sensorium by the Optic
 nerve. Hence it may fairly be surmised (1) that, as we only become
 conscious of visual impressions on the Retina when their in<U+FB02>uence has
 been transmitted to the central Sensorium, so we only become con
 scious of ideational changes in the Cerebral Hemisphercs when their
 in<U+FB02>uence has been transmitted to the same centre ; and (2) that, as visual
 changes may take place in the Retina of which we are unconscious,
 either through a temporary inactivity of the Sensorium (as in sleep),
 or through the entire occupation of the attention in some other direc
 tion, so may ideational changes take place in the Cerebrum, of which
 we may be at the time unconscious for want of receptivity on the part
 of the Sensorium, but of which the results may at a subsequent time
 present themselves to the consciousness as Ideas elaborated by an
 automatic process of which we have no cognizance.
      That the Cerebrum, like the nervous centres on which it is super
  imposed, has an Automatic activity of its own, cannot be doubted by
  those who have attended to the phenomena of Somnambulism (whether
  natural or induced), in which the directing and controlling power of
  the Will seems completely suspended, and the trains of thought follow
  the lead either of some dominant idea or of suggestion from without.
 There are well-authenticated cases in which such automatic action has
  not only evolved results that were perfect in themselves, but has
  wrought these out through a shorter and more direct process than had
  been conceived possible in the Waking state; the withdrawal of all
  distracting in<U+FB02>uences appearing to favour that undisturbed action of
  the mental mechanism (if such a phrase be permissible), which is the
  condition most favourable to the success of the operation. But in all
  such instances the Automatic action follows the course of the habitual
  lines of thought, and expresses the result of the whole previous
  training and discipline of the mind, which has been carried on under
  Volitional direction. The Lawyer could not thus have written in his
 'sleep a lucid opinion, unravelling the pcrplexities of a complicated

 case, if he had not assiduously cultivated the intellectual habit by
 which it was elaborated; nor could the Mathematician, in the same
 state, have not merely executed with perfect correctness a lengthened
 computation, which had ba<U+FB01>Eled him in the waking state, but found
 out a much more direct means of attaining the result, if his previous
 training had not been of a kind to develop this self-acting power.
     With such evidence that the Cerebrum may work automatically, it
 may further be regarded as Physiologically probable (on the grounds
already stated) that such automatic action may take place uncon
sciously ; and facts which are within the experience of every one seem
to justify this conclusion. Thus, when we have been trying to recol
 lect some name, phrase, or occurrence, and, after vainly employing
all the expedients we can think of for bringing the desiderated idea to
our minds, have abandoned the attempt as useless, it will often occur
spontaneously a little while afterwards, suddenly <U+FB02>ashing (as it were)
before our consciousness; and this although the mind has been com
pletely engrossed at the time by some entirely different train of thought,
so that no link of association can be detected whereby the result has been
knowingly apprehended. Now in these cases it seems probable that
the train of action we have purposely set going in the <U+FB01>rst instance has
continued in movement when we have withdrawn our attention from
it, and goes on all the more regularly in consequence of that with
drawal ; for experience shows that we are much more likely to recover
the forgotten idea when we cease to trouble ourselves about it, than
when we go on searching for it,—just as a rider who has lost himself
in some unknown region is more likely to <U+FB01>nd his way home by
dropping the reins on his horse’s neck, and letting him take his own
course, than by wearying him in trying one road after another.
     The same mode of action seems to have a large share in the pro
 cess of Invention, whether artistic, poetical, or mechanical : for numer
ous instances might be cited, in which, the object to be attained having
been kept before the mind for some time without any immediate result,
that result has suddenly presented itself either on <U+FB01>rst awaking out of
sleep, or in the midst of some entirely different occupation. And it is
a common experience of inventors (whether Artists, Poets, or Mecha
nicians) that when they have been brought to a stand by some difficulty,
the tangle will be more likely to unravel itself (so to speak) if the
attention be completely withdrawn from it, than by any amount of con
tinued effort.
     The same appears to be true of those acts of Judgment in which
a great many opposing considerations are involved, and in which we
take time to form our conclusion. As was well said by Abraham
Tucker“ of this class of cases, “ with all our care to digest our mate
rials, we cannot do it completely; but after a night’s rest, or some
recreation, or the mind being turned into some different course of
thinking, she <U+FB01>nds they have ranged themselves anew during her absence,

and in such manner as exhibits almost at one view all their mutual
relations, dependences, and conscquences—which shows that our organs
do not stand idle the moment we cease to employ them, but continue
the motions we put into them after they have gone out of sight,
thereby working themselves to a glibncss and smoothness, and falling
 into a more regular and orderly posture than we could have placed them
with all our skill and industry.” Experience shows that the soundest
judgments of the well-disciplined mind are thus formed ; all the con
 siderations which ought to be taken into account being <U+FB01>rst duly
 brought before it, and then left free to arrange themselves by <U+FB01>xing the
 attention on some other occupation: and if time be given for this
 unconscious balancing, we <U+FB01>nd, when we return to the subject, that
the direction in which our minds gravitate is a surer guide than any
estimate we might have formed under volitional pressure.
     This Unconscious action of the Brain, however, is often exerted in
giving a bias to our judgments, of which we may be entirely unaware.
Almost every one is thus in<U+FB02>uenced more or less by the habits of
thought and feeling early impressed upon him ; and the judgment is
especially liable to be warped by these, when the ordinary vigour of
the mind is depressed by physical or moral causes. This kind of
perversion may be so decided in its evil e<U+FB01>'ects, as to lead to a suspicion
of a want of honesty or candour, which may be totally unfounded; the
real source of it lying-hid deep down in that stratum of the mental
constitution, which represents the results of those early in<U+FB02>uences for
which the individual himself is not responsible. Thus, as Mr. Lecky
has shown, the doctrine of Unconscious Oerebration inculcates toleration
for differences not merely of belief, but of the moral standard.
     One of the most frequently-recurring forms of Unconscious Cerebral
action, is that by which what we call “ Common Sense ” decides for us
in a great variety of cases, in which we do not think it worth-while to
submit the question, to a logical discussion. New this “ common
sense ” is, so to speak, an acquired intuition; being the resultant of the
whole previous activity of the Mind, conjointly with that of the Brain
which is its instrument. Its value will consequently depend upon the
nature of the training and discipline which the Intellectual powers
have received: and it may be ai<U+FB01>rmed Without hesitation, that Where
those powers have been originally good, and have been thoroughly
well cultivated and exercised, the “ common-sense ” judgment is likely
to be even superior to that whigh may be worked out by an elaborate
process of reasoning, wherein some more acute reasoner will almost
always be able to <U+FB01>nd some <U+FB02>aw. Thus the “common-sense” decision
of mankind in regard to the existence of an External World, is prac
tically worth more than all the arguments of all the Logicians who
have discussed the basis of our belief in it.
    If, then, it be true that every form of Intuition, whether original
or acquired, is referable to the ever-<U+FB02>owing under-current, which may
be designated as “ Unconscious Celebration" or “ Preconscious Acti

  vity of the Soul,” according as we use the. terms of Physiology or of
  Metaphysics, the question naturally arises what power we have of
  directing and controlling its course, of strengthening or repressing its
  power.
      We have not that direct mastery over it, which we can gain by a
  determined exercise of the Will over our conscious activity. We cannot
  acquire, if we have it not in our original constitution, the creative
  power of genius, so as to make ourselves great Poets, Artists, or
  Musicians; nor can we gain by practice that peculiar insight which
  characterizes the Scienti<U+FB01>c discoverer of the highest class, or that
  ingenuity which distinguishes the great Mechanical inventor ; for these
  gifts are of the nature of instincts, which may be developed and
  strengthened by appropriate cultivation, but which no culture will of
  itself produce, any more than it can raise a crop of corn where there
  has been no seed.
      Still where we cannot create, we may learn to admire the Beautiful,
 to recognize the True, and to value the Good; and this power of
 appreciation grows and intensi<U+FB01>es, in proportion as it is exercised
 aright. The more we <U+FB01>x our attention on the highest ideals of Art,
 and withdraw ourselves from the in<U+FB02>uence of those lower forms of it
 which in any way connect themselves with the grosser parts of our
 nature, the more thorough will be our intuitive appreciation of what
 is noble and elevating, the more thorough our intuitive distaste for
 all that is mean and degrading. And so in the pursuit of Truth, the
 more faithfully, strictly, and perseveringly we aim to disentangle
 ourselves from all sel<U+FB01>sh aims, all conscious prejudices, the more
 shall we <U+FB01>nd ourselves becoming progressively emancipated from
 those unconscious prejudices which cling around us as results of
 early misdirection and erroneous habits of thought, and which are
 more dangerous to our consistency than those against which we know
 ingly put ourselves upon our guard. And so in those judgments in
 regard to ourselves or others for which we are all daily appealing to
 the guidance of Common Sense, the safety of that guidance will depend
 upon the degree in which we have habitually aimed to cultivate our
power of reasoning correctly, to try every question by <U+FB01>rst principles
 rather than by the dictates of a supposed temporary expediency, and
above all “to be just and fear not.” And every course of self-dis
cipline thus steadily and honestly pursued, tends not merely to clear
,the mental vision of the Individual, but to ennoble the Race; by de
veloping that power of immediate insight, which, in Man’s highest
phase of existence, will not only supersede the laborious operations of
his Intellect, but will reveal to him truths and glories of the Unseen,
which the intellect alone can see but “ as through a glass, darkly.”

                    PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY, ROYAL INSTITUTION.
            On the proposed Water Supply for the Metropolis.
OUT of every thousand people existing upon this planet at the present
moment, three live in London. Any matter, therefore, which inti
mately concerns the health and comfort of this vast mass of humanity,
cannot but merit earnest attention; and, moreover, if that matter be
connected with scienti<U+FB01>c research, I feel sure that the members of this
Institution will require no apology even for its being brought under
their notice a second time.
    A year ago, I discoursed to you about the chemical considerations
respecting the present Metropolitan Water Supply, and I mentioned
the <U+FB01>ve schemes then proposed to remedy its obvious and serious
defects-excessive contamination with sewage, and great hardness
the <U+FB01>rst rendering it un<U+FB01>t for drinking, and the second disqualifying
it to a certain extent for washing and cleansing purposes. Those
schemes to which I alluded on the last occasion were the following.
First, the sources of the Severn, proposed by Mr. Bateman ; second, the
Cumberland Lakes, proposed by Messrs. Hemans and Hassard ; third,
the Thames water <U+FB01>ltered through the Bagshot sands, suggested by
Mr. Telford Macneill; fourth, extensive reservoirs constructed near the
sources of the Thames, the scheme of Mr. Baily Denton; and <U+FB01>fth, the
waters <U+FB02>owing down the slopes of the Derbyshire and Staffordshire
hills, proposed to be brought to the metropolis by Mr. Remington.
     At that time the quality of the waters obtainable by any of these
schemes had been but little investigated, and that remark still applies
to the last three schemes. But in the interval, the water yielded by
the two <U+FB01>rst-named districts has been, at the instance of the Royal
Commission on Water Supply, submitted to a searching chemical
investigation by Dr. Odling and myself, and I am therefore enabled
on the present occasion to speak with con<U+FB01>dence as to the quality of
the water from both these districts.

1868.]       on the proposed Water Supply of the Metropolis.          347
    There are also one or two points of general scienti<U+FB01>c interest which
have been brought to light during this inquiry, and which I also pro
pose to touch upon :—these are, <U+FB01>rst, the curious e<U+FB02>'ect of detritus from
mines upon the quality of the water with which it is mixed; and
secondly, the conditions which determine the action or non-action of
water upon lead.
    During the past year the processes of water analysis have under
gone a complete revolution. It is one of my duties to report monthly
to the Registrar-General upon the quality of the metropolitan waters,
and in carrying out this work I found the methods of water analysis
hitherto employed so untrustworthy as to render an almost entire
remodelling of them absolutely necessary.
    I propose, therefore, <U+FB01>rst to glance shortly at some of the inno
vations which have been made in this branch of chemical analysis.
When water is to be submitted to chemical examination, it is of the
utmost importance to have a su<U+FB02>icient and well-collected sample. On
this occasion the completeness of the investigation, as regards the two
proposed schemes, has been very materially assisted by the judicious
choice of samples supplied by Dr. Pole, F.R.S., who went down to the
districts and collected the samples which were afterwards submitted to
chemical analysis by my colleague and myself.
     The <U+FB01>rst thing to be determined in a water analysis is the “ total
solid impurity,” as it is termed, Le. the total amount of solid matter
with which the water has been contaminated since it was submitted to
the natural process of distillation. This quantity of solid impurity is
determined by taking a known volume of the water and evaporating
it down to dryness in a previously weighed platinum vessel. The
solid impurity contains both organic matter and inorganic or mineral
matter. The most important of these two classes of substances
contained in the solid residue is undoubtedly the organic matter.
Now, even at the present moment, the actual weight of this organic
matter cannot be determined by chemical analysis; in fact there is no
process known to science by which its weight can be even approxi
mately estimated; but it is possible to determine, in a given bulk of
water, the quantity of the two principal constituents of this organic
matter,      the carbon and nitrogen which enter into its composition.
For this purpose a separate quantity of the water is evaporated down
to dryness; but in this case the process is conducted in a glass vessel,
and before evaporation the water is mixed with sulphurous acid in
order to expel the carbonic acid, which is partly dissolved in the
water and partly combined with lime and magnesia. Other precau
tions also have to be taken, but I hesitate to enter into the details,
 which I fear would only weary you. However, I think that it is
desirable just to show you the general plans on which the determina
tion of the organic carbon and nitrogen, in the residue thus obtained
 by evaporation in the glass dish, is effected. The operation is
performed in the following manner :-—The contents of the glass
 vessel are very carefully scraped out and rubbed off the sides of

3418                        Professor Frankland                    [April 3,
the vessel by a substance known as chromate of lead, a <U+FB01>nely pow
dered somewhat gritty material, which very completely effects this
object, and enables us to transfer the Water residue gradually into a
piece of hard Bohemian glass tube closed at one end. This tube is
then <U+FB01>lled up to within about four inches of the mouth with coarsely
granulated oxide of copper, and upon that is placed a small quantity
of bright metallic copper to decompose oxidized compounds of nitro
gen. The tube is then laid in a gas furnace, called “the com
bustion furnace.” Before combustion commences the entire tube is
made perfectly vacuous, all the air is pumped out of it, so as to get
rid of the atmospheric nitrogen which would vitiate our result. This
is done by means of a mercurial pump invented by Dr. Sprengel,
by means of which we can extract almost the last trace of atmo
spheric air contained in the tube. The latter is then gradually heated
to redness, during which process the carbon and nitrogen of the
organic matter in the water residue are converted, the <U+FB01>rst into car
bonic acid gas, and the second into nitrogen and nitric oxide gases.
From the volume of each of these gases the weights of carbon and
nitrogen can be calculated with great precision. (Experiment per
 formed.)
     Now the nitrogen in the result of the analysis is also derived from
any ammonia present in the water, and it is therefore necessary to
determine how much is due to that source. This estimation of ammonia
is perhaps the only rapid and easy process connected with water analysis
which may at the same time be regarded as satisfactory. For these
simple processes of analysis when they come to be rigorously tested
generally prove to be very incorrect; but this has survived the test of
experience, and is capable of determining the result with great pre
cision and readiness. I have here <U+FB01>ve glass cylinders. The water in
the <U+FB01>rst contains no ammonia at all; the second contains a certain
small quantity; the third twice as much as the second; the fourth
three times as much, and the <U+FB01>fth four times as much as the second.
To each of these Vessels I shall now add an equal volume of a test
solution, which strikes a peculiar yellow or orange-yellow colour with
the ammonia in the vessels.     This is known as the Nessler test, having
been invented by a German chemist of that name. (The experiment
was performed, the water in the four last vessels assuming di<U+FB02>'erent
shades of orange colour, in proportion to the quantity of ammonia con
tained in them; the water in the <U+FB01>rst vessel remaining colourless.)
     Now we have still one other process at which it is necessary to
 glance for a moment, viz.——the process for determining the nitrogen
existing as nitrates and nitrites. It is called combined nitrogen, but
it is not organic nitrogen, although it has in most cases been derived
from organic matter. The water residue used for the determination
of the amount of solid impurity is dissolved in a small quantity of
water; sulphate of silver is then added, by which the chlorides are
converted
ferred      into
        to the   sulphates.

  1868.]       on the proposed Water Supply of the Metropolis.          349
  to be mixed with rather more than its own weight of sulphuric acid,
  which is introduced in the same way. It is then only necessary to
  shake up this mixture, the mouth of the tube being closed with the
  thumb. Very soon the mercury begins to act on the nitric acid, con
  verting it into a colourless permanent gas called nitric oxide, which
  only requires to be measured in order to determine the amount of nitro
  gen originally present in the water in the shape of nitrites and nitrates.
      There is qnly one other determination I will trouble you with, and
  this I do principally for the purpose of introducing to your notice a
  very ingenious piece of apparatus, an application of the Sprengcl pump,
  which has just been contrived by my assistant, Mr. McLeod. It is
  designed to extract the gases which are dissolved in waters. By this
  instrument we can not only measure the whole of the gases present
  in the Water, but we can determine how much of the gases can be
  expelled at the ordinary temperature, and how much more will come
  of when you boil the water in vacuo.      This gas is then submitted to
  the usual eudiometrical investigation, to ascertain the quantity of
  carbonic acid, nitrogen, and oxygen,—the three gases which almost
  invariably occur in the waters submitted to analysis. (Apparatus
  shown at work).
      Now it is not necessary for me on the present occasion to go at all
  into the details as regards the sources of the two proposed water
  supplies for London. This I did on the former occasion pretty fully.
  I will only refer you for a moment to the large map before you, which
  shows the districts from which the supplies would be taken and the
  course of the conduits to the metropolis. By the Welsh scheme, the
  water would be collected on the slopes of Cader Idris and Plynlimmon,
  from whence it would be brought by a conduit to within ten miles of
  London, where it would be stored in reservoirs 400 feet above high
  water mark. The other scheme proposes to bring the water from the
  lakes of Cumberland, past several large towns, laying under contri
  bution the Bala Lake, in Wales, if necessary, and the combined waters
  would then be brought to the metropolis after distributing a certain
  amount to the large towns on their route.
      It is, perhaps, necessary just to say a word or two in order to
  disabuse your minds of the idea that these schemes are intended to
  in<U+FB02>ict any injury upon the present water companies. Ample provision
  is made in these schemes for the complete compensation of the existing
. companies, and the only conceivable mischief in this respect which
  can be done by the adoption of one scheme or the other, would be
  the abolition of certain Boards of Directors which now exist, for the
  administration of the affairs of the eight or nine companies which
  supply London.
      These schemes are of course very costly. It quite staggers one
  at <U+FB01>rst to think of the amount it is proposed to expend upon them.
  Thus, Mr. Bateman’s scheme, which is to bring water from the moun
  tains of North Wales, is calculated to cost, for a supply of 220,000,000
  gallons per day, the sum of 10,850,000l. ; whilst the scheme for bring

350                        Professor Franhland                    [April 3,
ing water from the lakes of Cumberland is put down, for 250,000,000
gallons a-day, at 13,500,000l.    Now these are startling <U+FB01>gures; but
I imagine that all we have to look at is the simple question, How much
shall we have to pay for the water when these schemes are carried out?
If you go into that matter you will <U+FB01>nd, according to the calcula
tions of the engineers—I will not say they are always to be implicitly
relied upon, perhaps a certain percentage must be allowed—but
taking their calculations as correct, it actually follows that after com
pensating the existing companies, and after expending this enormous
amount upon the works, we shall be supplied with this very pure
water at a less cost than that which we pay at the present moment.
We pay at present about 18. 5d. in the pound of rent for water. By
Mr. Bateman’s scheme we should be charged a domestic rate of 10d.
in the pound, or two-thirds of what we now pay, plus a public rate
of 2d. Messrs. Hassard and Hemans’ scheme would be met by a
domestic rate of 1s. 1d. in the pound. Now I think, if we are
actually to be gainers by this transaction, the enormous sums neces
sary to be expended upon these works need not frighten us, and need
not prevent us from taking them into our serious consideration.
    Let us just pause for a moment to consider the purely mechanical
relations of the proposed to the present metropolitan supply, because
this will somewhat help you to comprehend how it is that, having

livered in London has to be pumped up from nearly the sea level, to
an average height of about 250 feet. Then, again, the present supply
is intermittent; the proposed will be constant. With regard to the
pumping part of the process, that in the proposed scheme would be
replaced by the work of gravitation. The gigantic and magni<U+FB01>cent
engines employed at the present moment in London for raising this
vast volume of water-100,000,000 gallons daily—arc painful for the
philosopher to contemplate. You have here a stupendous waste of
power employed in doing over again an amount of work which was
previously executed for us gratuitously. The sun, in his prodigality
of power, <U+FB01>ings up far above the cross of St. Paul’s this daily supply
of 100,000,000 gallons, and we, in our imbecility, allow it to soil
itself by <U+FB02>owing down again nearly to the level of the sea, and then
we erect immense pumping engines and expend 200 tons of coal daily
to raise this water a fraction of the height from which we had pre
viously allowed it to fall. All this will be saved by the proposed
schemes.
    We talk of the exhaustion of our coal <U+FB01>elds and of the necessity of
conserving our supply as much as possible, and although the amount
thus saved would make but a poor <U+FB01>gure in Mr. Jevons’s 100,000,000
tons a year, yet this is a kind of work which can be done better by
solar heat than by the action of coal; and it is not very often that
we are thus able to substitute, with advantage, natural for arti<U+FB01>cial
force.

    The quantity of the solid impurity contained in a water is a very
important matter, apart from the consideration of the quality of the
substances which compose this impurity. Waters leaving a small
amount of residue upon evaporation are usually well <U+FB01>tted for domestic
use. They are invariably the best for manufacturing purposes, as they
effect a great saving in heat when used for steam boilers. I was
shown the other day some cakes of carbonate of lime, a quarter of an
inch thick, which had been removed from a locomotive boiler at the
Deptford Railway Station, in which they had been formed in forty
eight hours; through this substance heat passes with extreme slow
ness, so that a considerable quantity of fuel is wasted. It will be
seen from the <U+FB01>rst of the above tables that, on an average of all the
 samples, the total solid impurities amount in the two schemes to
 about 1-7th of those in the present water supply; but if we might
venture to take the water in the proposed large storage reservoirs as
equal in this respect to the water now stored in the lakes, it would
be about l-lOth of that which is found in London waters.
     Now this solid residue is partly mineral and partly organic. Let
us glance <U+FB01>rst at the organic portion. This organic matter present in
the original water may be either living or dead. The detection of the
former class of impurities belongs more to the province of the naturalist
than to that of the chemist; but it may be remarked in passing, that
this form of organic impurity must necessarily be in suspension and
not in solution. We cannot conceive of organized beings existing in
solution-it is impossible. But it does not from this follow that
these suspended matters can be removed from water by <U+FB01>ltration.
     it is well known that the ova of many species of animalculaa can
not be removed thus, they pass through the best <U+FB01>lters; and it has
also been proved that what is believed to be the cholera poison passes
through <U+FB01>lters, and cannot be arrested. This is a most important
consideration in connection with water which is contaminated with
sewage and manure matters; and it is necessary that such water
should, at all events, he as well <U+FB01>ltered as possible. The present
water companies supplying London cannot possibly be blamed for
the original quality of the water which they supply. They cannot
hinder the 600,000 persons who live on the banks of the Thames from
pouring their refuse into the river; but they can <U+FB01>lter this impure
water. They can, and indeed by Act of Parliament they are sup
posed to be compelled to deliver this water in a bright, transparent,
and <U+FB01>ltered condition ; and they can in this way, as far it is possible
by <U+FB01>ltration to do it, remove these suspended organic contaminations
from the water.
    But how does the matter stand ‘? Here is a sample of water which
I drew from the Lambeth Company‘s main on the 4th of March.
You see that the water is not <U+FB01>ltered. It is <U+FB01>ltered by Act of Parlia
ment! but it is curious to observe that so much pollution can pass
through an Act of Parliament. Here too is a sample of the same
company’s water collected on the 21st of January; and it is a fact,

1868.]       on the proposed Water Supply of the Metropolis.           353
that during the whole of that interval and almost up to the present
time, this water has been much in the same condition. Those of my
audience who are supplied by the Lambeth Company, or the Southwark
and Vauxhall Company, or by the Chelsea Company, will hear me out
as to the condition in which those companies have delivered water
during the past two months. In fact, not only for the past two
months, but during the entire year, water is often delivered in London
very imperfectly <U+FB01>ltered. The Southwark Company during the whole
of last year, with one exception, delivered from its mains, when the
samples were drawn for analysis, turbid water, imperfectly <U+FB01>ltered
most of the other companies were to a less extent guilty of the same
thing. Of the companies which draw from the Thames, the West
Middlesex and the Grand Junction are the two which <U+FB01>lter their
water best; but the only company which delivered water uniformly
transparent and well <U+FB01>ltered was the New River Company.
    I have stated that the absolute quantity of the organic matter in
solution in water cannot be ascertained, but the amount of carbon and
nitrogen contained in this organic matter can be estimated by the
process of combustion which I have exhibited to you. The amount of
organic carbon and nitrogen in the several waters I have referred to,
is represented in the second and third lines of table A, and in the
second and third columns of table B you will see that, with regard to
these elements of the organic matter in solution, there is not a very
striking difference between the three di<U+FB01>'erent classes of waters. There
is an excess of organic nitrogen in the case of the London water, and
of organic carbon in the case of the Welsh waters.                   .
    The organic matter, of which the elements are thus determined,
may be either animal or vegetable, and the nature of it has much to
do with the probability of its being noxious or innocuous. The
animal or vegetable source of the organic mattenmay be judged of by
the proportion of nitrogen to carbon, as determined by analysis: that
from animal sources contains a larger proportion than that derived
from vegetable sources; and in this way it is easy to see that the
organic matter in the Welsh and Cumberland waters is of a di<U+FB01>'erent
character from that contained in the London waters. The London
river-waters, especially when turbid, contain a much larger propor
tion of nitrogen to carbon than is contained in other waters, thus
proclaiming the animal origin of some portions of the organic matter.
    When I addressed you on this subject last year I stated that by
operating upon one litre of water, one per cent. of unchanged sewage
could be detected with certainty, but that smaller percentages ought,
in operations upon such a small quantity of water, to be considered as
falling within the possible errors of experiment; In like manner, by
operating upon 10 litres of water 1-10th of a per cent. of unchanged
sewage could be detected. During the past year, however, this
process ofanalysis has been so improved that an amount of organic
nitrogen corresponding to at most 3-100ths of a per cent. of unchanged
sewage can now be detected with certainty in one litre of water.

Now about 4-5ths of the organic nitrogen contained in perfectly fresh
sewage exists there as urea which undergoes such rapid decomposition,
into the mineral compound carbonate of ammonia, that little or none
of it ever reaches the Thames from the towns whose sewers debouch
into this river. As average London sewage contains 10 parts of
combined nitrogen in 100,000 parts, it follows that 100,000 parts of
this sewage as it flows into the Thames will contain only 2 parts
of organic nitrogen. Further, if the sewage of the 600,000 persons
who drain into the Thames above the point whence the water
companies draw their supply have the strength of average London
sewage, it will amount to 18,000,000 gallons daily, and if the
average flow of the river at Teddington be taken at 800,000,000
gallons daily, it follows that the river will there contain 2250 parts
of sewage in 100,000 parts, or 24 per cent. This quantity of sewage,
if in the condition as delivered at the sewer outfall, would con
taminate the whole volume of the river, only to the extent of 045
part of organic nitrogen in 100,000 parts of water. Now on the
21st of January last the water delivered by the five companies
drawing their supplies from the Thames contained the following
amounts of organic nitrogen in 100,000 parts:—
    Chelsea (turbid). . . .058          Grand Junction (clear) 031
    West Middlesex (clear) 027 | Lambeth (turbid)               ... 062
    Southwark (turbid) ... 061
    It will be seen, therefore, that three out of the five samples of
water actually contained more organic nitrogen than would be due to
the admixture of the 18,000,000 gallons of sewage which are poured
into the Thames above the point from which these samples came.
But Thames water holds in solution a certain amount of peaty matter
which contains organic nitrogen; a sufficient proportion of this
substance, however, to furnish the above larger quantities of organic
nitrogen would render the water brownish-yellow when viewed in
a quart decanter, whilst these samples of Thames water were, when
filtered, colourless or nearly so. I am therefore of opinion that
 the Thames water delivered in London by the Chelsea, Southwark,
 and Lambeth companies on the 21st of January last contained
unoxidized sewage. This opinion is confirmed by the results of some
 experiments which I have recently made in my laboratory, and which
show that, contrary to the generally received opinion (which is, how
 ever, based upon no reliable experimental data), sewage in which the
 urea is already decomposed undergoes further change with extreme
 slowness, even when freely exposed to the air and mixed with large
 volumes of water. Thus I find that a mixture of weak sewage from
 one of the London sewers with nine times its volume of water (con
 taining bicarbonate of lime in solution) at a temperature of 20° to 25°C.,
 and well agitated every day by being made to flow in a thin stream
 through three feet of air, oxidizes but to a slight extent in the course
 of eight days. Immediately after mixture this sewage-contaminated

 water contained 267 part of organic carbon and 081 part of organic
 nitrogen in 100,000 parts, whilst after 96 hours it still contained
  250 part of organic carbon and '058 part of organic nitrogen, and
 even after the lapse of 192 hours the undecomposed organic matter
 still contained 200 part of organic carbon and 054 part of organic
 nitrogen.
      In connection with the organic matter in water, the investigation
 of the Welsh and Cumberland samples revealed a very curious effect
 produced by the admission of the detritus from lead and other mines
 into the waters of the streams and lakes. It was found, upon analysis,
 that water thus mixed with the milky streams from the crushing
 engines of mines contained a wonderfully small quantity of nitro
 genous organic matter. You will see this brought out in the following
 table:—

     This table shows that whilst some of these waters exhibit a rather
large quantity of organic carbon, they contain very little or no organic
nitrogen. And further, these waters, though they hold in solution a con
siderable amount of peaty matter, are perfectly colourless when seen in
a quart decanter; but when viewed through a stratum fifteen feet thick
they exhibit the magnificent blue-green tint of absolutely pure water,
a tint which is brought out when water is passed through animal
charcoal. We may illustrate the action of this crushed quartz of
lead mines and of animal charcoal, by three samples of the water
delivered to this Institution by the Grand Junction Company, and
which are contained in the tubes before you, each of which is fifteen
feet long. The centre tube contains the water just as it passes into
the cistern, the water in the second tube has been shaken with
powdered flint, whilst the water in the third tube has been passed
through animal charcoal. If we now send through each tube a parallel
ray of electric light, which ray will have to pass through a stratum of
about fifteen feet of water, you will perceive that the             :   C 2

yellow-brown tint upon the screen; the second, a beautiful green tint,
and the third, a turquoise colour: the last two powerfully reminding
the observer of the lakes of Lauerz and Zug, as seen from the summit
of the Rigi. (Experiment performed.) In fact this is doubtless the
chief cause of that magnificent colour which we witness in many of
the Swiss lakes, and which we see for instance in the Rhone when it
leaves the lake of Geneva, and the Limmat as it flows from the lake
of Zürich. The streams running into the heads of these lakes come
in turbid and filled with finely-crushed quartz and other minerals, the
detritus from the glaciers which are the source of those streams. In
the lakes these fine particles of mud subside and attract to themselves
the peaty colouring matter which is to be found in almost all waters.
     We see in two of the English lakes some indications of this blue
green tint appearing, and it is precisely in the localities where the
streams from the lead mines come down into the lakes.        You see near
the mouths of those milky streams which come down into Ullswater from
 Glenridding, and from the “Old Man,” into Coniston Lake, the in
dications of this precipitation and removal of those brown substances
which discolour the natural waters of our lakes. We have thus here, per
 haps for the first time, evidence of improvement of the quality of water
 by the admission into it of manufacturing refuse. Hence the diversion
 of these waters coming from lead and other mines, which would seem
at first sight to be necessary, need not be effected; on the contrary,
 their admission into the lakes would be of great benefit to the waters,
they would to some extent decolorize them, and would tend to reduce
the nitrogenous organic matter to the lowest possible amount. There
appears to be no need to fear that such streams will carry anything
into the lakes which will be deleterious to the drinker.        All those
streams have been carefully examined for lead, arsenic, copper, &c.,
and only in two cases has the faintest trace of lead been discovered,
and the quantity was so minute that it is absolutely impossible it
could be deleterious, even if the water coming from the mines them
selves were to be drunk, but mixed with the large quantities of the
 lake water, it becomes utterly inappreciable.
     The fatal effect said to be exerted upon fish by these milky streams
from mines is most probably due to a mechanical action of the finely
divided quartz upon their organs of respiration—an effect analogous
to that (but of an exaggerated kind) from which the Sheffield grinders
notoriously suffer.
      Having thus discussed the organic portion of the solid impurity of
these waters, let us now turn to the inorganic or mineral portion,
which may be conveniently divided, as regards its most important
constituents, into three subdivisions, viz.:—
     1. Soap destroying substances.
    2. Mineral compounds, constituting chiefly the skeleton of decom
posed sewage or manure.                                                    -
    3. Poisonous substances, such as arsenic, copper, and lead.
    The first or soap destroying category of substances communicate

1868.]       on the Imposed Water Supply of the Metropolis.           357
to water the quality called hardness. These substances are the salts
of lime and magnesia; and the quantity of them contained in the
proposed, as compared with the present, metropolitan water supply
will be seen on reference to the above analytical table. The hardening
effect of these substances is also given in a separate line of the same
table, from which it will be seen that the proposed is only about
1-l0th as hard as the present water supply.
    Tastes differ as regards hard or soft water for drinking purposes,
and medical arguments have from time to time been advanced, now in
favour of and now against each. It has been asserted in this country,
for instance, that hard water is necessary for the formation of bone,
and that the <U+FB01>nger of Providence points to the advantage of hard
water by the profusion of calcareous strata occurring in the earth's
crust, whilst M. Belgrand states that the inhabitants of the hard-water
districts of France notoriously suffer from carious teeth. It would
probably be extremely di<U+FB02>icult to prove either of these assertions. As
regards the enormous advantages of soft water for washing, cleansing,
and manufacturing purposes, there is, however, no difference of opinion.
In Glasgow alone the annual saving of soap only, by the introduction
of Loch Katrine water, for a previous supply of very moderately hard
water, has been estimated at 36,0001. Having had the opportunity of ‘
comparing a six years’ experience of the soft water supplied to Man
chester, with a subsequent ten years’ experience of the hard water of
London, I can state that the soft water was for all purposes preferred
by every member of my family. On removing from Manchester to
London, the repugnance to drink the hard water of the latter city was
at least as marked as that which I have sometimes noticed in persons
making the transition in the opposite direction.
     The hardness of the London waters is chie<U+FB02>y what is termed temp0~
'rary hardness; that is, it is caused by the carbonates of lime and
magnesia, the greater portion of which is gradually deposited on boil
ing the water for half-an-hour. By reason of this softening of such

own experience leads me to the conclusion that the advantages of
temporary over permanent hardness have been considerably overrated.
In reality, water used for domestic purposes is, even when used hot,
either not heated to the boiling point, or is boiled for too short a time
to remove more than a small proportion of its temporary hardness.
Thus, water drawn from the.kitchen boilers of a dwelling-house and of
the Athemeum Club was usually almost as hard as the cold water with
which they were supplied, as is seen from the following table :—

    In the recent supply of water to Paris from new sources, theim
 portance of soft water attracted the attention of the eminent engineer
 M. Belgrand; a close investigation of the available sources, however,
 soon showed that he had unfortunately but little choice, as the really soft
 streams of the Fontainebleau sands (the minimum hardness is however
 6°) and of the granite of Morvan (minimum hardness 22°) were mere

1868.]        on the proposed Water Supply of the Metropolis.             359
dribblets. Of the latter M. Belgrand says—“ Sources qui donnent
les eaux les plus pures du bassin de la Seine; déviation vers Paris
impossible, en raison du peu d’importance des sources.” Hence the
river Vanne (NO-20°), somewhat softer than the Thames, was the
softest available source, and having <U+FB01>rst conclusively demonstrated
this, he consoles the Parisians by saying—-“ Les eaux du granite, du
greensand et des sables de Fontainebleau, qui sont chimiquement plus
pures, sont beaucoup moins agréables a boire.”               '          -
     The second category of inorganic substances contained amongst the
solid impurities of waters, consists of the mineral compounds constituting
chie<U+FB02>y the skeleton of decomposed sewage or manure. The putrescible
nitrogenous organic matters present in water, or in the soil through
which water percolates, undergo gradual oxidation and decomposition,
by which their carbon and hydrogen are converted into carbonic acid
and water, and their nitrogen into ammonia, nitrous and nitric acids.
The last three remain in the water, constituting a record of previous
contamination with putrescible nitrogenous organic matter. But rain
water always contains ammonia, and, as Dr. Bence Jones has shown,
also nitrous and nitric acids. The nitrogen in these forms in rain
water, as it <U+FB01>nds its way into rivers and springs, amounts in the aggre
gate to '032 part in 100,000 parts of water, therefore this amount must
be deducted from that found on analysis, as nitrogen derived from
aerial sources. The remainder, if any, represents the nitrogen derived
from putre<U+FB01>ed nitrogenous organic matters with which the water has
been in contact. To express this in terms of some known standard, I
employ average <U+FB01>ltered London sewage, which contains 10 parts of
nitrogen in the form of putrescible organic matter in 100,000 parts.
Thus, a water which contained one part of nitrogen in 100,000, as
nitrous acid, nitric acid and ammonia would contain in 100,000 parts,
the nitrogenous remains or skeleton of an amount of putrescible organic
matter equal to that contained in 10,000 parts of average <U+FB01>ltered
London sewage. Such a water therefore is said to have a previous
sewage contamination of 10,000 parts in every 100,000 parts. But it
maybe asked, Is this a true record of the previous history of the water
in this respect? I believe it to be so, as far as it goes. I believe that
this nitrogen as truly represents a quantity of previously existing putres
cible organic nitrogenous matter, as that the bones of a megatherium demon
strate the previous existence of an individual of that species ,1 but as the
geological record of previously existing organisms is imperfect, so is the
nitrogenous record, just as chemical and mechanical agencies have
broken up and dissipated the remains of millions of animals during
long geological periods, so does 'the action of growing plants, and per
haps also of living animals, remove from water, ina few hours or days,
some portion of this skeleton of previous putrescible organic matter.
Thus by storage in large reservoirs, the East London Company reduced
the previous sewage contamination of the River Lea last summer from
about 2000 down to 230 parts in 100,000. The previous sewage
contamination of a water as determined by analysis is therefore a
minimum quantity.

360                               Professor Franhland                           [April 3,
     But in addition to the aerial for which due allowance is made, can
there not be some other source of this skeleton than putre<U+FB01>ed sewage
or manure matter? Can it not be derived from putre<U+FB01>ed vegetable
matter——from peaty matter for instance ? Without utterly denying
the possibility of this, I venture to assert that nowhere, in this country
at least, nor probably on the continent of Europe, is there such a quan
tity of nitrates, nitrites, or ammonia produced from vegetable sources
as to appreciably affect the truth of my proposition that the nitrogen in
these forms obtained by waters from terrestrial sources is substantially
due to the putrefaction and oxidation of sewage and manure matters.
     It has been objected to this view of the origin and signi<U+FB01>cance of
these forms of combined nitrogen, that waters derived from com
paratively deep wells, in the chalk for instance, contain them in large
quantities; thus the Kent Company’s water exhibits a previous sew
age or manure contamination of from 3000 to 5000 parts in 100,000.
 It is di<U+FB01>icult to understand how such an objection could have origin
ated, and it certainly disappears on examination; for instance in the
above case, it is well known that a very large proportion of the water
collected in the London chalk basin consists of the drainage from
manured land, and it is doubtless from this source that the large pro
portion of nitrates existing in this water is derived.
     According to Mr. Way’s analysis, the drainage water from culti
vated land contains an amount of nitrates corresponding to the follow
ing proportions of previous sewage contamination in 100,000 parts :—
                                                      Maximum.        Minimum.      Mean.

     With two remarkable exceptions the above results show the greatest
previous sewage contamination precisely in those places where it would
be predicted; thus the shallow well-water of Leyland, near Preston,
consists almost entirely of the drainage from cesspools and market
gardens, through a sandy soil, the latter being heavily manured with
night-soil, stable manure, and guano. It need therefore excite no
surprise that nearly 25 per cent. of this water has been in a condition
equivalent to average London sewage. The quality of the waters taken
from four of the city pumps and from the well in the Royal Institu
tion‘“ needs no comment; these shallow wells are now recognized as
being fed by oxidized and somewhat diluted sewage. It is, however, in
the well of the Rue Traversine, in Paris, that this kind of contamina
tion reaches perhaps its maximum. The cesspool system is still in
full activity in Paris, and the soil of that city is saturated with liquid
manure of such a strength that one gallon of it is equivalent to three
gallons of average London sewage.
     As already mentioned there are in the above table two remarkable
exceptions to the general previous sewage contamination of well-waters.
These are the artesian well at Grenelle and the chalk well of the Cater
ham Water Company. With regard to the <U+FB01>rst, it is evident that the
pressure of water which supports a column of 122 feet above the surface
at Grenelle, precludes the possibility of admixture with the drainage of
 Paris, still there can be little doubt that the water supplying the chalk
 of the Paris basin is, to some extent at least, contaminated by manure,
although the land through which it drains is far less generally culti
vated than that through which the water supply of the London chalk
percolates. The water from the Caterham Company’s well, comes, I
believe, from a greater depth than that of the Kent and South Essex
 Company’s, and this circumstance, coupled with the observation of Mr.
 Dugald Campbell that the water of the deep chalk wells, unlike that

department of this Institution, and as I have been frequently and very earnestly
requested to withdraw a prohibition which I placed upon its use in the cholera

                                                                     In 100,000 parts.

    The gases dissolved in this water contained scarcely a trace of oxygen. A
half-pint glass of it contains nearly a quarter of a pint of water which has
previously been in the condition of average London sewage, besides a dessert
spoonful of actual or unoxidized sewage. It seems, therefore, highly probable that
<U+FB01>ltered and tolerably well-oxidized sewage, in its undiluted condition, would furnish
the most popular water supply for London. Such is the reliability of instinct in
these matters.

362                            Professor Frankland                      [April 3,
of the shallower chalk-wells, is free from nitrates, and taken in con
nection with the fact that there is free water-communication between
the upper and lower chalk, points to the conclusion that chalk
possesses the property of abstracting nitrates from water. If this be
the case, it would also account for the circumstance that the water of
the shallow chalk-wells exhibits much less previous sewage contami
nation than might be expected ; the average amount of nitrates found
by Mr. Way in drainage water would indicate a previous sewage con
tamination in the chalk-water, equal to about 20,000 parts in 100,000,
whilst the contamination actually exhibited in the case of the Kent,
Worthing, and South Essex Companies waters is only: Kent 3770,
Worthing 3940, and South Essex 8205 in 100,000 parts.
     I have extended this investigation to various river and lake waters,
as well as to spring waters, and have been here much indebted, as
regards the non-British waters, to M. Boussingault’s researches on the
presence of nitrates in waters. The following tables exhibit the results

       The results embodied in the above tables throw considerable
 additional light upon this form of water contamination. They show
in the <U+FB01>rst place that waters which have not been in suspicious com
pany exhibit little if any previous sewage contamination, thus in the
whole of the Cumberland and Westmorland district it only occurs in
 one instance (the Upper Kent which, as every tourist knows, has a
 little cultivated land on its banks), and that to a small extent only.
In the Welsh waters again there are only three instances. The spring
water, which issues from the Greensand beneath an uncultivated but
 heather-covered surface at Mother Ludlaw’s Cave, near Farnham,
 exhibits a mere trace of this contamination,- whilst the waters of nine
 springs on the Rhine, in the Vosges, and in the Pyrenees, examined by
 M. Boussingault, exhibit no indications of previous sewage contamin
 ation. On the other hand, the spring forming the source of the But
 and issuing not far from the cemetery at Montmartre at once discloses
 its antecedents, and exhibits a previous sewage contamination of 85,310
 parts in 100,000.        It will be seen that the water of the Ourcq, which
 is now used only for watering the streets of Paris, exhibits a previous
 sewage contamination somewhat less than Thames water.
       But what ~is the import of this previous sewage contamination?
 These skeleton compounds are innocuous, why trouble ourselves about
 them? True, they are innocuous, or nearly so; but inasmuch as they

  364                         Professor 'Fmkzmz                     [April 3,
  show that the water has been in contact with animal refuse they bring
  a heavy charge of suspicion against it. These refuse animal matters
  are known to contain that which is hurtful to human life. This hurt
  ful matter is believed, on very strong evidence, to consist of spores,
  or germs of organisms, which are capable, under favourable circum
  stances, of producing in man such diseases as cholera, typhoid fever,
  and dysentery. Now such spores or germs, endowed as they are with
  vitality, will be likely to resist the oxidizing agencies which convert
  the rest of the animal refuse into carbonic acid, water, nitric acid,
  nitrous acid, and ammonia. For instance, if the contents of an egg
  were beaten up with water and poured into the Thames at Oxford, the
  organic matter would probably be entirely oxidized and converted into
  mineral compounds before it reached Teddington; but if the egg were
  thrown whole into the Thames at Oxford, it would, if it retained its
  vitality, be carried down to Teddington without any decomposition of
  its organic matter.‘ There can be no doubt that the spores or germs
  of many organisms are in like manner capable of resisting for a long
  time the decomposing action of water. Now no practicable process is
  known by which these spores, once introduced into water, can be again
  removed or can have their vitality destroyed. Filtration will not do
  it; in fact it is well known to engineers that water is often contaminated
  with visible suspended matter which cannot be separated by <U+FB01>ltration;
  thus M. Belgrand says, “ Lorsque l’eau est troublée dans le <U+FB02>euve, elle
  sort louche de nos <U+FB01>ltres." And again, speaking specially of the
  London Water supply, “ Le mode de dégrossissage employé par les
  grandes compagnies anglaises, trés convenable it Londres, 01), Fan as bait
  pas d’eau, ne caut men a Paris, 02), les femmes, les enfants, les m'ez'llards
  de la classe ouvriére 'n’ont pas d’autre boisson. J’ai constaté par moi
  méme, et les ingénieurs anglais n’en disconviennent pas, que l’eau sort
  des <U+FB01>ltres trés chargée dc matiére organique.” Again, in the account of
  his highly remarkable researches on vaccine and small-pox poisons,
  recently communicated to the Academy of Sciences, M. Chauveau
  says regarding the organic germs contained in these poisons, that they
   “ne se déposent jamais completement dans les couches profondes du
  milieu ambient, et passent a travers tous les <U+FB01>ltres.”
       Boiling even for several hours cannot be relied upon for the destruc
  tion of such germs, some of which have recently been shown to retain
   their vitality after four hours boiling; in fact there can now no longer
   be any doubt that, as contended by M. Pasteur, the cases of so-called
   spontaneous generation have all had their origin in ignorance of the
  excessive tenacity of life in the germs of the lowest organisms.
       Nothing short of distillation therefore, as it is carried on in nature,
   can be relied upon to free, completely, sewage-contaminated water from
   its noxious constituents. Excessive <U+FB01>ltration is doubtless to some ex-
‘ tent a safeguard, and hence previous sewage contamination in chalk
   water, if we could be certain that the water had been fairly <U+FB01>ltered
   through some 100 feet of chalk, and that none of it gained access to
   the wells through <U+FB01>ssures or swallow-holes, would have far less signi

ficance than it has in the case of a river water where the fine-suspended
and noxious matters of sewage have but a comparatively slender chance
 of removal before the water reaches the consumer.                          We must also not
forget that mere dilution fails, in the case of these suspended germs,
to destroy their noxious quality, differing as they do in this respect re
markably from soluble poisons. The daily casting of a thousand fatal
doses of strychnine into the Thames at Oxford ought not to occasion
so much alarm amongst the London water-drinkers as the present flow
of the Oxford sewage into the river, because the excessive dilution of
 the soluble strychnine would effectually prevent its producing any
physiological effect. Each noxious living germ, on the other hand,
contains within itself the power of indefinite multiplication and mis
chief. One such germ may be present in a wineglass-full of water,
whereas it would be necessary to drink many thousand gallons of
water to imbibe a noxious amount of strychnine, under the conditions
just alluded to. I am therefore of opinion that water once con
taminated with sewage or manure matter ought never again to be used
for domestic purposes, if any other supply can be obtained; and I en
dorse the advice of M. Belgrand and the principle which guided him
in the selection of his new water supply for Paris:—“On a dit des
eaux potables, qu’elles étaient comme la femme de César, qu’elles ne
devaient pas même étre soupçonnées, et c'est mon avis.”
     A few words will now suffice regarding the third class of mineral
matters that may be present in the solid impurities of waters, viz.
poisonous substances, such as arsenic, copper, and lead. These substances
are only likely to occur in waters connected with mineral workings
one of them only, lead, has been detected in the proposed supplies,
and that only in two streams in Cumberland, and in quantity far too
minute to require any further notice. .

     You will find that the gases contained in the Welsh and Cumber
land waters are very similar in quantity and proportion to those found
in recently distilled water. Collected as these waters are near the
mountain ranges which constitute the great condensers of natural dis
tillation, this is exactly the result we should expect. The London

866                        Professor Frankland                  [April 3,
waters di<U+FB01>'er mainly in containing more carbonic acid in solution,
which makes them more sparkling in appearance. Sparkling waters
are generally preferred by the public, although they commonly owe
their briskness to extensive contact with decaying organic matter. It
is thus that the highly-sparkling pump-waters of London are still
preferred by many. On the other hand, soft waters are not necessarily
vapid; no draught of water could be more delicious than that which
is obtained from the public drinln'ng-fountains of Glasgow, supplied
from Loch Katrine, although I <U+FB01>nd that 100 volumes of this water
contain only the following gaseous constituents :

                             Action upon Lead.
     The conditions which determine the action or non-action of water
upon lead, have hitherto been involved in much obscurity. Messrs.
Graham, Miller, and Hofmann, the Government Commission of 1851,
on the supply of water to the metropolis, established the fact that the
presence of dissolved oxygen and the absence of more than three
volumes of carbonic acid in 100 volumes of water, are amongst the
conditions necessary for the attack of lead.
     The whole of the present water supply of the metropolis is perfectly
protected from acting upon lead by the large quantity of carbonic acid
which it contains. Still there are obviously other conditions involved
in the problem; for all the samples of water from the Welsh and Cum
berland districts contain, as shown in the above analytical results, dis
solved oxygen, whilst not one of them possesses an amount of carbonic
acid even remotely approaching that which is necessary to protect it,
and yet some of these waters act violently upon lead, whilst others are
entirely without action upon the metal. Having recently had occasion
to observe that a sample of distilled water, which acted powerfully
upon lead, completely lost this quality by momentary contact with
animal charcoal, I found on further investigation, that a minute quan
 tity of the chief constituent of bone-black, viz. phosphate of lime,
completely protects water from action upon lead. I then carefully
examined for phosphate of lime, the water of the River Kent (Upper
Kent) which is eminently distinguished for its violent action upon
 lead, and the water of the River Vyrnwy, which, although nearly as
 soft as distilled water, has not the slightest action upon lead, even
 when placed in contact with a bright and freshly-cut surface of the
metal for 24 hours. This examination established the fact that the
 water of the Vyrnwy contained an appreciable amount of phosphate of
 lime, whilst not the slightest trace of this substance could be detected
 in that of the Upper Kent. The waters from both the proposed dis
 tricts have been carefully examined as regards their behaviour towards

1868.]       on the proposed Water Supply of the Metropolis.         367
lead, and, as the result of this examination, it may be safely a<U+FB01>rmed
that no danger on this score need be apprehended from the introduc
tion of water from either district into the metropolis. I here exhibit
to you samples of lead in various waters exemplifying the points upon
which I have just spoken.
    Lastly, I place before you in these large cylinders, holding more
than a gallon each, samples of the Welsh and Cumberland waters,
side by side with a similar sample of Thames water, which fairly
represents the condition of more than 3-5ths of this water as it has
been delivered in London since the 21st of January last. But it may
be asked, will these waters from Wales or Cumberland reach the
metropolis in this colourless, transparent, and soft condition after
passing through a conduit from 180 to 280 miles in length ? Let me
tell you what I conceive will be the effect of such a conduit upon the
water. For the <U+FB01>rst two or three years a certain amount of lime from
the surface of the cement in the conduit will dissolve in the water,
communicating at <U+FB01>rst an amount of hardness probably not exceeding
5° ; this effect will gradually subside, and after two or three years the
water will be delivered in London in a slightly better condition than
that in which it leaves the storage reservoirs—a slightly better con
dition because it will be somewhat better aerated than when it starts
on its journey. At the present moment the water of Loch Katrine
passes through a conduit 26 miles long, and I have lately carefully
taken its hardness as it leaves the lake and as it is delivered to con
sumers in Glasgow. Its hardness on delivery in Glasgow is only
0'3", exactly the same as in the lake, and its transit through 26
miles of conduit has therefore added no hardening constituent to the
water. Now, if 26 miles of conduit fail to alter the hardness, I can
only conclude that 180 or even 280 miles of conduit, if properly
constructed, will also, after the lapse of a few years, be equally incom
petent to produce any substantial increase in the hardness. At the
time the above experiments were made, Loch Katrine water had
<U+FB02>owed through the conduit for seven years.
     These are the principal points I have to bring before you in con
nection with the proposed supply, and as a summary of the chemical
 investigation of the present water supply on the one hand, and of the
 samples furnished by the Welsh and Cumberland districts on the other,
 I may state the following conclusions to which these investigations
have led me :—
     1. The present water supply of the metropolis is largely contami
 nated with sewage. Both analysis and statistics concur in the state
 ment that each glass of Thames water taken from the river by the
 companies, contains one tea-spoonful of sewage.
     2. Although this sewage is generally to a great extent oxidized
 before the delivery of the water in London; yet there is no guarantee
 whatsoever that all its noxious qualities are removed, because these
 noxious qualities are, in all probability, contained in the mechanically
 suspended and least oxidizable portion of the sewage.

 368                     Professor Frankland                     [April 3,
     3. The river water supplied in London is often very imperfectly
<U+FB01>ltered; and thus even the visible suspended matters of sewage are not
wholly excluded from the water supply. Only on one occasion during
the whole year 1867, have I obtained a transparent sample of water
from the Southwark Company’s mains. The Grand Junction Com
pany’s water was turbid, four times out of twelve, the Chelsea thrice,
the West Middlesex, Lambeth, and East London each twice, out of the
twelve occasions when the samples were drawn for analysis. The New
River Company alone delivered perfectly <U+FB01>ltered water during the
whole year.
    4. The quality of the water supplied to London is greatly inferior
to that of any other town in the United Kingdom, whose supply I
have examined.
    5. The distribution of water in the metropolis still continues, with
but slight exceptions, on the intermittent system, a system which has
been abolished in almost every town of importance in the United
Kingdom.
    6. The water which it is proposed to supply either from the Welsh
or the Cumberland districts is of excellent quality. It is equal or
superior to that supplied to any town in Great Britain.
    7. The water from each of the proposed districts is extremely soft,
pleasant to drink, and of good aeration.
    8. These waters have never been contaminated with sewage, and
are therefore above all suspicion. '
    9. They can be distributed in the present system of supply pipes
without any danger of lead contamination.                              ‘
    The choice between the present and proposed supply rests virtually
with the intelligent inhabitants of the metropolis. Will you go to a
source of pure water uncontaminated with sewage, or will you continue
the existing supply? I can anticipate your verdict, but you must not
delay to record it. These splendid sources now available will not
remain much longer within your reach.
    In conclusion, I beg to quote the opinion of one of our highest
medical authorities on the dangers of sewage-contaminated water.
Unpleasant as the theme may be, this opinion is in the highest degree
deserving the earnest attention of every individual who has progressed
beyond the state of savagery. In his Report on the Cholera Visitation
of 1866, Mr. Simon, the medical officer of the Privy Council, says :—
“ It cannot be too distinctly understood that the person who contracts
cholera in this country is z'pso facto demonstrated with almost absolute
certainty to have been exposed to excremental pollution; that what
gave him cholera was (mediately or immediately) cholera-contagium
discharged from another’s bowels; that, in short, the diffusion of
cholera among us depends entirely upon the numberless <U+FB01>lthy facilities
which are let exist, and especially in our larger towns, for the fouling
of earth and air and water, and thus secondarily for the infection of man,
with whatever contagium may be contained in the miscellaneous out—
<U+FB01>owings of the population. Excrement-sodden earth, excrement

1868.]         on the proposed Water Supply of the Metropolis.          369
reeking air, excrement-tainted water, these are for us the causes of
cholera. That they respectively act only in so far as the excrement
is cholera-excrement, and that cholera-excrement again only acts in so
far as it contains certain microscopical fungi, may be the truest of all
true propositions; but whatever be their abstract truth, their separate
application is impossible. Nowhere out of Laputa could there be serious
thought of differentiating excremental performances into groups of diar
rhoeal and healthy, or of using the highest powers of the microscope to
identify the cylindro-teenium for extermination. It is excrement, indis
criminately, which must be kept from fouling us with its decay.
    “And thus it is that my practical advice remains substantially what it
has been for years. The local conditions of safety are, above all, these
two : —(l) that, by appropriate structural works, all the excremental
produce of the population shall be so promptly and so thoroughly
removed, that the inhabited place, in its air and soil, shall be abso
lutely without foecal impurities ; and (2) that the water supply of the
population shall be derived from such sources, and conveyed in such
channels, that its contamination by excrement is impossible.
 _ “What good results are got even by rough approximation to those
sanitary standards has already been abundantly shown here. The way
in which the southern districts of London, with their three-fourths of
a million of population, have gradually gained comparative immunity
from cholera in proportion as their two water companies have ceased to
distribute sewage-tainted water among them, is a matter of familiar
history.
     “ That cholera is still a terror to Europe shows how scantily such
illustrations are yet understood. Even here in England the objects
which I have named as essential are at best but rarely ful<U+FB01>lled ; indeed
for vast numbers of our population scarcely rudimentary endeavours
have been made to attain them. Town after town might be named,
with myriad on myriad of population, where there is little more
structural arrangement for the removal of refuse than if the inhabitants
were but tented there for a night. The case of the water supply is no
better: my reports are incessantly showing the too frequent foulness of
private supplies; while, as regards public water supplies, such as gene
'rally are in the hands of commercial companies, it has again and again
been shown (and seldom more pointedly than in the present volume),
that their conveniences and advantages are countervailed by dangers
to life on a scale of gigantic magnitude, unless those who administer
the supplies act under a very deep sense of responsibility.

                      On some New Experiments on Light.
THE speaker commenced by referring to the fact that we are constantly
making new experiments 0r observations on light: in fact, all seeing
is but a comparison of different degrees of light and shade, and the
contrast of colours. Most of the rays that meet our eyes frpm sur
                                                                    2 D

s72         _              Dr. J. H. Gladstone                 [April 24,
rounding objects are re<U+FB02>ected rays, but some of the commonest things,
such as the water-bottles and tumblers of cut-glass on our dining
tables, exhibit beautifully the bending, the magnifying, the diminishing,
and the production of coloured fringes, due to refraction. The purpose
of this discourse was to rise from the simplest phenomena of this kind
to a consideration of Refraction-equivalents, and to describe the state
of our present knowledge in regard to them.
    By means of the electric lamp it was shown that a piece of glass,
or other transparent body, will throw a perfectly black shadow
if the two surfaces through which the ray passes be not parallel;
that the light is then bent on one side, and at the same time spread
out into its component colours; that this bending (refraction) varies
with the amount of inclination of the two surfaces to one another, but
in such a way that the sine of the angle of refraction bears a constant
ratio to the sine of the angle of incidence; that this constant number,
termed the index of refraction, or Aa, belongs only to the one substance,
each solid, liquid, or gas having its own index; that there is no
necessary connection between the amount of refraction and the length
of the spectrum (dispersion) caused by di<U+FB01>'erent substances, whether
gaseous, liquid, or solid-for instance, a solution of an iodide always
disperses more than a solution of the chloride of the same metal, even
though it be diluted to the same amount of refraction.
    This index of refraction is affected by change of temperature. In
liquids, and probably in all gases, the bending decreases as the thermo
meter rises; in solids, on the contrary, as lately shown by Fizeau, the
change is in the opposite direction, crown glass always remaining the
same, and <U+FB02>uor spar being the only case where he observed a dimi
nution. This was experimentally demonstrated in regard to liquids.
Thus a yellow sodium ray, which had passed through a hollow prism
<U+FB01>lled with oil of nutmeg, and thence through another <U+FB01>lled with
bisulphide of carbon, moved some inches along the screen, when the
nutmeg oil was warmed a few degrees by stirring it with heated iron
wire. This index of refraction is still more materially a<U+FB02>’ected when
a body passes from the solid to the liquid, or from the liquid to the
gaseous condition; a fact that was illustrated by the visibility of the
water melted in crystalline spaces in the middle of a block of ice.
    The index of refraction of a mixture is moreover not always
the mean of the indices of its constituents. Thus a ray passed sue
cessively through two hollow prisms <U+FB01>lled with equal quantities of
alcohol and water respectively, fell on the screen in a certain position;
but when the two liquids were mixed together, and divided between
the two prisms, the ray was visibly refracted to a greater distance.
    These changes depend on the alterations of volume which the
substances undergo; and the speaker, in conjunction with the Rev. T.
Pelham Dale, had observed in liquids that the index of refraction,
minus unity, divided by the density (in symbolic language              is
constant for all temperatures, and for all mixtures, or rather that the

1868.]            on some New Experiments on Light.                  373
coincidence is very close but not quite perfect on account of some
other law not yet understood. This conclusion has been abundantly
veri<U+FB01>ed by Landolt of Bonn, Ketteler, and Wiillner, and the former
experimenter has founded upon it a method of analyzing mixtures
of liquids.
    This unchangeable number was termed the “speci<U+FB01>c refractive
energy” of the substance, and it seemed to hold good notwithstanding
a change from the solid to the liquid or the gaseous condition. It was
early observed that the speci<U+FB01>c refractive energy of a compound bore
a close resemblance to the mean of the speci<U+FB01>c refractive energies of
its components. Landolt, by multiplying this number by the chemical
equivalent, facilitated the calculation greatly. He termed this new
number the “refraction-equivalent,” P ‘u’51’ and proofs have rapidly
accumulated that the number is little affected, not only by temperature,
change of aggregate condition, mixture, or solution, but even by strong
chemical combination.
    Thus diamond, which is crystallized carbon, has the refraction
equivalent 5'0; sulphur has 16-0. Bisulphide of carbon, C 8,, which
is nearly the most refractive liquid known, should therefore be repre
sented by 5 + 2 X 16, that is 370. The experimental number is 37'3.
But the diamond will burn in oxygen, and is thus converted into
carbonic anhydride, while it is possible to reduce this gas into another
containing only half the amount of oxygen, namely, carbonic oxide.
The refraction-equivalents of these gases, as deduced from Dulong’s
observations, are respectively 1003 and 7'53; but the difference
between C 02 and C O is one equivalent of oxygen, and the difference
between the above numbers is 2'5. This then may be taken as the
refraction-equivalent of oxygen, and subtracting it from C 0:7‘53 we
have remaining 0:5'03, practically the same number as that obtained
directly from crystallized carbon. Similarly, but generally by more
indirect methods, it has been determined that this element, whether
pure as diamond or combined with other elements to form gases as the
above-mentioned, coal-gas, or cyanogen, or liquids as chloride of
carbon, benzole, oil of turpentine, alcohol, or ether, or solids as
para<U+FB02>in, sugar, or camphor, is still exerting the same in<U+FB02>uence on the
rays of light that set its particles in motion, an in<U+FB02>uence that we can
express by the number 5'0. Again to revert to sulphur, the two salts
sulpho-cyanide and cyanide of potassium—K S Cy and K Cy—di<U+FB01>‘er
by one equivalent of this element, and their refraction-equivalents as
determined from their aqueous solutions are respectively 334 and
171, numbers differing by 16-3, a number almost identical with that
reckoned from molten sulphur. In this way the refraction-equivalents
of a large number of the elements have been determined; and the
following table comprises what seem the most probable numbers
among those that have been hitherto published by Landolt, Haagen,
and Schrauf, as well as the speaker :—

    The above numbers are reckoned for the red ray. Most of them
can as yet claim to be considered only as approximative; and it seems
certain that some elements, as oxygen and sulphur, have more than
one refraction-equivalent.
    Wanadium, though included in the above table, has only just been
determined, and that from the oxy-trichloride which Professor Roscoe
exhibited a few weeks before. It"is interesting, as it supports his
theory of the close analogy of phosphorus and vanadium, for these
two bodies, with sulphur, exceed, all others in refraction and especially
in dispersion.
    The speaker stated that he was now engaged in examining the
effect of salts in solution on the rays of light, and that he hoped to
determine in this way the refraction-equivalents not only of a multi
tude of salts, but of the metallic elements themselves.
    But the question may be asked, “If a substance has a refraction
compounded of the refraction of its constituents, how can bodies such
as Iceland spar have two refractive indices?” Now these are crystal
line bodies, or if uncrystallized they have become doubly refracting
by being unequally heated or compressed. In either case we may
suppose a different amount of tension in different directions; and the
fact of the two rays being oppositely polarized points to some such
difference of molecular arrangement. It is easy to understand that
the change of tension or internal structure may act in the same way
as a change of density in modifying the velocity of transmitted light,
and therefore the amount of its refraction. But if we take the crystal
to pieces by dissolving it, there can then no longer be unequal
tension or unsymmetrical arrangement of particles, and it must have
one refraction-equivalent. And this is always the case. The numbers
deduced from Brewster's observations of the two rays of crystallized
nitre are 16.3 and 25.0, while the equivalent of nitre dissolved in
water is the intermediate number 21.8,

                   How to form a Good Taste in Art.
DURING the last hundred years the Fine Arts have been successfully
practised in England, and now hold a great and._increasing place in
our interests. Good taste in judging art is therefore a matter of some
value. The popular view is, however, that Taste is not subject to
rules. The proposition now advocated is, on the contrary, that Taste
 is, like all other: matters of human knowledge, an educated natural
bias; that practically Taste is knowledge. What such knowledge
leads to is, not identical judgments, but judgments founded on rational
rules ; not uniformity, but unity of taste.
     Three main practical: applications of such knowledge considered,
corresponding to the main elements which form the interest of works
of art :—
     1. Knowledge of natural fact.
     II. Knowledge of the material conditions of each art, and of the
chief phases of thought or emotion or sentiment which are expressed
b y art.
      These branches of knowledge are, at the same time, those which
the artist himself should possess. Reasons, however, why the artist
is not generally the best judge of air.
     III. Knowledge of the historical conditions under which works
of art have been produced.
     Results of these forms of knowledge in forming a correct and
rational taste. Such a taste will greatly increase our sense of that
which is the object of all the Fine Arts-high and lasting pleasure.
It will also be a large and comprehensive taste, free from fastidious
ness and petty egotistic judgments. The more accurately we enjoy,
{he more deeply we enjoy. We love more things, the more wisely we
  ove.

       Sm HENRY HOLLAND, Bart. M.D. D.O.L. F.R.S. President,

            On the Arti<U+FB01>cial Formation of Organic Substances.
OHEMIOAL researches are liable at various epochs to take special
directions.‘ Before 1830 organic chemistry was comparatively little
studied. The simpli<U+FB01>cation of the methods of organic analysis by
Liebig took place at a most opportune moment, and gave an extra
ordinary impetus to the study of carbon compounds. So great was
this in<U+FB02>uence that proximate and ultimate analysis made a progress
the rapidity of which was unexampled in the history of science.
     But chemists soon became dissatis<U+FB01>ed with merely determining
the composition of substances, and they very soon began eagerly to

1868.]          Arti<U+FB01>cial Formation of Organic Substances.           379
study their products of decomposition, and in this manner get a clue
to the way in which nature had put them together.
     The successful attack on this problem led to a, much grander one
suggesting itself. This was to utilize the insight analysis had given
them into the constitution of substances, and to endeavour to build them
up without the assistance of life. The speaker showed that we thus
arrive at the two great engines of chemical research, analysis and
synthesis.
    He then proceeded to de<U+FB01>ne and illustrate experimentally these
terms.
    In organic chemistry the information supplied by the analysis of a
substance often renders its synthesis easy. Water was decomposed by
a battery, and its properties and quantitative relations shown. The
mixed gases were then introduced into a soap-bubble, so prepared as
to last a considerable time. It was by a simple contrivance attached
to a? thread, and the lightness of the enclosed gases was shown by the
fact that the bubble was able to raise the thread and a disc of paper
into the air. The energy with which the mixed gases combine to
form water was then shown by applying a light to the bubble, when
it burst with a loud report. The quantitative synthesis of water was
experimentally shown by passing hydrogen over eupric oxide in an
apparatus which allowed of the collection of the water. It was then
shown that in organic chemistry the molecules are generally too com
plex to be put together so easily; and this statement was proved by
reference to the constitution of methylamine, the simplest of the
organic alkaloids.
     The speaker then went somewhat fully into the question of the
propriety of the use of the terms “organic” and “inorganic.” He
showed also that all the attempts hitherto made at separating chemistry
into two distinct branches had failed. Liebig’s de<U+FB01>nition of organic
chemistry as the “ chemistry of compound radicles ” being obviously
inadequate, inasmuch as some compound radicles (such as sulphuryl
and phosphoryl) are certainly inorganic.
    Laurent’s de<U+FB01>nition, “ chemistry of carbon,” is equally insu<U+FB01>icient,
inasmuch as carbonic anhydride and carbonic tetrachloride are as
clearly inorganic as sulphuric anhydride or sodic chloride. He then
proceeded to argue that chemistry was “one and indivisible,” and
stated that one of the chief aims of his discourse was to prove that
assertion.
    It was shown that until within the last few years all the speci<U+FB01>c
attempts made to break the apparently natural barriers between organic
and inorganic chemistry had proved failures.
     It was true that in the course of the innumerable researches and
experiments made by chemists, one or two of the simple organic bodies
had presented themselves; but, like urea and cyanogen, they were
substances which, as it were, hovered on the con<U+FB01>nes of inorganic
chemistry, and would have been called inorganic had they not con
 tainod carbon.
     The grand problem, which'consisted in taking the elements them

380                         Mr. G'reville Williams cm the                 [May 8,
selves, and building them up gradatim into the proximate principles
existing in the tissues of plants and animals, until lately appeared
almost hopeless. This apparent di<U+FB02>iculty was shown to arise from
the mistake of supposing the proximate principles of animals and
vegetables to result from an occult power vaguely termed the “ vital
force.” It was at one time supposed that the laws which regulate
combination were either suspended or modi<U+FB01>ed in the tissues of living
creatures, but the speaker urged that whenever the proper reagents
were made to act upon each other under the proper conditions, the
same substances were produced which at one time were supposed to
require the aid of vitality for their formation.
    The problem of the “synthesis,” or building up of the so-called
organic substances, was then shown to present itself (in the present
state of chemistry) under two aspects :—lst. Where they are prepared
by the aid of reagents, which have themselves been produced directly
or indirectly from animals or vegetables. 2nd. Where the synthesis
was e<U+FB02>'ected from ‘the free elements themselves, from hydrogen and
pure carbon.
    The speaker then proceeded to enumerate some of the principal
instances where substances originally derived from animals or vege
tables had been formed synthetically. Wiihler’s synthesis of urea
was shown to be one of the earliest in point of date, and his method
was described, and also Kolbe’s new process by the mere heating of
ammonic carbonate to a point just below that at which urea is de
composed.
    One of the next most important steps in the history of synthesis
was shown to ‘be the conversion of carbonic disulphide into carbonic
tetrachloride or perchlorinated marsh gas. Inasmuch as carbonic
disulphide is a purely inorganic body, it is evident that any substance
which can be formed from it is a case of true synthesis.
    The following equations represent the steps by which acetic acid
may be produced from carbonic disulphide :—

     This important series of reactions, then, result in the production
of acetic acid, one of the most marked of the so-called organic acids,
from purely inorganic materials.
    The synthesis of oxalic acid by the direct union of carbonic an
hydride with sodium, as recently accomplished by Dr. Drechsel, was
next described, and it was shown that as oxalic acid, by mere distil
lation, yields formic acid, the synthesis of the <U+FB01>rst acid leads directly
to a new synthesis of the second.
    The other modes of effecting the synthesis of formic acid were
then pointed out, viz. :—Berthelot’s process, which consists in heating
potassic hydrate in an atmosphere of carbonic oxide; and Kolbe and
Schmidt’s method, by exposing potassium to a warm moist atmosphere
of carbonic anhydride.
    The speaker, in the course of his remarks on the constitution
of formic acid, showed that the quantity of oxygen in it was so large
that it only required one atom more to convert it into carbonic acid
and water. Its easy oxidation was illustrated by letting it fall on
plumbic dioxide in an apparatus which caused the evolved gas to pass
into a solution of baric hydrate, the result being a copious precipi
tation of baric carbonate.
    Having shown that acetic acid can be formed from carbonic
disulphide and the chlorides of carbon, and oxalic and formic acids
from the oxides of carbon, the speaker proceeded to indicate the modes
in which complex bodies, hitherto obtained from animal and vegetable
sources, can be.built up from elemental carbon and hydrogen.
    If carbon can only be made to combine directly with hydrogen,
no matter how simple the resulting compound may be, it becomes
possible to effect the synthesis of avast number of the most character
istic substances found in animals and vegetables.
    This brilliant result has been accomplished through the agency of
acetylene, a most remarkable hydrocarbon which was <U+FB01>rst noticed by
Edmund Davy as long ago as 1836.
    There are two methods by which acetylene can be formed from
inorganic materials-one devised by Berthelot, and the other by the
speaker. The <U+FB01>rst consists in passing a stream of hydrogen through
a globe in which the voltaic are (from 70 or 80 cells of a Grove’s
battery) is produced between carbon points. At this tremendous
temperature the carbon unites directly with the hydrogen. The
experiment was made, and the production of acetylene shown, by
the formation of a precipitate in a solution of ammoniacal cuprous
chloride.
    The speaker then showed, experimentally, that much larger quan
tities of acetylene can be formed by the decomposition by the in
duction spark of carbonic tetrachloride in presence of hydrogen, in
accordance with the equation :—
                  2(cc1,) + 5H, = 0.11, + 8(HO1).
The experiment succeeded perfectly, and a large quantity of the
cuprous acetylide was rapidly produced.

 382                      Mr. Greville Williams on the           [May 8,
     But the most simple and ready means of preparing acetylene was
 shown to be by drawing air through the flame of a common glass
 spirit-lamp, by means of an aspirator. So readily is the cuprous
 precipitate obtained by this means, that it suffices to draw a few cubic
 centimetres through the solution of ammoniacal cuprous chloride to
obtain evidence of the presence of acetylene in the flame. The ex
  eriment was then made, and in a few seconds the solution became
thick with the suspended precipitate.
     The speaker had ascertained that all the homologues of olefiant gas
give acetylene in abundance when subjected to the induction spark.
Amylene does it readily in accordance with the annexed equation:—
                         2(C.H.) = 5(C.H.) + 5H.
                           Amylene.     Acetylene.
 That the spark acted only in consequence of its high temperature, the
speaker said, is rendered probable by the fact that if hydrogen be
passed through carbonic tetrachloride, and then into a globe con
taining a platinum spiral, when the latter was heated to dull redness
by three cells of a Grove's battery, no acetylene was produced; but
when five cells were used, and the spiral became white hot, the euprous
precipitate was obtained readily. The same result was stated to occur
with amylene.
     Simple as the formula of acetylene is, almost all the animal and
vegetable substances which have been formed by pure synthesis may
be obtained from it.
     The following equations represent the steps by which alcohol may
be “synthesised.” It is proper to premise that the conversion of
acetylene into olefiant gas is accomplished by treating the cuprous
acetylide with zinc and ammonia, so as to obtain nascent hydrogen:—
                               C2H2 –– Hs      -   C.H.

     This mode of effecting the synthesis of succinic acid is due to the
 researches of Maxwell Simpson.
     The beautiful appearance of succinic acid under the influence of
polarized light was shown by the aid of the electric lamp. The
specimen used had been artificially prepared.
     The speaker then proceeded to show that the synthesis of succinic
acid was a direct step to that of tartaric acid. This latter reaction is
due to the researches of Perkin and Duppa.
    The artificial formation of succinic acid, starting with acetylene,
having been proved, it is only necessary to start with that acid to
prove the synthesis of tartaric acid from acetylene:—

    The speaker next proceeded to show how the synthesis of the
organic alkaloids could be effected from inorganic materials.
    In the first place the fact that cyanides can be produced by heating
carbon in presence of nitrogen and an alkali, is well known. The
next step is to procure prussic acid by distilling cyanides with acids.
From pure prussic acid methylamine, the simplest of the primary
monamines, can easily be obtained, either by the aid of nascent
hydrogen, or free hydrogen in the presence of spongy platinum. .

    This equation has been realized by both the methods given above,
the first by Mendius, the second by Debus.                               -
    It is also evident that as alcohol can be obtained from acetylene,
that all the ethylic, primary, secondary, and tertiary monamines of
Hofmann can now be synthetically formed. The steps being, (1)
conversion of acetylene into olefiant gas; (2) passage of olefiant gas
into alcohol; (3) alcohol into iodide of ethyl; (4) action of iodide
of ethyl on ammonia.
    Again, acetic acid, it has been shown, can be prepared from car
bonic disulphide. Now acetic acid, by the action of a red heat, can
be made to yield a number of the homologues of olefiant gas. The

latter by treatment with excessively strong hydriodic acid, become
converted into the iodides of the alcohol radicals (Berthelot). By
following up this last reaction with pentylene, heptylene, octylene,
and nonylenc, the speaker succeeded in obtaining pentylamine, hepty
lamine, octylamine, and nonylamine.
       The direct ascent from acetylene to the coal tar colours was then
shown according to the following equatiOns :——                       '

       These transformations were all described at length. In effect
acetylene passed through a red-hot tube becomes polymerized into
  benzol.
       The passage of toluol into nitro-toluol and toluidine is omitted in
the above equations, because the reactions are identical in kind with
  those of benzol into aniline.
       In describing benzol, experiments were shown illustrating the
density of its vapour as compared with air. In one of these, benzol
  was poured into a large beaker containing a hot iron; at <U+FB01>rst the
benzol assumed the spheroidal form, but, as the temperature fell, it
  became converted into vapour, which <U+FB01>lled the beaker. A glass
  syphon was then introduced into the beaker, and the vapour drawn
  oil‘ as if it had been a liquid, and in<U+FB02>amed. The vapour descending
  through the syphon was then received into a warm beaker, from which
  it was decanted into another beaker in which it was in<U+FB02>amed.
       The speaker then proceeded to show the way in which the syn
  thesis of zinc ethyl could be effected; it is, however, unnecessary to
  follow the equations in detail, because, having already explained the
 manner in which alcohol can be synthesized from acetylene, it is ob
  vious that zinc ethyl can be directly derived from that <U+FB02>uid.
_      Wanklyn’s interesting synthesis of acetic acid from sodium methyl
  was then shown to take place in accordance with the expression :

     The method appears to be general, inasmuch as the same chemist
 has effected the synthesis of propionic acid :

     The speaker stated that one of the most interesting of the cases of  -
synthesis recently accomplished was that in which Mr. W. H. Perkin
had succeeded in producing arti<U+FB01>cially the odoriferous principle _of
new hay and the tonquin bean.
     The delicious fragrance of new hay is entirely due to the presence
of the sweet-scented vernal grass, anthowanthum odoratum. It is the
same substance which is the cause of the sweet smell ‘of the woodru<U+FB02>',
asperula odorata; and the melilot, melilotos o<U+FB01>icinalis. It is also the
<U+FB01>avouring ingredient in the mat wein of the Germans, which is per
fumed with woodru<U+FB01>'.
   - Until lately, nothing was known about coumarin, except that it was
a colourless crystalline body, having the formula
                                    ' (391160,.
     The crystals of coumarin appear very beautiful under the in<U+FB02>uence
of polarized light. The image of some arti<U+FB01>cial coumarin, which had
been fused and allowed to crystallize in a plate of glass, was then
thrown upon the screen, and the light being polarized by the aid of
Nicol’s prisms, the crystals assumed the most gorgeous and varying
colours as the prisms were rotated.
     The clue to its constitution was shown to be the circumstance that
when heated with potassic hydrate it yields salicylic and acetic acids.
The production of salicylic acid from coumarin was then shown, experi
mentally, the presence of the acid being proved by its yielding a deep
purple coloration with ferric chloride.
     Arti<U+FB01>cial coumarin was obtained from the hydride of salicyl. By
treatment With sodium it yielded hydride of sodium salicyl; this sub
stance, heated with acetic anhydride, gave hydride of aceto-salicyl.
This last substance was then distilled with acetic anhydride and sodie
acetate, and when the temperature reached 290°, the distillate solidi
<U+FB01>ed to a mass of crystals of pure coumarin, having all the fragrance
and beauty of that obtained from the tonquin bean.
     The speaker then submitted that the assertion he had made at an
early period of his discourse that there was no natural barrier between
organic and inorganic chemistry, had been amply proved by the in
stances he had brought forward. He said that they had studied
together that evening several cases where, starting from inorganic

matter, they had ascended step by step until they had reached some,
of the most complicated bodies secreted by animals and vegetables.
What, he said, could be more distinctly inorganic than nitrogen,
carbon, and oxygen? What more distinctly an animal secretion than
urea ? What more completely inorganic than acetylene? What more
distinctly vegetable in origin than coumarin ?
     Chemists have then, so far, done what a very few years would have
been regarded as possible only by aid of the vital force. A true
organized substance, he said, is so de<U+FB01>nite that we can almost invariably
determine its molecular Weight, and it is generally crystalline. But
when we come to the tissues we are dealing no longer with organic
substances, but with organized beings, and we feel that we are ap
proaching the barriers which separate the study of life from the study
 of matter. The bonds which unite them are so close that we cannot
imagine life without matter, and it is equally di<U+FB01>‘icult to conceive the
assumption of vitality by matter; but we must never cease to look
anxiously for the solution of the problem. The impossible is B, horizon
which recedes as we advance, and the term incognita of to-day will to
morrow be boldly mapped upon every schoolboy’s chart!

                             On the Talmud.
THE speaker introduced his subject by alluding to the different and
generally unfavourable judgments formed about the Talmud. Tal
mudical investigators, he said, were like those explorers sent by Moses
into the Holy Land, the majority of whom returned with tales of iron
walls and monstrous giants, while the few came back carrying a huge
bunch of grapes. Many were the poetical similes suggested by that
strange work; but, treated strictly as a book, the nearest approach to it
was Hansard.     Like Hansard, it is a law-book: a collection of Parlia
mentary debates, of bills, motions, and resolutions. Only that while
the former shows how the proposition gradually grows into an Act,
in the Talmud the Act is the starting-point. The discussions in the
Talmud merely seek to evolve the reasons for it out of Scripture, of
which itself is a development and an outgrowth, while at the same time

 1868.]    '                    on the Talmud.     '                   '387
‘supplementary paragraphs are constantly evolved out of its own legal
 text. These bills or acts are called Mishnah-both collectively and
 individually; the discussions, Gemam; both together, Talmud.
     But if Hansard contains the Debates of the Lords and Commons,
 the Talmud contains much more. All those manifold Assemblies
 wherein a people’s mental, social, and religious life are considered and
 developed, are here represented. Parliament, Convocation, Law-courts,
 Academies, Colleges, the Temple, and the Synagogue—nay, even the
 Lobby and the Common Room have left their realistic trace upon it.
 The authors of this book, who number by hundreds upon hundreds,
 were always the most prominent men of the people in their genera
 tion, and thus designedly and undesignedly show the fullness of this
 people’s life and progress at every turn. The Talmud, in this wise,
 contains—apart from the social, moral, criminal, international, human
and divine Law-an account also of the education, the arts, the
 sciences, the history, and religion for about a thousand years :—most
 fully perhaps of the time immediately preceding and following the
 birth of Christianity. It shows us the teeming streets of Jerusalem,
 the tradesman at his work, the women in their domestic circle, the
 children at play in the market—place. The priest and the Levite minis
 tering in their holy rites, the preacher on the hillside surrounded by
 the multitudes, nay, even the story-teller in the bazaar: they all live
 and move and have their being in these pages. Nor is it Jerusalem
 or even the hallowed soil of Judea alone, but the whole antique world
 that seems to lie embalmed in it. Athens and Alexandria, Rome and
 Persia, their civilizations and their religions, old and new, appear at
 every turn. That cosmopolitanism which for good or evil has ever been
 the characteristic trait of the Jewish people, is most vividly re<U+FB02>ected in
 this book. One of the most striking historical points is their always
coming in contact-mostly against their will-—with the most promi
nent nations, exactly at the moment when the latter seem to have
reached the highest point in their own development. Passing the
three di<U+FB01>'erent stages of the people as Hebrews, Israelites, and Jews,
we <U+FB01>nd them connected with Chaldea, Egypt, Phoenicia, Assyria,
Babylonia, Persia, Greece, Rome, Arabia. Yet that cosmopolitanism
never for one moment interfered with the most marked mental indi
viduality. There always remained that one central sun, the Bible.
Around this ever revolves that. great cosmos, the Talmud, and from it,
as shown in the Gemara, the M'ishnah is begotten.              ‘
     After brie<U+FB02>y alluding to the “ Sinaitic” injunctions, which had led
some to invent the tale of the Talmud, as such, claiming to be “ in
spired ”—a notion from which its own authors would have shrunk with
horror—the speaker proceeded to dwell more fully on the “dates”
[of the individual dicta in the book: a subject which seems to have
puzzled many not fully acquainted with the nature of eastern tradition.

startling instances are offered by the Brahmins and the Parsee priests

 recite parrot-like entire chapters of their sacred books correct even as
.to accent. But in the Talmud we have, apart from the clearest and
 most irrefutable evidences of witnesses, all the ordinary internal
 evidences of history. We have an array of carefully preserved his
 torical names and dates from beginning to end; names and dates the
 general faithfulness and truth of which have never yet been called into
 question. From the Great Synagogue down to the <U+FB01>nal completion of
 the Babylonian Gemara, we have the legal and philosophical develop
 ment of the nation always embodied as it were in the successive prin
 cipal schools and men of their times.—-After entering into some his
 torical and chronological details, the speaker alluded to those ethical
 sayings, parables, gnomes, &c., which were the principal vehicle of the
 common Jewish teaching from an almost prehistoric period. However
 sublime and tender and poetical their expression often be in the
 Talmud, he failed to see anything surprisingly new in them: any
 thing, in fact, that was not substantially contained in the canonical
 and uncanonical writings of the Old Testament.
      Turning to its authors, the speaker touched upon the “ Priests and
  Pharisees,” and hinted that the cry of separation of Church and State
  might perhaps be <U+FB01>rst heard in the Talmud, though but faintly.
  The fact being that the priests had sadly deteriorated, as a body,
  bright exceptions apart, since the days of the Maccabees, when they
  by an accident suddenly found themselves in political power. From
  being, as Moses had intended them to be, the receivers of the people’s
  free gifts, their messengers-not mediators-—and their teachers, they
  had become, chie<U+FB02>y in their upper strata, an encroaching, and at the
  same time ignorant faction. The ordinary priests had mostly sunk
  into more local functionaries of the Temple, while many of the High
  Priests, who in those latter days bought their sacred o<U+FB01>ce from the
  ruling foreign power, had forgotten the very elements of that Bible
  which they had been especially appointed to teach. The Pharisees,
  on the other hand, in view of the clouds that they saw gathering round
   the Commonwealth, had but one cry-Education: Education catholic,
  gratuitous, and compulsory. From one end of the Talmud to the
   other there resounds but one echo: learn-teach; teach—learn. The
   Priesthood, the Sacri<U+FB01>ces, the Temple, as they all went down at one
   sudden blow, seemed scarcely to leave a gap in the religious life of
   the nation. The Pharisees had long before undermined these things,
   or rather transplanted them, into the people’s houses and hearts.
   Every man in Israel, they said, is a priest, every man’s house a
   temple, every man’s table an altar, every man’s prayer his sacri<U+FB01>ce.
   Long before the Temple fell, it had been virtually superseded by
   hundreds of synagogues, schools, and colleges, where laymen read and
   expounded the Law and the Prophets. The priest as such, or the
   Levite, played but a very insigni<U+FB01>cant part in the synagogue or
 school. The function of pronouncing the “ Benediction ” on certain
  occasions and a kind of vague “ Precedence ”' was all that the syna
  gogue had preserved of the whilom high estate of these Aaronides.

1868.]                       on the Talmud.                          389
Yet, on the other hand, instances are not wanting of these men, having
lost their former privileges, applying themselves all the more vigor
ously to study and the great national work of Education. Nor was
there any real personal antagonism between the “pharisaical” or
“popular” party, and the descendants of the “sacred” tribe and
family. On the contrary, one of the most cherished legends—and
here as usual the legend faithfully interprets the people’s real feeling
-—tells us how, when the enemy entered the Holy- of Holies, the
Priests and Levites, led by the High Priest himself, bearing aloft
the golden key of the sanctuary, were seen precipitating themselves,
with all the tokens and emblems of their sacred trust, into the blazing
ruins of the Temple—rather than deliver them up to the conquerors.
    Regarding that education which the Pharisees advocated so
strenuously and indefatigably, the speaker related how they had suc
ceeded, after many unsuccessful attempts, to make it compulsory all
over the land, save Galilee. Peculiar geographical circumstances
(Samaria, Phoenicia, &c.) had reduced that beautiful country to the
Bceotia of Palestine. The faulty pronunciation of its inhabitants was
the standing joke of the witty denizens of the metropolis. This state
of things, however, was altered after the fall of Jerusalem, when
Galilee in her turn became the seat of some of the most exalted
Academies.
    The regulations and provisions for public instruction were ex
tremely strict and minute. The number of children allotted to one
teacher, the school buildings and their sites, the road even that led to
them, everything was considered; no less the age of the pupils and
the duties of the parents with regard to preliminary preparation and
continuous domestic supervision of their tasks. The subjects, the
method, the gradual weaning even of the pupil into a teacher or help
mate of his fellow-pupils-all these things are carefully exposed in
the Talmud. Above all is the great principle Non multa sed multum,
the motto of all schooling in the Talmud. Good fundamental
grounding, elementary maternal teaching, and constant repetition are
some of the chief principles laid down.     The teachers, in most‘cases,
taught gratuitously: considering theirs a holy and godly o<U+FB02>ice, for
which the reward would surely not fail them. The relation between
master and disciple was generally that of father and child, or friend
and friend.   Next to Law, Ethics, History, and Grammar—Languages
were one of the principal subjects of study. We hear of Coptic,
Aramaic, Persian, Median, Latin, but above all Greek. The terms
in which this last language is spoken of verges indeed on the
transcendental. This also is the only language which it seems to
have been incumbent to teach even to girls. Medicine was another
necessary subject of instruction : the hygienic laws and the anatomical
knowledge (bound up with religion) transmitted to us in the book
show indeed no small pro<U+FB01>ciency for its time. Mathematics and
astronomy formed another part of instruction, and were indeed con
sidered indispensable. We hear of men to whom the ways of the

390              Mr. Emanuel Deutsch on the Talmud.           [May 15,
stars in the skies were as familiar as the streets of their native city,
and others who could compute the number of drops in the ocean, who
foretold the appearance of comets, &c. Next came Natural History,
chie<U+FB02>y Botany and Zoology. The highest point, however, was reached
in Jurisprudence, which formed the most extensive and thoroughly
national study.
     The chief aim and end of all learning-the Talmud is never tired
of repeating-is doing. All knowledge is but a step to “modesty and
the fear of heaven;" and innumerable are the parables whereby this
lesson is inculcated. After brie<U+FB02>y adverting to Prayers and Sermons
and the whole worship of Temple and Synagogue at the time of
Christ, the speaker turned to the “ political” portions of the “ Law ”
under consideration, and pointed out how almost the modern theory
of constitutionalism was contained in it. He brie<U+FB02>y touched upon
the relationship between Royalty, State, and subjects, and the pro
visions for taxes, for war, the legislative and judicial powers, 810.
Both this, the legal, and the other, the ethical part of the book-so
closely intertwined that they can hardly be separated-may be said to
grow out chie<U+FB02>y of one fundamental axiom of the Talmud, viz. the
utter and absolute equality of all men and the obligation to “follow
 God,” by imitating the mercy. attributed to Him by Scripture.
     Next the speaker alluded to the holy in<U+FB02>uence exercised by the
women, of whom the Talmud not only records the noblest deeds, but
whom, even as the Angels themselves, it makes at times the bearers of
 most sublime thoughts. Regarding the latter, it was shown at some
 length how both they and their counterparts the ‘demons’ were—
 though partly adopted from Persian or rather Zoroastrian metaphysics
-—-made the vehicles of national Jewish doctrines. Indeed, all those
 pantheistic and dualistic principles which the people had gathered
 from the creed of other nations, were transformed under the skilful
 hand of the Talmudical masters into strictly monotheistic elements,
 by being either idealized into abstract notions of right and wrong,
 or surrounded by a poetical halo which deprived them of any real
 existence. Thus Satan (Sammael, the “Primeval Serpent”), though
 mythologically his functions are precisely similar to those of the
 Persian “ Evil Spirit,” 1'. e. those of Seducer, Aceuser, and Angel of
 Death, is yet explained away philosophically as meaning merely
 “ Passion,” which seduces, produces remorse, and kills. The speaker
 adduced among other instances the legend of Isaac, in which “ Satan,”
 as the Angel of Death, appears <U+FB01>rst as an accuser of Abraham (as of
 Job) beforei God, next as a seducer to Abraham in the garb of an
 old man, to Isaac in that of a youth, <U+FB01>nally to Sarah, informing
 her of the danger in which her son had been placed. The speaker
 further alluded to the legend of the death of Moses, in which Satan,
  eager to vanquish the “divine man,” is thwarted by God’s Name
 even to the end.
      In the same manner Asmodeus (the Persian Aéshma), “Lilith,”
 and the rest of the demoniacal powers, as well as those allegorical

_ monsters the “Leviathans,” the “ Cocks," the “Bulls,” and the rest
  of the ever-repeated reproaches to the Talmud (all of which are taken.
  almost bodily from the Zendavesta), have to play their instructive
  part. They are either reduced into their original meanings in the
  Talmud, or they are ridiculed and made to inculcate some moral
  lesson. On the other hand the famous “Sea Fairy Tales,” taken
  from Indian sources, are made into guises of political, if not religious
  satires.
      After dwelling on the causes of the obscurity of some of the
  matters found in the Talmud and their apparent want of dignity—
  occasioned partly by the circumstances and the manners of the period,
  and partly by the neglect of copyists, and the undying fanaticism
  which ever tried to “ improve ” this important record of humanity-—the
  speaker instanced the various modes in which the Talmudical authors.
  <U+FB01>gured to themselves the Messianic times, and the utter and absolute

   CHEMICAL changes, whether of combination or decomposition, result in
   the production of new bodies which, under the conditions of the change,
   have for the most part a greater stability than the original bodies.
       One evidence of this greater stability is a<U+FB01>'orded by the develop

392               Dr. W. Odling on some E<U+FB01>'ecte 0f the          [May 22,
ment of a quantity of heat—the heat of chemical action-from the pro- .
duced bodies having a smaller potential heat than the original ones.
    It results, both from reason and experiment, that in order to undo
or reverse any de<U+FB01>nite chemical action, just so much heat must be
directly or indirectly expended as was evolved by the original action.
    For the same quantity of heat evolved, the resulting temperature
varies with the mass and kind of matter heated, and with the rapid or
gradual evolution of the heat.
    When the evolution of heat is instantaneous, the resulting tempe
rature may be calculated from the quantity of heat evolved, and the
mass and speci<U+FB01>c heat, &o., of the matter heated.
    By a unit of heat is meant the quantity of heat necessary to raise
the temperature of one kilogramme of water one degree centigrade, or
more accurately £rom 0° to 1".
                                    II.
    Every 18 grammes of water is a combination of two l-gramme
proportions of hydrogen H, with one IG-gramme proportion of oxygen
0; and, by the combination of two grammes of hydrogen with sixteen
grammes of oxygen, there are developed 68 units of heat.
    Of these 68 units of heat, however, little more than 57 units are
really due to the chemical aetion,—ncarly 11 units of heat being
evolved by the contraction of the original mixed gas into two—thirds
its volume of steam, and by the further condensation of the resulting
steam into 18 cubic centimetres of water.
    While the quantity of heat evolved by the combination of a given
quantity of oxygen and hydrogen is invariable, ‘the intensity of the
heat may vary from a scarcely recognisable rise of temperature up to
the highest temperature of the oxy-hydrogen blowpipe <U+FB02>ame, capable
of fusing platinum and silica.
    A most remarkable e<U+FB02>'ect of the intense temperature resulting from
the combination of oxygen and hydrogen into water, is the partial
decomposition of water into oxygen and hydrogen, discovered by Mr.
Grove in 1846.
    At this high temperature, hydrochloric acid and carbonic anhy
dride gases also undergo partial decomposition, into hydrogen and
chlorine, and into carbonous oxide and oxygen respectively.
    Upon what do these singular decompositions by heat, of bodies
formed with great evolution of heat, depend; or with what class of
chemical phenomena may they be associated ‘E
                                   III.
    Under certain familiar conditions, chemical action seemingly takes
place to its utmost possible extent in a single direction only, with
production of a maximum amount of the substance that is formed with
maximum evolution of heat.
    For example, taking atomic proportions in grammes, the heat of
formation of chloride of zinc, ZnOl2, is 101 units, and the heat of form_

 1868.]             Heat of the Gary-hydrogen Flame.                  393
ation of chloride of copper, CuOl,, is 605 units. Hence, with chlorine
in solution and excess of both copper and zinc, there is <U+FB01>nally pro
duced the maximum possible amount of chloride of zinc and no chloride
of copper.
    Again, an addition of su<U+FB02>icient zine to solution of chloride of
copper, there is complete combination of chlorine with zinc and com
plete separation of chlorine from copper, i. e. complete burning of the
one metal and complete unburning of the other.
                                    IV.
    But under simpler though less familiar conditions, chemical action
habitually takes place in more than one direction simultaneously, with
production of correlative products in varying proportions.
    Thus, with hydrogen and excess of both chlorine and oxygen,
although the heat of formation of oxide of hydrogen H2O is 57 units,
and the heat of formation of chloride of hydrogen 2HO1 is only 4.7- 5
units, yet, in this case, the hydrogen does not combine with the
oxygen to the exclusion of the chlorine, but divides itself between
the oxygen and the chlorine in proportions which vary with the
conditions of the experiment.
    In accordance with this result it is found that, at the same red
heat, excess of chlorine will effect the partial decomposition of water
with extrusion of oxygen; and, conversely, that excess of oxygen will
effect the partial decomposition of hydrochloric acid with extrusion
of chlorine.
     So that, beginning with the two chemical substances, water and
chlorine, or beginning with the two chemical substances, hydrochloric
and oxygen, or beginning with the three chemical substances, hydrogen,
chlorine, and oxygen, there exist, at a full red heat, the four chemical
substances, water, hydrochloric acid, chlorine, and oxygen; the proper
tions of the four substances depending certainly upon the relative
quantities present of the elements concerned, and most probably also
upon the temperature of the experiment.
     Similarly, beginning with the one chemical substance, water (Grove),
or beginning with the two chemical substances, oxygen and hydrogen
(Bunsen), there always exist, at a su<U+FB01>iciently high temperature, the
three chemical substances, water, oxygen, and hydrogen.
     Although, by exposure to a red heat, the electrolytic mixture of
oxygen and hydrogen gases becomes completely combined, or trans
formed into water, yet, as recently shown by Bunsen, at the high
temperature of 2024 degrees, only one-half, and at the still higher
temperature of 2844 degrees, only one-third of the mixture undergoes
combination, the other one-half or two-thirds remaining in the state of
mixed gas.
                                    V.
    Chemists are acquainted with many reciprocal actions comparable
with those of chlorine upon water, and of oxygen upon hydrochloric
acid, the most familiar instance being probably the decomposition

394                        Mr. W. E. H. Lecky                  [May 29,
of ignited oxide of iron by hydrogen with extrusion of iron, and the
converse decomposition of oxide of hydrogen by ignited iron with
extrusion of hydrogen.
    Similarly, sodium will decompose the oxides of carbon, while carbon
will decompose oxide of sodium; and just as a sufficient excess of
chlorine may be made to effect the almost complete decomposition
of a given quantity of water, so may a sufficient excess of carbon
(or carbonous oxide) be made to effect the almost complete decom
position of a given quantity of sodium-oxide or zinc-oxide, as in the
ordinary processes for obtaining the two metals; notwithstanding that,
for an equal consumption of oxygen, the respective combination heats
of sodium and zinc exceed by far the combination heat of carbon or
carbonous oxide.
     Again, although the combination heat of oxygen and carbonous
oxide is 68 units, while that of oxygen and hydrogen is only 57
units, yet, as was shown by Bunsen many years ago, upon exploding
a mixture of oxygen with a joint excess of carbonous oxide and
hydrogen, the oxygen does not attach itself exclusively to the car
bonous oxide, but divides itself between the carbonous oxide and
hydrogen in a ratio determined by their relative proportions.

       SIR HENRY Hol.I.AND, Bart. M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. President,
                               in the Chair.
                         W. E. H. LECKY, Esq.
             On the Influence of the Imagination on History.
 THE imagination may be regarded in two ways, as a realizing faculty
or as a creative faculty. Considered in the former light, it is the
power by which men realize the unseen; considered in the latter, it
is the power by which they create fictions or idealize and embellish
facts. If we regard it in the first aspect, it is manifest that all histo
 rical writing as well as all historical reading is a continuous effort of
 the imagination. It is the business of the historian to resuscitate a
 society that has passed away, to cause men and manners, habits of
thought and habits of feeling that no longer exist to pass once more
before his reader, and the charm of his history will depend chiefly
 on the vividness, while its philosophic value will depend chiefly upon
the fidelity, of the picture. If we regard the imagination in the second
 aspect, the part which it plays in history is also very great. In all

1868.]        on the In<U+FB02>uence of the Imagination on History.          395
histories we may discover a large mythological element produced by
the undisciplined imagination of an early society, re<U+FB02>ecting and also
in a great degree determining the character of the people and com
prising its <U+FB01>rst literature, its <U+FB01>rst philosophy, and its <U+FB01>rst religion.
We also <U+FB01>nd many historical facts and characters that have been
trans<U+FB01>gured by the imagination. Men have so fascinated the imagin
ations of their fellows, that they have become the ideals of many
generations, and when thus idealized, have exercised a vast and en
during in<U+FB02>uence upon the world. The same facts have often pro
duced a history and a romance, and the romance has sometimes proved
more important than the history.
    After a few preliminary remarks on the effects of the imagination
in magnifying men, qualities, and incidents in proportion to their
dramatic interest rather than to their importance, and also upon the
nature of myths, the speaker proceeded to discuss his main subject,
the part played by ideals in history. He observed, that in order that a
character or incident should be idealized, two things are necessary.
There must be something in the object itself striking and conspicuous
enough to fascinate the imagination. There must also be a pro-exist
ing tendency which the ideal represents. Thus, when the course of
events has been long tending towards military enterprise, then, and
then only, a great warrior is likely to be idealized; when an ascetic
tendency has been long in existence, then only an ascetic is likely to
be idealized; when the direction of affairs has been to exalt monarchical
institutions, then only a king becomes the ideal. But this ideal,
which is thus the result of the pro-existent tendency, becomes in turn
an efficient cause. For men are governed much more by their imagin
ations than by their reason. In order to affect them, it is necessary
not only to teach them what is right, but also to show them what
is right, and precepts are impotent till they are connected with
examples.
    Thus the early Greek philosophy and the early Greek types were
essentially local and municipal. The sympathies of the people were
restricted to the interests of their own petty states. The national
heroes, who represented the supreme ideal of greatness, were all
local heroes, and the notion of a cosmopolitan sympathy was un
known. It arose in the philosophy of Socrates and his followers;
but it only became general when the career of Alexander fascinated
the minds of the people, eclipsed by its splendour the glories of Peri
cles, Leonidas, and Miltiades, and familiarized the minds of men with
the conception of a universal empire. And this was probably the most
important result of the career of Alexander, for the cosmopolitanism of
the Greek mind, blending with the cosmopolitanism effected in the
Roman mind by the conditions of universal empire, alone rendered
possible the conversion of Europe to Christianity.                        .
    We may take an illustration of the force of ideals from the history
of Roman suicides. In the early days of Rome, suicide (except in the
form of self-immolation as a religious rite, as in the cases of Decius

396                         Mr. W. E. H. Lecky                  [May 29,
and Curtius) was unknown. In the later days it was regarded as
almost the normal close of a great career. Many circumstances con
spired to this change, but one of the most important was the displace
ment of Regulus by Cato as the ideal type. Regulus is believed to
be an unhistorical figure. His courage, his high honour, his patient
endurance of suffering, represented the ideal of the simple and virtuous
republicans. He was proposed to the young as the type or model of
what a good man should be, and he exercised this fascination until the
age of Cato, who reflected most perfectly the ideal of the Stoical phi
losophy which had just arisen, and whose tragic death, synchronizing
 as it did with the defeat of a glorious cause and the destruction of a
 great republic, exercised an extreme but very natural fascination over
 the Roman mind. The life and death of Cato formed the supreme
 model of the Stoical period of Roman history. He was deemed (as
 Welleius Paterculus said) of all men the one “most like to virtue;”
 and the ideal retained its power till the softening influences of the
 Greek spirit permeating Roman life rendered the Stoical type too hard
and unsympathising for the spiritual wants of men when new beliefs
were formed and new ideals arose to command the world.
     It would be impossible within the limits of a lecture to give any
thing like a complete review of the successive ideals that have governed
mankind.      A few examples must suffice.
     Thus, in the fifth century, we find Christendom completely under
the fascination of the hermit life.    Several causes, some of them reli
gious and some of them arising from the social and political condition
of the empire, had driven multitudes to this life, and the imaginations
of men seizing on the many poetical aspects it presented, constructed
an early legendary literature of which the hermit was the central
figure, and which was very widely diffused throughout Europe. The
ascetic ideal was, in the first place, the extreme antithesis to the old
Greek exaltation of the civic virtues. Among the Greeks the first
idea of a good man had been a man who devoted himself unremittingly
to the service of his country. In the fifth century, the first condition
of supreme virtue had become the complete abandonment of secular
duties and cares.    That such a character as the hermit should have
been idealized in the days of Greek or Roman republicanism was im
possible; but the long-continued imperial despotism and the extreme
corruption of all parts of Roman administration had gradually with
drawn all the best minds from political life, had attached a certain
taint or stigma to public employment, and had therefore predisposed
men to accept, as their supreme type of virtue, a life entirely uncon
nected with the duties of a citizen. The ascetic ideal also represented
the complete subjugation of the body to the mind. The virtue of
Paganism had for a long period consisted solely in action. A move
ment, however, had long been in progress raising the contemplative
virtues to the supreme place; and this movement had already in the
neoplatonic period reached the point of asceticism. In the hermit
life, it attained its extreme limits. Greek art had been the glorifica

 tion of the body. The medimval Mosaics represented its extreme ma
 ceration. Dio Chrysostom, in a very whimsical passage of one of his
 orations, had observed that a great moral lesson was to be derived
 from the fact that Homer, though he places his heroes by the banks of
 what he always expressly calls the “<U+FB01>shy Hellespont," never makes
 them eat <U+FB01>sh, but only roast ox; for this food being “ strength su<U+FB02>i- .
 cing,” <U+FB01>tted to make men strong, and manly, and courageous, was best
 suited for virtuous men. If we contrast this judgment with the pro
 tracted and, indeed, incredible fasts that were attributed to the saints
 of the desert, we shall have a vivid picture of the change that had
 come over the ideal.                                        '
     The ascetic ideal, represented in innumerable legends, painted in
every church, extolled from every pulpit, exercised for many centuries
an absolute rule over Europe. When men thought of virtue or of
greatness, the supreme type that naturally rose before their imagin
ation was the hermit. This idea] was at last replaced by that of
chivalry, which represented chie<U+FB02>y three innovations, the growth of the
 spirit of gallantry, the increased reverence for secular rank, and the
 military tendencies of the times.
     1. The amatory character of chivalry, which was especially re<U+FB02>ected
in the romances and poems of the troubadours, was a natural rebound
against the extreme misogynism of the ascetic period. The <U+FB01>rst duty
of the saint was to <U+FB02>y from all contact with women; and a principal
measure of his excellence was the number of years he had avoided
seeing them. As the Puritanism of the English Commonwealth
produced the licentiousness of the Restoration, so the ascetic austerities
produced at length that passionate glori<U+FB01>cation of the fair sex, of which
the romance of Le Petit Jehan de Saintré is perhaps the most curious
example. The tide <U+FB02>owed in this direction with especial vehemence
after the cessation of the panic which had arisen at the close of the
tenth century about the approaching end of the world. The Council
of Clermont, which originated the Crusades, in some degree recognized
the new tendency, by imposing on the knight the religious obligation
of defending all widows and virgins.
     2. The growing sentiment of admiration for secular rank was a
product of the feudal system. The few peasantry had almost all
disappeared in Europe, most of them voluntarily enrolling themselves
as serfs under some powerful lord, for the sake of the protection he
could afford. The chiefs gave to their leading warriors portions of
conquered land. Gradually the obligation of military service was
attached to these donations, and still later they became hereditary.
In this manner an hereditary aristocracy was constituted. A great
hierarchy of rank arose, of which the serf was the basis and the
emperor the apex. All except the highest personage were in a con
dition of continual subordination, and a feeling of reverence for rank
was universally diffused. Men came to associate their ideal of supreme
greatness with regal or noble authority, and their minds were there
fore prepared to, idealize any great sovereign who might arise. This

398          -             Mr. W. E. H. Lecky            -   [May 29,
sovereign appeared in Charlemagne, whose genius exercised upon
Europe a fascination not less powerful than that which Alexander had
once exercised upon Greece; and Charlemagne became accordingly the
centre of a whole literature of romance.
    3. The growth of the military spirit had at the same time been
rapidly advancing. The strong hostility the Church had at first mani
fested towards it, had been qualified when many tribes of warlike
barbarians embraced the faith; and the military obligation, which was
an essential element of feudalism, acted in the same direction.   But,
above all, the invasions and conquests of Mahommedanism awoke the
military energies of Christendom, and at the same time determined
the direction it should take.        -
    If we now proceed to examine the Karlovingian romances, which
arose under the influences that have been described, we shall find in
them some significant and important characteristics.
    In the first place, the ideal was changed. For many centuries the
imagination of Europe had represented as its supreme and most perfect
type the hermit in the desert. The central figure was now a king,
a knight, a warrior. The romances of Charlemagne and the romances
of Arthur form one of the most important epochs in the history of the
human mind, for they mark the period when the ideal of Christendom
was changed.
    In the next place, we may observe how curiously the moral atmo
sphere reigning in Europe when the romances were composed coloured
the portrait of Charlemagne. That sovereign, who, if not the greatest,
was probably the most many-sided, man who ever sat upon a throne,
whose vast and capacious genius radiated through almost all the
forms of thought and action existing in his time, pervading all and
renovating all, did no doubt combine the talents of a great conqueror
with those of a great legislator and administrator; but his military
expeditions were directed almost exclusively against the Germans. He
made thirty-one or thirty-two expeditions against them. He conquered,
he converted, he partly civilized them; and his victories had a lasting
influence upon Europe. With the Spanish Mahommedans he came
but very slightly in contact. He made in person only a single expe
dition against them; and that expedition, which was of no great
magnitude and importance, and which forms altogether an insignificant
episode in his reign, was unsuccessful in its issue. Such was the
career of the historic Charlemagne; but the writers of the romances
being imbued with the Crusading spirit which was universal at their
time, totally misrepresented it. The German wars are scarcely noticed.
Charlemagne is represented as having passed his entire life in a con
tinual, heroic, and triumphant struggle with the Mahommedans of
Europe, and is even gravely credited with a triumphant expedition to
Jerusalem itself. The first three of the romances of the Crusades,
which were all written by monks, make Charlemagne their hero.
    We might have supposed, however, that the spirit of romance
would have attached itself in a Crusading age rather to the grand

1868.]         on the Influence of the Imagination on History.       399
father of Charlemagne, than to that emperor himself. Charles Martel,
by his victory near Poitiers, by freeing Provence from Mohammedanism,
had in a great measure been the saviour of Europe. Yet he never
was made an ideal, and he occupies only the most subordinate positions
in romantic literature. For this fact three reasons may, I think, be
assigned. He appeared somewhat too early, before the moral ten
dencies that have been indicated had acquired a sufficient force to
break the spell of the ascetic ideal which governed the world. He did
not possess the same dazzling genius as his grandson, and was there
fore not able to fill and entrance the popular imagination. He was
also regarded with much animosity by the clergy, whose property he
had severely taxed; while Charlemagne was the first sovereign who
rendered compulsory the payment of tithes. The figure of Charles
Martel has therefore scarcely any place in the romances of chivalry,
and nearly the only legend of any importance concerning him is that
after his death a hermit saw him carried by demons down the crater of
a volcano, on account of his sin in secularizing church property. The
war of Charles Martel, however, against the Mahommedans was not
forgotten, but the glory of it was transferred to the popular hero, and
one of the great triumphs of the Charlemagne of romance was an expe
dition to rescue Nimes and Carcassone from the Mahommedans.
    But it was only in the Crusades that these new tendencies acquired
a decisive ascendency. In few other periods of history has there been
so great a difference between the ideals created by the imagination and
the realities that are recognized by history. Of all recorded wars, the
Crusades are probably those which were at once most disinterested in
their origin, most immoral in their execution, and most disastrous
in their immediate effects.      Before the Crusaders started on their
expeditions they signalized their zeal by atrocious massacres of the
Jews in France and Germany. At Constantinople, on their passage to
the Holy Land, they perpetrated every kind of outrage; and many of
the works of ancient art, and perhaps some of the works of ancient
literature, perished in the conflagrations they caused. In Palestine
they were guilty of atrocities which no tongue can adequately de
scribe, no imagination conceive. All the ghastly cruelty which the
fiercest intolerance could engender blended in a strange and hideous
amalgam with all the licentiousness of the most unbridled lust.
After the capture of Jerusalem, besides the multitudes who were slain
during the siege, they deliberately massacred in cold blood the old,
the women, and the children. At Ptolemais they murdered on a
single occasion 2700 defenceless prisoners. The Archbishop of Tyre
emphatically declared that wherever the Crusading armies had passed
there was “not a chaste woman to be found.”         And with all this we
find every description of fraud and treachery and falsehood and in
trigue, the dissensions of kings, of generals, of religious orders,
disintegrating the invading hosts; so that when at last, after the
endurance and the infliction of countless sufferings, after two cen
turies of nearly unremitting war, and the destruction, it is said, of

400          .            Mr. W. E. H. Leaky        ‘            [May 29;
not less than two millions of lives, the armies of the Cross were
<U+FB01>nally rolled back upon Europe,—it may be truly said that they were
not so much ba<U+FB01>ied by the arms of the Saracen as blasted by their
own multiform, degrading, and appalling vice.
    Such was the historical aspect of the Crusades, but far otherwise
were they conceived by the imagination. There had been, as we have
seen, a strong religious feeling and also a strong military spirit pre
veiling in Europe, and these two streams met at the Crusades, and
the popular imagination, under their in<U+FB02>uence, conceived an ideal '
which is assuredly one of the most beautiful that has ever been en
shrined in the poetry or in the hearts of mankind. The red cross
knight of Tasso and of Spenser, combining all the courage and <U+FB01>re
of the ancient hero with all the gentleness of the Christian saint
-—-the virtue of humility refracted and diluted into the graces of
courtesy and of modesty-the brave soldier, animated by no feeling
of personal ambition, but drawing his sword only in the cause of the
feeble and the oppressed, to defend his persecuted faith and raise once
more the prostrate altars of his God——this was the ideal of chivalry
which acquired during the Crusades its supreme authority, and its
in<U+FB02>uence is felt to the present day. When we apply the epithet
ehivalrous to a modern gentleman, this is no unmeaning term. There
is a certain aroma of re<U+FB01>nement in the character of a modern gentle
man, there is something in .that <U+FB01>ne combination of the self-assertion
of honour with the self-abnegation of courtesy which was not known
in the ancient world, and which may be distinctly traced to that ideal
of chivalry which the Crusades made dominant in Europe.
    The romances of the Crusades arose at the very beginning of the
movement, and we <U+FB01>nd the popular imagination not only inventing
innumerable prodigies, but also, after its usual fashion, trans<U+FB01>guring the
simplest facts. Thus the Council of Clermont, which was in reality
held in the dark days of November, was arbitrarily transferred by the
romance writers to the month of May, the cheerful opening of summer
appearing more suitable for an event which introduced so bright a
period in the history of the world. Geography itself was sometimes
recast by the imagination, and maps are in existence in which
Jerusalem is represented as the centre of the earth,—doubtless because
the geographer believed that its local position must correspond to its
moral position.
    The last example I shall give of the manner in which ideals
detach themselves from realities and of the enduring in<U+FB02>uence they
exercise is taken from the history of Scotland. The distinctive
beauty and the great philosophic interest of the Scotch character
arises from the very singular combination it displays of a romantic
and ehivalrous with a practical and industrial spirit. No other nation
exhibits in equal perfection the union of these two elements, and the
fact is in the <U+FB01>rst instance due to geographical and political causes.
The seat of the <U+FB01>rst is the Highlands, the seat of the other the Low
lands. The <U+FB01>rst spirit has grown out of the old clan system; the

1868.]        on the Influence of the Imagination on History.        401
history of the second spirit is that of the towns, of the rise of the
middle classes, and of Puritanism.       The enthusiasm of the first is
loyalty; the enthusiasm of the second is liberty. The first spirit
makes men reverent, retrospective, and imaginative; the second makes
them enlightened, progressive, and practical. In no other nation do
we find a vein of poetic sensibility and romantic feeling qualifying
and tempering in so singular a manner a character that is essen
tially industrial, practical, and almost plodding. The long endurance
of this romantic element may chiefly be ascribed to the existence of
certain traditional and patriotic romances, which elicit the first enthu
siasm of most Scotchmen, and which leave an impression upon their
characters that is seldom wholly effaced. Among these romances, per
haps the most prominent is that of Mary Stuart. Her beauty, her
misfortunes, and the many noble qualities she undoubtedly displayed,
made her peculiarly fitted for a centre of romance; and the vein of
sentiment the clan spirit had formed in Scotland speedily surrounded
her with a halo of romance. How early that romance arose has been
strikingly illustrated by Dean Stanley, in his work on Westminster
Abbey. “Mary's tomb,” he tells us, “was revered by devout Scots
as the shrine of a canonized saint. “I hear,’ says Dempster thirteen
years after the removal of the remains from Peterborough, “that her
bones, lately translated to the burial place of the kings of England,
are resplendent with miracles. This probably is the last instance of
a miracle-working tomb in England.” The same romance has con
tinued, though in other forms, to the present day, and there are few
Scotch men or women in whose character there may not be detected
something that may be distinctly traced to that unhappy queen. How
far the real Mary was removed from the Mary of romance, a great
living historian has conclusively shown; but the ideal Mary has
probably done more in the world than the real one. The latter
played rather a noisy than a great part, and all trace of her influence
has long since past; the former has had an abiding influence on the
imaginations and the characters of her people.
    It will appear from these considerations how very important the
fabulous element has often proved in history. The facts of history
have been in a great degree governed by its fictions. The part of the
historian, in dealing with a fable, is not simply to prove its fabulous
character, or even to explain the circumstances that generated it:
he must also trace the influence that fable has exercised upon the
world. Men as they were supposed to have been have often been
more influential than men as they were, and the realities of history
can never be exhaustively explained without reference to its illusions.
    And in this respect historical facts resemble physical phenomena.
We hear much in this place of the universe of which our world is but
an infinitesimal fraction, of the strange and interchanging forces that
govern its phenomena, of the all-pervading law discovered alike in its
mightiest masses and in its minutest particles; but there is a universe
widely different from that which modern science reveals. There is a

universe of which our globe is the centre and the sun and moon are
inconsiderable lights decorating its <U+FB01>rmament, and all its phenomena
are isolated and detached. It is the world of the appearances of things.
As truly as the sun causes the planets to revolve in their orbits around
it, as truly as the moon makes the tides of the ocean to ebb and <U+FB02>ow
beneath her power, so truly does the aspect of external nature as it is
seen by the untutored eye of man form the <U+FB01>rst associations of the
imagination, mould by its plastic energy the belief of succeeding
generations, and imprint its characters almost indelibly on the inmost
texture of the mind of man.
     It is the duty of the historian not simply to describe, but also to
explain, the conduct of men. He must penetrate below actions, and
must reveal the characters from which actions spring. There exist in
every individual mind and in every society countless tendencies, moral
and intellectual, in<U+FB01>nitely varying in their combinations, in the
degrees of their intensity, and in the directions of their operations.
These are the true materials of history, for these are the secret springs
that determine the actions of an individual or of a society. It is the
task of the historian to trace their genesis, to analyze their nature, to
estimate their forces, to forecast their probable issue. Some of them
may be traced to the facts of history, and some of them to its fables.
Facts never acquire their greatest in<U+FB02>uence over the human mind
until they have past through the medium of the imagination. Ideals
ultimately govern the world, and each, before it loses its ascendency,
bequeaths some moral truth as an abiding legacy'to the human race.
From the days of the Pagan romances, from the days of the ascetic
life, from the days of Charlemagne and the Crusaders~from these,
and many other periods, moral sentiments have descended to ourselves
which have all their place among the many and various elements that
compose the characters and determine the actions of civilized men.

                 WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                          Friday, June 5, 1868.
SIR HENRY HOLLAND, BART. M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. President, in the
                                   Chair.
                    Sm SAMUEL WHITE BAKER, M.A.
                         On Abyssinian, or Ethiopia.
 THERE are countries of small repute that only rise from their obscurity
when certain unexpected events call them before the world : thus Abys
sinia was simply known to exist, but commanded no attention, until the
detention of British subjects by its king forced that wild country before
the eyes of Europe.
     Nevertheless, we are bound to admit that, although Abyssinia was
ignored by the civilized world, there is much of interest attached to
that peculiar land, inhabited by various races, whose origin is at once
doubtful and mysterious, but who have for a period of nearly 1600
years maintained inviolate their belief in Christ, although surrounded
upon all sides by the enemies of their faith. It is the only spot in the
vast continent of Africa where Christianity absolutely took root.
    In the short space of a discourse I can only endeavour to condense
the past and present of Abyssinia, leaving the uncertain future to the
imagination of those who contemplate its annexation to a Mahommedan
 empire.
     To be concise, I propose to arrange the description of Abyssinia
under separate heads, commencing with Geographical Position, and
following in order with:
            2.
            1.
            3. Ancient

                           Formation;and Animals;
terminating with the “Abyssinian dif<U+FB01>culty” and the death of Theodore.
     Geographical Position-The frontiers of Abyssinia, like those of
most wild countries, are exceedingly ill de<U+FB01>ned, but they may be roughly
stalted as comprised between 9° and 15° N. lat. and 35° to 42° E. longi
tu e.
    Although this country contains the principal streams that cause the
annual inundation of the Nile, there is not one navigable river through
out the entire empire; thus Abyssinia must always struggle against the
difficulties of transport.
     With a considerable extent of sea-coast, Abyssinia has never hoisted
a <U+FB02>ag upon the Red Sea.

1868.]                  on Abyssinia, or Ethiopia.                   405
    This apparent apathy is the result of geographical difficulties. The
formation of the country is adverse to development, so long as it re
mains in savage hands.
    The low sandy shore that at one time formed the bottom of the
Red Sea, burns during a portion of the year with intense heat, and is
devoid of water. From this level plain, the mountains of Abyssinia
abruptly rise, and form an extraordinary mass of plateaux, peaks, and
<U+FB02>at~topped rocks, to altitudes varying from 6 to 14,000 feet. This
extreme variation of altitude affords a wide range of temperature: thus
the thermometer which stands at 120° in the shade on the sea-coast,
falls much below freezing-point in higher localities, and the unhealthy
valleys are walled in by plateaux heights that may rank among the
<U+FB01>nest climates of the world.
    The variation of temperature and of soil produce the most inter
esting botanical changes; in the lowlands are found all the well
known tropical productions, while every successive altitude exhibits
the beauties of different latitudes; thus we have the wonderful stride
in vegetation from the millet and the palms of the valley, to the wheat
and the <U+FB01>r-tree of the plateaux and mountain-peaks.
    The natural effect of so large a mountain mass as that presented by
Abyssinia, is the attraction of rain; thus, in addition tothe blessing of
a favourable climate, it has the advantage of moisture. Heavy dews
refresh the soil during the dry season, while numerous mountain
rivulets facilitate irrigation. In the month of April the weather
begins to vary, and heavy thunder-storms break upon the mountains.
In May these become more frequent; the trickling beds of insigni<U+FB01>
cant streams change to roaring torrents, following every storm, until
the month of June ushers in the rainy season in all its grandeur of
purple clouds and tremendous thunder. The mountains that in the
dry season were in silence, now tremble and roar with the <U+FB02>oods that
burst from their rugged sides, and in their impetuous course from
the high ground they cut the deep channels that form the only roads
from the lowlands to Upper Abyssinia. These innumerable torrents,
radiating from a mountain centre, at length concentrate in two great
rivers <U+FB02>owing north-west-the Blue Nile and the Atbara. It was on
22nd June that I witnessed the dry, sandy bed of the latter suddenly
invaded by the tremendous <U+FB02>ood, and although not a cloud dimmed the
parching sky, I knew that the rains were pouring in Abyssinia. It is
now well known that this <U+FB02>ood causes the periodical inundation of
Lower Egypt.
    Having given an outline of the effect of the mountain range, we
will now seek for the cause, by glancing at the principal geological
features.
     The greater portion of the rocks are plutonic, and a general
upheaval of the mass has been occasioned by volcanic action. We
thus observe, at an altitude of several thousand feet above the ocean,
masses of coral and'fossil shells that at one time formed the bottom of
the sea.   In another district we <U+FB01>nd beds of sandstone, not only

 406                       Sir Samuel White Baker                   [June 5,
 upheaved, but broken through by masses of basalt that have formed
 lofty mountains; while in the southern portion of the country we
 <U+FB01>nd that the same action that caused an upheaval on the one hand, has
 also caused depression on the other, as shown by the Salt Lake Assal
 (<U+FB01>rst seen by Harris in his mission to Shea), which is 570 feet below
 the level of the sea. There can be little doubt that at the time of the
 great volcanic disturbance a portion of the sea must have been enclosed
 and caught by the upheaval of the shore and the depression of the
 interior ; the evaporation of which has given rise to the plains of salt
 in that portion of Abyssinia. This salt is cut by the natives into
 small pieces, like hone-stones, and in certain districts it is used in lieu
 of coin.
      Minerals-The mineralogy of the country has never been scienti
 <U+FB01>cally examined, but it is known to be rich in iron and copper, and to
 possess in smaller quantities gold, antimony, and lead. In one district
 coal has long since been discovered cropping out from the mountain’s
 side in exceedingly thick veins, said to be from 10 to 15 feet. It is
 with this fuel that Theodore smelted his iron, and cast his monster
mortar that was to terrify the English. On the con<U+FB01>nes of Abyssinia,
at Fazoclé, the Egyptians have worked gold mines for many years,
 and there can be little doubt that a scienti<U+FB01>c investigation of the
 country would lead to important mineral discoveries. I myself dis
 covered, in the portion of Abyssinia occupied by Mek Nimmur, the
presence of copper in large quantities, that was entirely unknown to
the natives; also bloodstone and cornelian in extraordinary masses.
So rich is the copper-ore in the district to which I allude, that it
poisons the water of the stream that flows through the cliffs, and it
has the effect of impoverishing all animals until they become mere
living skeletons.
      As the general formation of the mountain-range is basaltic, which
 undergoes rapid decomposition when exposed to the atmospherical
 changes of violent rains and intense heat, the shapes of the extreme
 heights are most fantastic; in some instances the sides have fallen
 bodily away, and have left a dice-shaped table thousands of feet above
 the plain; in others the natural demolition is more complete, and the
 top having crumbled, has widened the base with its fallen ruin, leaving
 a keen-edged pyramid as an unmistakable landmark among the chaos
 of mountain-peaks. Wherever a broad <U+FB02>at-topped summit is found
 towering above the rest, with precipitous and inaccessible sides, it is
 occupied as an Amba, or fortress, by some refractory chief, into which
\eagle’s-nest he can retire with his followers when hard pressed by the
 enemy.
      Fertility.—Although during the dry season the aspect of the
mountain-range is parched and barren, the soil of the valleys and
 plateaux is exceedingly fertile, formed by the disintegrated portions
of volcanic rocks that have been washed from the mountain sides.
Even the steep slopes of these mountains give birth during the rains
 to a. rich vegetation, which supports vast herds of cattle in the populated

1868.]                   on Abyssinia, or Ethiopia.                     407
districts, and in those less inhabited localities attracts the numerous
wild animals that constitute the. “ fauna ” of Abyssinia-the elephant,
rhinoceros, buffalo, antelopes of many varieties, gira<U+FB02>‘es, lions, leopards,
hyenas, hippopotami, baboons, monkeys, &c. Throughout the country
are innumerable birds, including the great and lesser bustard, guinea
fowl, francolin, and other varieties of partridges, sand-grouse, with
geese, ducks, and a long list of rare species to delight the ornithologist.
     Of the insect tribes the most important are the cattle-<U+FB02>y, or
“seroot,” that drives all domestic animals from the lowlands during
the rainy season, and the bee.
     I believe that this tormentor (the Seroot) was the instrument em
ployed in the plague of <U+FB02>ies in<U+FB02>icted upon the Egyptians by Moses.
 This <U+FB02>y is alluded to in the passage in Isaiah vii. 18 :—“And it shall
come to pass in that day that the Lord shall hiss for the <U+FB02>y that is
in the uttermost part of the land of Egypt.” This insect scourge
appears at the commencement of the rains in June, being hatched from
the egg deposited in the soil in the preceding year, and its arrival is
the signal for an exodus of the people and <U+FB02>ocks from the low rich
 soils to drier or more elevated localities.
     The bee is the blessing of Abyssinia ; the rocks and hollow trees
 teem with wild honey, during the months from December to April.
 Beeswax is one of the principal exports of the country, and mead, or
 “ tetch,” is the general beverage. This is a mixture of <U+FB01>ve parts of
 water to one of honey, <U+FB02>avoured with herbs, and fermented; it is ren
 dered intoxicating by the addition of the leaves of a plant called by
 the Abyssinians “ Jershooa.”
     The chief article of export from Abyssinia is co<U+FB02>'ee. This im
 portant production is indigenous to the soil, and <U+FB02>ourishes with small
 attempts at cultivation. There can be no doubt that Abyssinia, if in
 the possession of a European power, would become one of the <U+FB01>rst
 co<U+FB01>'ee-producing countries, as the quality of soil, climate, and vast
 extent of mountain slopes are peculiarly adapted for that branch of
 agriculture. At present the great market is at Gellabét, commonly
 known as Matemma ; there the oo<U+FB01>'ee is brought by Abyssinian mer
 chants and sold in exchange for cotton, which is produced of excellent
 quality, by the Tokrooris who inhabit that district. Although the
 mountainous portion of Abyssinia is ill adapted for cotton cultivation,
 there is a large district partly uninhabited, owing to the insecurity of
 life near the Egyptian frontier, that is eminently suited for cotton
 plantations. This beautiful country is about 2500 feet above the sea
 level, at the base of precipitous range of mountains, from which it
 slopes to the north-west, and drains into the Atbara. It is through
 this fertile but neglected land that the great Nile tributaries of
 Abyssinia cut their impetuous channels. The Takazzie, or Settite,
 the Angrab, Salaam, and others of less importance burst from the
 dark gorges of the mountain sides in imposing grandeur, and at length
 escaping from the narrow walls of rocks and precipices, they have cut
  deep valleys in the rich soil some two miles in width, at the bottom

408                      Sir Samuel White Baker                  [Jone 5,
of which—200 feet below the general level of the country-they flow
in superb streams, enriched with the mud that will be deposited in the
Nile delta.
    Although that portion of the country offers every advantage for
cotton cultivation, it is almost uninhabited, neither can it become of
value until the Egyptians shall have absolutely de<U+FB01>ned their frontier,
and Abyssinia shall have some more civilized and stable form of
government.
     In a summary of the geographical features of Abyssinia, we <U+FB01>nd that
it possesses nearly every variety of climate and soil ; that it is rich in
minerals; it possesses coal, but means of transport are di<U+FB02>icult in the
absence of roads or navigable rivers. It produces an exceedingly
hardy race of horses andmules, together with an excellent breed of
cattle.
     With such natural advantages, it appears surprising that Abyssinia
should not have progressed in the scale of civilization. This inertia
must be attributed to the di<U+FB01>iculties of its position : it is a moun
tainous country, surrounded by enemies di<U+FB01>'ering in religion, and
regarding the population of Abyssinia as Christian dogs who should
be driven out or converted to Mahommedanism. Without the possession
of a sea-coast, which is claimed by Egypt, and depending for security
upon the di<U+FB02>iculty of approach presented by the mountains, Abyssinia
has maintained its independence simply through its isolation; it has of
late years been excluded from the world, therefore it remains some cen
turies behind the world.
     Races of mankind that have thus lived long in seclusion cling
most pertinaciously to their ancient customs and traditions; thus,
hemmed in among their own mountains, the Abyssinians are strictly
conservative, and hold to their faith with extreme tenacity.
     According to the traditions of the people, the origin of the Abys
 sinian race was a settlement of the Jews. Although this assertion is
dii<U+FB01>cult to prove, there is no reason to doubt that the Israelites may
 have settled in considerable numbers at remote periods. Certain it is,
 that in the reign of Solomon, the Red Sea was navigated by the Jewish
 <U+FB02>eet, and the coasts were searched for every production that could add
 to the treasury of the king. It is written in I. Kings ix. 26 :—-“ And
 King Solomon made a navy of ships in Ezion-geber, which is beside
 Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom.” Again, we
<U+FB01>nd in chap. 1:. 22 :——“ For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish
 with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Thar
 shish, bringing gold and silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.” Thus there
 were two distinct <U+FB02>eets in the Red Sea, the “navy of Hiram” and the
 “navy of Tharshish :” the latter only returned once in three years
 from some distant voyage, probably from Ceylon and India; while that
 of Hiram traded with Ophir and along the east coast of Africa.
     It is therefore highly probable that Jewish settlements were esta
 blished according to the traditions of the Abyssinians, which inter
 married with the inhabitants; these I believe to have been originally

1868.]                  on Abyssinia, or Ethiopia. I                409
pure Gallas, at that time either idolaters or devoid of all religion.
Even at the present day the Gallas are so closely allied to the Abys
sinians that they are with difficulty distinguished, both appearing to
belong to the Caucasian race, and entirely distinct from all other races
of the African continent. The men are Well-featured, of a dark-brown
colour, with good hair, while the women (especially the Gallas) are
remarkable for a delicacy of feature that is at least equal to that of
Europeans.
    A further proof of the Israelitish extraction of the Abyssinians is
rigid adherence to the ancient Jewish rites : circumcision is invariably
practised, polygamy is allowed, and the harsh and cruel Jewish laws
of retribution are sternly enacted.
    Although the name Ethiopia was used in a broad sense by the
ancients without any strict geographical limits, there can be no doubt
that it is specially applied to Abyssinia in many parts of the Old
Testament. At that time Abyssinia included the entire course of the
Blue Nile and the Atbara, which is now possessed by Egypt. We <U+FB01>nd
in Isaiah repeated allusions to the country that cannot be mistaken
(18th chapter, 1, 2 verses) :—-“ Woe to the land shadowing with wings,
which is beyond the river of Ethiopia : that sendeth ambassadors by
the sea, even in vessels of bulrushes upon the waters.”
     Both in the Hebrew and in Arabic the same word denotes either
the sea or a large river, or sheet of water; thus, in the verse quoted,
the “sea” is the Nile, and even to this day the Abyssinians use no
other vessels (upon the great lake Tana) than bundles of rushes lashed
together in the form of canoes, which are the “ vessels of bulrushes
upon the waters.”                   '
     Again, in Isaiah xi'x.: “And the waters shall fail from the sea,
and the river shall be wasted and dried up. And they shall turn the
rivers far away; and the brooks of defence shall be emptied and dried
 up; the reeds and <U+FB02>ags shall wither.”
     The word “sea” is here used in the same sense, signifying the
lake—most probably the lake Tana in Ethiopia (Abyssinia) which
supplies water to the Blue Nile. The prophecy, “They shall turn the
rivers far away,” is explained by the Abyssinian traditions that, in the
ancient wars between that country and Egypt, they turned the course
of several large rivers, and by means of prodigious dams they directed
their waters away from the Nile, thus impoverishing Egypt by pre
venting the annual inundation. It may be a question whether in the
time of Joseph the seven years of famine in Egypt were not caused by
such a disturbance of the Nile tributaries of Abyssinia.
     An equally important question may be suggested, whether the low
 Nile that af<U+FB02>icted Egypt as a plague in the time of Moses was not
equally the result of hostile Ethiopian engineering at the Abyssinian
 sources ‘3
     At that period Ethiopia was a power that had actually overrun
 and vanquished Egypt, and although we receive merely an outline of
 certain events in the Old Testament, we are indebted to Josephus for

410                     Sir Samuel White Baker                 [June 5,
a detailed account of the life of Moses, which he gathered from books
that were most probably lost at the destruction of the Alexandrian
Library. He tells us that after Egypt had been vanquished by the
Ethiopians, Moses was chosen to lead the Egyptian forces against the
enemy. Successful in every battle, he gained great renown, and at the
head of the Egyptian army he not only drove the Ethiopians out of
Egypt, but he followed them into their own country until he arrived
at their capital, Saaba or Soba, on the banks of the Blue Nile ; not a
dozen miles from the spot upon which Khartoum now stands in N. 1at.,
about 150 26'. This great town of Ethiopia, protected by the Blue
Nile on one side and by the White Nile a few miles in the rear, was
besieged by Moses, and would hardly have been taken, had not
the daughter of the Ethiopian king become enraptured with the accounts
she had received of Moses’ renown, and grand personal appearance;
her passion became so great that she sent a messenger, declaring that
she would betray her father’s citadel in return for the love of the
Egyptian general. She did so; the gates were opened, the city of
Soba was taken, and Moses returned to Egypt victorious with his
Ethiopian bride. All that we hear of this lady in the Bible is con
tained in Numbers xii. 1:——“And Miriam and Aaron spake against
Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married; for he
had married an Ethiopian woman.”
     I have dwelt at some length upon this incident to prove that, even
in the reign of the Pharaohs, Abyssinia, or Ethiopia, was a most
powerful country; therefore although the present race claims a
Jewish descent, at that remote period the Abyssinians could have had
no admixture of Israelitish blood.
     We shall now turn to a more recent, although still ancient, period
of great interest in Abyssinian history, bearing in mind that Saaba, or
Soba, was the capital of the country situated on the Blue Nile due
south of Egypt.
     In the reign of Solomon we are told that he was visited by the
great Queen of the South-the Queen of Sheba.           It is written in
I. Kings:—-“ But King Solomon loved many strange women, together
with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites,
 Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites” . . . “and he had seven hundred
 wives princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned
 away his heart.”
     As the daughter of the King of Saaba had become enamoured of
 Moses through his reputation, so it appears by Abyssinian tradition
 that the Queen of Sheba, perhaps of that same Ethiopian capital Saaba,
 had almost more than a feminine curiosity in making her long journey
 to Solomon. It is the present boast of Abyssinia that the long line
 of her emperors descends direct from Menilek, the son of Solomon
 and the Queen of Sheba.
     There are several cogent reasons for the suggestion that the
 capital of Ethiopia (Saaba) was the country of this celebrated but
 mysterious queen.    In the II. Chronicles ix. her o<U+FB01>‘erings are thus

 1868.]                  on Abyssinia, or Ethiopia.                  411
 described: “And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents
 of gold, and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither
 was there any such spice as the Queen of Sheba gave King Solomon.”
     When speculating upon the country from which she came, we
 must observe the character of the presents delivered by the queen.
 1st, the Gold. This is not only produced in Abyssinia generally, but
 even at the present day gold mines are worked by the Egyptian
 Government at Fazoclé, on the Blue Nile, which is the river upon
 which her supposed capital, Saaba, was situated.
     2nd, the Spices. I imagine that the <U+FB01>nest gum arabic is alluded
 to under the general name of spice, as that presented by the Queen was
 evidently a great rarity; it is specially remarked, “neither was there
 any such spice as the Queen of Sheba gave King Solomon.” It so
 happens that the district of Kordofan, a few days’ journey from the
 city of Saaba, is renowned for the most beautiful quality of gum
 arabic that is produced from its acacias.                    '
     3nd, the Precious Stones. The ancients attached great value to the
 topaz; and we <U+FB01>nd an allusion to this stone in Job that is, curiously
 suggestive in the theory that the Queen of Sheba was Queen of Saaba,
 or Ethiopia: in chap. xxviii. 19, “ The topaz of Ethiopia shall not
 equal it.” Thus, all those presents offered to Solomon by the queen
 were celebrated products of Ethiopia, i. e. Abyssinia—gold, spices,
 and precious stones.                   -
     It is natural to suppose that so important a country as Ethiopia,
 which had at one time conquered Egypt, would be in regular com
 munication with that power, aid the Nile and the usual caravan
.routes; therefore the great queen would have speedily heard the
 reports of so renowned a king as Solomon.                         '
     Accepting the Abyssinian tradition that Menilek, the son of
 Solomon and Queen of Sheba, was the <U+FB01>rst of that royal line which
 has since governed the country, let us turn our attention to the last
 farewell, when Queen Sheba thus took leave of Solomon, to return
 into Ethiopia. She said :-—“ Blessed be the Lord thy God, which
 delighted in thee to set thee on his throne, to be king for the Lord
 thy God: because thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever,
 therefore He made thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.”-—
 II. Chron. ix. 8.
     Thus, about 986 13.0. was a belief in the true God introduced to
 the pagans of Ethiopia, upon the return of their queen, who had
 heard and been converted by the wisdom of Solomon; and thus were
 Jewish laws engrafted upon that land, of which David had already
 prophesied (Psalm lxviii. 31): “Princes shall come out of Egypt;
 Ethiopia shall soon stretch out her hands unto God.”
     We have every reason to suppose that from this time the Jewish
 settlements in Abyssinia commenced; but We will at once leave that
 ancient epoch, and turn to that most interesting time when Christianity
 <U+FB01>rst dawned upon the land.
     In Acts viii. we have the following graphic account of the con

412                        Sir Samuel White Baker                   [June 5,
version to Christianity of the treasurer of Ethiopia, who is supposed
to have introduced that creed upon his return to the country. It is
    (Ver.:-—26.) “ And the angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, I
Written
Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from
Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.
     “And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an
eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who
had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for
to worship, was returning, and sitting in his chariot, read Esaias the
prophet.
     “ Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to
this chariot.
     “ And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet
Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest ‘R
     “And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me?
And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.
     “ The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as
a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer,
so opened he not his mouth: in his humiliation his judgment was
taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is
taken from the earth.
     “ And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom
speaketh the prophet this ? of himself, or of some other man?
     “Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture,
and preached unto him Jesus.                             '
       Andeunuch
and “the              wentSee,

                            on here   way,
                                         water;

     “And Philip said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou
mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that esus Christ is the
Son of God.                    '
     “And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went
down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he bap
tized him.”
     Even to this day the Abyssinians baptize by total immersion:
thus the <U+FB01>rst seeds of Christianity were sown by the eunuch, upon his
return. We next hear2 of the general conversion of Abyssinia to
 Christianity, by,Frumentius, in about A.D. 340, who introduced the
Coptic Church from Alexandria, from which date unto the present
day it has remained as an o<U+FB02>'set of that Church, under the direction of
the Coptic Patriarch.
     In the short space of a discourse it is impossible to give more than
an,outline of the principal events that have occurred in the long
period of Ethiopian history: it will be sui<U+FB01>eient to have traced the
origin of the conversion to Christianity, and to pass over the less im
 portant events of the Greek settlements and the founding of Axum by
 the Ptolemies; the mission of the Portuguese Jesuits in the <U+FB01>fteenth

 1868.]                 on Abyssinian, or Ethiopia.            ‘     4,13
 century, who, after creating anarchy throughout the country, were
 expelled in 1632 ; and the constant encroachments of the Mahommedan
 Gallas. Every attempt to alter the original faith of Abyssinia has
 failed, even down to our own time, when in 1829 Bishops Gobat and
 Kugler were despatched by our Church Missionary Society. We new
 approach those events which are more specially interesting to us as
 the forerunners of the Abyssinian dii<U+FB01>culty. Like the Jewish history,
 that of Abyssinia has been marked with continual blood-shedding ;
 the descent from Solomon has been the cause of perpetual confusion,
 one usurper succeeding another under the pretext of legitimate birth,
 while the civil wars have been conducted with revolting atrocities.
 At the same time, the mutual hostility that marked the ancient histories
 of Egypt and Ethiopia has burnt with a steady <U+FB02>ame, fresh fuel having
‘been added to the <U+FB01>re by the fanatical opinions of opposing creeds,
 the ancient Christianity of Abyssinia clashing with the Mohammed
 anism of the Egyptians.
     Within the last twenty-<U+FB01>ve years the Egyptians have extended
 their southern conquests until they have absorbed territories that
 originally formed portions of Ethiopia, and having no regard for
 boundaries, there has been a constant border warfare upon their elastic
 frontier. Perpetual raids have been made upon Abyssinian ground,
 villages plundered, and the young girls as slaves captured to <U+FB01>ll the
 hareems of the wealthy. Wide and fertile tracts of land that I have
 already described are uninhabited, owing to the insecurity of life and
 property, and the Abyssinians have withdrawn into their wall of
 mountains. In addition to this di<U+FB01>iculty, the hostility between the
two countries has rendered it next to impossible for the Abyssinians
to continue their Pilgrimages to Jerusalem, to which they have attached
extreme importance from very remote periods. At the same time
they have lost their sea-coast, which has been annexed by Egypt.
     Under these adverse circumstances, Abyssinia sought the protection
of England as a Christian and powerful friend.          ,
     In the year 1848, when Ras Ali was King of Abyssinia, Mr. Plow
den, who had for some years been resident as a traveller in that
country, was appointed British consul by Lord Palmerston; and the
<U+FB01>rst grand error was committed, by the appointment of a consul in the
interior of a savage country, where he could not possibly be supported.
     In the year 1853 a claimant to the throne appeared in the person
of one Kasai, of Kwora, on the Scnaar frontier, who declared himself
to be the rightful heir to the throne, as the direct descendant of
Menilek, the son of Solomon. This man combined high qualities of
courage and ability that shortly procured him extraordinary in<U+FB02>uence;
and his success was so unvarying and rapid, that a superstitious awe
seized upon his enemies: to meet Theodore Kasai in battle was to be
defeated. Ras Ali was dethroned, and in 1855 Theodore was crowned
by the Aboona as “ King of kings of Ethiopia.”
    At that time there was in Abyssinia an English gentleman adven
turcr, named Bell : it was this traveller who <U+FB01>rst induced our country

414                      <U+FB01>ir Samuel White Baker                   [June 5,
man Mr. Plowden to visit Abyssinia, in which country both these
gentlemen eminently distinguished themselves; and after gaining an
extraordinary, in<U+FB02>uence with the King Theodorus, they died by the
hands of his enemies. Mr. Bell served as his commanderin-chief,
and, after great exploits, fell in battle in the service of the king; but
Mr. Plowden, who was appointed British consul for Abyssinia in 1848,
was attacked upon the road during a journey, and was killed by a party
of the king’s enemy, Negoussee. This sad event occurred in February,
 1860; and Theodore avenged the death of his friend by the execution
of Negoussee and a number of his people.
    At that time Theodore was a <U+FB01>rm friend’ to the English, who were
supposed to reciprocate the feeling, as Her Majesty’s Government had
already, in 1849, entered into a treaty with Abyssinia, and had also
interfered for the protection of the Abyssinians from the attacks of the
Egyptians; ride the following despatch from Lord Clarendon, then
Secretary of State for Foreign A<U+FB02>'airs, to the Consul-general of Egypt,
dated 30th June, 1854 :—
    “You will state to the Pasha distinctly that Her Majesty’s Govern
ment will not acquiesce in any assumption, either on the part of the
Porte or that of himself, of any authority over the independent terri
tories of Abyssinia; and that Her Majesty’s Government will watch
over the interests of the Christians in that country, and not allow them
to be maltreated or oppressed by their Mussulman neighbours.“
    Believing in the friendship of England, and devoted in his admi
ration of those good specimens of Englishmen, Plowden and Bell, who
had won so great an in<U+FB02>uence, that extraordinary man Theodore, with
a mind of no common capacity, organized a plan for the regeneration
of his country, and determined that Ethiopia should resume her high
position among the empires of the east.
    There is an extreme interest in tracing the grand views of this
remarkable man at that early stage of his career, before his plans had
been thwarted, and he had been rendered cruel and desperate by con
stant rebellions, ingratitude, and treachery; before he had discovered
that the material that he governed was inadequate to the great task he
contemplated.
    In an interesting work published by the deceased Consul Plowden’s
brother, we have the advantage of his manuscript written in Abyssinia
at a time when he was the king’s most intimate friend, and shared all
his projects. He writes, in page 455 :—
    “ King Theodorus‘is young in years, vigorous in all manly exercises,
of a striking countenance, peculiarly polite and engaging when pleased,
and mostly displaying great tact and delicacy.
    “He is persuaded that he is destined to restore the glories of the
Ethiopian empire and to achieve great conquests; of untiring energy,
both mental and bodily, his personal and moral daring are boundless.
                      * ‘Abyssinian Blue Book,’ p. 89.

 1868.]                   on Abyssinia, 01- Ethiopia.                  415
     “When aroused, his wrath is terrible, and all tremble, but at all
 moments he possesses a perfect self-command. Indefatigable in busi
ness, he takes little repose night or day; his ideas and language are
clear and precise, hesitation is not known to him, and he has neither
 counsellors nor go-betweens.
     “ He is fond of splendour, and receives in state, even on a campaign.
 He is unsparing in punishment (very necessary to restrain disorder
 and to restore order in such a wilderness as Abyssinia). He salutes
 his meanest subject with courtesy, is sincerely, though often mistakenly,
 religious, and will acknowledge a fault committed towards his poorest
 follower in a moment of passion, with sincerity and grace.
     “He is generous to excess, and free from all cupidity, regarding
 nothing with pleasure or desire but munitions of war for his soldiers.
 He has hitherto exercised the utmost clemency towards the vanquished,
 treating them rather as his friends than his enemies. His faith is
 signal.   ‘ Without Christ,’ he says, ‘ I am nothing; if he has destined
 me to purify and reform this distracted kingdom, with his aid, who
shall stay me?’
     “ The worst points in his character are his violent anger at times,
his unyielding pride, as regards his kingly and divine right, and his
fanatical religious zeal.
     “Married himself at the altar, and strictly continent, he has ordered
or persuaded all who love him to follow his example, and he exacts
the greatest decency of manners and conversation; this system he
hopes to extend to all classes.
     “He has begun to substitute letters for verbal messages. After
perusing the ‘ History of the Jesuits in Abyssinia,’ he has decided that
no Roman Catholic priests shall teach in his dominions. To foreigners,
however, he permits the free exercise of their religion, but prohibits
all preaching contrary to the doctrine of the Coptic church.
     “He is particularly jealous of his sovereign rights and of anything
that appears to trench on them; he wishes in a short time to send em
bassies to the great European powers, to treat with them on equal terms.
     “ Some of his ideas may be imperfect, others impracticable; but a
man who, rising from the clouds of Abyssinian ignorance, without
assistance and without advice, has done so much, and contemplates
such large designs, cannot be regarded as of an ordinary stamp.”
     In his private conversations with Mr. Plowden the character of
Theodore is strikingly displayed.
     On one occasion he said, “You and Bell only love me. Abyssi
nians are governed by God’s will, and I have yet much to do. What
if I died to-night (cholera was then raging), or turned monk, but that
God wills me for this work?
     “If you gave me this room full of gold, of what use would it be
to me? I wish for knowledge to avoid the necessity of severe punish
ment, and to put my country in order. As God has given this throne
to me, a beggar, so let Him give me knowledge.”
     On another occasion, previous to his departure on a campaign,

416                     Sir Samuel White Baker                [June 5,
when Mr. Plowden refused to accept his gifts, he said, “ Our country
requires us to be hospitable; we must wash the feet of strangers.
By whose power are we now in a house, and not in a wilderness?
I do not give you pay or raiment, I only give you bread and water,
you must receive them. I know you are richer than I am, but now it
is only a loan, and you will repay me hereafter in deeds.” I replied,
“I am nothing; my Queen only can be of use to you.”           He said,
“Listen! without God’s permission all the kings of the earth could
not prevail against me, and 1 fear them not;        but your Queen, a
Christian, has sent you to me, and faith unites us: Christ wills our
friendship. God may design me good in this.”
     Mr. Plowden adds, “He then called me apart and offered me
1000 dollars to enable me to live in comfort in his absence, which I
refused. He then took my hand, and said, ‘All men are mortal; if
anything happens to me, befriend my son. Write to your country,
say you had a friend who loved you all, and who intended to send
an embassy to you for your friendship, and beg them to support my
son.’ I assented. He said, ‘ I love and trust you, good-bye.’ ”
     This is a selection from similar conversations with Mr. Plowden,
which exhibit the intensity of feeling of the king; at the same time
it is a record of the judgment and discretion that were displayed by
the consul. He wisely declined the king’s gifts, thereby upholding
the dignity of the Queen, and retaining his complete independence;
at the same time his relations with the king were those of the
warmest friendship.
     We will now change the scene. Theodore’s enemies had killed his
bosom friends, the two Englishmen Bell and Plowden; he was thus
robbed of those two sincere advisers to whom he could always turn for
an opinion, and in whom he had placed implicit trust. From that date
the character of Theodore changed with succeeding events. The rebels
tormented him on all sides; the European missionaries were an
annoyance; the Egyptians made raids upon his frontier; he had lost
those friends to whom he could turn for sympathy-they were dead.
A new consul, Mr. Cameron, was appointed from England.
     Theodore had been assured of the friendship of England, and he
 had wished to send an embassy to the Queen; this was declined on our
 side. He requested Mr. Cameron to forward an urgent letter to the
 Queen; this request was complied with; the letter was sent, and he
anxiously awaited a reply.
     In the meantime the Egyptians continued their attacks upon his
 frontier. England had, as we have already seen, interfered to protect
 Abyssinia from aggression, but no active assistance was given. The
 British consul, Mr. Cameron, passed over into Egypt, and remained
 with the enemies of Abyssinia. The king became suspicious; where
 were the dear friends of old in whom he had always trustcd-Plowden
 and Bell?
     Months passed away. Mr. Cameron returned to Abyssinia, but no
 reply arrived from the Queen to his urgent letter. Fresh insurrections

1868.]                 on Abyssinia, 01' Ethiopia.                   417
broke out at home. Constantly worried by the Egyptians on one side,
by the Gallas on the other, and his empire racked with internal discord,
the heart of the king grew hard; all those sanguine hopes of regene
rating Ethiopia, the day-dreams of his youth, had faded. Disappointed,
deceived, cajoled, the naked truth lay bare before him-England had
deserted him; the country in which he had trusted had not even eon
descended to notice his letter to the Queen. Was it possible? Perhaps
that letter was never forwarded, and he had been deceived by Cameron.
This suspicion was maddening. Cameron had visited the Egyptians,
his enemies, and therefore he might be his enemy.
    Years passed away-nearly three years; the King of kings of
Ethiopia, Theodorus, was no longer the Theodore of former days, when
he leant on his faithful counsellors, Plowden and Bell; soured and
despairing, the softer portions of his nature grew callous, and all that
remained were the indomitable courage, the pride, and chivalry of the
king.
    In the meanwhile that important letter upon which his hopes had
centred, lay utterly ignored and unanswered, in some dusty pigeon-hole
of the Foreign Of<U+FB01>ee, while our suspected consul was lying in chains
in Abyssinia!
    It is painful to follow the successive phases of the Abyssinian
di<U+FB01>iculty.
    Mr. Rassam was sent as British envoy. In the meantime the king
had increased in tyranny and suspicion ; he had placed all the
Europeans in chains.
    Mr. Bassam’s mission failed; the Oriental etiquette of exchange
of presents was frightfully transgressed. The members of Mr.
Rassam’s mission were added to the captives.
    England was insulted. The report had spread through Egypt and
India that a British consul and envoy were in chains. We determined
upon war.                                              ‘
    The events of this war are too well known to be repeated. From
the days of Hannibal, who marched his army and elephants across the
Alps, no such mountain-march has been performed as that by Sir
Robert Napier, who with a skill and foresight unequalled in modern
times has cut a road for 400 miles through the Abyssinian Alps,
beaten the enemy, rescued the prisoners, and we trust has by this time
returned with the army to the Red Sea.
     Thus closes the Abyssinian drama; and thus all the grand visions
of the proud Theodore for the regeneration of Ethiopia have dis
solved. With all his faults, Theodore was a remarkable character;
faithful to the memory of his <U+FB01>rst friends, the Englishmen, Plowden
and Bell, he has never spilt one drop of English blood—he has never
 hurt a European head; he delivered the captives into our hands safe
 and in robust health. His army deserted him, and delivered up the
key of his pom'tion. Too brave to yield, too proud to swell the
triumph of his conqueror, he determined to die as he had lived, as
 “ King of kings of Ethiopia.” With a few devoted followers he

faced the storm of the British assault. Crushed by the overwhehning
odds, his brave adherents were swept down; and as Saul, when the
battle went against him, fell upon his own sword, so the great
Theodore ended his career with a pistol-shot through his brain. He
had formerly received that pistol as a present from Her Majesty the
Queen of England.
     Thus passed away this extraordinary man. Of his cruelties we will
not speak ; they were not more than a repetition of those bloody events
that have ever stained the history of Abyssinia. However horrible,
they were inferior to those wholesale massacres committed by Moses,
Joshua, and those eminent characters in Jewish history which are
looked upon in Abyssinia as models of virtue: hardly were they more
terrible than acts in the reign of Mary committed in our own country.
     The rock of Magdala is the everlasting tombstone that covers the
remains of Theodore, King of Ethiopia; at the same time it is an
imperishable monument not only of British bravery and enterprise,
but of British justice and moderation: unlike those savage wars that
have reddened their paths with blood, and desolated the land by rapine,
no single act of injustice has been reported throughout our long and
difficult march, and England retires from Abyssinia respected by
barbarians and honoured by the civilized world.
    Thus the curtain falls upon the last act in the Abyssinian tragedy.
In conclusion, I cannot help recalling those pathetic words in the <U+FB01>rst
act addressed by the king to his friend Plowden at the moment of part
ing: he said, “ Write to your country, say you had a friend who loved
you all, and who intended to send an embassy to you for your friend
ship, and beg them to support my son ;” the consul assented, and
Theodore’s last words were, “ I love and trust you, good-bye.”
    All Englishmen must be grati<U+FB01>ed that this con<U+FB01>dence was not
misplaced. At that time Theodore was our friend, but the trust has
been deemed sacred although he died as our enemy. Only yesterday
a telegram was received from Sir Robert Napier, reporting the death
of Theodore’s queen, and craving permission that the orphan son, a
child, might be taken to Bombay for protection and education. Thus
a descendant of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba remains beneath the
British <U+FB02>ag, who, civilized by our laws and educated in the mercies of
Christianity, may on some future day sit upon his late father’s throne,
and carry out his grand but futile plans for the regeneration of
Abyssinia.

                               in the Chair.
                     EDWARD FRANKLAND, F.R.S.
                           PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY 3.1.
             On the Source of Light in Luminous Flames.
THE most proli<U+FB01>c source of error amongst mankind is the unques
tioning acceptation of authoritative opinion. However much we may
pride ourselves upon the sifting 0f the explanations of things by our
own enlightened judgments, it cannot be denied that the ipse dixit
mode of settlement is still wonderfully frequent amongst us. Not
only is this the case with the public in general, but even the culti
vators of science are not entirely innocent of the same weakness.
    The essential difference between a fact and a theory is not always
appreciated with su<U+FB01>icient vividness. The statement that “ 16 parts
by weight of oxygen unite with 2 parts of hydrogen to form water,” is
considered by many, for instance, as perfectly synonymous with the
assertion that “1 atom of oxygen unites with 2 atoms of hydrogen to
form water.”                     i
    The existence of an imponderable ethereal medium <U+FB01>lling all space
is often regarded as equally certain with the presence of a gaseous
envelope surrounding our globe.
    The atomic theory and the hypothesis of an ethereal medium are,
at present, absolutely necessary, the one to the progress of chemistry,
the other to the further development of physics; but neither this
circumstance nor the splendid discoveries made by their aid can
establish their truth. A mathematician starting from false data is
sure to arrive at a false result; but it is far otherwise with theory, for
false theories can, and constantly do, conduct to true facts. Thus
 Oolumbus’s counterpoise theory of the earth led to the discovery of
America, although that theory was nevertheless essentially false.
    The most sober worker in science cannot progress without the
assistance of theory to co-ordinate his facts, and to lead him on to
further research. It is here that even a false theory is invaluable,
and it is only when the theory continues to be held after it has
become opposed to facts, that it exercises a prejudicial in<U+FB02>uence
upon the progress of science. Then it hinders rather than expedites
                                                             2 a 2

the advance of the experimenter, and ought to be at once aban
doned.
     In pursuing the investigation forming the subject of this discourse,
the speaker had been compelled thus to abandon a theory of the
source of light in luminous flames, which he, in common with others,
had derived from Davy's classical researches on flame.
     Our text-books answer the question, What is the source of light in a
luminous gas or candle flame? in the most positive and unanimous
IIlannel".
     Selecting from some of the most celebrated, the following quota
 tions may be made :
     “All our artificial lights depend upon the ignition of solid matter,
 in the intense heat developed by the chemical changes attendant on
 combustion.”— W. A. Miller.
     “Whenever hydrocarbons are imperfectly burnt, there is a deposi
 tion of carbon, and this temporary deposition of carbon is an essential
 condition for the production of the white light required in an ordinary
 flame.”—Williamson.
     “The illuminating power of the gas flame is therefore due to these
 carbon particles, which are afterwards burned nearer the border of the
 flame.”—Balfour Stewart.                        -
      “The brightness or illuminating power of flame depends not only
 on the degree of heat, but likewise on the presence or absence of solid
 particles which may act as radiant points. A flame containing no
 such particles emits but a feeble light, even if its temperature is the
 highest possible.”—Watts.                 -
      The speaker then proceeded to investigate a number of different
 flames: he showed that there are many flames possessing a high
 degree of luminosity, which cannot possibly contain solid particles.
 Thus the flame of metallic arsenic burning in oxygen emits a remark
 ably intense white light; and as metallic arsenic volatilizes at 180°C.,
 and its product of combustion, arsenious anhydride, at 218°C., whilst
 the temperature of incandescence in solids is at least 500° C., it is
 obviously impossible here to assume the presence of ignited solid
 particles in the flame. Again, if carbonic disulphide vapour be made
 to burn in oxygen, or oxygen in carbonic disulphide vapour, an almost
 insupportably brilliant light is the result; now fuliginous matter is
 never present in any part of this flame, and the boiling point of
 sulphur (440°C.) is below the temperature of incandescence, so that
 the assumption of solid particles in the flame is here also inadmissible.
 If the last experiment be varied by the substitution of nitric oxide gas
  for oxygen, the result is still the same; and the dazzling light pro
 duced by the combustion of these compounds is also so rich in the
 more refrangible rays, that it has been employed in taking instan
 taneous photographs, and for exhibiting the phenomena of fluorescence.
 Lastly, amongst the chemical reactions celebrated for the production
 of dazzling light, there are few which surpass the active combustion
 of phosphorus in oxygen. Now phosphoric anhydride, the product of

1868.]                Source of Light in Luminous Flames.                       421
this combustion, is volatile at a red heat," and it is therefore mani
festly impossible that this substance should exist in the solid form at
the temperature of the phosphorus flame, which far transcends the
melting point of platinum.
     For these reasons, and for others which the speaker had stated in
a course of lectures on Coal-Gas, delivered in March, 1867, and
printed in the ‘Journal of Gas Lighting, he considered that incan
descent particles of carbon are not the source of light in gas and
candle flames, but that the luminosity of these flames is due to
radiations from dense, but transparent hydrocarbon vapours. As a
further generalization from the above-mentioned experiments, he was
led to the conclusion that dense gases and vapours become luminous
at much lower temperatures than aeriform fluids of comparatively low
specific gravity; and that this result is to a great extent, if not
altogether, independent of the nature of the gas or vapour, inasmuch
as he found that gases of low density, which are not luminous at a
given temperature when burnt under common atmospheric pressure,
become so when they are simultaneously compressed. Thus mixtures
of hydrogen and carbonic oxide with oxygen emit but little light
when they are burnt or exploded in free air; but exhibit intense
luminosity when exploded in closed glass vessels, so as to prevent
their expansion at the moment of combustion.
      In a communication just made to the Royal Society the speaker
had described the extension of these experiments to the combustion
 of jets of hydrogen and carbonic oxide in oxygen under a pressure
 gradually increasing to twenty atmospheres. These experiments,
which were conducted in the laboratory of the Royal Institution,
were made in a strong wrought-iron vessel furnished with a thick
 glass plate of sufficient size to permit of the optical examination of
the flame. The appearance of a jet of hydrogen burning in oxygen
 under the ordinary atmospheric pressure was exhibited. On increas
 ing the pressure to two atmospheres, the previously feeble luminosity
was shown to be very markedly augmented, whilst at ten atmospheres'
pressure, the light emitted by a jet about one inch long was amply
 sufficient to enable the observer to read a newspaper at a distance of
two feet from the flame, and this without any reflecting surface
behind the flame. Examined by the spectroscope, the spectrum of this
flame is bright and perfectly continuous from red to violet.
      With a higher initial luminosity, the flame of carbonic oxide in
 oxygen becomes much more luminous at a pressure of ten atmospheres
 than a flame of hydrogen of the same size and burning under the same
 pressure. The spectrum of curbonic oxide burning in oxygen under
     * Davy mentions this fact in connection with his view of the source of lumi-4
 nosity in flames, and endeavours to explain the, to him, anomalous phenomenon.
 He says:—“Since this paper has been written, I have found that phosphoric acid
 volatilizes slowly at a strong red heat, but under moderate pressure it bears a
 white heat; and in a flame so intense as that of phosphorus, the elastic force must
 produce the effect of compression.”—Davy's Works, vol. vi., p. 48.

 422             Professor Frankland on Luminous Flames.        [June 12,
 a pressure of fourteen atmospheres is very brilliant and perfectly
 continuous.
      If it be true that dense gases emit more light than rare ones when
 ignited, the passage of the electric spark through different gases ought
 to produce an amount of light varying with the density of the gas; and
 the speaker showed that electric sparks passed as nearly as possible,
 under similar conditions, through hydrogen, oxygen, chlorine, and
 sulphurous anhydride, emit light, the intensity of which is very slight
 in the case of hydrogen, considerable in that of oxygen, and very
 great in the case of chlorine and sulphurous anhydride. On passing
 a stream of induction sparks through the gas standing over lique<U+FB01>ed
 sulphurous anhydride in a strong tube at the ordinary temperature,
 when a pressure of ‘about three atmospheres was exerted by the gas, a
 very brilliant light was obtained. A stream of induction sparks was
 passed through air con<U+FB01>ned in a glass tube connected with a con
 densing syringe, and the pressure of the air being then augmented to
 two or three atmospheres, a very marked increase in the luminosity of
 the sparks was observed, whilst on allowing the condensed air to
 escape, the same phenomena were observed in the reverse order.
     Way’s mercurial light was also exhibited as an instance of intense
 light produced by the ignition of the heavy vapour of mercury. '
      The gases and vapours just mentioned have the following relative
 densities :
                     Hydrogen     ..  ..  .. .. ..    1
                     Air .. ..    ..  ..  .         14-.’5

      The feeble light emitted by phosphorus when burning in chlorine
 seems, at <U+FB01>rst sight, to be an exception to the law just indicated, for
 the density of the product of combustion (phosphorous trichloride)
 68 ' 7 would lead us to anticipate the evolution of considerable light.
 But it must be borne in mind that the luminosity of a <U+FB02>ame depends
 also upon its temperature, and it can be shown that the temperature
 in this case is probably greatly inferior to that produced by the com
 bustion of phosphorus in oxygen. We have not all the necessary
 data for calculating the temperature of these <U+FB02>ames, but, according to
 Andrews, phosphorus burnt in oxygen gives 5747 heat units, which,
 divided by the weight of the product from one grain of phosphorus,
 gives 2500 units. When phosphorus burns in chlorine, it gives only,
 according to the same authority, 2085 heat units, which, divided as
 before by the weight of the product, gives 470 units. It is therefore
‘evident that the temperature in the latter case must be greatly below
 that produced in the former, unless the speci<U+FB01>c heat of phosphoric
 anhydride be enormously higher than that of phosphorous trichloride.
 The speaker had, in fact, found that if the temperature of the <U+FB02>ame of
 phosphorus, burning in chlorine, be raised about 500° C. by previously

heating both elements to that extent, the flame emitted a brilliant
white light.
    To return to ordinary luminous flames, the argument of the neces
sity of solid particles to explain their luminosity obviously falls to the
ground; and a closer examination into the evidence of the existence of
these particles reveals its extreme weakness. Soot from a gas flame
is not elementary carbon, it always contains hydrogen. The perfect
transparency of the luminous portion of flame also tends to negative
the idea of the presence in it of solid particles. The continuous spec
trum of gas and candle flames does not require, as is commonly
supposed, the assumption of solid particles. The spectra of the flames
of carbonic oxide in air, of carbonic disulphide, arsenic, and phosphorus
in oxygen, are continuous, and so, as we have seen, is that of hydrogen
burning in oxygen under a pressure of ten atmospheres. It is to the
behaviour of hydrocarbons under the influence of heat that we must
look for the source of luminosity in a gas flame. These gradually
lose hydrogen, whilst their carbon atoms coalesce to form compounds
of greater complexity, and consequently of greater vapour density.
Thus marsh-gas (C.H.) becomes acetylene (C, H.), and the density
increases from 8 to 13. Again, olefiant gas (C, H.) forms naphthaline
(Clo H.), when the vapour density augments from 14 to 64. These
are some of the dense hydrocarbons which are known to exist in a gas
flame, but there are doubtless others still more dense; pitch, for instance,
must consist of the condensed vapours of such heavy hydrocarbons,
for it distils over from the retorts in the process of gas-making.
Candle flames are similarly constituted. The direct dependence of
the luminosity of gas and candle flames upon atmospheric pressure,
also strongly confirms the view that the light of these flames is due to
incandescent dense vapours.
    This inquiry cannot be confined to terrestrial objects. Science
seeks alike for law in the meanest and grandest objects of creation.
From questioning a candle she addresses herself to suns, stars, nebulae,
and comets; the same considerations which have just been applied to
gas and candle flames are equally pertinent to these great cosmical
sources of light.

      SIR HENRY Hol.IAND, Bart. M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. President,
                                  in the Chair.
                     PROFESSOR TYNDALL, LL.D. F.R.S.
                 On Chemical Rays, and the Light of the Sky.
THE first physical investigation of any importance in which, jointly
with my friend Professor Knoblauch, I took part, bore the title, “The
Magneto-optic Properties of Crystals, and the Relation of Magnetism
and Diamagnetism to Molecular Arrangement.” This investigation
compelled me to reflect upon the structure of crystals, on their optical
properties in relation to that structure, and more particularly on the
striking phenomena exhibited by many of them in the field of a suffi
ciently powerful magnet. These were evidently due to the manner in
which the molecules of the crystals were built together by the force of
crystallization: and it was natural, if not necessary for me, to employ
such strength of imagination as I possessed in obtaining a mental
picture of this molecular architecture. The inquiry gave a tinge and
bias to my subsequent scientific thought, rendering, as it did, the con
ceptions and pursuit of molecular physics pleasant to me. Its influence
is to be traced in most of my scientific work. The first lecture, for
                     * “Philosophical Magazine, July, 1850.

430                              Professor Tyndall                         [Jam 15,
example, which I ever delivered in this theatre, was “ On the In<U+FB02>uence
of Material Aggregation on the Manifestations of Force ;” by “material
aggregation ” being meant the way in which, by nature or by art, the
particles of matter are arranged together. In 1853 I also published a
paper “On Molecular In<U+FB02>uences,” in which common heat was made
the explorer of organic structure. In the “Bakerian Lecture,” given
before the Royal Society in 1855, the same idea and phraseology crop
out. The Bakerian Lecture for 1864 bears the title “Contributions
to Molecular Physics.” And all through the investigations which
have occupied me during the last ten years, my wish and aim have
been to make radiant heat an instrument by which to lay hold of the
ultimate particles of matter.
      The labours now to be considered lie in the same direction. In
the researches just referred to, I employed tubes of glass and brass,
called, for the sake of distinction, “experimental tubes,” in which
radiant heat was acted upon by the gases and vapours subjected to
examination.      Wishing, two or three months ago, to render visible
what occurred within these tubes on the entrance of the gases or
vapours, I found it necessary to intensely illuminate their interiors.
The source of illumination chosen was the electric light; the beam of
which, converged by a suitable lens, was sent along the axis of the
tube. The dirt and <U+FB01>lth in which we habitually live were strikingly
revealed by this method of illumination. For, wash our tube as we
might with water, alcohol, acid, or alkali, until its appearance in
ordinary daylight was that of absolute purity, the delusive character
of this appearance was in most cases revealed by the electric beam.
In fact, in air so dirty as that which supplies our lungs-and I will
not say that we could get on healthily without the “ dirt ”’*—it is not
possible to be more than approximately cleanly.
      Vapours of various kinds were sent into a glass experimental tube
a yard in length, and about three inches in diameter. As a general
rule, the vapours were perfectly transparent; the tube when they were
present appearing as empty as when they were absent. In two or
three cases, however, a faint cloudiness showed itself within the tube.
This caused me a momentary anxiety, for I did not know how far, in
describing my previous experiments, actions might have been ascribed
to pure cloudless vapour which were really due to those newly
observed nebulae. Intermittent discomfort, however, is the normal
feeling of the investigator; for it drives him to closer scrutiny, to
greater accuracy, and often, as a consequence, to new discovery. It
was soon found that the nebulae revealed by the beam were also
generated by the‘ beam, and the observation opened a new door into
that region inaccessible to sense, which embraces so much of the
intellectual life of the physical investigator.
      What are those vapours of which we have been speaking ? They

in the animal economy we are as yet ignorant.

are aggregates of molecules, or small masses of matter, and every mole
cule is itself an aggregate of smaller parts called atoms. A molecule
of aqueous vapour, for example, consists of two atoms of hydrogen and
one of oxygen. A molecule of ammonia consists of three atoms of
hydrogen and one of nitrogen, and so of other substances. Thus the
molecules themselves inconceivably small, are made up of distinct
parts still smaller. When, therefore, a compound vapour is spoken of,
the corresponding mental image is an aggregate of molecules separated
from each other, though still exceedingly near, each of these being
composed of a group of atoms still nearer to each other. So much for
the matter which enters into our conception of‘ a vapour.‘i To this
must now be added the idea of motion. The molecules have motions
of their own as wholes; their constituent atoms have also motions of
their own, which are executed independently of those of the mole
cules; just as the various movements on the earth’s surface are
executed independently of the orbital revolution of our planet.
     The vapour molecules are kept asunder by forces which, virtually
or actually, are forces of repulsion. Between these elastic forces and
the atmospheric pressure under which the vapour exists, equilibrium
is established as soon as the proper distances between the molecules
have been assumed. If, after this, the molecules be urged nearer to
each other by a momentary force, they recoil as soon as the force is
expended. If by the exercise of a similar force they be separated
more widely, when the force ceases to act they again approach each
other. The case is different as regards the constituent atoms.
     And here let me remark that we are now upon the very outmost
verge of molecular physics; and that I am attempting to familiarize
your minds with conceptions which have not yet obtained universal
currency even among chemists ; which many chemists, moreover,
might deem untenable. But, tenable or untenable, it is of the highest
scienti<U+FB01>c importance to discuss them. Let us, then, look mentally
at our atoms grouped together to form a molecule. Every atom is
held apart from its neighbours by a force of repulsion ; why, then, do
not the mutually repellent members of this group part company ?
The molecules do separate from each other when the external pressure
is lessened or removed, but the atoms do not. The reason of this
stability is that two forces, the one attractive and the other repulsive,
are in operation between every two atoms ; and the position of every
atom-its distance from its fellows-is determined by the equilibra
tion of these two forces. If the atoms come too near, repulsion pre
dominates and drives them apart; if too distant, attraction predomi
mates and draws them together. The point at which attraction and
repulsion are equal to each other is the atom’s position of equilibrium.
    * Newton seemed to consider that the molecules might be rendered visible by

If not absolutely cold-and there is no such thing as absolute cold
ness in our corner of nature—the atoms are always in a state of
vibration, their vibrations being executed to and fro across their
positions of equilibrium.
    Into a vapour thus constituted, we have now to pour a beam of
light. But what, in the <U+FB01>rst instance, is a beam of light? It is a
train of innumerable waves, excited in, and propagated through, an
almost in<U+FB01>nitely attenuated and elastic medium, which <U+FB01>lls all space,
and which we name the Ether. These waves of light are not all of
the same size : some of them are much longer and higher than others.
Now the short waves and the long ones move with the same rapidity
through space, just as short and long waves of sound travel with the
same rapidity through air. Hence the shorter waves must follow each
other in quicker succession than the longer ones. The different rapid
ities with which the waves of light impinge upon the retina, or optic
nerve, give rise in consciousness to differences of colour. There are
however, numberless waves emitted by the sun and other luminous
bodies which reach the retina, but which are incompetent to excite the
sensation of light. If the lengths of the waves exceed a certain limit,
or if they fall short of a certain other limit, they cannot generate
vision. And it is to be particularly borne in mind that the capacity
to produce light does not depend so much on the strength of the waves,
as on their periods of recurrence. I have often permitted waves to
enter my own eye, of a power which, if di<U+FB01>'erently distributed, would
have instantly and utterly ruined the optic nerve, but which failed to
produce any impression whatever upon consciousness, because their
periods were not those demanded by the retina.
    The elements of all the conceptions with which we shall have
subsequently to deal are now in your possession. And you will observe
that though we are speaking of things which lie entirely beyond the
range of the senses, the conceptions are as truly mechanical as they
would be if we were dealing with ordinary masses of matter, and with
waves of sensible magnitude. I do not think that any really scienti<U+FB01>c
mind at the present day will be disposed to draw a substantial
distinction between chemical and mechanical phenomena. They
di<U+FB01>'er from each other as regards the magnitude of the masses involved;
but in this sense the phenomena of astronomy di<U+FB02>'er, also, from those
of ordinary mechanics. The main bent of the natural philosophy of
a future age will probably be to chasten into order, by subjecting it to
mechanical laws, the existing chaos of chemical phenomena.
    Whether we see rightly or wrongly—whether our intellection be
real or imaginary-—it is of the utmost importance in science to aim at
perfect clearness in the description of all that comes, or seems to
come, within the range of the intellect. For if we are right, clcarness
of utterance forwards the cause of right; while if we are wrong, it
ensures the speedy correction of error. In this spirit, and with the
determination at all events to speak plainly, let us deal with our con
ceptions of sether waves and molecules. Supposing a wave, or a train

  1869.]         on Chemical Rays, and the Light of the Slay.          433
  of waves,'to impinge upon a molecule so as to urge all its parts with
  the same motion, the molecule would move bodily as a whole, but
  because they are animated by a common motion there would be no ten
  dency of its constituent atoms to separate from each other. Di<U+FB02>‘erential
  motions among the atoms themselves would be necessary to effect a.
  separation, and if such motions be not introduced by the shock of the
  waves, there is no mechanical ground for the decomposition of the
  molecule.
      It is, however, di<U+FB01>icult to conceive the shock of a wave, or a train
  of waves, so distributed among the atoms as to cause no strain amongst
  them.    For atoms are of di<U+FB01>'erent weights, probably of different sizes;
  at all events it is almost certain that the ratio of the mass of the
  atom to the surface it presents to the action of the waves is different
  in different cases. If this be so, and I think the probabilities are
  immensely in favour of its being so, then every wave which passes
  over a molecule tends to decompose it-tends to carry away from
  their weightier and more sluggish companions those atoms which, in
  relation to their mass, present the largest resisting surfaces to the
  motion of the waves. The case may be illustrated by reference to a man
  standing on the deck of a ship. As long as both of them share equally
  the motions of the wind or of the sea, there is no tendency to separa
  tion. In chemical language, they are in a state of combination. But
  a wave passing over it <U+FB01>nds the ship less rapid in yielding to its
- motion than the man; the man is consequently carried away, and we
  have what may be regarded as decomposition.
      Thus the conception of the decomposition of compound molecules
  by the waves of :ether comes to us recommended by a priori proba
  bility. But a closer examination of the question compels us to sup
  plement, if not materially to qualify, this conception. It is a most
  remarkable fact, that the waves which have thus far been found most
  e<U+FB02>‘ectual in shaking asunder the atoms of compound molecules are
  those of least mechanical power. Billows, to use a strong comparison,
  are incompetent to produce effects which are readily produced by
  ripples. It is, for example, the violet and ultra-violet rays of the sun
  that are most effectual in producing these chemical decompositions;
  and, compared with the red and ultra-red solar rays, the energy of
  these “ chemical rays ” is in<U+FB01>nitesimal. This energy would probably
  in some cases have to be multiplied by millions to bring it up to that
  of the ultra-red rays; and still the latter are powerless where the
  smaller waves are potent. We here observe a remarkable similarity
  between the behaviour of chemical molecules and that of the human
  retina. The energy transmitted to the eye from a candle-<U+FB02>ame half
  a-mile distant is more than su<U+FB02>icient to inform consciousness; while
  waves of a different period, possessing twenty thousand million times
  this energy, have been suffered to impinge upon my own retina, with
  an absolute unconsciousness of any effect whatever-mechanical,
  physiological, chemical, or thermal.
      Whencc, then, the power of these smaller waves to unlock the

434                          Professor Tyndall                    [Jan. 15,
bonds of chemical union? If it be not a result of their strength, it I
must be, as in the case of vision, a result of their periods of recurrence.
But how are we to <U+FB01>gure this action ? I should say thus: the shock
of a single wave produces no more than an in<U+FB01>nitesimal effect upon
an atom or a molecule. To produce a larger effect, the motion must
accumulate, and for wave-impulses to accumulate, they must arrive in
periods identical with the periods of vibration of the atoms on which
they impinge. In this case each successive wave <U+FB01>nds the atom in a
position which enables that wave to add its shock to the sum of the
shocks of its predecessors. The effect is mechanically the same as
that due to the timed impulses of a boy upon a swing. The single
tick of a clock has no appreciable‘ effect upon the unvibrating and
equally long pendulum of a distant clock; but a succession of ticks,
each of which adds, at the proper moment, its in<U+FB01>nitesimal push to
the sum of the pushes preceding it, will, as a matter of fact, set the
second clock going. So likewise a single puff of air against the prong
of a heavy tuning-fork produces no sensible motion, and, consequently,
no audible sound ; but a succession of pu<U+FB01>'s, which follow each other
in periods identical with the tuning-fork’s period of vibration, will
render the fork sonorous. I think the chemical action of light is to
be regarded in this way. Fact and reason point to the conclusion that
it is the heaping up of motion on the atoms, in consequence of their
synchronism with the shorter waves, that causes them to part company.
 This I take to be the mechanical cause of these decompositions which
are effected by the waves of tether.
    And now let us return to that faint cloudiness, already mentioned,
from which, as from a germ, these considerations and speculations
have sprung. It has been long known that light effected the decom
position of a certain number of bodies. The transparent iodide of
ethyl, or of methyl, for example, becomes brown and opaque on
exposure to light, through the discharge of its iodine. The art of
photography is founded on the chemical actions of light; so that it is
well known that the effects for which the foregoing theoretic con
siderations would have prepared us, are not only probable, but actual.
    But the method employed in the experiments in which the
cloudiness above referred to was observed, and which consists simply
in offering the vapours of volatile substances to the action of light,
enables us not only to give such experiments a beautiful form, but
also to give a vast extension to the operations of light, or rather of
radiant force, as a chemical agent. It also enables us to illustrate in
our laboratories actions which have been hitherto performed only in
the laboratory of nature. A few of these actions of a representative
character I have now to bring before you; and, in doing so, I will
take advantage of the fact that, in a great number of cases, one or
more of the substances into which the waves of light break up
compound molecules are comparatively involatile. These products of
decomposition require a greater heat than is required by the vapours
from which they are derived to keep them in the gaseous form; and

1869.]         on Chemical Rays, and the Light of the Sky.           435
hence, if the space in which these new bodies are liberated be of the
proper temperature, they will not remain in the vaporous condition,
but will precipitate themselves as liquid particles, thus forming
visible clouds upon the beam to the action of which they owe their
existence.
    We will now commence our illustrative experiments. I hold in
my hand a little flask, F, which is stopped by a cork, pierced in two
places. Through one orifice passes a narrow glass tube, a, which ter
minates immediately under the cork; through the other orifice passes
a similar tube, b, descending to the bottom of the little flask, which is
filled to a height of about an inch with a transparent liquid. The
name of this liquid is nitrate of amyl, in every molecule of which we
have 5 atoms of carbon, 11 of hydrogen, 1 of nitrogen, and 2 of
oxygen. Upon this group the waves of our electric light will be
immediately let loose. The large horizontal tube that you see before
you is what I have called an “experimental tube;” it is connected
with our small flask, a stop-cock, however, intervening between
them, by means of which the passage between the flask and the
experimental tube can be opened or closed                             -
at pleasure. The other tube, passing                  -
through the cork of the flask and descend
ing into the liquid, is connected with a
U-shaped vessel, filled with fragments of
clean glass, covered with sulphuric acid.
In front of the U-shaped vessel is a narrow
tube stuffed with cotton-wool.   At one end             |
of the experimental tube is our electric                 |
lamp; and here, finally, is an air-pump, by               |
by means of which the tube has been ex-                   |
hausted. We are now ready for experi
ment.
    Opening the cock cautiously, the air                  |F
of the room passes, in the first place,                   |
through the cotton-wool, which holds back
the numberless organic germs and inor
ganic dust-particles floating in the atmo
sphere. The air, thus cleansed, passes into
the U-shaped vessel, where it is dried by
the sulphuric acid. It then descends
through the narrow tube to the bottom of
the little flask, and escapes there through
a small orifice into the liquid.    Through
this it bubbles, loading itself to some ex
tent with the nitrite of amyl vapour, and
then the air and vapour enter the experi
mental tube together.                             -
     The closest scrutiny would now fail to discover anything within
this tube; it is, to all appearance, absolutely empty. The air and the

436                          Professor Tyndall                  [Jan. 15,
vapour are both invisible. We will permit the electric beam to play
upon this vapour. The lens of the lamp is so situated as to render
the beam slightly convergent, the focus being formed in the vapour
at about the middle of the tube. You will notice that the tube
remainsQdark for a moment after the turning on of the beam; but the
chemical action will be so rapid that attention is requisite to mark
this interval of darkness. I ignite the lamp ; the tube for a moment
seems empty; but suddenly the beam darts through a luminous white
cloud, which has banished the preceding darkness. It has, in fact,
shaken asunder the molecules of the nitrite of amyl, and brought
down upon itself a shower of liquid particles which cause it to <U+FB02>ash
forth in your presence like a solid luminous spear. It is worth
while to mark how this experiment illustrates the fact, that however
intense a luminous beam may be, it remains invisible unless it has
something to shine upon. Space, though traversed by the rays from
all suns and all stars, is itself unseen.  Not even the rather which <U+FB01>lls
space, and whose motions are the light of the universe, is itself
visible.          ‘
    You notice that the end of the experimental tube most distant from
the lamp is free from cloud. Now the nitrite of amyl vapour is there
also, but it is unaffected by the powerful beam passing through it.
Let us make the transmitted beam more concentrated by receiving it
on a concave silver mirror, and causing it to return by re<U+FB02>ection into the
tube. It is still powerless. Though a cone of light of extraordinary
intensity now traverses the vapour, no precipitation occurs, no trace
of cloud is formed. Why? Because the very small portion of the
beam competent to decompose the vapour is quite exhausted by its
work in the frontal portions of the tube. The great body of the light
which remains, after this sifting out of the few effectual rays, has no
power over the molecules of nitrite of amyl. We have here, strikingly
illustrated, what has been already stated regarding the in<U+FB02>uence of
period, as contrasted with that of strength. For the portion of the
beam which is here ine<U+FB01>'ectual has probably more than a million times
the absolute energy of the e<U+FB02>‘ectual portion. It is energy specially
 related to the atoms that we here need, which specially related energy
 being possessed by the feeble waves, invests them with their extraor
 dinary power. When the experimental tube is reversed so as to bring
 the undecomposed vapours under the action of the ansifted beam, you
have instantly this <U+FB01>ne luminous cloud precipitated.
     The light of the sun also effects the decomposition of the nitrite
of amyl vapour. A small room in the Royal Institution, into which
the sun shone, was partially darkened, the light being permitted to
enter through an open portion of the window-shutter. In the track of
the beam was placed a large plane-convex lens, which formed a <U+FB01>ne
convergent cone in the dust of the room behind it. The experimental
tube was <U+FB01>lled in the laboratory, covered with a black cloth, and carried
into the partially darkened room. On thrusting one end of the tube
into the cone of rays behind the lens, precipitation within the cone

1869.]         on Chemical Rays, and the Light of the Sky.             437
was copious and immediate. The vapour at the distant end of the
tube was shielded by that in front; but on reversing the tube, a second
and similar splendid cone was precipitated.
    Now let us pause for a moment and glance at the ground over
which we have passed. We have de<U+FB01>ned a vapour as an aggregate
of molecules mutually repellent, but hindered from inde<U+FB01>nitely re
treating from each other by an external pressure. We have de<U+FB01>ned
a molecule as an aggregate of atoms maintained in positions of equi
librium by the equalized action of two opposing forces, and always
oscillitating to and fro across those positions. We have de<U+FB01>ned a
beam of light as a train of innumerable waves, and have illustrated
their chemical action. We have learned that it is not the magnitude
or power of the waves, so much as their periods of recurrence, that
renders them e<U+FB01>'ectual as chemical agents. We have also seen how
the luminous beam is sifted by the vapour which it decomposes, and
deprived of those rays which are competent to effect the decomposition.
The e<U+FB01>'ects, moreover, obtained with the electric beam are also produced
by the beams of the sun.                                '
    And here I would ask you to make familiar to your minds the idea
that no chemical action can be produced by a ray that does not involve
the destruction of the ray. But the term “ ray ” is unsatisfactory to
us at present, when our desire is to abolish all vagueness, and t0 a<U+FB01>ix
a de<U+FB01>nite physical signi<U+FB01>cance to each of our terms. Abandoning the
term ray as loose and inde<U+FB01>nite, we have to <U+FB01>x our thoughts upon
the waves of light ; and to render clear to our minds that those waves
which produce chemical action do so by delivering up their own
motion to the molecules which they decompose. We have here fore
stalled to some extent a question of great importance in molecular
physics, which, however, is worthy of being <U+FB01>xed more de<U+FB01>nitely in
your mind; it is this: When the waves of sether are intercepted by
a compound vapour, is the motion of the waves transferred to the
molecules of the vapour, or to the atoms of the molecules ? We have
thus far leaned to the conclusion that the motion is communicated to
the atoms; for if not to these individually, why should they be shaken
asunder? The question, however, is capable of, and is worthy of,
another test, the bearing and signi<U+FB01>cance of which you will immedi
ately appreciate.
    As already explained, the molecules are held in their positions of
equilibrium by their mutual repulsion on the one side, and by an ex
ternal pressure on the other. Their rate of vibration, if they vibrate
at all, must depend upon the elastic force which they mutually exert.
If this force be changed, the rate of vibration must change along with
it; and after the change the molecules could no longer absorb the
waves which they absorbed prior to the change. Now the elastic force
between molecule and molecule is utterly altered when a vapour passes
to the liquid state. Hence, if the liquid absorbs waves of the same
period as its vapour, it is a proof that the absorption is not effected by
the molecules. Let us be perfectly clear on this important point.

4338                        Professor Tyndall                  [Jan. 15,
Those waves are absorbed whose vibrations synchronize with those of
the molecules or atoms on which they impinge; a principle which is
sometimes expressed by saying that bodies radiate and absorb the same
rays. This great law, as you know, is the foundation of spectrum
analysis; it enabled Kirchhoff to explain the lines of Frauenhofer, and
to determine the chemical composition of the atmosphere of the sun.
If then, after such a change as that involved in the passage of avapour
to the liquid state, the same waves are absorbed as were absorbed
prior to the passage, it is a proof that the molecules, which must have
utterly changed their periods, cannot be the seat of the absorption;
and we are driven to conclude that it is to the atoms, whose rates of
vibration are unchanged by the change of aggregation, that the wave
motion is transferred. If experiment should prove this identity of
action on the part of a vapour and its liquid, it would establish in a
new and striking manner the conclusion to which we have previously
 leaned.
     We will now resort to the experimental test. In front of this ex
perimental tube; which contains a quantity of the nitrite of amyl
vapour, is placed a glass cell a quarter of an inch in thickness, <U+FB01>lled
with the liquid nitrite of amyl. I send the electric beam <U+FB01>rst through
the liquid and then through its vapour. The luminous power of this
beam is very great but it can make no impression upon the vapour.
The liquid has robbed it completely of its effective waves. I remove
the liquid ; chemical action immediately commences, and in a moment
we have the apparently empty tube <U+FB01>lled with this bright cloud, preci
pitated by one portion of the beam, and illuminated by another. I
re-introduce the liquid : the chemical action instantly ceases. I again
remove the liquid, and the action commences once more.         Thus we
uncover in part the secrets of this world of molecules and atoms.
     Instead of employing air as the vehicle by which the vapour is
carried into the experimental tube, we may employ oxygen, hydrogen,
or nitrogen. With hydrogen curious effects are observed, due to the
sinking of the clouds through the extremely light gas in which they
<U+FB02>oat. They illustrate, without proving, the argument of those who
say that the clouds of our own atmosphere could not <U+FB02>oat if the cloud
particles were not little bladders, instead of full spheres. Before you
is a tube <U+FB01>lled with the nitrite of amyl vapour, which has been carried
into the tube by hydrogen gas. On sending the beam through the
tube a delicate bluish-white cloud is precipitated. A few strokes of
the pump clear the tube of this cloud, but leave a residue of vapour
behind. Again turning in the beam we have a second cloud, more
delicate than the <U+FB01>rst, precipitated. This may be done half-a-dozen
times in succession. A residue of vapour will still linger in the tube
sui<U+FB01>cient to yield a cloud of exquisite delicacy, both as regards colour
and texture.
     Besides the nitrite of amyl a great number of other substances
might be employed, which, like the nitrite, have been hitherto not
known to be chemically susceptible to light. But I con<U+FB01>ne myself at

1869.]         on Chemical Rays, and the Light of the Sky.           439
present to this representative case. One point, however, in addition I
wish to illustrate, chie<U+FB02>y because the e<U+FB01>'eet is the same in kind as one
of great importance in nature. In our atmosphere you know <U+FB02>oats
carbonic acid gas, which furnishes food to the vegetable world. But
this food could not be consumed by plants and vegetables without the
intervention of the sun’s rays. And yet, as far as we know, these rays
are powerless upon the free carbonic acid of our atmosphere. The
sun can only decompose the gas when it is drunk in by the leaves of
plants. In the leaves it is in close proximity with substances ready
to take advantage of the loosening of the molecules of the carbonic
acid by the waves of light. Incipient disunion being introduced by
the solar rays, the carbon of the gas is seized upon by the leaf and
appropriated, while the oxygen is discharged into the atmosphere.
    The experimental tube now before you contains a quantity of a
di<U+FB02>'erent vapour from that which we have hitherto employed. The
liquid from which this vapour is derived is called the nitrite of butyl.
On sending the electric beam through the vapour, which has been
carried in by air, the chemical action is scarcely sensible. I add to
the vapour a quantity of air which has been permitted to bubble
through hydrochloric acid. When the beam is now turned on, so
rapid is the action and so dense the clouds precipitated, that you could
hardly by an e<U+FB01>'ort of attention observe the dark interval which pre
ceded the precipitation of the cloud.       This enormous augmentation
of the action is due to the presence of the hydrochloric acid. Like the
chlorophyl in the leaves of plants, it takes advantage of the loosening
of the molecules of nitrite of butyl by the waves of the electric light.
    In these experiments we have employed a luminous beam for two
di<U+FB02>'erent purposes. A small portion of it has been devoted to the
decomposition of our vapours, while the great body of the light has
served to render luminous the clouds resulting from the decomposition.
It is possible to impart to these clouds any required degree of tenuity,
for it is in our power to limit at pleasure the amount of vapour in our
experimental tube. When the quantity is duly limited, the precipitated
particles are at <U+FB01>rst inconceivably small, defying the highest micro
scopic power to bring them within the range of vision. Probably their
diameters might then be expressed in millionths of an inch. They grow
gradually, and as they augment in size, throw from them, by re<U+FB02>exion,
a continually increasing quantity of wave-motion, until, <U+FB01>nally, the
cloud which they form becomes so luminous as to <U+FB01>ll this theatre with
light. During the growth of the particles the most splendid irides
cences are often exhibited. Such I have sometimes seen with delight
and wonder in the atmosphere of the Alps, but never anything so
gorgeous as those which our laboratory experiments reveal. It is not,
however, with the irideseences, however beautiful they may be, that
We have now to occupy our thoughts, but with other e<U+FB01>'ects which bear
upon the two great standing enigmas of meteorology—the colour of
the sky and the polarization of its light.

440                          Professor Tyndall                    [Jan. 15,
   And   here let me briefly say that, were it not for the stimulus im
 parted  to me by the private correspondence of a celebrated man, I
 should   not have entered upon the investigation of these subjects so
 soon.   In reference to the effects of light which you have just wit
nessed, Sir John Herschel wrote to me thus:—“It is a class of
relations eminently calculated to set one thinking, and it seems to
 have had that effect upon you to excellent purpose. I am glad it
 has brought you into contact with the blue colour of the sky; still
more so if it should lead you to any satisfactory explanation of the
polarization of sky-light.”      The letter went on to treat of “this
 mysterious and beautiful phenomenon.” in a manner which excited
 in me the strong desire to throw, if possible, some certain light upon
 a question regarding which the most divergent opinions and specu
lations were afloat among our most eminent scientific men.
     First, then, with regard to the colour of the sky; how is it pro
duced, and can we not reproduce it 2 This colour has not the same
origin as that of ordinary colouring matter, in which certain portions
of the white solar light are extinguished, the colour of the substances
being that of the portion which remains. A violet is blue because its
molecular texture enables it to quench the green, yellow, and red con
stituents of white light, and to allow the blue free transmission. A
geranium is red because its molecular texture is such as quenches all
rays except the red. Such colours are called colours of absorption;
but the hue of the sky is not of this character. The blue light of the
sky is all reflected light, and were there nothing in our atmosphere
competent to reflect the solar rays we should see no blue firmament,
but should look into the darkness of infinite space. The reflection of
the blue is effected by perfectly colourless particles. Smallness of
size alone is requisite to ensure the selection and reflexion of this
colour. Of all the visual waves emitted by the sun, the shortest and
smallest are those which correspond to the colour blue. On such
waves small particles have more power than upon large ones, hence
the predominance of blue colour in all light reflected from exceedingly
small particles. The crimson glow of the Alps in the evening and in
the morning is due, on the other hand, to transmitted light; that is to
say, to light which in its passage through great atmospheric distances
has its blue constituents sifted out of it by repeated reflexion.
     It is possible, as stated, by duly regulating the quantity of
vapour, to make our precipitated particles grow from an infinitesimal
and altogether ultra-microscopic size to masses of sensible magnitude;
and by means of these particles, in a certain stage of their growth,
we can produce a blue which shall rival, if it does not transcend, that
of the deepest and purest Italian sky. Let this point be in the first
place established.     Associated with our experimental tube is a
barometer, the mercurial column of which now indicates that the tube
is exhausted.     Into the tube I introduce a quantity of the mixed air
and nitrite of butyl vapour sufficient to depress the mercurial column
one-twentieth of an inch; that is to say, the air and vapour together

1869.]        on Chemical Rays, and the Light of the Sky.            441
exert a pressure of one six-hundredth of an atmosphere. I now add
a quantity of air and hydrochloric acid sufficient to depress the
mercury half-an-inch further, and into this compound and highly
attenuated atmosphere I discharge the beam of the electric light.
The effect is slow; but gradually within the tube arises this splendid
azure, which strengthens for a time, reaches a maximum of depth and
purity, and then, as the particles grow larger, passes into whitish
blue. This experiment is representative, and it illustrates a general
principle. Various other colourless substances of the most diverse
properties, optical and chemical, might be employed for this experiment.
The incipient cloud in every case would exhibit this superb blue; thus
proving to demonstration that particles of infinitesimal size, without
any colour of their own, and irrespective of those optical properties
exhibited by the substance in a massive state, are competent to produce
the colour of the sky.
    But there is another subject connected with our firmament, of a
more subtle and recondite character than even its colour.        I mean
that “mysterious and beautiful phenomenon,” the polarization of
the light of the sky. The polarity of a magnet consists in its two
endedness, both ends, or poles, acting in opposite ways. Polar forces,
as most of you know, are those in which the duality of attraction and
repulsion is manifested. And a kind of two-sidedness—noticed by
Huygens, commented on by Newton, and discovered by a French
philosopher, named Malus, in a beam of light which had been reflected
from one of the windows of the Luxembourg Palace in Paris—receives
the name of polarization. We must now, however, attach a distinctness
to the idea of a polarized beam, which its discoverers were not able to
attach to it.   For in their day men's thoughts were not sufficiently
ripe, nor optical theory sufficiently advanced, to seize upon or express
the physical meaning of polarization. When a gun is fired, the ex
plosion is propagated as a wave through the air, The shells of air,
if I may use the term, surrounding the centre of concussion, are
successively thrown into motion, each shell yielding up its motion
to that in advance of it, and returning to its position of equilibrium.
Thus, while the wave travels through long distances, each individual
particle of air concerned in its transmission performs merely a small
excursion to and fro. In the case of sound, the vibration of the air
particles are executed in the direction in which the sound travels.
They are therefore called longitudinal vibrations. In the case of light,
on the contrary, the vibrations are transversal; that is to say, the
individual particles of aether move to and fro across the direction in
which the light is propagated. In this respect waves of light resemble
ordinary water-waves, more than waves of sound. In the case of an
ordinary beam of light, the vibrations of the aether particles are
executed in every direction perpendicular to it; but let the beam

 impinge obliquely, upon a plane glass surface, as in the case of Malus,
 the portion re<U+FB02>ected will no longer have its particles vibrating in all
 directions round it. By the act of re<U+FB02>exion,          it occur at the proper
 angle, the vibrations are all con<U+FB01>ned to a single plane, and light thus
 circumstanced is called plane polarized light.
      A beam of light passing through ordinary glass executes its vibra
 tions within the substance exactly as it would do in air, or in tether
 <U+FB01>lled space. Not so when it passes through many transparent crystals.
 For these have also their two-sidedness, the arrangement of their
 particles being such as to tolerate vibrations only in certain de<U+FB01>nite
 directions. There is the well-known crystal tourmaline, which shows
 a marked hostility to all vibrations executed at right angles to the axis
 of the crystal. It speedily extinguishes such vibrations, while those
 executed parallel to the axis are freely propagated. The consequence is,
 that a beam of light, after it has passed through any thickness of this
 crystal, emerges from it polarized. So also as regards the beautiful
 crystal known as Iceland spar, or as double doubly refracting spar.
 In one direction, but in one only, it shows the neutrality of glass;
 in all other directions it splits the beam of light passing through it
 into two distinct halves, both of which are perfectly polarized, their
 vibrations being executed in two planes, at right angles to each other.
      It is possible by a suitable contrivance to get rid of one of the
two polarized beams into which Iceland spar divides an ordinary
beam of light. This was done so ingeniously and effectively by a
man named Nicol, that the Iceland spar, cut in his fashion, is now
universally known as Nicol’s prism.          Such a prism can polarize a
beam of light; and if the beam, before it impinges on the prism, be
already polarized, in one position of the prism it is stopped, while in
another position it is transmitted. Our way is now, to some extent,
cleared towards an examination of the light of the sky. Looking at
various points of the blue <U+FB01>rmament through a Nicol’s prism, and
turning the prism round its axis, we soon notice variations of the
brightness of the sky. In certain positions of the spar, and from
certain points of the <U+FB01>rmament, the light appears to be wholly trans
mitted; while, looking at the same points, it is only necessary to turn
the prism round its axis through an angle of ninety degrees to
materially diminish the intensity of the light. On close scrutiny it
is found that the difference produced by the rotation of the prism is
greatest when the sky is regarded in a direction at right angles to
that of the solar rays through the air. Let me describe a few actual
observations made some days ago on Primrose Hill. The sun was
near setting, and a few scattered neutral-tint clouds, which failed to
catch the dying light, were <U+FB02>oating in the air. When these were
looked at across the track of the solar beams, it was possible byv
turning the Nicol round, to see them either as white clouds on a dark ~
ground, or as dark clouds on a bright ground.* In some of its’ posi
    "I I was not aware when these words were written that this observation was
made by the indefatigable Brewster.

    tions the sky-light was in great part quenched by the Nicol, and then
    the clouds, projected against the darkness of space, appeared white.
    Turning the Nicol ninety degrees round its axis, the brightness of the
    sky was restored, and then the clouds became dark through contrast
    with this brightness.
        Experiments of this kind prove that the blue light sent to us by
    the <U+FB01>rmament is polarized, and that the direction of most perfect
    polarization is perpendicular to the solar rays. Were the heavenly
    azure like the ordinary light of the sun, the turning of the prism
    would have no effect upon it; it would be transmitted equally during
    the entire rotation of the prism. The light of the sky is in great
    part quenched, because it is in great part polarized.
        When a luminous beam impinges at the proper angle on a plane
    glass surface it is polarized by re<U+FB02>exion. It is polarized, in part,
   by all oblique re<U+FB02>exions; but at one particular angle, the re<U+FB02>ected
   light is perfectly polarized. An exceedingly beautiful and simple
   law, discovered by Sir David Brewster, enables us readily to <U+FB01>nd
   the polarizing angle of any substance whose refractive index is known.
   This law was discovered experimentally by Brewster ; but the Wave
   Theory of light renders a complete reason for the law. A geome
   trical image of it is thus given. When a beam of light impinges
   obliquely upon a plate of glass it is in part re<U+FB02>ected and in part
   refracted. At one particular incidence the re<U+FB02>ected and the refracted
   portions of the beam are at right angles to each other. The angle of
   incidence is then the polarizing angle. It varies with the refractive
   index of the substance; being for water 521}, for glass 57%, and for
   diamond 68 degrees.
        And now we are prepared to comprehend the di<U+FB01>iculties which
   have beset the question before us. It has been already stated that in
   order to obtain the most perfect polarization of the <U+FB01>rmamental light,
   the sky must be regarded in a direction at right angles to the solar
   beams. This is sometimes expressed by saying that the place of
   maximum polarization is at an angular distance of 90° from the sun.
   This angle, enclosed as it is between the direct and re<U+FB02>ected rays,
   comprises both the angles of incidence and re<U+FB02>exion. Hence the
   angle of incidence, which corresponds to the maximum polarization of
   the sky, is half of 90°, or 45°. This is the atmospheric polarizing
   angle, and the question is, what known substance possesses an index
' of refraction to correspond with this polarizing angle? If we knew
   this substance, we might be tempted to conclude that particles of it,
   scattered in the atmosphere, produce the polarization of the sky.
   “ Were the angle of maximum polarization,” says Sir John Herschel,
   “ 76° (instead of 90°), we should look to water, or ice, as the re<U+FB02>ecting
  body, however inconceivable the existence in a cloudless atmosphere,
 ' and a hot summer day, of unevaporated particles of water.” But a
   polarizing angle of 45° corresponds to a refractive index of 1; this
   means that there is no refraction at all, in which case we ought to
   have no re<U+FB02>exion.      Brewster and others came to the conclusion that
                                                               2 I 2

the reflexion was from the particles of air themselves. Dr. Ruben
son, of Upsala, made the angle enclosed between the direct and
reflected beams 90° 2'; “the half of which,” says Mr. Buchan, in his
excellent little ‘Handy Book of Meteorology, “is so near the
polarizing angle of air, as to leave no doubt that the light of the sky,
as first stated by Brewster, is polarized by reflexion from the
particles of air.” It is difficult to affix a physical meaning to this
conclusion. If light be reflected, it must be at the common limiting
surface of two media of different refrangibility. But to satisfy the
law of Brewster, as Sir John Herschel remarks, “the reflexion would
have to be made in air upon air!” “The more the subject is con
sidered,” adds the celebrated philosopher last named, “the more it
will be found beset with difficulties, and its explanation, when arrived
at, will probably be found to carry with it that of the blue colour of
the sky itself.”
      If you doubt the wisdom, acknowledge, at all events, the faith in
your capacity which has caused me to bring a subject so entangled
before you. I believe, however, that even the intellect which draws
its strength and its associations from a totally different source, may
have its interest excited in subjects like the present, dark and difficult
though they be. I do not expect that you will all grasp the details
of this discussion; but I think that everybody present will see the
extremely important part hitherto played by the law of Brewster in
speculations as to the colour and polarization of the sky. This law
leads to the extraordinary conclusion already announced, that the
reflexion takes place at the limiting surface of two media of the same
 refrangibility, where reflexion could no more occur than it could
occur in the very heart of an optically homogeneous medium." I shall
now seek to demonstrate in your presence, firstly, and in conformation
of our former experiments, that sky-blue may be produced by exceed
ingly minute particles of any kind of matter; secondly, that polariza
 tion identical with that of the sky is produced by such particles; and
 thirdly, that matter in this fine state of division, where its particles are
probably small in comparison with the height and span of a wave of
 light, releases itself completely from the law of Brewster; the direction
 of maximum polarization being absolutely independent of the polariz
ing angle as hitherto defined. Why this should be the case, the wave
theory of light, to make itself complete, will have subsequently to
 explain.
      Into this experimental tube, in the manner already described, I
introduce a vapour which is decomposable by the waves of light. The
     * I am here taking for granted that the polarizing angle of 45° established
by observation is rigidly correct. With regard to the reflexion which accompanies
atmospheric refraction, inasmuch as the rays are incident upon a convex surface,
or upon a series of concentric convex surfaces, the reflected light is dispersed in
space instead of reaching the eye of the observer. Such reflexion, moreover, even
to an eye in space, would not account for the colour of the sky, nor probably
 for the quantity of its light.

mixed air and vapour are su<U+FB02>icient to depress the mercurial column
one inch. I add to this mixture air, which has been permitted to
bubble through dilute hydrochloric acid, until the column is depressed
thirty inches : in other words, until the tube is full. And now I
permit the electric beam to play upon the mixture. For some time
nothing is seen. The chemical action is doubtless progressing, and
condensation going on; but the condensing molecules have not yet
coalesced to particles suf<U+FB01>ciently large to re<U+FB02>ect sensibly the waves of
light. As before stated—and the statement rests upon an experimental
basis—the particles here generated are at <U+FB01>rst so small that their
diameters would probably have to be expressed in millionths of an
inch; while to form each of these particles whole crowds of molecules
are probably aggregated. Helped by such considerations, the intellec
tual vision plunges more profoundly into atomic nature, and shows us,
among other things, how far we are from the realization of Newton’s
hope that the molecules might one day be seen by microscopes. While
I am speaking, you observe this delicate blue colour forming and
strengthening within the experimental tube. No sky-blue could exceed
it in richness and purity; but the particles which produce this colour
lie wholly beyond our microscopic range. A uniform colour is here
developed, which has as little breach of continuity-—which yields as
little evidence of the particles concerned in its production-—as that
yielded by a body whose colour is due to true molecular absorption.
This blue is at <U+FB01>rst as deep and dark as the sky seen from the highest
Alpine peaks, and for the same reason. But it grows gradually brighter,
still maintaining its blueness, until at length a whitish tinge mingles
with the pure azure ; announcing that the particles are now no longer
of that in<U+FB01>nitesimal size which re<U+FB02>ects the shortest waves alone?“
     The liquid here employed is the iodide of allyLT but I might
choose any one of a dozen substances here before me to produce the
effect. You have seen what may be done with the nitrite of butyl.
With nitrite of amyl, bisulphide of carbon, benzol, benzoic tether, &c.
the same blue colour may be produced. In all cases where matter
slowly passes from the molecular to the massive state, the transition
is marked by the production of the blue. More than this :—you have
seen me looking at the blue colour (I hardly like to call it a blue
“cloud,” its texture and properties are so di<U+FB01>'erent from ordinary
clouds) through this bit of spar. This is a Nicol’s prism, and I could
wish one of them to be placed in the hands of each of you. Well,
this blue that I have been regarding turns out to be, if I may use the
expression, a bit of more perfect sky than the sky itself. When I look
across the illuminating beam exactly as we look across the solar rays
in the atmosphere, I obtain not only partial polarization, but perfect
polarization. In one position of the Nicol the blue light seems to

pass unimpeded to the eye; in the other it is absolutely cutoff, the
experimental tube being reduced to optical emptiness.        Behind the
experimental tube it is well to place a black surface, in order to pre
vent foreign light from troubling the eye. In one position of the
Nicol this black surface is seen without softening or quali<U+FB01>cation ; for
the particles within the tube are themselves invisible, and the light
which they re<U+FB02>ect is quenched. If the light of the sky were polarized
with the same perfection, on looking properly towards it through a
Nicol we should meet, not the mild radiance of the <U+FB01>rmament, but the
unillumined blackness of space.
     The construction of the Nicol is such that it permits to pass
through it vibrations which are executed in a certain determinate
direction, and these only. All vibrations executed at right angles to
this direction are completely stopped: while components only of those
executed obliquely to it are transmitted. It is easy, therefore, to see
that from the position in which the Nicol must be held to transmit or
to quench the light of our incipient cloud, we can infer the direction
of the vibrations of that light. You will be able to picture those
vibrations without di<U+FB01>iculty. Suppose a line drawn from any point
of the “ cloud ” perpendicular to the illuminating beam. The particles
of tether along that line, which carry the light from the cloud to the
eye, vibrate in a direction perpendicular both to the line and to the
beam. And if any number of lines be drawn in the same way from
the cloud, like the spokes of a wheel, the particles of aether along all
of them oscillate in the same manner. Wherefore, if a plane surface
be imagined cutting the incipient cloud at right angles to its length,
the perfectly polarized vibrations discharged laterally will all be
parallel to this surface. This, in fact, is the plane of vibration of the
polarized light. Or you may suppose a circle drawn round the experi
mental tube, and a series of strings attached to various points of this
 circle. If all the cords be stretched as perpendiculars to the experi
mental tube, and caused to wriggle by a series of jerks imparted at
right angles both to them and to the tube, the motion of the particles
 of the strings will then represent those of the particles of aether. A
 distinct image of those vibrations is now, I hope, within the reach of
 every person here present.
     Our incipient blue cloud is a virtual Nicol’s prism, and, between it
 and the real Nicol, we can produce all the effects obtainable between
 the polarizer and analyzer of a polariscope. When, for example, a
 thin plate of selenite, which is crystallized sulphate of lime, is placed
 between the Nicol and the incipient cloud, we obtain the splendid
 chromatic phenomena of polarized light. The colour of the gypsum
 plate, as many of you know, depends upon its thickness. If this be
 uniform, the colour is uniform. If, on the contrary, the plate be
 wedge-shaped, thickening gradually and uniformly from edge to back,
 we have brilliant bands of colour produced parallel to the edge of the
 wedge. Perhaps the best form of plate for experiments of this character
 is that now in my hand, which was prepared for me some years ago by

1869.]         on Chemical Rays, and the Light of the Sky.              447
a man of genius in his way, the late Mr. Darker of Lambeth. It con
sists of a plate of selenite thin at the centre, and gradually thickening
towards the circumference. Placing this film between the Nicol and
the cloud, we obtain, instead of a series of parallel bands, a system of
splendidly coloured rings. The colours are most vivid when the
incipient cloud is looked at perpendicularly. Precisely the same
phenomena are observed when we look at the blue firmament in a
direction perpendicular to the solar rays.
    We have thus far illuminated our incipient cloud with ordinary
light, and found the portion of this light reflected laterally from the
cloud in all directions round it to be perfectly polarized.        We will
now examine the effects produced when the light which illuminates
the cloud is itself polarized. In front of the electric lamp, and be
tween it and the experimental tube, is placed this fine Nicol's prism,
which is sufficiently large to embrace and to polarize the entire beam.
The prism is now placed so that the plane of vibration of the light
emergent from it, and falling upon the cloud, is vertical. How does
the cloud behave towards this light 2 This formless aggregate of infi
nitesimal particles, without definite structure, shows the two-sidedness
of the light in the most striking manner. It is absolutely incompetent
to reflect upwards or downwards, while it freely discharges the light
horizontally, right and left. I turn the polarizing Nicol so as to render
the plane of vibration horizontal; the cloud now freely reflects the
light vertically upwards and downwards, but it is absolutely incompe
tent to shed a ray horizontally to the right or left.
    Fix your attention upon one of those reflecting particles. Figure
it as a little sphere with the beam of the electric light impinging
upon it. Let us call that diameter which coincides with the direction
of the beam, the axis of the sphere; one of its poles would then be
turned towards the light, and the other in the opposite direction.
The equator of the little sphere would of course be midway between
its poles. Now, conceive a parallel of latitude drawn upon the
sphere at an angular distance of 45 degrees from the pole; that is to
say, midway between the pole and the equator. Then what occurs
with ordinary light is this: all the vibrations tangent to the little
circle, which I have called a parallel of latitude, are reflected perfectly
polarized; but all vibrations executed at right angles to the circle go
unreflected through the little sphere. If, instead of ordinary light,
we use polarized light, it is clear that at two opposite points of the
little circle the vibrations are executed along the tangents, while at two
other opposite points they are executed at right angles to the tangents.
In the former case the particle reflects the light, in the latter it
transmits the light unreflected. What is true of a single particle is
true of all, and hence the inability of the incipient cloud formed of
such particles to reflect light in two directions, while it freely reflects
it in two others. The entire facts are now placed before you. The
reflecting particle and the waves of aether are of course both beyond
the range of the senses, but to the intellect the conceptions here intro

448                         Professor Tyndall                    [Jam 15,
duced are just as easy as if, in illustration, I had pointed to the poles,
equator, and parallel of latitude of an ordinary terrestrial globe.
    Suppose the atmosphere of our planet to be surrounded by an
envelope impervious to light, with an aperture on the sunward side,
through which a solar beam could enter and cross our atmosphere.
Surrounded on all sides by air not directly illuminated, the track of
the sunlight would resemble that of the electric beam in a dark space
<U+FB01>lled with our incipient cloud. The course of the sunbeam would
be blue, and it would discharge laterally, in all directions round it,
light in precisely the same polarized condition as that discharged
from the incipient cloud. In fact, the azure revealed by the sunbeam
would be the azure of such a cloud. And if, instead of permitting
the ordinary light of the sun to enter the aperture, a Nicol’s prism
were placed there, which should polarize the sunlight on its entrance
into our atmosphere, the particles producing the colour of the sky
would act precisely like those of our incipient cloud. In two direc
tions we should have the solar light re<U+FB02>ected; in two others unre<U+FB02>ected.
In fact, out of such a solitary beam, traversing the unilluminated air,
we should be able to extract every e<U+FB02>'ect shown by our incipient cloud.
In the production of such clouds we virtually carry bits of the sky
into our laboratories, and obtain with them all the effects obtainable
in the open <U+FB01>rmament of heaven.
    And here, had not a su<U+FB01>icient strain been already imposed upon
your minds, I might enter upon the description of a series of extra
ordinary e<U+FB01>'ects observed when the particles of our incipient clouds
are allowed to augment in size, so as to approach the condition of true
cloudy matter. The selenite ring-system, already referred to, is a
most delicate reagent for the detection of polarized light. When we
look normally, or perpendicularly, at an incipient cloud, the colours of
the rings are most vividly developed, a diminution of the colour being
immediately apparent when the incipient cloud is regarded obliquely.
But let us continue to look through the Nicol and selenite normally
at the cloud: the particles augment in size, the cloud becomes coarser
and whiter, the strength of the selenite colours becoming gradually
feebler. At length the cloud ceases to discharge polarized light
along the normal, and then.the selenite colours entirely disappear.
If new the cloud be regarded obliquely, the colours are restored, very
vividly, if not with their <U+FB01>rst vividness and clearness. Thus the
cloud that has ceased to discharge polarized light at right angles to
the illuminating beam, pours out such light copiously in oblique
directions. The direction of maximum polarization changes with the
texture of the cloud.
    But this is not all; and to understand, even partially, what remains,
a word must be said regarding the appearance of the colours of our
plate of selenite. If, as before stated, the plate be of uniform thick
ness, its hue in polarized light is uniform. Suppose, then, that by
arranging the Nicol the colour of the plate is raised to its maximum
brilliancy, and suppose the colour produced to be green; on turning

1869.]        on Chemical Rays, and the Light of the Sky.            449 '
the Nicol round its axis the green becomes fainter. When the angle
of rotation amounts to 45 degrees the colour disappears; we then pass
what may be called a neutral point, where the selenite behaves, not
as a crystal, but as a bit of amorphous glass. Continuing the rotation,
a colour reappears, but it is no longer green, but red. This attains
its maximum at a distance of 45 degrees from the neutral point, or, in
other words, at a distance of 90 degrees from the position which
showed the green at its maximum. At a further distance of 45 degrees
from the position of maximum red, the colour disappears a second
time. We have there a second neutral point, beyond which the green
comes again into view, attaining its maximum brilliancy at the end
of a rotation of 180 degrees.    By the rotation of the Nicol, therefore,
through an angle of 90 degrees, we produce a colour complementary to
that with which we started.
    As may be inferred from this result, the selenite ring-system
changes its character when the Nicol is turned. It is possible
to have the centre of the circle dark, the surrounding rings being
vividly coloured. The turning of the Nicol through an angle of 90
degrees renders the centre bright, while every point occupied by a
certain colour in the <U+FB01>rst instance is occupied by the complement of
that colour in the second. But what am I aiming at in these long
preliminary statements ‘2 I want to be able to say, with full assurance
of being understood by everybody present, that a cloud may so alter
its texture as to produce upon light an effect equivalent to the rotation
of the Nicol through 90 degrees.      By curious internal actions, not
here to be described, the cloud in our experimental tube sometimes
divides itself into sections of different textures. Some sections are
coarser than others, while it often happens that some are iridescent
to the naked eye, and others not. Looking normally at such a cloud
through the selenite and Nicol, it often happens that in passing from
section to section the whole character of the ring-system is changed.
You start with a section producing a dark centre and a corresponding
system of rings; you pass to another section through a neutral
point, and <U+FB01>nd in that section the centre bright, and at the same radial
distances <U+FB01>nd each of the <U+FB01>rst rings displaced by one of the comple
mentary colour. Sometimes as many as four such reversions occur in
the cloud of an experimental tube a yard long. Now, the changes
here indicated mean that in passing from section to section of the
cloud the plane of vibration of the polarized light turns suddenly
through an angle of 90 degrees; this change being entirely due to the
di<U+FB02>'erent texture of the two parts of the cloud.
    You will now be able to understand, as far as it is capable of being
understood, a very beautiful effect which, under favourable circum
stances, might be observed in our atmosphere. This experimental
 tube contains an inch of the iodide of allyl vapour, the remaining
29 inches necessary to <U+FB01>ll the tube being air, which has bubbled
through aqueous hydrochloric acid. Besides, therefore, the vapour of
iodide of allyl, we have those of water and of acid within the tube.

The light has been acting on the mixture for some time, a beautiful
incipient blue cloud being formed. As before stated, the “incipient
cloud” is wholly di<U+FB01>'erent in texture and optical properties from an
ordinary cloud; but it is possible to precipitate the aqueous vapour
within this tube so as to cause it to form a cloud similar to the clouds
of our atmosphere. This new and real cloud will be precipitated in
the midst of the azure of the incipient cloud. An exhausted vessel of
about one-third of the capacity of the experimental tube is now con
nected with the tube, the passage uniting both being closed by a stop
cock. On opening this cook the mixed air and vapour will rush from
the experimental tube into the empty vessel; and, in consequence of
the chilling due to rarefaction, the vapour in the experimental tube
will fall together as a true cloud. You are now prepared for the expo
riment. I <U+FB01>rst look at this blue colour, so as to obtain a vivid ring
system with a dark centre. Turning on the cook, the air is rare<U+FB01>ed
and the cloud precipitated. What is the result? Instantly the centre
of the system of coloured rings becomes bright, and the whole series
of colours corresponding to de<U+FB01>nite radial distances, complementary.
While I continue to look at the cloud, it gradually melts away as an
atmospheric cloud might do in the azure of heaven. And there is our
azure also remaining behind. The coarser cloud seems drawn aside
like a veil, the blue reappears, the <U+FB01>rst ring-system, with its dark
centre and correspondingly coloured circles, being restored.
    Thus patiently and bravely you have accompanied me over apiece
of exceedingly di<U+FB01>icult ground; and I think as a prudent'guide, we
ought to halt upon the eminence we have now attained. We might
go higher, but the boulders begin here to be very rough. At a future
day we shall, I doubt not, be able to overcome this difficulty, and to
reach together a greater elevation.

      SIB. HENRY HOLLAND, Bart. M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. President,

                    JAMES Fnneusson, Esq. F.R.S.
On Tree and Serpent Worship, as exempli<U+FB01>ed by some recently discovered
                            Indian Monuments.
Tun speaker introduced the subject by explaining the di<U+FB01>iculties which
arose in treating of it, partly in consequence of the reckless manner
in which a certain class of antiquaries had theorized regarding
Serpent-worship, but more because, as a result of this, all the better
class of critics had been deterred from meddling with what had
become the laughing-stock of sober-minded persons, in consequence of
the absurdities which had been engrafted upon it. Except one work,
by Bottiger, on the ‘ Baumkultus der Hellenen,’ no serious work had
been published in Germany, bearing on the subject; while in France
nothing had appeared. in elucidation of the worship of either the
Serpent or of Trees.                          -
     The case was different in this country: a whole literature had
sprung up, dating from the visit of King James I. to Stonehenge in com
pany with his architect, Inigo Jones; and from‘ their time, Dr. Stukeley,
Colt Hoare, Geoffrey Higgins, Bathurst Deane, and many others,
had published volume after volume on the subject. Almost all-these
works had, however, been based on a passage in the 29th book of
Pliny’s ‘Natural History,’ in which he related the formation of an
“Angm'num” or serpent-egg, by an assembly of snakes on a certain
day, adding that the egg was considered an important charm by the
 Druids. On this slender basis, Stonehenge, Avebury, and all the
megalithic temples of Britain, were called Druidic, and Serpent-worship
admitted as the established faith of our forefathers. It was in vain to
hope to attack successfully such a castle in the air, unless some new
and tangible evidence could be brought to bear on the subject. This,
however, has now fortunately reached us from India, and the object
of this evening’s discourse is to explain its form and relevance.
     The <U+FB01>rst monument bearing on the subject was the Temple of
 Nakhon Vat, in the centre of the now desolate country of Cambodia,
 which was discovered about ten years ago, almost accidentally, by a
 French traveller, M. Muhot. It is probably not too much to say,
 that, taken altogether, it is probably the most remarkable temple in
 Asia, being one of the largest, and is unsurpassed by any in the extent

454                          Mr. Fergussorl                   [Feb. 5,
and the beauty of its form, and the marvellous elaboration of its
sculptural details. On examination it was found that this temple was
erected, by an Indian colony from Taxila, as late as the 13th century
of the Christian era, and was dedicated wholly to the worship of the
Serpent.
    The next piece of evidence was brought to light even more acci
dentally. While looking for objects to cast for the Paris Exhibition
of 1867, a large collection of sculptures in white marble were disco
vered buried under rubbish of all sorts in the stables of Fife House,
then occupied as a temporary museum attached to the India O<U+FB01>‘ice.
On examination, it was found that these had been sent home some
twelve years ago, by Sir Walter Elliot, having been principally exca
vated by him from the Amravati Tope, a building of the 4th century,
situated about 60 miles from the mouth of the Kistnah river in the
Zillah Guntoor.
    The building to which these marbles belonged was originally
enclosed by a circular screen 195 feet in diameter, or exactly double
the dimensions of the corresponding screen at Stonehenge, the height
of the two circles being very nearly the same. Within this was a
procession-path, 12 feet in width, and then an inner screen only 6
feet in height, but even more elaborately ornamented with carvings
than the outer enclosure. The interior of the Tope inside these
two circles was occupied by a number of buildings, all of which have
been destroyed, and their materials used by a local Rajah in building
the town of Amravati, at the end of the last century.
    On examination, it was found that the Tope had been erected in
the 4th century, and was in all essentials a Buddhist monument; but
its sculptures proved that the worship of the seven-headed Naga, or
Serpent-god, was nearly as important and as prevalent when it was
erected as that of Buddha himself. Another circumstance. nearly as
unexpected, was that the worship of the Tree was equal in dignity to
that of the Serpent-the three forming a trinity for which we were
by no means prepared.
    The next piece of evidence which came to light was in the form of
a series of photographs of the Sanchi Tope, near Bhopal, in Central
India, made by Lieut. Waterhouse, and a still more interesting series
of drawings of the sculptures of the same monument by Lieut.-Col.
Maisey.
    The sculptures of this monument are earlier than those of the
Amravati Tope, and date from the <U+FB01>rst century of our era. In them
Buddha himself never appears as an object of worship, though the
monument is essentially Buddhist. The Serpent is worshipped, but
only occasionally; but the Tree is the prevailing and prominent object
of adoration.
    The light thrown on the subject by the examination of these three
typical examples was so distinct and clear, that many minor indica
tions which had hitherto been overlooked were now found to bear
directly on the subject; and the general result was to prove what had

1869.]                  on Tree and Serpent Worship.                     455
only before been suspected,“E which was, that before the preaching of
Gautaina Buddha, or Sakya Muni, who died 543 13.0., the prevailing
worship of the aboriginal tribes of India was Tree and Serpent wor
ship ; that the former was tolerated by Buddha-—the latter abolished;
but in later times, when the prophet’s in<U+FB02>uence became weaker, that
the two had cropped up again, and had, in later times, so obscured as
nearly to obliterate the reforms he had introduced.
    Mr. Fergusson then proceeded to point out what he believed to be
the key to half the problems of Indian mythology or art: this was,
that the country was now, and had in all historical times been,
inhabited by two perfectly distinct and separate races of men. One
aboriginal, so far as known, and of distinctly Turanian race ; the other,
Aryans, who migrated into India some 2000, or it may be 3000 years
before the Christian era, and who, down at least to the 7th century B.o.
completely dominated the aboriginal races.
    The language of the Aryans was Sanscrit-their religion that of
the Vedas ; and it may be asserted, almost without limitation, that all
the literature of India belongs to this great family of mankind; but
like Aryans all over the world, they had no great feeling for art, and
erected no permanent buildings.
    The aboriginal Turanians, on the other hand, had no literature, but
an innate love of art, and built as instinctively as bees. Their religion,
like that of all similar races, was ancestral. They had no distinct idea
of a future state, but supplied its place by metempsychosis; and, as
before stated, their principal outward symbols of worship were Serpents
and Trees.
    The religion which Buddha taughtwas not a reform of the Vedic faith
of the Aryans, but a re<U+FB01>nement of the less intellectual religion of the
Turanians. Serpent-worship was abolished, and with it human sacri
<U+FB01>ces, to be replaced by the utmost tenderness towards all living things ;
but Tree-worship was not only tolerated, but encouraged; the ancestral
tumulus became a relic shrine; ascetics were formed into monastic
communities; and, what is even more important for our present pur
poses, simultaneously with this upraising of a Turanian race, men
began to erect permanent buildings in India. There does not, so far
as we now know, exist in all India a single building or any carved
stone that dates from the days of Aryan supremacy; but 300 years
after the death of Sakya Muni, Asoka, then emperor of India, did for
Buddhism what Constantine did for Christianity 600 years afterwards.
He made it the religion of the state; and with him begins also the
history of lithic architecture in that country. The old caves that
belong to this age, and all those down at least to the Christian era,
are literal copies of wooden forms; and it is not till after the time of
the Sanchi’s gateways, which were erected in the <U+FB01>rst century after
Christ, that the architecture ceases to be mere imitative carpentry,
and becomes appropriate to masonic forms.

  456                          Mr. Fergusson                      [Feb 5,
       These propositions were illustrated by diagrams on the walls, taken
  principally from tho Sanchi and Amravati Topes, to which the speaker
  frequently referred as illustrating this branch of his subject.
       Having established these points in so far as India was concerned,
  the speaker then turned to the forms which this worship had assumed
  among the Turanian races in other parts of the world.
       The earliest written notice of the worship of Trees and Serpents
  is that contained in the 2nd and 3rd chapters of Genesis. With the
  knowledge we now possess on this subject, it appears reasonable to
  assume that the curse therein recorded on the Serpent was not against
  the reptile as such, but the expression by a Semitic people of their
  abhorrence of what they considered a degrading superstition, which
  it was necessary should be anathematized and swept away in order to
  make way for the purer and higher worship of Jehovah, which it was
  the great object of the writers of the Pentateuch to introduce. In so
  far as the Jews were concerned the abolition seems to have been suc
  cessful; but when they come in contact with the Canaanites it again
  crops up occasionally. As, for instance, when the Lord is said to have
  appeared to Moses in a <U+FB02>ame, issuing from a sacred tree, on which
  occasion the prophet’s rod was turned into a Serpent. A still more
  remarkable instance was that of the brazen Serpent, which Moses
' erected in the desert to cure the Israelites from the bites they were
  suffering from. Though we lose sight of this image for a while, it
  appears that the Jews burnt incense and made o<U+FB02>'crings to it down to
  the time of Hezekiah, and that it was during these 600 years kept
  in the temple with the Asherahs or Groves, which were the symbolical
   trees of this form of worship. It reappeared after the time of Christ
   in the form of the sects of Ophites; and, in so far as we can trust
   coins, prevailed in all the cities of Asia Minor in which the seven
   churches were <U+FB01>rst established.
        Both forms apparently prevailed in Babylon, but only Tree-worship
   has been found in Assyria; while in ancient Egypt the adoration
   of the Serpent apparently only formed one item in that wonderful
   pantheon of animal worship which formed so singular and so marked
   a part of their mythology.
        In Greece we <U+FB01>nd a history and mythology precisely analogous
   to what we <U+FB01>nd in India. An old Turanian race of Pelasgi, with
   ancestral, and Tree and Serpent worship, superseded by an Aryan race
   symbolized by the return of the Heracleidaa, and all whose earlier
   myths represent either the prevalence of this form of worship or the
   struggles of the immigrant Aryan races to suppress it. When once
   they had attained the political supremacy, however, the Hellenes seem
    to have become more tolerant.
        The Pythonic oracle at Delphi was adopted conjointly with the
   Druidic oracle of Dodona, as the principal sanctuary of the country.
    The oldest temple of the Acropolis at Athens was erected to enshrine
   the tree of Minerva, which was given in charge to the serpent Erectho
    nice. But still more remarkable than these was the worship of

1869.]                 on Tree and Serpent Worship.                 457
Esculapius in the form of a serpent in the grove at Epidaurus, which
prevailed till after the Christian era. Among the demigods and heroes
the Serpent association was as frequent as with the greater deities,
as is exempli<U+FB01>ed by the stories of Cecrops, Jason, Theseus, Hercules,
Agamemnon, and generally with the Homeric fables.
    Rome borrowed her Esculapian serpent-worship apparently from
Epidaurus, though Italy had a centre of that faith at Lanuvium, and
it afterwards became so favourite a form under the Empire that the
number of tame Serpents became a positive nuisance.
    The Germans apparently worshipped Trees, but never Serpents;
but in Scandinavia, the Finns and Lapps and other Turanian tribes
brought with them both Tree and Serpent worship to such an extent,
that notwithstanding the long supremacy of Northmen of a different
race, both Trees and Serpents were worshipped in Esthonia as in
Scandinavia in the last century, and the faith as exhibited in the
Edda is as near a counterpart of what is found further East, as could
well be expected considering the distances of the places and the very
different channels through which the description reaches us.
    From Scandinavia the faith seems to have reached the north-east
coast of Scotland, but not to have penetrated south of the Forth in
that direction. Its traces are very few and indistinct south of the
Tweed, and what are found seem to have come by a more southern
route from some other source.      Both the Welsh and the Irish, how
ever, have many traditions of Serpent-worship, which, if treated
reasonably, might throw much light on the subject; but except the
legend of the Virgin Keyna, at Stanton Drew, they are at present all
of the vaguest form.
    Leaving these indistinct traces to fade into the western ocean, the
speaker next pointed to Africa as the great centre of Tree and Serpent
worship of the present day. The faith of the kingdom of Dahomey,
on the Gold Coast, is essentially the adoration of Trees and Ser
pents, accompanied by ancestral worship and human sacri<U+FB01>ces, and
female soldiers. In fact, Africa preserves in full vigour and per
fection at the present day all those characteristics which we see only
dimly re<U+FB02>ected in the myths of other nations.
    In the new world, too, the worship of the Serpent-apparently there
connected with that of the sun-certainly prevailed extensively before
that continent was discovered by Columbus; and with forms so like
many of those found in Asia that frequent attempts have been made
to prove that what we find there is a form of Buddhism.    This cannot,
 however, be sustained; but it certainly appears to be a form of that
primawal faith on which Buddhism was based and out of which it
arose in India.
    In conclusion, the speaker pointed to certain forms of Dolmens,
stone circles, menhirs, and such like rude stone monuments, found
in India, identical in form and purpose with those found in Africa, in
Brittany, and nearly all over the world wherever a Turanian people
can be traced. These are not necessarily old, though some of them

limits of this century, and are undistinguishable from the older ex
amples; showing how persistent certain forms of faith are when once
adopted by certain races of mankind. Among these theTuranians are
certainly the most instinctive and least progressive of any.
    It is this last fact which gives unity while it adds interest to the
whole subject. In Tree and Serpent worship We have the oldest
known form of faith and belonging to the most ancient people of
whose existence we have any knowledge. It is now found generally
in a nearly fossil state underlying the Semitic and Aryan strata
which have been superimposed upon it. Occasionally, however, it
crops up in out-of-the-way corners of the world, fresh and vigorous,
and tells a strange tale of the persistent unchangeableness of certain
races of mankind and still more strange irradicability of certain forms
of superstitious faith.

                      On the Coast Defences of England.
IN bringing to your notice the subject for our consideration this
evening, I will <U+FB01>rst brie<U+FB02>y refer to the coast defences of former times,
and then endeavour to explain the principles of defence which are
being adopted in this country at the present day.
    In the earlier periods of English history our Anglo-Saxon fore
fathers were exposed to the frequent predatory incursions of the
Northmen and the Danes, who, starting from the shores of Norway
and Denmark, sailed round the coasts of England, ascended the
navigable rivers, ravaged and‘laid waste the surrounding country, and
then returned with their booty to their ships; and during the fre
quent wars waged by our Norman and Plantagenet kings with the
sovereigns of France, the shores of England were subject to attacks
by the French, which differed but little in character from the pre-
datory incursions of the Northmen.
    The precautions taken by our ancestors to guard against such
attacks are thus described by Holinshed :—“ The custome of the coun
tries adioining neere to the sea is, especiallie in time of warre, on eueri'e
hill or high place to erect a beacon, with a. great lanterne on the top,
which may be seen and discerned a great space off, and ‘when the noise

  1869.]             on the Coast Defences of England.                  459
  is once bruted that the enimies approch neere the land, they suddenlie
  put <U+FB01>re in the lanterne, and make shouts and outcries from towne to
  towne and from village to village. Some run in post from place to
  place, admonishing the people to be readie to resist the jeopardie and
  defend the perill. And by this policie the fame is soon blowne t0
  euerie citie and towne, insomuch that as well the citizens as the
  rurall people be in short space assembled and armed to repell and
  put broke the newly arrived enimies.”
      But though these precautions su<U+FB02>ieed to repel small predatory
  attacks, they were incapable of resisting anything like a national
  invasion; and the attacks of our foreign enemies were generally
  successful whenever they were made upon a su<U+FB02>icient scale. For
  instance, Dover was taken and partly burnt by the French under
  Montmorenci in 1296; and in 1339 the same nation took and sacked
  Portsmouth in retaliation for the English attack upon Boulogne.
  In the following year the French ravaged all the southern coasts of
  England during the absence of Edward III. in Flanders, destroyed
  several ships at Hastings, reduced the greater part of the town of
  Southampton to ashes, and burnt Plymouth nearly to the ground. In
  1377, the French attacked the town of Rye and the Isle of Wight, and
  made great havoc at Hastings, Portsmouth, Dartmouth, and Plymouth;
  and three years later they pillaged Winchelsea, and several other
  towns. in 1405, a large French force was landed at Milford Haven,
  and before the army sent by our Henry IV. could reach the spot, the
  French had plundered Garmarthen and some other towns, and had
  safely regained their ships.
      Fortunately, however, the progress of civilization has introduced
  better usages into the practice of modern war, and it is not necessary
  now to provide against such plundering expeditions. In fact, the
  length of our coast is far too great, and the accessible points are far
  too numerous, to render it possible to fortify them all. When we
  speak then in the present day of our “Coast Defences,” we must not
  be understood to advocate a vain attempt to secure by defensive works
  every vulnerable point; we mean to apply the term only to the means
  which it is necessary to provide for the protection of our national
  dockyards and arsenals, and of our main commercial ports.
      We are sometimes told that the idea of fortifying these important
  points of our coasts is “ un-English ; ” but if it be so, we ceased to be
  English some 330 years ago, when extensive forti<U+FB01>cations were erected
  along our coasts by King Henry VIII. During the <U+FB01>rst years of
' that monarch’s reign, his attention was attracted to the facility with
  which the French effected some landings on the coasts of Sussex. He
  had also been struck by the success of the French in their campaigns
  on the ‘Continent in the <U+FB01>fteenth century, when their superiority in
  artillery turned the tide in their favour; and at a later period, when
           quarrelled with

had moued and stirred divers great princes and potentates of Christen
dome to invade the realme of England.” ' Thereon King Henry gave
his anxious consideration to the question how best to fortify the most
important points of the coast; and the steps he took for that purpose
were such as might have been expected from his energetic character.
He himself rode to inspect a considerable portion of the coast, sent
his counsellors to survey all the ports and exposed places, caused forts
and bulwarks to be erected, ordered general musters to be made, and
armour and weapons to be “ seen and viewed.”
     Lord Herbert of Oherbury, in his life of Henry VIII., tells us
that “all these preparations being made against a danger which was
believed imminent, seemed so to excuse the King suppressing of the
abbeys, as the people (willing to spare their own purses) began to suffer
it easily: especially when they saw order taken for building divers
forts and bulwarks on the sea coasts.”
     In the State Papers, I <U+FB01>nd an interesting letter from Sir Antony
Knyvet to the king, dated October, 1541, highly extolling the new
fortress at Portsmouth, then recently erected; and begging the king
to take an early opportunity of inspecting the plans of that great
work; thus indicating that King Henry took a personal interest even
in the details of his forti<U+FB01>cations. The king’s attention had previously
been strongly drawn to the progress in the science of artillery. Mr.
Froude, in his ‘History of England,’ observes that Henry VIII. was
one of the <U+FB01>rst men to foresee and value the power of artillery; he
tells us that Sebastiniani mentions experiments in the range of guns
which were made by the king in Southampton Water; and he adds
that “ when the history of artillery is written, the labours of
Henry VIII. in that department must not be forgotten.”
     During the reigns of Edward VI. and of Mary the subject of
coast defence was almost entirely lost sight of. Not only was nothing
done to extend, but scarcely anything was done to maintain the works
constructed by King Henry. It was not until Queen Elizabeth came
to the throne that public attention was again directed to the question.
     At this time (1559) England being actually at war with the
second power in the world, the whole naval force in commission
amounted to seven coastguard vessels —the largest of which was only
of 120 tons—and of eight small merchant ships altered for <U+FB01>ghting.
Of ships in harbour <U+FB01>t for service there were but nine, of from 200 to
800 tons, with twelve sloops and boats. In artillery, the destitution
was even more pitiable. Of cannon (48-pounders) and “demi-cannon”
(24-pounders), in all the dockyards, there were but thirty which
were reported sound, with 200 culverins (12-pounders), minions
(3-pounders), and falconets. As for the troops, a certain Captain
Turner, who was sent to command at Portsmouth, where he was in
daily expectation of a visit from the French, reported to Cecil “that
they
ill    were
    that man's
             all head
                  grown  to misorder
                      could  imagine.” and mischief, and to the greatest ‘

    There is a quaint letter written in 1587 by Lord Sussex to the
Council, in which he complains among other things that the platform
of the round tower at Portsmouth was so old and rotten that on the
day of Her Majesty's coronation he “ durst not shoot off the piece.”
The forts at Gravesend and Tilbury were in no better plight; for
we <U+FB01>nd in a letter from Walsingham to Leicester, dated July, 1588
(the Armada almost in sight), that at Tilbury and Gravesend he
could not <U+FB01>nd a single platform on the ground or aloft that was <U+FB01>t to
bear any “ ordinance.”
    The country was, however, now aroused to a conviction of the
necessity for taking active steps towards improving the state of the
defences, and we now hear for the <U+FB01>rst time of a system of batteries
for the defence of the Medway, and, a few years later, of permanent
forti<U+FB01>cations at Milford Haven. Orders were also given for the repair
and arming of minor works at Rye, Eastbourne, Hastings, &c.
    It would take too much of your time to dwell upon the measures
for the minor improvement of our defences which were undertaken
during the succeeding reigns; and I will pass on to the year 1666,
when there was war with France, Denmark, and Holland, and when
the House of Commons, to quote the words of Macaulay, “readily
voted sums unexampled in our history ” towards putting the country
into a state of defence. This period appears especially interesting, as
showing the course pursued when our <U+FB02>eet, as Macaulay describes it,
existed only upon paper, and when our enemies had the command of
the sea.
    The chief engineer of this time, Sir Bernard de Gomme, was a man
well <U+FB01>tted for such an emergency, and under his superintendence
every effort was made to place the country in a state of defence.
    At Portsmouth, the old mud walls which had been constructed
by King Henry VIII. had fallen into decay, and new lines were
ordered and executed. The chief portion of the work, which is
substantially the same as is now known as Portsmouth Lines, was
completed in July, 1667. The lines of Gosport, which formerly only
enclosed the town of Gosport itself, though designed and actually
commenced at this time, were not completed for many years after.
The forti<U+FB01>cations of the Isle of Wight were jealously examined,
and by the strenuous exertions of all concerned, the whole position
was put into so excellent a state of defence, that we <U+FB01>nd by inter
cepted letters from the Dutch Admirals De Ruyter and De Witt,
dated July, l667—mark this—-that they were deterred by the strength
of Portsmouth and the Island from making their intended attack.
At Plymouth'the citadel on the Hoe was built, and at Dover, Wey
mouth, Dartmouth, and the Scilly Isles the forti<U+FB01>cations were also
strengthened. Sheerness was forti<U+FB01>ed now, and Pepys in his diary
tells us that the king and the Duke of York went to Sheerness to see
the ground which Sir Bernard de Gomme had staked out for the new
fort there. The works, however, were not completed soon enough to

  prevent its guns being captured by the Dutch <U+FB02>eet under Admiral
  Ruyter in 1667, as they swept up the Medway to Chatham. The
  defences of Gravesend, Tilbury, and Woolwich, were also strengthened,
  and the city of London granted a loan of 10,0001. for building forti<U+FB01>
  cations on the Thames and Medway. The castles of Deal, Walmer,
  and Sandown had turf laid on their walls, but it is written of Sandwich
  that “the chief magistrates there kept to their old trade of disagreeing,
  and have left off fortifying themselves.”
      Along the east coast too, the indefatigable Sir Bernard found
  scope for his energies, and at Harwich works were constructed by
  him, which repulsed the attack of the Dutch <U+FB02>eet in July, 1667. In
. the north, forti<U+FB01>cations were either erected or repaired at Tynemouth,
  Scarborough, Bridlington Quay, and Hull.
      Doubtless at other places works were erected or strengthened at
  this juncture ; but the foregoing are the principal that were executed
  up to the date of the peace which was concluded between England
  and her foreign enemies in the autumn of 1667.
      Nothing further appears to have been undertaken in the construc
  tion of coast defences until the middle of the reign of Queen Anne,
  when an invasion of England was projected by the King of France
  on behalf of the Pretender. This project received both the pecuniary
  help and the prayers of the Pope ; and great preparations were made
  for the extension of our forti<U+FB01>cations, so far as the purchase of the
  necessary lands is concerned. Large quantities were taken under
  acts of Parliament, at Portsmouth (for the Portsea Lines, &c.), at
   Harwich, and at Chatham; but with the exception of one fort at
   Portsmouth, I do not <U+FB01>nd that works were commenced at any of these
   places until nearly <U+FB01>fty years afterwards.
       The next works of importance were constructed during the reign
   of George II.—viz., the lines at Chatham and Devonport, which were
   commenced towards the end of the reign of that monarch. An
   extension of the forti<U+FB01>cations at Gosport, batteries on the South
   sea shore, and a small work since replaced by Fort Cumberland,
   were erected at about the same time. Batteries were also ordered on
   sundry points in Milford Haven, and at several points along the south
   coast; the cause for all these preparations being, as cited in the
   preamble of the Act 31 Geo. 11., cap. 39, “the unjust and hostile
   invasion made on His Majesty’s dominions in America and the
   Mediterranean, and great preparations made in France for invading
   these realms.”
       Towards the middle of the reign of George III., when the Duke
   of Richmond was Master-General of the Ordnance, and during the
   French Revolutionary War, still further additions were made to our
   coast defences. At Portsmouth, Portsea Lines were built, Fort Cum
   berland was entirely reconstructed, the old Hilsea Lines were thrown

 1869.]             on the Coast Defences of England.                 463
 up, and the western defences were extended by the construction of
 Fort Monckton ; a few batteries were also erected for the defence of
 Stokes Bay. About this time, also, Sheerness Lines were constructed,
 and the works at Dover were largely added to. Numerous small
 earthworks were also built at this juncture at various parts of the
 English coast; but they were allowed to fall into decay after the war.
 At Plymouth, large quantities of land were acquired at various parts
 in the vicinity of the town and dock for the erection of Devonport
 Lines ; and amongst other works which were now constructed was the
 line of redonbts and barracks which occupy the position known as the
 Maker Heights. Pitt (who took a great interest personally in these
 questions) intended to have erected a citadel on Maker Heights;
 but he was defeated by a majority of one (the Speaker’s casting vote)
 in a proposal for the further extension of our forti<U+FB01>cations at Ports
 mouth and Plymouth.
     After this, for half a century, we acted like the magistrates of
 Sandwich, and “left off fortifying ourselves.” Men indulged in
dreams of universal peace, which were, however, rudely dispelled by
the great Crimean war.
     Now we come to the e<U+FB02>‘orts of the present generation, and never
has there been a time when it has been so di<U+FB01>icult to deal with ques—
 tions of defence.
     The introduction of steam, of ri<U+FB02>ed guns, then of iron-clad ships,
which rendered necessary the construction of artillery of enormous
power; these are the conditions with which we have had to deal
during the last few years, and it may be con<U+FB01>dently asserted we are
second to no other nation, if we are not‘ superior to all, as regards the
steps taken to meet present requirements, in every department of coast
defence.
     I will now proceed to consider the principles which should guide
us in the defence of this country in the present day.
     Since the periods of which I have been speaking, the British
empire has been greatly extended, and the demands upon our resources
have become proportionably enlarged. For the general defence of so
vast an empire, we must <U+FB01>rst of all and mainly depend upon our
seagoing <U+FB02>eet. It is to-the <U+FB02>eet we must look for our <U+FB01>rst line of
defence against invasion of this country, to maintain our communica
tions with our foreign possessions, and to protect our commerce and
our interests generally both at home and abroad.
    But the bases on which our naval power must rest are the ports,
dockyards, and arsenals, in which our <U+FB02>eets and squadrons are har
boured, coaled, and re<U+FB01>tted.    Thus we have naval establishments at.
Portsmouth, Plymouth, Ghatham, and Pembroke, at home; at Ber
muda, Malta, Gibraltar, and several other places abroad. These
places are the roots from which our naval power springs, and they

   464                           Col. W. F. D. Jervoia                    [Feb 12,
   require special protection against attacks that may be made upon
   them, during the absence of our <U+FB02>eet, either by hostile'naval forces
   alone, or by combined naval and military expeditions.
       If our navy could be kept up in sufficient strength to meet the
   navies of other nations at all points where hostile <U+FB02>eets or cruisers
   might attack us, questions about attack upon- these naval arsenals
   would be disposed of)“                       .
       Very little re<U+FB02>ection and calculation, however, are necessary to
   show that the resources even of this country, whether in money or in
   seamen, would not admit of our maintaining such enormous naval
   means as would, of themselves, su<U+FB02>ice to defend these sources of our
   naval strength, and at the same time to protect our commerce, or to
   prevent an enemy from either landing on our shores or attacking our
   widely scattered commercial ports, whether at home or abroad.
       Even if it were possible that a <U+FB02>eet su<U+FB02>icient to ful<U+FB01>l all these
   duties could be maintained, such an application of the resources of
   the nation would lead to an expenditure of public money far exceed
   ing that which would su<U+FB01>ice for the defence of the country with the
   aid of other means. The <U+FB01>rst cost of such a navy would be enor
   mous, and would have to be repeated every twenty or thirty years, and
   the expense for maintenance would be great and continual.
       Further, if the several sections of our navy were employed for the
 ‘ protection of the arsenals whence they are maintained, we should be
   using the <U+FB02>eet to maintain the dockyards instead of the dockyards to
   maintain the <U+FB02>eet ; and each of the sections of our navy thus scattered
   over the world would be liable to be overpowered by the concentrated
   forces of the enemy.
       Other defences besides the navy are, therefore, essential for these
   nurseries of the <U+FB02>eet.

                                     water, andattack.
                                        naval                             .
                                                  big mines below wafer, placed, of
' course, at the proper distance in advance of the object to be protected.
       Booms of timber, rafts, chains, or nets, might also be used for
   obstructing channels ; but the attention that has been given during the
   last few years to the application of submarine mines has rendered
   these passive obstructions of minor importance.
       To proceed then to consider active obstructions, or mines below
   water—
       These are now, in most cases, necessary to obstruct the passage of
   ships, and to keep them under the <U+FB01>re of the guns above water, and
   have become of especial importance since iron armour has been

   repeated from a lecture given by me at the United Service Institution in June,

applied to the sides of ships, and thus these vessels of war have become
 most vulnerable at their bottom.
     There are two classes of these mines-—one, exploded by mechanical
contrivances, the other exploded by electricity.
     Those exploded by mechanical means should be of a size to con
tain about 150 lbs. of powder. They are much less costly than the
others, and can be placed in position more expeditiously ; they could
moreover be applied in any number, but they are inapplicable in
positions where it is necessary to keep the channel open to friendly
vessels.
    In such cases, electric torpedoes must be used. These admit of a
friendly vessel passing over them in safety, and of a ship in chase
being sunk by the completion of the electric circuit.
    Their charges would be about 1000 lbs. of gunpowder, or about
400 lbs. of gun-cotton, and would ensure the destruction of a ship by
their explosion, not merely when immediately over them, but if even
any portion of her were within forty or <U+FB01>fty yards of their position.
    It used to be the fashion, even amongst professional men, in this
country, to consider this mode of defence as being incapable of prac
tical application; but of late years a very different opinion has
prevailed, and the effective application of submarine mines, used in
conjunction with forts and <U+FB02>oating-batteries, is of immense importance,
not only in connection with forti<U+FB01>cations, for the defence of our great
naval stations, but also for our minor ports, and for the protection of
all places on the seaboard.
    Foreseeing the important part that submarine mines would play
in coast defences, I had the honour of proposing to Lord de Grey, in
 1862, that a special committee should be appointed to consider and
report upon the question of their application to defence of‘harbours.
     Lord de Grey at once recognized the importance of such an in
quiry, and appointed a committee, which, after prolonged investiga
tion and experiment, has made a most valuable and interesting report
upon the subject.
    We are now in a position to apply this system of defence to any
extent that may be required for the protection of our harbours and
other points upon our coasts ; and we are much indebted to the com
mittee for the thoroughly practical results which we are now enabled
to attain in this important and inexpensive element of national de
fence.
    The question is sometimes asked,—-Whether the application of
submarine mines will not render unnecessary the employment of forts
and batteries for defence against naval attack?
    Forts and batteries, however, are still required in all important
cases to cover the torpedoes and prevent their being tampered with.
It must also be remembered that whilst the submarine mine is harm
less unless the ship comes near it, the shot from the battery can injure
the ship whatever may be her position within effective range.

466                       001. W. F. D. Jervois                   [Feb. 12,
    Further, although probably our harbours might be efficiently ob
structed by torpedoes in at from seven to fourteen days’ notice, yet one
condition is that the weather should be su<U+FB02>iciently favourable to allow
them to be exactly laid. There are, again, certain positions where,
even if the torpedoes are laid, they might be disturbed by a violent
storm, and, possibly, an attack on the positions in which they were to
serve might take place before they could be renewed; and though the
periods of the year at which these di<U+FB02>iculties might arise are short,
yet the bare possibility of interference in the application of a complete
torpedo system prevents our placing entire reliance on such a defence
for the protection of places on which the warlike power of the nation,
both for offence and defence, must in a great measure depend. There
fore, although submarine mines are a most important element in the
defence of our harbours and coasts, and add greatly to the power of
our forts to resist a naval attack, they must not be regarded as sub
stitutes for permanent works of defence at our naval arsenals and
harbours, and other important ports.
    To proceed now to consider the employment of big guns above
water. These with all the numerous accessories for their service
must be placed in positions so protected and arranged as to give them
a decided superiority over the artillery of assailing ships.
    The question then arises whether they shall be placed a<U+FB02>oat in
strongly protected vessels, 1'. e. in <U+FB02>oating-batteries; or at <U+FB01>xed points
either on land or on shoals, i. e. in forts.
    It is often said, “Why don’t you protect your ports by <U+FB02>oating
batteries alone?”    The same reasons, however, as have been before
adduced against the employment of our sea-going navy, prevent our
employing special <U+FB02>oating-batteries alone for this object.
    Such a system would necessitate our maintaining at each of our
chief ports a naval squadron, su<U+FB02>iciently powerful to resist the attack
of the superior force of the enemy. Then again arise the questions,
“What is a su<U+FB01>‘iciently powerful force to maintain at each point for this
object; what would be its <U+FB01>rst cost; in how many years will it be
necessary to repeat the outlay for it ; what will be the expense of its
annual maintenance ? ”
    It is impossible to examine these questions without arriving at
the conclusion that even if our resources in money and in seamen
rendered it practicable to maintain such a force in addition to our
sea-going navy, the defence of our ports can be effected much more
efficiently and economically with the aid of other means.
    Irrespective, however, of the question of the expense of providing
for coast defence by <U+FB02>oating-batteries alone, very little consideration
is requisite to understand that if there be positions on land from
whence an effective <U+FB01>re can be brought to bear on the channel,
anchorage, or shore to be defended, there is no object in placing the
guns in vessels a<U+FB02>oat.
    In positions such as I have referred to, there cannot be any object

1869.]              on the Coast Defences of England.                467
in substituting an unsteady platform—on which the amount of protec
tion that can be afforded is limited by considerations inherent to
floating structures, and which is liable to be taken away or to be sunk
—for a fixed and perfectly steady platform on shore, which can be fully
protected, either against its fire being silenced, or from capture by an
enem V.
     # cases, however, where the distance between forts is so great
that the intervening space cannot be properly commanded by their
fire, or where it may be necessary to have advanced batteries of
artillery at a distance from the shore, and where foundations for
fixed works cannot be obtained without expense and difficulty dis
proportioned to the object, it becomes necessary to employ floating
defences.
     In short, we must, in each case, consider—
     1. Whether we can provide for the defence by forts without floating
batteries.
     2. If not, to what extent floating defences should be applied in
conjunction with forts. And
     3. Whether the circumstances are such as to render it advisable
to employ floating-batteries in substitution of forts.
     The question is not one, as it is often put, of “floating-batteries
versus forts.” There is no “versus” in the matter. Both are required
in their proper places.
     The question of the kind of floating-battery to be employed for
harbour defence has from time to time been much discussed.
     Ten years ago, at my suggestion, a committee was appointed by
 General Peel to consider the subject. Admiral Cooper Key, Colonel
 Wilmot, R.A., and myself were the members of this committee. We
 then recommended the employment for harbour defence of small
 vessels, each carrying a fixed iron tower for four guns, and provided
 with eight ports. It is curious how nearly this vessel approached the
 “Monitor’ type first used in the memorable fight at the mouth of the
 James river, in America, with the ‘Merrimac, in 1862.        I believe it
 is generally admitted that the ‘Monitor” class of vessel is the best
 kind of armour-clad floating-battery for coast defence; but amidst the
 many projects for floating structures for defence now advocated, it
 would be presumptuous for me to give any decided opinion on this
 subject. In some cases iron-clad “Monitors, supplemented by a mos
 quito squadron of gun-boats, might be employed, and, to oppose
 unarmoured cruisers or privateers to the attacks of which alone the
 less important harbours would be liable, small gun-boats of light
 draught in conjunction with submarine mines would alone suffice.
 I take this opportunity of showing a model of a small gun-boat for
 one gun, proposed by Mr. Rendle, of the Elswick Ordnance Company,
 in consultation with Admiral Cooper Key, which appears admirably
 well adapted for the small class of vessels for harbour defence.

 468                 '     Col. W. F. 1). Jervois               [Feb 12,
     I now pass on to consider the defence of our great naval arsenals,
 in the event of an enemy obtaining a footing on our shores.
     We maintain a large military force of regulars, reserves, militia,
 and volunteers, and thereby admit the possibility of a campaign taking
 place in this country.
     The landing of a hostile army on our coasts must be admitted to be
 a dii<U+FB01>cult operation; but it would, to say the least, be very unwise if
 we were to conclude that invasion is impossible because it is di<U+FB01>‘icult.
     It must be assumed that the main object of an enemy in an inva
 sion would be to get to London; for by doing so he would not only
 occupy the commercial heart of the empire and the seat of govern
 ment, but the main military arsenal of the empire at Woolwich would
 also fall into his hands.
     Supposing him to have obtained a footing on shore, and to be
 advancing on London, we interpose between him and his object the
 regular army, in conjunction with the armed and organized manhood
 of the country, more or less disciplined, and aided by such temporary
 defences as could be thrown up at the time of expected attack. But
 as the best disciplined and the greater part of our military forces
‘must be employed to cover the capital, we must arrange our plan of
 defence so that as few disciplined troops as possible may be necessary
 for the defence of other points in the country which must be defended,
 but which cannot be covered by the operations of the main army.
     Portsmouth and Plymouth, for instance, are therefore defended on
 the land side by the aid of forti<U+FB01>cations which will enable a compara
 tively small number of partially disciplined forces, with the aid of a
 few regular troops, to protect those places against capture or bombard
 ment, whilst the main army would be employed in the defence of
 London and Woolwich.                                      -
     A mistake is commonly made that because the places I refer to are
 forti<U+FB01>ed, the garrisons of those places must be largely increased. The
 case is precisely the reverse. Even if all the outer line of forts to
 landward at either Portsmouth or Plymouth were fully manned at the
 same time (which would be quite unnecessary, not more than one-half
 need be fully manned at the same time), only between 6000 and 7000
 men would be required for the purpose at each place respectively, and
 only a very small portion of these need be regular troops. The
 remainder of the garrisons would consist of a movable force, which
 in any case we must have for the defence of these places, but which in
 the absence of the forts must be of su<U+FB02>icient strength and sufficiently
 disciplined to meet the enemy in the open <U+FB01>eld, whilst with the forts it
 maybe comparatively small in number, and only disciplined to take
 up a <U+FB01>ghting position, under the support of the works, as that part of
 the forti<U+FB01>ed line assailed.
      Unforti<U+FB01>ed, an enemy would only have to detach about 15,000 or
 20,000 men from the main invading army to e<U+FB01>‘ect in a few days the
 destruction of all our ships and naval establishments at Portsmouth ;
 forti<U+FB01>ed, he must employ an army of at least three times that number,

1869.]             an the Coast Defences of England.                 469
and must have a considerable time at his disposal to undertake a
regular siege.
     Unforti<U+FB01>ed, no force that, in the case referred to, we could afford
for the garrisons of these places could protect either against the attack
of 15,000 regular troops; forti<U+FB01>ed, there is no di<U+FB02>iculty in providing
the numbers and description of troops that would be capable of making
a good defence of these nurseries of the navy.
     Unforti<U+FB01>ed, they at once fall if an enemy were to obtain a decisive
victory over the army in the <U+FB01>eld; forti<U+FB01>ed, they remain in our
hands even under such untoward circumstances, and thus enable us
to avert the destruction of our naval power at a period when all the
resources of the country will be required to enable us to retrieve
the position temporarily lost.
    A few words in conclusion. We are often told that these works are
unproductive, and so in one sense they are; but who shall say what
effect permanent measures of defence may have upon the position of
this nation ? I verily believe they tend to peace and to the develop
ment of the prosperity of England.
    But we are met with other objections. It is commonly said that
there is no use in constructing permanent forti<U+FB01>cations, because the
inventions of one age render useless the efforts of the previous
generation. History, however, does not support this statement. At
this moment we are turning to account, and with good effect, works
erected by Ilenry VIII. more than three centuries ago. In like
manner, works constructed in the time of Charles II. and in the reigns
of George II. and George III. form parts of the system of forti<U+FB01>ca
tions we are adopting at the present day.
     Then we are told that these measures are so extravagant. The fact,
however, is that, by the aid of forti<U+FB01>cations, we are enabled to defend
the empire with fewer troops and a smaller navy than would otherwise
be necessary, and that they thus tend greatly to economy. If we are
to make provision for defence at all, it is only by the aid of forti
 <U+FB01>cations that we can have an economical system of defence.
     They say then, that our forti<U+FB01>cations “lock up” troops. I have
 shown you that, on the contrary, they enable us to utilize our auxiliary
 forces and to set the regular army free.        .
     But again, we are told that we ought to depend upon our navy;
 but the main purpose of the forti<U+FB01>cations is to enable the navy to do
its duty effectively. The navy is without doubt the arm on which
we must mainly depend; but that is no reason why we should tie it
down to our side ! ~
     Lastly, they say, “An enemy won’t go near these forti<U+FB01>cations.”
 My reply is, that that is the very object for which they are pro
 vided.
     To sum up.     The truth is, that to provide an e<U+FB02>icient system of
 defence at the least cost to the state, the sailor, the soldier, and the

military engineer must each occupy his proper place. The navy and
the army are the vital principle of defence; and fortified arsenals and
harbours are the centres of refuge and action for both. Take away
fortifications, and you are unable to turn your auxiliary forces to
proper account; you leave an army insufficient for the duties it has
to perform; a navy, scattered, unsupported, and with no protected
home.

                On the Influence of Civilization upon Health.
RoUSSEAU, representing the metaphysical and absolute spirit of the
revolutionary politicians of the eighteenth century, maintained that
civilization was destructive to health and morals, and would have it
altogether swept away. The positive sociologist recognizing that the
 phenomena with which he deals, like all others, are amenable to
natural laws, seeks to find out what the Law—the natural tendency of
 modern civilization—is, and how it may be modified by human effort
 in a direction favourable to the moral and physical development of
 the individual. It is the greatest of all human problems. Leibnitz's
 maxim, On ne doit penser essentiellement qu'à deux choses, d'abord la
 vertu et puis la Santé, may be taken as the text of this discourse.

 1869.]           the In<U+FB02>uence of Civilization upon Health.          471
     Health may be de<U+FB01>ned as, The greatest energy of each part com
patible with the energy of the whole; or again, more simply, as, Being
 able to do a good day’s work easily. Energy is measurable by the
 amount of work done. Where there is perfect health there will be
 the greatest economy of the vital energies ; the most complete synergy
 of the functions, the minimum of loss from antagonism, or from
 degradation of higher into lower forms of force. Three examples
 were taken by the speaker; good and bad digestion; clumsy and
 skilful muscular e<U+FB02>'ort; uncontrolled and self-contained emotion, as
 shown in the contrast between the well-drilled soldier and the savage.
 In the imperfect performance of each of these three functions there is
 Waste of energy ; that is, ineffective transformation of nerve-muscular
 into calori<U+FB01>c or some other lower form of force.
     Again, Health may be de<U+FB01>ned as the most perfect form of Life.
 Life having been de<U+FB01>ned by Auguste Comte as the constant adaptation
 of organism to environment, health is the state in which such adapta
tion is most complete. Healthy respiration implies the adaptation of
a breathing apparatus hereditarily vigorous to a perfectly pure atmo
sphere. Healthy vision implies a sound ocular mechanism adjusted
to appropriate conditions of luminous forces.
     Rising from the Vegetal and the Animal phase of life to the highest
mode peculiar to man, the Social phase, we <U+FB01>nd that Social Life
 depends, like the others, on two conditions: a brain in which lies
latent the hereditary capacity for receiving and transmitting the long
tradition of our race, its emotions, its thoughts, its modes of action;
and a social environment supplying the appropriate stimulus which
 calls these latent capacities into action. The environment for this
phase of vitality is Humanity; that is to say, the resultant sum of all
human e<U+FB01>'ort throughout the immeasurable past, represented more or
less perfectly by the society in which the lot of the individual may
be cast. The function of the human brain, as transmitting the mutual
reactions of Humanity and the Individual, has been compared by Comte
to the function of the placenta with the mother and the unborn child.
     The speaker then proceeded to point out the in<U+FB02>uence upon the
individual of different social environments. In order to render the
meaning more precise, a single well-de<U+FB01>ned instinct was chosen,
the desire of praise. In one society personal bravery might be the
object of the highest admiration; in another, it might be civic duty; in
others, religious asceticism. Obviously the instinct under consideration
would in these three societies prompt three wholly distinct courses of
action; and in a society like our own, which had ceased to be warlike,
which was too overgrown to encourage the sense of citizenship, and
which from a combination of causes had lost its religious faith, wealth,
as comprising the power of individual enjoyment, became the object of
the highest admiration. The instinct of “approbativeness ” therefore
would in such a society prompt the acquisition of wealth. The same
analysis would hold good of the action of the other instincts. In a
society without strong religious faith, without any <U+FB01>rm binding prin

ciples, and endowed with new and extraordinary powers over natural
forces, the inevitable result is immensely rapid accumulation, accom
panied by prodigal expenditure, of wealth; with small regard to health,
with small provision for the future maintenance of the vigour of the
breed.
     The speaker then proceeded to consider some of the principal facts
illustrating the morbid condition of modern industrial life 2“
      1. The growth of great towns in the last half century.
      2. The in<U+FB02>ux into these towns from country districts.
      3. The mortality of infants.
      4. The mortality of adults at the reproductive age.
      5. The condition of the agricultural population, which may be
regarded as the reserve stock of national vitality on which rapidly
increasing demands are being made.
     With regard to the two <U+FB01>rst heads, statistics were produced show
ing that in 1811 the towns above 10,000 inhabitants contained only
24 per cent. of the population ; in 1861 they contained 44 per cent.
In 1811 there was no town in England, except London, with a popula
tion above 100,000 ; in 1861 there were twelve such towns, containing
one-quarter of the people. To illustrate the extent to which the
 increasing population of London was fed by the rural districts, it was
 mentioned that out of eleven persons over the age of twenty in London,
 six were born in the country.
     Statistics and charts were then produced, illustrating infant and
adult mortality. Four populations were compared : that of England
as a whole ; of Liverpool ; of ten cotton manufacturing towns of
Lancashire and Cheshire, not including Manchester ; and of seven
purely agricultural counties. These populations were compared: <U+FB01>rst,
with respect to their rate of mortality at the infantile period; secondly,
at the reproductive period; the mortality in the case of women being
examined at successive periods from 15 to 45 ; in the case of men, from
 25 to 55. It was shown that in both periods the rate of mortality in
Liverpool and the cotton districts was far above the rate for England
at corresponding times; that of the agricultural districts far below it.   ill
Attention was also called to the fact, that in towns where women were
largely employed in factories, their mortality relatively to men of the
same age was far beyond what it should be, taking the standard of
England as a whole.
     The question was started whether the excessive mortality of infants
 might or might not be regarded as a preservative action of nature,
 sacri<U+FB01>cing the unhealthy lives, and so preserving the vigour of the
breed. It was also considered, whether or not sanitary measures, by
preserving weak lives, might not in some measure tend to deteriorate the
breed.     With regard to the latter point, the speaker’s view was that
 unless sanitary measures were carried much farther and deeper than at
 present, there might be some such danger. And meantime he brought

1869.]          the In<U+FB02>uence of O'ivilizalion upon Health.            473
statistics to show that the high rate of mortality in infants in large
towns did not preserve the reproductive portion of their population
from similarly high rates.
    After a brief allusion to the unsatisfactory condition of our reserve
stock of health, the agricultural population, the speaker then pro
ceeded to discuss the historical causes of this state of things. He
showed, by illustrations from the vegetable and animal kingdoms,
that the state of equilibrium we call health is more di<U+FB01>icult, yet at the
same time more perfect, as we ascend from the lower organisms to the
higher. The same holds true of primitive and barbarous times as
compared with the more advanced stages of civilization Reference
was made to Captain Cook and to travellers in Central Africa to prove
the remarkable immunity from European disease enjoyed by savages.
The in<U+FB02>uence of an organized religion in controlling social action, and
its bearings upon public health, were, then considered, and were illus
trated by allusion to the theocracies of Egypt, Palestine, and India,
to the military polytheism of Greece and Rome, and to mediaeval
Catholicism. The two causes of the decline of Catholicism, the decay
of theology, and the growth of science, were then pointed out, and it
was shown how both these causes co-operated in producing the excep
tionally morbid state of modern industrial England.
    The question then remained, By what methods can we hope to
remedy this state of things ‘P
    There are two forces, the speaker remarked, available for the
modi<U+FB01>cation of natural social agencies- Capital, and scienti<U+FB01>cally
trained Intellect.   If asked, therefore, where lies the e<U+FB02>icient and
radical remedy for the evils we deplore, the answer would be, nowhere
but in a moral and religious change, as profound as that of the <U+FB01>rst
century of our own era in Western Europe, or that of the seventh century
in the East, the principal result of which will be to concentrate these
two forces on such problems as have here been discussed. The present
attitude of scienti<U+FB01>c men does not inspire immediate hope in this
respect. Absorbed in their own specialities, they revolt against the
idea of any moral or spiritual discipline, which would have the effect of
concentrating their investigations more closely round human interests,
although these, largely viewed, offer an abundant and super-abundant
<U+FB01>eld for every intellectual energy. They rebel against all such
claims as an unpleasant restraint. And the sense of civic duty is
restraint. Noblesse oblige.
    This great remedy therefore will be slow in its action. But while
there are some remedies which are deep, but not immediate, there are
others which are immediate, though not deep. To some of these the
speaker brie<U+FB02>y alluded. A revision and consolidation of our sanitary
laws; the appointment by Government of public inspectors of health ;
the introduction of very simple sanitary teaching into our primary
education; the establishment on a large scale of public parks and
gymnasia; and <U+FB01>nally, special attention to the sanitary and social
requirements of the agricultural labourer, from whom it was essential

not to out off, as had been done during the last century, the hope,
however distant, of becoming a peasant proprietor.
     With regard to the cost of these and similar measures, the speaker
merely remarked that London alone expended a yearly sum of between
three and four millions upon doubtful charities ; and that We had found
little di<U+FB01>ieulty in raising ten millions, of late years, to protect our
selves against the imaginary danger of invasion. Whereas the

On some further Results of Spectrum Analysis as applied to the Heavenly
                                       Bodies.
THE speaker commenced by saying that four years ago he had the
honour to give in the theatre of the Royal Institution an account of
the results of an attempt to apply the method of analysis by the prism,
for which science is indebted to Kirchho<U+FB02>', to the light of the heavenly
bodies. It was the speaker’s purpose to describe, ongthezpresent
                                                                          r.

476              Mr. Huggins on some further Results of        [March 5,
occasion, some of the results which had been obtained in his observa
tory since the spring of 1865. The peculiar suitability of spectrum
analysis as a mode of investigation of the bright objects in the heavens
had been con<U+FB01>rmed, not only by the gain of further information of the
chemical and physical constitution of some of these immensely distant
bodies, but also by knowledge of another kind which this elegant and
 searching method of analysis had revealed to us.
     The speaker then described the three typical forms under which
all spectra may be classed, and the interpretation which our present
knowledge enables us to give of these different spectra when the light
is emitted by bodies rendered luminous by heat. The spectra of
 <U+FB02>uorescent and phosphorescent bodies were not to be described.
     1. A continuous spectrum without dark or bright lines shows, as a
 general rule, that the luminous source is in the solid or liquid state.
 In certain exceptional cases, however, a gas may give a spectrum which
 is apparently continuous. Dr. Balfour Stewart pointed out that as
 gases and vapours possess a power of general absorption, in addition
 to the selective absorption peculiar to each gas, a gas when luminous
 would emit light of all refrangibilities, producing a continuous spec
 trum, in addition to its spectrum of bright lines, and further that the
 intensity of this continuous spectrum would he in proportion to the
 opacity of the gas. The researches of Pliicker and Frankland have
 shown that under certain conditions of density and temperature, the
 bright lines of hydrogen expand so as to produce a spectrum which is
 apparently continuous.
     2. A spectrum of bright lines indicates that the luminous body is in
 the state of gas. Each gas and vapour has its own set of lines. The
 lines may be greatly modi<U+FB01>ed, or even altogether changed, under
 different conditions of temperature and density, as is well known in
 the case of nitrogen, the vapour of sulphur, and some other substances;
 but throughout all these changes each gas behaves in a way peculiar
 to itself. There appears to be one exception to the statement that a
 spectrum of bright lines is peculiar to luminous gas. Bunsen found
 that when solid erbia is heated to incandescence, the continuous
 spectrum contains bright bands.
     3. A continuous spectrum interrupted by dark lines informs us that
 the light has passed through vapours at a lower temperature than the
 source of light. As the kinds of light absorbed by each vapour cor
 respond precisely with the set of bright lines which that vapour emits
 when in the luminous state, it is possible to learn if the vapours are
 those of any of the substances with which we are acquainted.
     The speaker said that following the arrangement adopted in the
 former discourse, the most important recent information obtained of
 the <U+FB01>xed stars results from the application of prismatic analysis in a
 new direction. Under certain conditions the spectrum of a luminous
 body is adapted to tell us whether that body is moving towards or
 from the earth. The importance of information on this point will be
 seen from the consideration that the proper motions of the stars repre

1869.]     Spectrum Analysis as applied to the Heavenly Bodies.       477
sent that part only of their whole motion which is transverse to the
line of sight; for any motion they might have in the visual direction,
towards or from the earth, would not cause any visible displacement
of the star, and could not therefore be ascertained by the ordinary
methods of observation.
    As it is upon the length of the waves, or upon the number con
tained in the series that enters the eye, or falls upon the prism, in a
second that a judgment is formed of the colour of the light, or its
place in the spectrum is determined, it follows that any circumstance
which would alter the length of the waves relatively to the observer, or,
in other words, cause a larger number of waves to enter the eye in a
second of time, would cause a change in the colour or refrangibility of
the light so far as the observer is concerned. It is obvious that if the
observer advances to meet the light, a longer series of waves falls
upon the retina in a second of time, each wave appears shorter, and
he ascribes to the light a higher refrangibility than he would do if he
were not advancing to meet the-light. If he were receding from the
star an alteration of refrangibility in the opposite direction would take
place. The same effect would ensue, if the luminous source were in
motion. Thus to a swimmer striking out from the shore, each wave
appears shorter, and he passes a greater number of them in a given
interval in proportion to his speed through the water.
    Illustrations were given of this principle, which was <U+FB01>rst suggested
in 1841 by Doppler, by means of an analogous change of pitch in
sound. Two tuning-forks sounding in unison were moved rapidly
towards and from the audience, when beats were heard, which told of
a difference of pitch produced by the opposite motions of the forks.
    As there exists beyond the visible spectrum, at both ends, a store
of invisible waves, these would be advanced or degraded into visi
bility, in proportion as the colours of the spectrum were altered, and
no change of colour would be perceived. It is therefore essential
before we can apply this method to detect the radial motion of the
stars, that we know the original refrangibility of some part of the light
at the moment it left the star, and also that we are able to recog
nize this particular part of the light again in the spectrum of the
star’s light. When by means of a group of dark or bright lines we
learn the presence of a terrestrial substance in the star, both these
conditions are ful<U+FB01>lled.
    Of all the stars which the speaker had compared with terrestrial
elements, when working with his distinguished friend Dr. W. A.
Miller, Treas. R.S., Sirius, which contains four very strong lines
which are due to hydrogen, appeared the most suitable for this
investigation. The apparatus employed, and the special precautions
which were taken to ensure the perfect coincidence in his instrument
of the stellar lines with those of the substance compared with it, were
described by the speaker, who stated that after a prolonged comparison,
extending over many weeks, of the line of hydrogen in Sirius in the
green, at the place of F in the solar spectrum, with the line of terres

478                Mr. Huggins on Spectrum Analysis.          [March 5,
trial hydrogen, he found that the line in the star had undergone a
shift in the spectrum equal to a difference of wave length, which would
correspond to a motion of recession between the star and the earth of
41 miles per second. The speaker had obtained evidence from ex
periment that this shift was not due to unsymmetrical expansion of
the line in hydrogen as the density is increased. The greater width
of this line in Sirius than in the solar spectrum would show that the
hydrogen in Sirius, though at a pressure considerably less than that of
our atmosphere at the surface of the earth, is more dense than the
hydrogen in the solar atmosphere by which the dark line F is pro
duced. This conclusion is in accordance with the presumably enor
mous mass of Sirius, as suggested by its great intrinsic splendour.
    The earth at the time of observation was moving from Sirius at
about 11 miles per second, which would leave 30 miles as due to the
star. A further connection is required for the solar motion in space,
which is believed to be towards Hercules, with a velocity of 4 or 5
miles per second. The whole of this must therefore be deducted,
leaving about 26 miles as the motion of Sirius from the earth in the
line of sight. The true motion of the star would consist of this radial
motion compounded with the transverse motion of from 24 to 40 miles
per second, which is shown by its proper motion.
    The speaker then described a further examination of the nebulae
(about <U+FB01>fty have been successfully observed) with a more powerful
spectroscope, which con<U+FB01>rms his previous conclusion that these
bodies consist mainly of the gases nitrogen and hydrogen. He also
found that when the spectra of these gases are made faint by the
removal of the spark to a distance, all the lines are extinguished
with the exception of the one line in each spectrum which is found
in the nebulae. If such an extinction takes place in the case of the
nebulae, since they are objects of sensible size, it must be attributed
to a power of extinction of light existing in cosmical space.
    Observations of four comets have been made. A large part of the
light of these strange objects was found to be peculiar, and therefore
emitted by the cometary matter. Brorsen’s comet at its return in
1868, and a comet discovered by Winnecke, gave a spectrum of three
bright bands. The spectrum of Winnecke’s comet (comet II, 1868)
was found to be identical with the spectrum of carbon as it appears
when the induction spark is taken in ole<U+FB01>ant gas, and in some other
compounds of carbon. lThe spectrum of the comet was compared
directly in the instrument with the spectrum of ole<U+FB01>ant gas.
    The speaker then described some observations of the sun. He
found that while the solar lines are for the most part thickened when
viewed in the light from the umbra of a spot, the lines C and F, due
to hydrogen did not appear to be altered. This observation is of
interest in connection with the constitution of the solar prominences
as shown by the observations of the great eclipse of last August. The
speaker nearly three years ago, at the same time that he had inde
pendently made attempts to see the prominences by means of the

spectroseope, also tried the method of using absorbing media, by
which the parts of the spectrum where the bright lines occur might
remain, while all the rest of the spectrum was extinguished. In this
way the faint prominences would be rendered visible, in consequence
of the much greater relative diminution of the intensity of the illu~
minatcd screen of air, which on ordinary occasions conceals them
from view. Recently he had succeeded in viewing the outline of these
objects by means of a coloured glass combined with a spectroscope
with a wide slit. He expected to be able to view these objects by
means of coloured media alone.

  WILLIAM ROBERT GBovE, Esq. M.A. Q1)‘. F.R.S. Vice-President,
                               in the Chair.
                   F. A. ABEL, F.R.S. For. Sec. 0. S.
   on some Applications of Electricity to Naval and Military Purposes.
THE applications which electric science has received within the last
few years in connection with the military and naval services are
various and important. The employment of the electric light for
  ignalling and reconnoitring purposes; the permanent establishment
of telegraphic equipments by which an army in the <U+FB01>eld or at a siege
is maintained in the most intimate communication with the directing
powers ; the employment of electric signalling arrangements in ships of
war, and the accurate investigation of the ballistic force of gunpowder
and other explosive agents, are among the uses to which electricity has
been put in connection with war-purposes; but the earliest application,
and one of the most important and extensive—one, moreover, possessing
great interest from industrial points of view-is the employment of
electricity as an agent for exploding land- and submarine mines.
     The possibility of applying the electric spark to the ignition of
charges of gunpowder suggested itself both to Franklin, in 1751, and
to Priestley in 1767; but it was not until some years after the dis
covery of the electric pile by Volta, that serious attempts were made
to apply electricity to mining and military purposes. The <U+FB01>rst prac
tical application of the voltaic battery in this direction was made little
more than thirty years ago by French military Engineers ; a few years
afterwards that agent was successfully applied in this country in con
nection with important blasting operations, such as the destruction of
Round Down Oli<U+FB02>' at Dover, and the removal of the wrecks of the

480                Mr. F. A. Abel on some Applications         [March 12 ,
Royal George and Edgar at Spithead. The general method of opera
tion then pursued was adhered to by military Engineers in this country
until very recently, and is, in fact, still occasionally employed, though
it has been in great measure superseded by other systems which pre
sent very important advantages. It consists in inserting into the
charge of gunpowder a short piece of thin wire, composed of a metal
of inferior conducting power, such as iron or platinum, and placing
this wire into connection with the circuit wires of the battery. The
resistance offered to the passage of the current gives rise to the de
velopment of heat, the intensity of which is regulated by the conduct
ing power and the length and thickness of the wire. The latter may,
in this way, be raised to a red heat, or even fused ; and thus, by com
pleting circuit through the wire at the desired moment, a charge of
powder maybe in<U+FB02>amed. A number of charges may be simultaneously
exploded by introducing several pieces of thin wire into the circuit.
    Although the employment of a voltaic current of low tension
presents obvious and great advantages over old systems of igniting
charges by trains or slow-burning fuzes, its application to military
purposes is attended with some dif<U+FB01>culty and uncertainty, arising out
of the want of uniformity of action of the same voltaic arrangements
at different periods, the di<U+FB02>‘iculties attending the transport and proper
preservation of the battery and materials required for its use, the de
pendence for success upon care and experience in preparing and pre
serving the batteries, and the very considerable increase which it is
necessary to make in the power of the battery when the operations
to be performed involve the simultaneous explosion of a number of
charges, or the ignition of gunpowder at very considerable distances
from the battery.
    For these reasons, soon after the <U+FB01>rst successful application of
voltaic electricity to mining purposes, the attention of military Engi
neers on the Continent, and of others here and abroad who were
specially interested in operations of this kind, became directed to the
possibility of rendering electricity of high tension available for ex
ploding purposes, whereby voltaic batteries, for mining operations,
might be greatly reduced in size, if not altogether dispensed with. In
1853 a Spanish o<U+FB02>icer, Colonel Verdu, associated himself with M.
Ruhmkor<U+FB02>' in experiments on the application of electro-magnetic in
duction coils to the explosion of gunpowder. The success of their
experiments led Colonel Verdu to pursue thorn further in Spain,
where he soon succeeded in <U+FB01>ring six mines simultaneously by one
element of Bunsen’s battery, at a distance of upwards of three
hundred yards, through the agency of the Ruhmkor<U+FB02>" coil. The mode
of operating and di<U+FB02>iculties which Colonel Verdu had to overcome
will be presently described. While the success of these operations
led the military Engineers in Spain, France, and Russia to pursue the
development of the application of electro-magnetic induction instru
ments to exploding purposes, a committee of Austrian military Engi
neers (of which Baron von Ebner was from the <U+FB01>rst a most distin

1869.]           of Electricity to Naval and Military Purposes.      481
guished member) was labouring to apply frictional electricity to mili
tary uses as an exploding agent, having come to the conclusion that
the electro-magnetic induction apparatus was too complicated and
too greatly susceptible of derangement for military uses. But little
success had up to that time attended attempts to apply frictional elec
tricity to this purpose. In 1831, Moses Shaw, of New York, succeeded
in exploding several mines simultaneously by means of frictional elec
tricity, but was foiled in his attempts to apply this agent to practical
purposes, by the fact that he could not conduct operations with any
chance of success except in very dry weather. Somewhat more pro
mising results attended several attempts in Germany between 1842
and 1845; but the prospect of practical success was still not encourag
ing when the Austrian Committee of Engineer Of<U+FB01>cers took the matter
in hand, and eventually produced a portable glass frictional electric
machine, which, when in good working order, furnished results sur
passing those which had been obtained with volta-induction appa
ratus. Some very extensive operations were conducted with this
machine; thus, <U+FB01>fty land-charges and, afterwards, thirty-six sub
marine charges, were simultaneously exploded. Even, however with
all the precautions adopted, the machine was still too seriously affected
by damp to be thoroughly serviceable for military purposes. But the
persevering labours of Baron von Ebner eventually resulted in the
production of an electric machine which was almost entirely free from
the objections hitherto attached to this form of apparatus.
    While the progress just indicated was being made in different parts
of the Continent in the application of electricity to mining operations,
but little attention was directed in this country to e<U+FB02>'ecting improve
ments in the utilization of electricity for military mining purposes.
In 1855, however, Sir C. Wheatstone directed the attention of Field
Marshal Sir John F. Burgoyne to the importance of instituting an
experimental inquiry into the relative advantages of different sources of
electricity of tension as agents for exploding glmpowder. The Ordnance
Select Committee, of whom Sir C. Wheatstone and Mr. Abel were
then members, were consequently instructed to pursue this inquiry;
and a series of investigations was carried out, in the <U+FB01>rst instance, to
a working branch of the Committee, and subsequently by Mr. Abel at
Woolwich and Chatham, the results of which were eventually em
bodied in a report presented by the above-mentioned gentlemen to
the Secretary of State for War in 1860. Since then Mr. Abel, as
a member of the Government Committee on Floating Obstructions,
has continued systematic investigations on the applications of electri
city to the explosion of mines, and especially to submarine operations,
and considerable improvements and simpli<U+FB01>cations of the arrange
ments and appliances have resulted. Some advance has also been
made on the Continent in this subject, and during the last two or
three years our military Engineers have acknowledged in the most
practical manner the advantages to be derived from the use of elec
tricity of tension as the agent for exploding mines, by gradually and

 482                 Mr. F. A. Abel on some Applications        [March 12,
 to a very great extent abandoning the old system of operation, and by
 devoting considerable attention to the practical elaboration of the
 new systems.
     The following is an outline of the results obtained up to the
 present day with different classes of instruments which furnish elec
 tricity of tension.
     It has been stated that Colonel Verdu succeeded, in 1853, in exploding
 several mines simultaneously by means of a Ruhmkor<U+FB01>' induction
 coil. The ignition of the gunpowder was effected in these experi
 ments by introducing one or more small but complete interruptions
 into the circuit, across which the electric spark of high tension would
 leap upon the current being passed. This spark will in<U+FB02>ame gun
 powder, but not very readily, although its production is attended
 with development of heat considerably in excess of that required;
 the reason being that powder requires for ignition either the close
 proximity of a considerable heated surface, or the continuous appli
 cation of heat for a brief period, while the disruptive discharge from
 an induction coil consists of a series of instantaneous discharges
 following each other in very rapid succession. Hence a charge of
 gunpowder is not always instantaneously <U+FB01>red when the spark is
 passed; indeed, unless the powder be closely con<U+FB01>ned round the wire
'terminals between which the spark passes, it is sometimes dispersed
 by the mechanical action of the spark without being exploded; and
 when a succession of sparks is passed simultaneously through a
 number of charges, it frequently happens that only a few are exploded,
 in which some of the grains happened to be in positions or conditions
 more favourable with reference to the source of heat than in other
 instances, where the powder would escape ignition. Colonel Verdu
 succeeded in increasing the certainty of simultaneous ignition of
 several charges, by surrounding the wire terminals with a substance
 much more readily in<U+FB02>amed than powder—-the fulminate of mercury.
 Another source of di<U+FB02>‘iculty in effecting the simultaneous ignition of
 a considerable number of charges by the spark from the coil is the
 enfeebling effect upon the spark-discharge exerted by a number of
 successive small interruptions in the circuit. This was to some extent
 overcome by employing a fuze constructed by Messrs. Statham and
 Brunton, in which the space between the wire-terminals was bridged
 over with a <U+FB01>lm of a <U+FB01>nely-divided substance—the subsulphide of
 copper, the conducting power of which is su<U+FB02>iciently great to aid the
 passage of the electric discharge across the interruption, while it is at
 the same time readily combustible, and therefore directly promotes
 the ignition of the powder. Finding that, even with the combined use
 of this fuze and of fulminate of mercury, the power of the induction
 coil to explode charges simultaneously was limited, Colonel Verdu
 adopted the following simple arrangement. Separate small groups of
 mines were all connected with earth, and an insulated conducting
 wire connected each group with a distinct small insulated plate. By
 bringing these plates in very rapid succession into circuit with the

1869.]          of Electricity to Naval and Military Purposes.      483
coil-machine, the several groups were so rapidly exploded as to produce
results somewhat similar to those attainable by the really simultaneous
discharge of a considerable number. Not long after this contrivance
was adopted by M. Verdu, M. Savare devised another arrangement,
whereby a much more rapidly successive discharge of a number of
mines was accomplished through the agency of the coil. The metal
lic circuit which passed to the mines was divided into a number of
branches, so that, upon completion of the circuit, the currents, follow
ing each other in very rapid succession, would distribute themselves
 through all the branches with a degree of uniformity regulated by
the resistance met with in each branch. Thus, when one or more
 fuzes were interposed in each branch of the circuit, those which
happened to offer the greatest facilities for the passage of the current
 would be <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>red, whereupon the escape of electricity in that direc
 tion would be interrupted, and the explosion of fuzes in the other
 branches would follow. With the employment of currents following
 each other with the enormous rapidity with which they pass o<U+FB02>‘ from
 the induction-coil machines, the discharge of a number of mines may
 thus be effected with a rapidity which, practically, has almost the
 effect of a simultaneous discharge.                      -
     The Ruhmkor<U+FB01>' coil was used to some extent by the Russians in
mining operations during the Crimean war, and some very extensive
blasting operations were carried on with its aid at Cherbourg in 1854.
A series of experiments was instituted at Woolwich in 1856 with two
excellent induction-coils, produced by M. Ruhmkorff, in the course of
which various descriptions of materials were tried in the fuzes, for the
purpose of increasing the power of the machine to <U+FB01>re numbers of
charges simultaneously. At that time the fulminate of mercury was
found to be the best in<U+FB01>aming agent ; but not more than twelve charges
were <U+FB01>red simultaneously by means of the most powerful coil avail
able and a battery of twelve cells (without employing Verdu’s or
Savare’s methods of explosion). One defect in this class of instru
ment was found to be the want of uniform action of one and the
same apparatus at different periods; another was the liability to de
rangement of the machine, especially of the condenser. Far more
successful results were afterwards obtained with the same coils and
the fuze constructed at a later period of these investigations; <U+FB01>fteen
charges were <U+FB01>red simultaneously with a battery of six cells, and <U+FB01>fty
charges, arranged in branch-circuit in groups of ten, were exploded
with the e<U+FB02>'ect of a simultaneous discharge. These results were
obtained with machines produced by Ruhmkorff in 1855; but the im
provements since then effected in the construction of this apparatus
have reduced to insigni<U+FB01>cance the results at that time obtained with
it. There is no question therefore that the Ruhmkor<U+FB02>' coil is avail
able for special operations of considerable magnitude; but in point of
simplicity, certainty, and constancy of action, it is far surpassed by
other forms of electric instruments, which will be presently noticed.
     At the suggestion of Sir‘ Charles Wheatstone, experiments were

484                Mr. F. A. Abel on some Applications         [March 12,
commenced in 1856 on the application of currents induced by per
manent magnetslto the explosion of gunpowder. The <U+FB01>rst experiments
were instituted with a very large and powerful magneto-electric machine,
constructed by Mr. Henley, of which the armature, carrying two power
ful coils, was suddenly detached from the magnet by means of a lever.
A few experiments su<U+FB01>iced to show that the induced current obtained
even with this powerful intrument was not adequate to ignite one
single charge of gunpowder with certainty. Somewhat better, but
still uncertain, results were obtained with Statham's and one or two
other forms of fuzes existing at that time. A careful investigation
was then undertaken by Mr. Abel (with the invaluable assistance of
Mr. Brown, of the Chemical Department, Woolwich), into the condi
tions to be ful<U+FB01>lled in the production of a fuze which should be certain
of action with the magneto-electric machine. The results of extensive
experiments indicated that a combination of comparatively high con
ducting power with great susceptibility to ignition appeared to be
essential elements of success in a material to be used as the exploding
agent in a fuze. The uniform arrangement of the poles or wire
terminals in the fuze, the space between which was to be bridged
over by the igniting composition, also proved a matter of great
importance. A mode of constructing the fuzes which ensured perfect
uniformity in this respect was ultimately perfected, and has proved
quite successful. A very fairly e<U+FB02>icient fuze was obtained with the
aid of the poles thus arranged, by employing as the igniting agent
gunpowder impregnated with a small proportion of calcic chloride,
which caused it, upon brief exposure to air, to imbibe moisture
su<U+FB01>icient to render the gunpowder highly conducting. It is obvious
however, that, although the fuze itself was hermetically closed when
complete, there must be a liability to want of uniformity in the pro
portion of water absorbed by the powder, and a consequent variation
in the conducting power of the latter. Eventually a material was
prepared (consisting of the subphosphide of copper, subsulphide of
copper, and potassic chlorate) which combined the essentials of perfect
certainty of action with very great sensitiveness to ignition. Henley’s
large magnet <U+FB01>red three of these fuzes simultaneously with perfect
certainty, while a small horse-shoe magnet with revolving armature
exploded twenty-<U+FB01>ve in divided circuit in exceedingly rapid succes
sion. A combination of six small compound magnets was afterwards
employed, with which an exceedingly rapid succession of currents was
obtained, and this apparatus exploded twenty-<U+FB01>ve fuzes, in divided

which are used for medical purposes will explode these fuzes with

    The application of magneto-electric machines having been sue
oessfully accomplished, a series of experiments was carried on by
Mr. Abel, with the valuable aid of Colonel H. Scott, R.E., at Chatham,
during the years 1857-58, on the explosion of charges, both land- and

'1869.]         of Electricity to Naval and Military Purposes.   . 485
submarine; and the great advantages of these instruments, as regards
simplicity and permanent e<U+FB01>iciency, over the voltaic arrangements
 hitherto used, was fully demonstrated. Very compact but powerful
 exploding instruments were constructed by Sir C. Wheatstone, and
 these have for the last seven or eight years received many important
 applications; thus, the proof of cannon at Woolwich and the <U+FB01>ring of
guns, from a safe distance, in the numerous experiments at Shoebury
ness, is effected by means of Wheatstone’s exploder, which is, more
over, an important adjunct in all electro-ballistic experiments, when
the operator desires himself to <U+FB01>re a gun at a particular moment.
Magneto-electric machines have also been found very useful in con
nection with blasting operations on land, except in instances when
the absolutely simultaneous explosion of a large number of mines is
required.
     Since the success of Wheatstone’s exploders has been fully esta
blished, several other forms of magneto-electric-machines have been
devised, especially on the Continent and in America. Powerful in
struments similar to Wheatstone’s are manufactured by Siemens and
Halske, of Berlin; Markus, of Vienna, has constructed very e<U+FB01>icient
instruments in which one separation and return of the armature to
the magnet are made to explode the charges. The disadvantages of
these instruments is that a succession of currents cannot be obtained
from them as in the case of machines with revolving armatures ; hence
the number of mines which can be exploded by them in divided circuit
is comparatively limited. Mr. Beardslee, an American, has also devised
a modi<U+FB01>cation of Wheatstone’s exploder, in which the magnets are
made to revolve between the armature‘coils, and which furnishes cur
rents of greater quantity but lower tension than Wheatstone’s. The
 fuze constructed by Mr. Beardslee for employment with this instru
ment is similar in principle of construction to Abel’s; but the
 materials which bridge over the space between the terminals or poles
 of the fuze are black lead, with the addition of a minute quantity of
some substance, apparently collodion, which adds to the size of the
 scintillations produced when the current passes, and thus increases
the certainty of ignition of the powder which is in close contact with
the poles. These fuzes are e<U+FB02>icient with magneto-electric instruments
like that of Mr. Beardslee, but they are much less delicate than the
Woolwich fuzes, and the number which can be simultaneously ex
ploded is therefore much more limited. Sir C. Wheatstone has also
lately constructed more powerful modi<U+FB01>cations of his original mag
 netic exploder, which may, at will, be made to furnish currents of
 greater quantity and lower tension, or to produce the high tension
currents. Lastly, Mr. Ladd and Mr. Browning have produced instru
ments of comparatively low price, but quite powerful enough for
ordinary blasting and quarrying operations. The only obstacle, but a
most important one, to the general use of these machines for the ex
plosion of mines on land and under water is, that very slight defects
in the insulation of the conducting wire which leads from the instru

486               Mr. F. A. Abel on some Applications            [March 12,
ment to the mines are quite fatal to its exploding power. In consequence
of the high tension of the current developed by these machines, and
the small quantity put into circulation by even the most powerful of
them, the diversion of the current from its destined course to earth
is promoted by the smallest points of escape presented to it; a result
which is, moreover, facilitated by the resistance of the fuzes in circuit.
With care this source of failure can be guarded against in operations
on land, but such is not the case with regard to submarine arrange
merged wires,
ments;           moreover,
         while,which         hardly defects

completely nullify the exploding power of the machines. Hence mag
neto-electric instruments are the least reliable of all electric exploding
apparatus for submarine purposes.
    A few experiments were instituted at Woolwich in 1857 on the
employment of frictional electricity as an exploding agent, and
especially with a small hydro-electric machine constructed for the
purpose by Sir William Armstrong. As regards its power of ex
ploding a number of charges simultaneously, when it was in good
working order, it far exceeded any other instrument experimented with
at that time; one hundred fuzes, arranged in a single current, were
frequently exploded by its means; but the great uncertainty of its
action, and the dif<U+FB01>culty of employing it in the <U+FB01>eld, did not afford
encouragement for a continuation of experiments with it.
    The great di<U+FB01>iculties encountered in the Austrian experiments in
the attempts to employ glass frictional electric machines as exploding
agents for military purposes, led Baron von Ebner to direct his attention
to the production of an instrument in the construction of which glass
was altogether avoided, and which might therefore be expected to be less
subject to atmospheric in<U+FB02>uences. His labours in this direction were
eventually crowned with success; for he found in the hard vulcanized
india-rubber (known as ebonite or vulcanite) a dielectric material
excellently adapted to the construction of the frictional apparatus;
while by employing a sheet of vulcanized india-rubber coated with
tinfoil and compactly rolled up, he obtained without the use of glass
a powerful condenser, or Leyden jar arrangement. The improved
machines were constructed in a very compact form (with cases ex
cluding all the working parts from direct exposure to             by Messrs.
Siemens of Berlin and Lenoir of Vienna, who exhibited specimens in
England in 1862, at which time the electric machine had already
received important applications in the Austrian service, and had been
regularly adopted for military uses. Baron von Ebner had also, from
the commencement of the Austrian experiments, laboured assiduously
at the production of an e<U+FB01>icient fuze to be used with electricity of
tension; and the Austrian service is indebted to him for a simple and
thoroughly serviceable fuze, which, as regards the arrangement of its
poles and the character of the igniting composition, may be said to
combine the principles of the Statham and Abel fuzes. Though less
sensitive than the present English service electric fuze, a very con

1869.]          of Electricity to Naval and Military Purposes.      487
siderable number may be exploded in simple circuit by the ebonite
electric machine. The power of this apparatus in its portable form is
nearly equal to that of the hydro-electric apparatus just now referred
to, when the latter is in perfect working order. A far greater number
of mines may therefore be simultaneously exploded by its means
than by very large batteries or by the most powerful magneto-electric
machines hitherto constructed. One hundred of Abel’s fuzes have
frequently been simultaneously exploded with one of the portable
machines, and still greater results can be obtained with a larger
instrument having a battery of condensers, which was specially con
structed for submarine operations by Mr. Becker, at the suggestion of
Captain Maury. In very damp weather, when the most perfect glass
electric machines would have been useless unless housed in a warm
apartment from which the external air was as much as possible
excluded, these ebonite machines have been used from time to time
throughout the day with very satisfactory results.
     Another important advantage which these instruments possess
over magneto-electric machines consists in the fact that very consi
derable defects in the insulation of even submerged conducting wires
do not so greatly reduce the power of the current furnished by them as
to interfere with the accomplishment by its agency of the most extensive
operations under water which are likely to occur in practice. Unfor
tunately, however, the very circumstance which constitutes its chief
advantage, namely, the powerful character of the current of high
tension with which it charges an insulated wire, is also a source of
serious defect, to be presently noticed, which very greatly limits the
applicability of these machines to naval and military purposes.
     A class of electrical instruments has been created within the last
three years which bids fair to supplant even these very powerful and
e<U+FB02>icient frictional machines. The instruments in question, of which
different forms have been devised by Wheatstone, Wilde, Siemens,
and Ladd, have received the generic name of dynamo-electric ma
chines, because dynamic force becomes through their agency a ‘direct
and powerful source of electricity. In the machines of Siemens,
Wheatstone, and Ladd, mechanical power is transformed into electric
force without the intervention of permanent magnets. The action
of the most simple form of these instruments may be described as
follows :—The residual magnetism existing in an electro-magnet
 sui‘<U+FB01>ces to develop an induced current in a rapidly-revolving coil
armature; this current, reacting upon the electro-magnet, determines
 the development of powerful magnetism in the latter by the inductive
 action of its insulated coils; the currents developed by the electro
 magnet are consequently in their turn greatly increased in power, and
 react again upon the armature ; and thus an immense accumulation of
 electric force is accomplished with great rapidity until, when that
 accumulation has reached the maximum attainable without detriment
 to the insulation of the wire-coils, a simple interrupting arrangement
 causes the current to be diverted from the machine to conducting

488                 Mr. F. A.-Al>el on some Applicatiom       [March 12,
wires, by whose medium it is utilized. The details of the machines
vary according to the di<U+FB02>'erent plans adopted by the several con
structors, but the above explanation applies more particularly to the
machines of Messrs. Siemens and Halske, who have been the <U+FB01>rst to
produce a small instrument of this class thoroughly applicable to
mining purposes, and which almost equals in power the ebonite fric
tional-electric machine. Fifty charges, arranged in simple circuit,
have been repeatedly exploded, without any failures, by one of these
machines; it therefore provides with certainty the power necessary
for the most extensive mining or submarine operations, and is at the
same time quite free from all disturbing atmospheric in<U+FB02>uences. Its
mechanism is simple, and less easily susceptible of derangement than
that of any magneto-electric apparatus, and as it is independent of
everything but the application of manual power for the development
of its action, it is far superior to the most perfect of these, indepen
dently of the fact that it surpasses them all greatly in power. For
many important military and mining operations the hand dynamo
electric machines, constructed by Messrs. Siemens and Halske, are
therefore unquestionably superior to all other existing apparatus which
furnish electricity of tension.      This class of instrument, however,
shares, to some extent at any rate, one important defect of the fric
tional-electric machines, which is consequent upon the powerful
charges of high-tension electricity sent into conducting wires by
their agency. It was observed, in the earlier experiments of the
Austrians with frictional electricity, that if two or more insulated
wires which led to distinct mines were situated side by side, in
moderately close proximity, even only for comparatively short dis
tances, the charge sent from the machine into one of the wires, with
the view of only exploding a particular mine or series, might develop
in neighbouring wires, not connected with the machine, a charge of
induced electricity of sufficient power to explode the mines connected
with those wires. Some results obtained at Chatham, and many
experiments recently instituted at Woolwich, have not only con<U+FB01>rmed
those observations in Austria, but have shown that means do not at
present exist of avoiding this serious defect of powerful charges of
high tension.‘ If, therefore, it is necessary to lead separate Wires from
the point of operation (from the exploding instrumen‘ii) to di<U+FB01>'erent
mines or groups which it is desired to explode indepen ently of each
other, it is impossible to employ the frictional electric machine as the
exploding agent without great risk of failure, even though the wires, laid
upon or imbedded in earth, are separated as widely as possible, as they
must unavoidably extend in proximity to each other to a distance from
their points of union with the machine, which, if the latter be highly
charged, may prove su<U+FB01>icient to determine the development of in
duced “ exploding” currents in the wires leading to mines not intended
to be <U+FB01>red. If the wires lead to submarine mines or torpedoes, and
are therefore submerged, the unintentional explosion of mines becomes
much more certain, and the frictional machine is consequently inap

1869.]          of Electricity to Naval and Military Purposes.        489
plicable to submarine operations in all instances where mines are
arranged in separate circuits. The dynamo-electric machines share
this serious defect to some extent; still, with proper experience in their
use, they are not altogether inapplicable to such services as above
speci<U+FB01>ed. If Siemens’ dynamo-electric machine be highly charged
by very rapid revolutions of the armature, the inductive action of
the charge will be similar in power to that exerted by the charge of the
frictional machine, but by revolving the armatures slowly it is pos
sible to charge the machine su<U+FB02>‘iciently to <U+FB01>re a mine or a small group
with certainty, while the inductive action of the charge sent into the
wire will not in<U+FB02>uence neighbouring wires to an extent su<U+FB02>icient to
cause the explosion of mines connected with them.
    The subject of the application of electricity to the explosion of
submarine mines for purposes of defence and attack received some
attention from the Russians during the Crimean war, and was prac
tically developed in its most simple form in 1859, in the hands of the
Austrian government, when a system of submarine mines, to be <U+FB01>red
through the agency of electricity by operators on shore, was applied
by Baron von Ebner to the defence of Venice, which, however, never
came into practical operation. ’The subject of the utilization of
electricity for purposes of defence did, however, not receive serious
consideration in England or other countries until some years after
wards, when the great importance of submarine mines as engines of
war was demonstrated by the number of ships destroyed and injured
during the war in America. Twenty-<U+FB01>ve vessels belonging to the
Federal navy were destroyed and nine others injured by the explosion
of torpedoes, while the Confederates lost three vessels by accidentally
coming into collision with their own torpedoes, and one which was
attacked by means of a torpedo and destroyed by the Federals.
    Soon after the commencement of that war the attention of the
English government was called to the importance of practical inquiry
into the value of submarine obstructions, both passive and active, as
auxiliary agents of defence, and a Committee was appointed at the
suggestion of Colonel Jervois, C.B., R.E., to report on the use which
might be made of <U+FB02>oating or sunken obstructions and of submarine
mines, in the defence of channels, harbours, and rivers. The labours
of this Committee have recently terminated, and they were enabled, by
the aid of systematic investigations conducted for them at Woolwich
during the last four years by one of their members, Mr. Abel, and of
practical experiments carried on chie<U+FB02>y at Chatham under the direc
tion of another of their body, Colonel A. re. Fisher, C.B. R.E., to
elaborate the subject of the application of electricity to submarine
mines and torpedoes, to such an extent that a solid foundation of
information and instruction is now available for those who may at any
time have to be entrusted with the actual arrangement and employ
ment of these important means of defence. Continental Governments
have also devoted much attention to this subject, and especially the

Austrian Government, for whom Baron von Ebner devised an inge
nious and elaborate system of electric torpedo defence,-exhibited in
detail at the Paris Exhibition of 1867, which received application
during the recent war, though its e<U+FB02>iciency was not actually put to
the test except in the way of experiment.
     The application of electricity to the explosion of torpedoes was
very limited during the American war ; but arrangements for the ex
tensive employment of that agent as the exploding power were far
advanced in the hands of both the Federals and Confederates at the
 close of that war. It appears that only in two instances of the entire
 number of vessels destroyed and injured was the explosion of the
torpedoes effected by electric arrangements, the others having all been
exploded by mechanical agency.
     The explosion of submerged charges of gunpowder by mechanical
contrivances, either of a self-acting nature or to be set into action at
desired periods, was accomplished as far back as 1583, during the
siege of Antwerp by the Duke of Parma. The English employed self
acting torpedoes against the French ships o<U+FB02>' Rochelle in 1628, and
from that period to 1854 devices of more or less ingenious and prac
ticable character have been proposed from time to time, and even
applied to some small extent in different countries, for the explosion
of torpedoes either by clockwork, at <U+FB01>xed periods, or by coming into
collision with a ship. The Russians were the <U+FB01>rst to apply self-acting
mechanical torpedoes with any prospect of success, and there is little
doubt that had the machines which were applied to the defence of the
Baltic been of larger size (they only contained 8 or 9 lbs. of gun
powder), their presence would have proved very disastrous to some of
the English ships which came into collision with and exploded them.
Various mechanical devices for effecting the explosion of torpedoes
by their collision with a ship were employed by the Americans during
the recent war, a few of which proved very effective. But although,
in point of simplicity and cost, a system of defence by means of
mechanical torpedoes possesses decided advantages over any extensive
arrangements for exploding submarine mines by electric agency, their
employment is attended by such considerable risk of accident to
those at whose hands they receive application that, under many circum
stances which are likely to occur, they become almost as great a source
of danger to friend as to foe. Thus the operations of lowering and
mooring torpedoes, the explosion of which depends upon the application
of a blow, thrust, or pull to some portion of the machine, which is so
placed and arranged as to be in a favourable position for the applica
tion of mechanical action by a passing ship, are attended with very
great danger to those employed, unless some means are adopted for
rendering the exploding mechanism inactive until after the torpedo
has been placed in position. But the employment of a safeguard of
this kind involves a considerable amount of uncertainty as to the
torpedo being rendered active by its removal after the operation of
mooring is completed, because this very removal is frequently a dan—

 1869.          of Electricity to Naval and Military ParP oses.       491
gerous operation. Again, when once the mechanical torpedoes have
been placed in position and rendered active, they are as dangerous to
friendly ships as to the enemy; consequently their employment for
the defence of a particular tract of water completely closes it until
the torpedoes have been exploded or removed, and their removal
obviously constitutes one of the most dangerous services upon which
men can be employed. Several instances have recently occurred in
America of the destruction of ships in waters defended during the war
by mechanical torpedoes, of which it was believed that the subsequent
removal had been completely accomplished. Some improvements
have recently been made in mechanical and chemical appliances of a
self-acting nature for torpedoes, by the employment of which the
mooring arrangements can be completed with perfect safety, and the
torpedoes afterwards rendered active, by the performance of a simple
and safe operation when it is desired to close the defended water.
But the complete exclusion of friendly vessels, and the di<U+FB02>iculties
attending the raising of the torpedoes when no longer required, still
constitute formidable objections against the use of mechanical tor
pedoes, excepting in the case of tracts of water which are not ordi
narily navigated, but the passage of which in times of war might be
attempted by vessels of light draft.
    The most important advantages secured by the application of
electricity as the exploding agent of submarine mines and torpedoes
are as follows :—They may be placed in position with absolute safety
to the operators; they may be rendered active or passive at any moment
from the shore; the waters which they are employed to defend are
therefore never closed to friendly vessels until immediately before the
approach of an enemy; they can be <U+FB01>xed at any depth beneath the sur
face (while mechanical torpedoes must be situated directly or nearly
in the path of a passing ship), a circumstance which very considerably
simpli<U+FB01>es the arrangements for their application in tidal waters ; lastly,
electric torpedoes may, when no longer required, be removed with as
much safety as attended their application.
    There are two distinct systems of applying electricity to the
explosion of torpedoes. The most simple is that in which the ex
plosion of a torpedo is made dependent upon the completion of the
electric circuit by operators stationed at one or more posts of
observation on shore. The particular mode of arrangement and the
operation to be adopted depend in great measure upon the nature
of the locality to be defended by torpedoes. If this be a river or
channel, the plan of arranging and exploding torpedoes is compa
ratively simple, but will serve su<U+FB02>ieiently to illustrate the general
nature of this system of applying torpedoes. The mines are arranged
across the river or channel in rows or lines, converging towards a
station on shore, to which the conducting wires are led which are to
connect each torpedo with the exploding instrument. The operator
at this station has it in his power, therefore, to explode any one of the
                                                            2 M 2

torpedoes at will, by completion of the circuit through the particular
cable and the earth. Some other position on shore is selected as a
second station, which commands points of view intersecting the lines
of torpedoes. The operators at the two stations are placed in tele
graphic communication with each other, and when a ship is observed
by the operator at the second station to approach in the direction of
any one of the torpedoes, he will signal to the man who looks along
this line of torpedoes, and the latter will complete circuit as soon as
the vessel appears over the particular torpedo speci<U+FB01>ed. Should the
vessel alter her course in approaching the torpedoes, the operator at
the observing station will inform the man at the <U+FB01>ring station, who
will alter his arrangements accordingly. Or, the man at the observing
station, when he perceives a vessel to approach in a line with any of
the torpedoes, places the cable of that torpedo in electric connection
with the operator at the other station, and the latter will complete
the circuit through the earth to the torpedo as soon as he sees that the
vessel is over the <U+FB01>rst line of torpedoes. Other more or less elaborate
 modi<U+FB01>cations of these modes of observing and exploding have been
proposed; they all depend for ef<U+FB01>ciency upon the experience, har
monious action, and constant vigilance of the operators at the exploding
and observing stations. They are, moreover, entirely useless at night,
and in any but clear weather. They are therefore not to be compared,
in general e<U+FB01>iciency, with self-acting electric torpedoes, which are
either exploded by their collision with a ship, whereby electric circuit
is completed within them, or by the vessel striking a circuit-closing
arrangement moored near the surface of the water, whereupon either
the torpedo, moored at some depth beneath, is instantly exploded, or
a signal is furnished at the station on shore, which indicates to an
operator the particular torpedo to be exploded. The object to be
attained in these circuit-closing apparatus, which are so moored as to
be within range of a passing ship, is to oppose in the path of a vessel
a contrivance which will not be a<U+FB01>'ected by the motion of the water,
but which will complete electric circuit between the conducting cable
and the fuze, if struck in some particular part, or thrown into a
particular position, by the advancing ship. Numerous ingenious
contrivances have been proposed for this purpose and experimented
with, but in only two or three instances have satisfactory results been
attained, the conditions essential to success being numerous, and their
combined ful<U+FB01>lment not easy of attainment. Simplicity of mechanism
and a combination of su<U+FB02>icient, but not excessive, delicacy of action,
with permanence during long immersion, are among the most impor
tant objects to be aimed at in the construction of these circuit—closing
or signalling machines or self-acting torpedoes, which, if efficient,
must contribute most importantly to the success of any arrangements
for defence of a water by electric torpedoes.
    It has been shown that magneto-electric instruments cannot be
relied upon for submarine operations, on account of the perfect in
sulation of the conducting-wires, joints, &c., required to ensure success

 1869.]         of Electricity to Naval and Military Purposes.         493
with machines of that class. On the other hand, frictional machines
and also dynamo-electric machines leave little to be desired as regards
power to effect even the simultaneous ignition of numerous submarine
mines, through cables in the insulation of which, from long-continued
use, some defects exist. These instruments therefore are available as
most efficient instruments when any extensive submarine operations
have to be accomplished; but the frictional machines cannot be used
as the exploding agents in connection with any system of defence by
torpedoes, which depends for its efficiency upon the explosion at the
proper moment of only the particular torpedo over which a vessel
passes, while all surrounding torpedoes still remain intact; because, for
the reason which has been given, the explosion of the proper torpedo
will almost invariably be attended by the accidental explosion of
others which it is not desired to bring into operation. The same
objection applies, at any rate to some extent, to the dynamo~electric
machines. These two classes of instruments are therefore only sus
ceptible of certain special applications in connection with submarine
mines. There is, moreover, another general objection to the use of any
source of electricity, the action of which is entirely dependent upon
an operation to be performed at the instant that an electric discharge
is required. This consists in the fact that, although the torpedoes may
be self-acting, their ef<U+FB01>ciency is still dependent upon the vigilance and
presence of mind of an operator on shore.
     The only sources of electricity which thoroughly ful<U+FB01>l the conditions
essential to its application with perfect con<U+FB01>dence, in connection with
self—acting torpedoes, are constant voltaic batteries. By substitution
of the Abel fuze for the old platinum-wire fuze, it has become possible
to use batteries which were previously inapplicable to the explosion
of mines, because, even when employed in considerable numbers, the
quantity of electricity furnished by them is not sui<U+FB01>cient to effect the
ignition of platinum wire. Thus, a number of elements of a Daniell’s
battery or a sand battery, quite incapable of heating a platinum wire
to redness, <U+FB01>res an Abel fuze with perfect certainty. The heat developed
in the latter by the passage of a current from such a battery amply
suffices to raise to its igniting point the readily explosive priming
mixture which serves as the conductor in the fuze. Moreover the
resistance presented by the fuze is so considerable in comparison
with that offered by the longest cables which are likely to be used in
actual practice, that a current from a battery which possesses tension
su<U+FB02>icient to overcome the resistance of the fuze will explode the latter
with as much certainty, through cables of great length, as when it is
close to the battery. A number of cells of a Bunsen battery, sufficient
to ignite a piece of platinum wire several inches in length, when close
to the battery, the current of which possesses also su<U+FB02>icient tension
to ignite an Abel fuze, will be incapable of rendering a very short
piece of thin platinum wire even moderately warm, if four or <U+FB01>ve
hundred yards of ordinary conducting-wire be introduced into circuit;
but its power of exploding an Abel fuze will not have become at all

494               Mr. Abel on Applications of Electricity.    [March 12,
a<U+FB02>'ected. It is evident from this illustration that the necessity for
greatly adding to battery-power, when mines are to be exploded through
 considerable lengths of wires, which exists with the use of the wire
fuzes, is obviated by employing the new fuze; and thus one great
objection to voltaic batteries, as exploding agents in mining operations,
is set aside.    Again, the sand batteries, or Daniell batteries, which
are used for telegraphic purposes, and which, when once charged,
continue, with very little attention, in constant and good working
action for several months, may now be substituted for the batteries (cg.
 Grove’s or Bunsen’s) which it was formerly necessary to employ in
order to attain su<U+FB01>icient quantity of current, and which only continue
in good action for a few hours. Sand batteries have been repeatedly
employed at Woolwich for the explosion of fuzes, after having been
in action four or <U+FB01>ve months, with the occasional addition of a little
 water to compensate for evaporation.
     It will be seen, from the foregoing, that constant voltaic batteries
 combine more thoroughly the essential quali<U+FB01>cations of e<U+FB02>icient ex
ploding agents, in connection with any system of submarine defence,
 than all other sources of electricity at present known. They are
 simple of construction, inexpensive, require but little skill or labour
 in their production and repair, and very little attention to keep them
in constant good working order for long periods. Their action is
quite independent of any operation to be performed on shore at the
last moment; it is only necessary to place the cables leading to the
torpedoes in connection with the battery when it is desired to close a
defended watcr,—the circuit-closing portion of the torpedo, upon being
 struck by a ship at any time, will then cause the instantaneous ex
plosion of the charge. The defence by torpedoes thus becomes as
effective by night as by day ; moreover, the e<U+FB02>iciency of the constant
batteries is not more prejudicially affected by the existence of defects
 in the insulation of the cables, than that of the frictional electric
machines; and they may be used without incurring any risk of the
 unintentional explosion of torpedoes by induced currents.
     Simple and powerful forms of batteries are readily extemporized,
 and there is no more portable, simple, or economical description of
exploding instrument than the ordinary Volta-pile, for the construc
 tion and employment of which it is only necessary to provide a piece
of hard timber, some zinc and copper sheet, on old blanket, and some
vinegar and common salt. A pile, composed of 120 elements, the
plates being 2% in. diameter, is very portable, and su<U+FB01>ices to explode a
mine in single circuit, or three or four arranged in branch circuit. It
will remain in good action for at least twenty-four hours, and is
readily and expeditiously cleaned and re-charged. This apparatus
has become a favourite exploding instrument with sailors, being easily
constructed and charged anywhere, and very handy for boat-opera
tions (in connection with the employment of torpedoes as an arm of
attack), in which service more delicate instruments speedily lose in
e<U+FB01>‘iciency. Larger piles constructed on precisely the same plan are

now being used in some ships of war for the simultaneous discharge
of guns, and a very small form of pile, with water only as the exciting
agent, is the most convenient instrument for testing the fuzes and
cables of torpedoes after they are in position. It is a matter of great
importance that a positive knowledge of the efficiency of a torpedo
and its conducting wire should be obtained from time to time by
electric tests, and there is now no dii<U+FB01>culty in including the fuzes
themselves in the test. Signals may, in fact, be readily passed from
one <U+FB01>ring station to another through the fuze in a submerged torpedo,
which is arranged to be <U+FB01>red at will from the shore.
    It does not come within the scope of this discourse to enter upon a
discussion of numerous important subjects connected with the actual
use of electric torpedoes, or of the considerations involved in the
question as to how these formidable agents of defence may be most
e<U+FB02>iciently applied, in addition to, or in the absence of, artillery de
fences. The object of the discourse will have been attained if it has
been satisfactorily demonstrated that electrical science is destined to
contribute most invaluably to the e<U+FB01>iciency of a country’s defences.

On Chemical Constitution, and its Relation to Physical and Physiological
                               Properties.
OHEMIsrs have long endeavoured to answer the question, What is the
relation in which the constituents stand to one another in a com
pound? and numerous hypotheses more or less ingenious have been
devised for this purpose. Two of these modes of representing chemi
cal phenomena occupy so prominent a place in the history of the
science as to merit special notice, even in so slight and hurried a
sketch as this must be. These are, 1st, the Electro-chemical and
Radical Theory; and 2nd, the Theory of Atomicity and Chemical
    The <U+FB01>rst was the product of the genius, learning, and laborious
Structure.                                                          I
research of Berzelius; it was soon adopted by all chemists, and formed
for many years the foundation of all chemical teaching and the guide
in all chemical work. The point of view from which it regards che
mical phenomena is that of combination and decomposition, of the
union of elements to form compounds and the separation of com

496                            Dr. A. Crum Brown                     [March 19,
pounds into elements. A very important form of chemical decompo
sition is electrolysis, or the breaking up of a compound by means of
current electricity. From the nature of the case electrolysis gives
rise to a dichotomous decomposition, and this duality wasv extended to
all cases of combination and decomposition. Elements combine with
each other in pairs; these pairs may again combine in pairs, forming
compounds of the second order, and so on. Thus calcium combines
with oxygen to form lime, sulphur combines with oxygen to form sul
phuric acid, and sulphuric acid combines with lime to form sulphate
of lime. This union of compounds with compounds was not supposed
to depend on a union of the constituents of the one with the con
 stituents of the other, but to be a combination of the one as a whole
 with the other as a Whole; not a combination of the calcium of the
 lime with the sulphur or with the oxygen of the sulphuric acid, or of
 the sulphur of the sulphuric acid with the oxygen of the lime, but of
 the lime as such with the sulphuric acid as such.
     This view may be illustrated by a reference to the relations of
 human life. Individuals unite to form partnerships or corporations,
 and these may again enter into alliances, although the members of the
 one allied corporation may be altogether unacquainted and uncon
 nected with the members of the other.
      But the progress of discovery brought to light facts which seemed
 to contradict this View of binary combination. Cases were observed
 in which a compound of two elements united directly with an element,
 and to meet this new class of facts the theory was modi<U+FB01>ed by the
 introduction of the notion of Radicals. A Radical was a compound
 which acts like an element.
      The simile introduced above may be used to illustrate this exten
 sion of the theory. Some combinations of men (corporations) can be
 treated as individuals, can enter into legal relations with individuals,
 while others cannot; so some compounds can unite with elements,
 while others have not this capability.
      The Theory of Atomicity regards chemical phenomena from an
 altogether di<U+FB01>'erent point of view. In it the various substances are
 considered as modi<U+FB01>cations of one another rather than as compounds.
 The rise of this mode of viewing chemical phenomena may be traced
 from the early papers by Dumas, and by Laurent, on Substitution. lt
  appears more prominently in the position given to double decompo
  sition as the representative of all chemical action, by Laurent and
  Gerhardt, in the types of Gerhardt and Williamson, in Frankland’s
 theory of the organo-metallic bodies, and in its extension by Kolbe to
 the compounds of carbon. It was reserved, however, for Kekulé to
 combine these ideas into a consistent theory.* The theory has been
     * It is right to observe that although Kekulé has used this theory with the
 most eminent success, both in the explanation of facts already known, and in
 the discovery of new chemical relations, he does not exclude the possibility of the
 union of compounds with each other to form compounds of a second order.

1869.]                    on Chemical Constitution.                     497
further elaborated by Butlerow, to whom we owe the name “ Chemical
Structure,” by Erlenmeyer, and by many others, and it has been
adopted and applied with slight modi<U+FB01>cations by almost all chemists
engaged in organic research.
     According to this theory the typical form of chemical action is
what we may call the chemical exchange. To illustrate this idea we
may consider the simplest case; that of double decomposition where
two molecules act on one another to produce two new molecules.
     Chloride of sodium, for instance, acts on nitrate of silver, pro
ducing chloride of silver and nitrate of sodium. Comparing chloride
of sodium and chloride of silver, we at once see that while there are
important respects in which the sodium and the silver differ as to the
nature of their union with chlorine (thus the amount of work required
to separate the metal from the chlorine is very different in the two
cases) still, from one point of view (and that is the point of view taken
by the atomicity theory), the silver may be said to replace or to be
substituted for the sodium. In the same way a cup <U+FB01>lled with mercury
is very different from the same cup <U+FB01>lled with water; and the relation
 of the mercury to the cup differs in many respects (such as pressure
and adhesion) from the relation of the water to the cup; but they
 agree in this, that the cup is <U+FB01>lled in both cases. In the same way the
 chlorine is said to be saturated by the sodium or the silver, although
 the intimacy or <U+FB01>rmness of the combination is not the same in the
 two cases.
      We may also consider this double decomposition from the other
 side. As the silver and sodium have changed places, so the chlorine
 has changed place with the rest of the nitrate of silver—with what in
 the nitrate of silver is not silver; or, representing the action in symbols
 (NaCl + AgNO, = AgCl + NaNOS) Cl and NO, have changed places.
      In this example we have one atom or group replacing one other
 atom or group; but all cases of double decomposition are not of so
 simple a kind. Thus, when water is treated with pentachloride of
 phosphorus we <U+FB01>nd that one atom of oxygen (from the water) replaces,
 and is replaced by, two atoms of chlorine from the pentachloride;
 thus, PCl, -|-- H20 = PCl3O + 2 HCl.         So that while the two atoms
  of hydrogen were formerly united to one atom of oxygen and formed
 with it one molecule, they are, after the change, each united to a
  separate atom of chlorine and form with them two molecules.
      Oxygen, therefore, in this case (and, as far as we know, in all
  cases) enters into two relations, while hydrogen, chlorine, silver, and
  sodium only enter into one. In a similar way it has been shown that
 the different elements have different “atomicities” or enter into
  different numbers of relations. It is to this “polyatomicity,” or
  multiple-relatedness, that the complexity of compounds is due ; for it
  is obvious that by the union together of several multiply-related atoms
  a very complicated structure may be produced.
      In the case of a compound containing only two atoms, such as
  chloride of sodium, there is clearly only one way in which it can

 498                       Dr. A. Crum Brown                  [March 19,
 break into residues; but a complex substance containing many atoms
 may, and generally does, break in di<U+FB01>'erent ways when acted on by
 different substances; and it is by the study of these ways of decom
 position of a substance, and by the study of the ways in which by
 means of double decomposition it can be produced, that we arrive at a
 knowledge of its structure, that is, of the mutual relation of its atoms.
     But the multiple-relatedness of some atoms produces a further
 complication, producing a kind of chemical action, which, while still a
 chemical exchange, cannot be called double decomposition. In double
 decomposition we saw that each molecule breaks into residues which
 change places with the residues of the other molecule, and that this
 breaking into residues results from the rupture of one or more
relations between pairs of atoms. But where we have multiply
related atoms, it may happen that such a rupture takes place without
 a separation of the residues, these being retained in combination by
some other relation of their multiply-related atoms. To illustrate
this we may compare the action of anhydrous potash, K20, and of
anhydrous lime, CaO, on water.
     Using graphic formulae, we have in these two cases :—
                                                                     ®
     Here the dotted lines indicate the relations ruptured ; and it will
be seen that, while in the <U+FB01>rst case the rupture produces a separation
into two residues, in the second case it does not; what would other
wise be residues remaining united, on account of the double-relatedness
of the calcium atom.
    From this examination of chemical exchange, it will be obvious
that no operation of this kind can produce a change in the “atomicity”
of an atom; for, for every relation ruptured, a new one is entered into.
But we have no reason to suppose that all chemical action is of this
kind; and there are numerous phenomena which it is very dif<U+FB01>cult
to explain, except by the assumption that there is another kind of
chemical action, in which the number of relations of an atom is
increased or diminished. Such actions are those by which we pass
from one series of compounds to another. Thus the ferrous salts are
connected together by processes of exchange; but it is only by making
new hypotheses that we can thus explain the passage from the ferrous

 1869.]                   on Chemical Constitution.                    499
 to the ferric salts. Similar relations exist between the manganous
 salts, the manganic salts, the manganates, and the permanganates, where
 a consideration of each group, apart from the others, would lead us to
 a different atomicity for manganese; and many other examples might
 be given of the same kind. The speaker considered it, in the mean
 time, to be better to regard each such series separately, rather than, by
 an attempt to bring all chemical processes under one class, to endanger
 the stability of the theory of chemical structure which, while it is
 probably not destined, in its present form, to remain as a permanent
 part of the great edi<U+FB01>ce of the science, is certainly a most convenient
 scaffolding, not easy to replace, and not hastily to be thrown down.
     Having thus seen what is meant by chemical structure, and how
 we arrive at a knowledge of it by a study of the history of the sub
 stance, of the ways in which it may be formed and in which it may be
 decomposed; we may now glance at the relations which exist between
 the chemical structure of a substance and its physical and physiological
 properties. We shall consider specially two of the physical characters
 of matter, volatility and colour, and examine in what way these are
 modi<U+FB01>ed by the performance upon the substance of certain speci<U+FB01>ed
 chemical operations. The volatility of a substance depends upon two
 things :—-1st, the temperature at which the substance boils under a
 particular pressure; and, 2nd, the change of boiling-point produced by
 a change of pressure. In order, therefore, fully to know the volatility
 of a substance, its boiling-point must be determined through a very
great range of pressure. This involves great labour; and only a few
substances have been thus fully examined. Almost all we know on
this interesting question is due to the ingenious and patient experi
ments of Regnault. These do not, as yet, furnish us with su<U+FB01>icient
data to enable us to deduce anything like a law. They show us, how
ever, that a mere comparison of boiling-points under an arbitrarily
selected pressure (such as 760 millimetres, which happens to be the
mean pressure of the atmosphere) cannot lead us to a law, as the
boiling-points of two substances are frequently changed very un
equally by a change of pressure.
     Such comparisons of boilingepoints have been made, and from
them have been deduced, especially by Kopp, a series of very interest
ing, and certainly not fortuitous coincidences. That distinguished
chemist and physicist has shown that, in a very large number of
instances, the same change of chemical structure produces nearly the
same change of boiling-point. These “laws” of Kopp are only
approximate, and are not even approximate in the cases where the
boiling-points of the substances‘ compared are very differently changed
by change of pressure.
     Turning to the other physical character which has been men
tioned, namely colour, we see at once a marked regularity.          As a
rule, substances belonging to the same series differ from one another
in degree rather than in kind of colour; while in passing from one

  500          Dr. A. Cram Brown on Chemical Constitution.     [March 19,
  series to another, we observe that the colour undergoes a total change
  of character. This is well illustrated by comparing the colours of
  substances belonging to such series as the ferrous salts, the ferric
  salts, the ferrates; the manganous salts, the manganic salts, the
  manganatcs and the permanganates; the euprous and cupric salts,
  the chromous and chromic salts, the chromates and perchromic acid.
  Possibly such changes of colour as we see in the transformation of
  rosaniline and its derivatives into leukaniline and analogous bodies,
  and of blue into white indigo, may be cases of the same kind. It is
   also interesting to note, that while the nitro-substitution products of
  the aromatic series are generally yellow, all the known substances
   of the same kind in the fatty series are colourless.
       These considerations of colour would naturally incline us to
  regard the operations which lead from one series to another as different
  in kind from those which lead from one member to another of the
  same series; and when we examine the physiological action of bodies
  of the same, and of different series, this impression is greatly
  strengthened.
       The speaker described in some detail a few of the observations
- made within the last two years by Dr. T. R. Fraser and himself,
   pointing out the similarity of the action of substances belonging to
  the same series, and the remarkable change of physiological action
  produced by those chemical changes which lead from one series to
  another. The illustrations were drawn from the natural alkaloids—a
   group of substances containing trebly-related nitrogen, and those
  derivatives of the alkaloids which contain <U+FB01>vefold-related nitrogen.
  It was shown that the salts of the alkaloids, although containing <U+FB01>ve
  fold-related nitrogen, were not adapted for this comparison, on account
  of the readiness with which they lose acid in the presence of alka
  line substances, their nitrogen thus returning to the trebly-related
  condition. The bodies formed by the addition of a compound of
  methyl have not this disadvantage; and as the nitrogen in them is
  permanently <U+FB01>vefold-related, their physiological action may be satis
  factorily compared with that of the alkaloids themselves.
       The experiments loading to a knowledge of the action of strychnia
  and of the salts of methyl-strychnium were described; and it was
  shown that while the former acts by exciting the origins of the motor
  nerves in the spinal cord, the latter act by diminishing the action and
  ultimately paralyzing the terminations of the same nerves in the
  muscles. Similar relations exist between brucia and methyl-brucium,
  thebaia and the salts of methyl-thebaium, morphia and the salts of
  methyl-morphium, &c. Indeed, it may be stated generally that, as far
  as observation goes, compounds of trebly-related nitrogen exert an
  action totally different in kind from similar compounds of <U+FB01>vefold
  related nitrogen, that a similar difference exists between the triatomic
  and pentatomic compounds of other members of the nitrogen family,
  and that this principle appears to be of still wider, and probably
  general, application.

     The speaker, in conclusion, drew attention to the peculiar interest
attaching to those regions of science which lie on the frontiers
between two distinct departments, as on their successful exploration
would depend the ultimate fusion of all physical sciences into one, the
science of dynamics, the science which treats of matter and energy,
and their relations to one another. Such a fusion is probably very
remote; but we now see in the border-land between chemistry and
physics that slow process of absorption going on which has already
converted the once independent sciences of sound, light, heat, elec
tricity, and magnetism into more or less completely subjugated pro
vinces of the great empire of applied mathematics. If we believe in
the unity of the plan of creation we must believe that this process will
advance and ultimately triumph.

      SIR HENRY HOLLAND, Bart. M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. President,

           On the Temperature and Animal Life of the Deep Sea.
THE results of recent inquiries into the condition of the abyssal
depths of the Ocean, tend to prove :—-that notwithstanding their
apparently profound stillness, undisturbed by the storms which
agitate the surface, an incessant motion is everywhere taking place
in them, which exerts a most important moderating in<U+FB02>uence on what
would otherwise be the intolerable heat of the Equatorial and the
unbearable cold of the Polar regions, and thus a<U+FB02>'ects the distribution
of Animal and Vegetable life, alike on land and in the ocean waters :—
that the line of demarcation which has been supposed to separate their
dreary wastes from the comparatively shallow stratum (300 fathoms) to
which life has been af<U+FB01>rmed to be restricted, has no real existence;
but that whilst the ocean bottom in one region may be as barren as
Sahara, it may in another, though at ten times the depth, be teeming
with varied forms of organizationz-that notwithstanding the tre_
mendous pressure exerted by the superincumbent mass (amounting to
nearly 3 lbs. per square inch of surface for every fathom of depth,
and thus to 3000 lbs. per square inch at a depth of 1100 fathoms),
animals of the softest conceivable texture can “live and move and
have their being” without suffering any inconvenience from the
burden :—that not even the total privation of Light, which the
highest authorities have af<U+FB01>rmed to be essential to the existence of
life,* prevents these rayless depths of ocean from supporting a vast
and continuous mass of Animal life, which is actively engaged in
forming a Oalcareous deposit over the bed of the Atlantic; a deposit
    * “ Organization, sensation, voluntary motion, life," said Lavoisier, “ only exist
on the surface of the earth, and in places exposed to light. It might indeed be
said that the fable of Prometheus was the expression of a philosophical truth
which had not escaped the penetration of the ancients. Without light, nature
were without life and without soul; a bene<U+FB01>cent God, in shedding light over
creation, strewed the surface of the earth with organization, with sensation, and
with thought.”—“ These words,” says Dumas (‘ The Chemical and Physiological
Balance of Organic Nature,’ p. 8), " are as true as they-are eloquent.”

504                 Dr. Carpenter on the Temperature             [April 9,
which, when hereafter raised above the waters, so as to form dry land,
will be designated by the Geologist of the future as Chalk :—and
lastly, that in these abyssal depths are preserved in continued exist
ence many types of organization which had been supposed to have
long since become extinct ; revealing themselves as living denizens of
the present epoch, when brought to the surface by the searching
dredge of the Naturalist, just as the reminiscences of our past lives,
stored up in the hidden chambers of our “ under sou ,” are called up
in the process of recollection when groped for with the right clue of
Association.
    It had been the good fortune of the speaker to bear a part in these
inquiries: a proposal for a deep-sea dredging expedition, which
originated with his friend Prof. Wyville Thomson, of Belfast,
having been brought by him last June before the President and
Council of the Royal Society, and by them strongly recommended
to the Admiralty ; which, on the strong recommendation of the Hydro
grapher, assigned for the service the surveying vessel ‘Lightning,’ and
provided her with the best appliances that could be got ready on so
short a notice. The work of the expedition, which was placed under
the scienti<U+FB01>c charge of the speaker, was specially directed to the
exploration of the deep channel which lies between the north of
Scotland and the Faroe Islands; and although necessarily limited in
time, and much interfered with by bad weather, it a<U+FB02>'orded results of
great interest, in regard both to the Physics and the Animal Life of
the Ocean depths.
    I. The current belief among Physical Geographers in regard to the
temperature of the deep sea had been that it is everywhere 39°; de
scending towards that point in the Equatorial region, from a surface
temperature of between 75° and 85°, in proportion to the depth to which
the thermometer is sunk, and falling to 39° at about 1200 fathoms;
whilst it ascends towards that point in the Polar region, as the ther
mometer sinks through the ice-cold waters nearer the surface, until it
rises to 39° at a depth of about 750 fathoms. Between the Equatorial
and the Polar regions it has been supposed possible to draw a boundary
line at which the temperature of the sea is 39° at all depths ; and this
line in the Antarctic ocean, of which the local temperature seems com
paratively little disturbed by currents, has been set at 56:];0 south lat.
This doctrine mainly rests upon the temperature-soundings taken in
Sir James Ross’s expedition; which were not inconsistent with the
prevalent belief that sea-water, like fresh water, has its maximum
density at this temperature, and that, consequently, still water at
32° or 33° cannot underlie water at 39°.
    Several instances, however, had been recorded, in which tempera
tures below 39° had been observed; but these were regarded as mere
local exceptions, depending upon particular currents. The most re
markable of such observations, made by General Sabine more than
<U+FB01>fty years ago, in Captain (afterwards Sir John) Ross’s arctic voyage,

1869.]               and Animal Life of the Deep Sea.               505
was thus chronicled in his journal :—“ Having sounded, on Sept. 19,
1818, in 750 fathoms, the registering thermometer was sent down to
680 fathoms, and on coming up the index of greatest cold was at 25%".
Never having known it lower than 28° in former instances, I was very
careful in examining the thermometer, but could discover no other
reason for it than the actual coldness of the water.” Strange as this
record seems, it is by no means incredible ; for, as the careful experi
ments of Despretz have since shown, Sea-water, although it ordinarily
freezes at 27%", may be cooled down to 25%0 without freezing, if kept
free from agitation; whilst, instead of expanding as its temperature
falls (which is the case with fresh water below 39°), it continues to
contract, so as to acquire its greatest density at 255° ; which tempera
ture, therefore, might be expected to be that of the still depths of
Polar seas, when not disturbed by the intrusion of any warmer
currents.
    Now the ‘ Lightning’ temperature-soundings gave a minimum tempe
rature of from 32° to 33'7° through a considerable part of the deep
channel (from 500 to 600 fathoms) lying E.N.E. and W. S.W. between
the north of Scotland and the Faroe banks, the surface-temperature
being about 52°; and it is probable that if there be any error in the
observations (all of which rest on the agreement of at least two thermo
meters), it is that the temperatures were not registered low enough by
these thermometers, in consequence of the pressure of 100 atmospheres
or more on their bulbs. Though it cannot be positively asserted that
these minima were the bottom-temperatures of the area in question, this
may be considered next to certain, for the following reasons :—1. It is
improbable that water at 32° should overlie water at any higher tem
perature, which is speci<U+FB01>cally lighter than itself, unless two strata
have a motion in different directions su<U+FB02>iciently rapid to be recog
nizable. 2. The nature of the Animal life found on the bottom of
this cold area exhibited (as will presently appear) a marked corre
spondence with its presumed depression of temperature. 3. At a
depth of 170 fathoms in the cold area, the minimum was found to be
41'7° ; which is just what might be expected at that depth, if the tem
perature progressively descends with the increase of depth.—The
positive determination of this question, however, may be expected
from the temperature-soundings to be taken this summer; in which
means will be adopted for ascertaining the temperature at every
50 or 100 fathoms in the same sounding.
    On the other hand, in other parts of the same channel, at the very
same depths, and with the same surface-temperature (never varying
much from 52°), the minimum temperature was never less than 47°;
and where this prevailed, not only was Animal life far more abundant,
but its type was that of the warmer temperate seas.
    It does not seem possible to account for the existence of two such
very different Submarine Climates within so short a distance of each
other, save on the hypothesis that the water which is 8° or 10° warmer
than what may be regarded as the normal temperature of the latitude,
                                                            2 N 2

r.                      Dr. Carpenter on the Temperature                       [April 9,
has come thither from some region nearer the Equator, whilst the
water which is 6° or 8° colder than the normal temperature of the
latitude, has come thither from some region nearer the Pole. How
far the <U+FB01>rst of these phenomena is attributable to what is properly
called the “Gulf Stream ”—that is, to the current of heated water
which issues from the Gulf of Mexico, and can be traced for a great
distance across the Atlantic, in a N.E. direction—is a matter still
open to discussion. But that it is not attributable to surface-drift,
seems perfectly clear from the depth to which the excess of warmth
extends. And the two facts taken together may with con<U+FB01>dence be
taken as an example of that continual interchange between the oceanic
waters of Equatorial and Polar regions, which is as much a physical
necessity as that interchange of air which has so large a share in the
production of winds. For the water that is cooled in the Polar seas
must sink and displace the water that is warmer than itself, pushing
it away towards the equator ; so that in the deepest parts of the ocean
there will be a progressive movement in the equatorial direction;
whilst, conversely, the warm water of the Tropical sea, being the lighter,
will spread itself north and south over the surface of the ocean, and
 will thus move towards the polar regions, losing its heat as it ap
 proaches them, until it is there so much reduced in temperature as to
 sink to the bottom, and thus return towards its source.
      A set of temperature-soundings recently taken across the Arabian
 Gulf, between Aden and Bombay, by Captain Shortland, in H.M.S.
 ‘Hydra,’ give a line of bottom-temperature of 335° Fahr. at depths
 exceeding 1800 fathoms, the surface-temperature being 75°. It seems
 impossible to account for this fact on any other hypothesis than that
 of a deep current from the Antarctic Polar region, which must have
 maintained this extremely low temperature throughout the vast course
  it had to traverse.
       II. The collective results of the deep-sea Dredgings recently
 carried on by the Swedish Government under the direction of Pro
 fessor Sars and his son, by the United States coast survey under the
 direction of Count Pourtales, and by the ‘Lightning’ expedition
 under the direction of the speaker, have conclusively established the
 justice of the inference previously drawn by Dr. Wallich from the more
 restricted data collected by the Sounding apparatus,‘ as to the existence
 of a varied and abundant submarine Fauna, at depths which have been
 generally supposed to be either altogether azoic, or tenanted only by
 animals of very low type. The dredgings obtained in N. lat. 59° 36'
      * The earliest recorded fact of this class still remains one of the most interesting.
 In the Arctic expedition of Captain Ross, in 1818, a sounding having been taken
 at a depth of 1000 fathoms, the line brought up a magni<U+FB01>cent Axtrophyton (then
  known as Asterias Caput Medusa), which according to the distinct recollection of
  General Sabine, who was a member of that expedition, must have come from the
 bottom; since it was partly imbedded in very soft greenish mud into which the
 heavy deep-sea weight had sunk.

1869.]               and Animal Life of the Deep Sea.                507
and W. long. 7° 20', at a depth of 530 fathoms and a minimum tem
perature of 47%", included an extraordinary collection of Siliceous
Sponges and Foraminifera, with Zoophytea, Echinoderms, Mollushs,
Annelidshand Crustaceans; and among them two specimens of the little
Rhizocrinus (to be presently noticed more particularly), whose recent
discovery by M. Sars on the coast of Norway had furnished a principal
“motive” of this expedition. And a single dredging subsequently
taken in N. lat. 61° 2’ and W. long. 12° 4’, at the depth of 650 fathoms
and a minimum temperature of 46°, gave evidence of the like variety,
though the specimens obtained were less numerous and more frag
mentary. These two dredgings, it is believed, are by far the deepest
that have yet been taken; and the facility with which they were
obtained fully justi<U+FB01>es the belief that no serious di<U+FB01>iculty will be
found in the way of the exploration of the ocean bottom by means of
the Dredge at depths twice as great.
    III. The results of the ‘Lightning’ dredgings seem to warrant
the conclusion that the distribution of Animal life in the deep sea is
much more closely related to the temperature of the water than to its
depth. No contrast could well be more striking than that which
presented itself within a distance of 50 miles between the Fauna of
the warm and that of the cold area: the former containing, with the
animals proper to the locality, a number of forms hitherto known only
as inhabitants of the warmer temperate seas; whilst the far more
scanty aggregate of the latter consisted to a great extent of animals
of a proper Boreal type, of which few were met with elsewhere even as
far north as the Faroe Islands. And whilst the bottom itself was for
the most part composed, in the warm area, of the Globigerina mud,
the presence of which (as Dr. Wallich pointed out) seems to go along
with the Gulf stream, it consisted in the cold area of stones and sand,
the latter including many particles of distinctly volcanic minerals,
indicative of a probable derivation from Iceland or Labrador.—The
comparatively shallow bank in this cold area, at which a temperature
of 41-7" was found at a depth of 170 fathoms, presented a Fauna dis
tinctly intermediate between that of the colder and that of the warmer
area; the intermixture of the proper Boreal forms being less, and its
predominant character being that which might be expected from its
geographical position, with which its temperature closely accorded.
    IV. The remarkable fact has been ascertained, that two deposits
may be taking place within a few miles of each other, at the same depth '
and on the same geological horizon (the area of one penetrating, so to
speak, the area of the other), of which the Mineral character and the
Fauna are alike different ;—that difference being due on the one hand
to the direction of the current which has furnished their materials, and
on the other to the temperature of the water brought by that current.
If the “cold area ” were to be raised above the surface, so that the
deposit at present in progress upon its bottom should become the

  508                     Dr. Carpenter on the Temperature                 [April 9,
   subject of examination by some Geologist of the future, he would <U+FB01>nd
  this to consist of a barren Sandstone, including fragments of older
  rocks, the scanty Fauna of which would in great degree bear a boreal
  character; whilst if a portion of the“ warm area” were elevated at
  the same time with the “ cold area,” the Geologist would be perplexed
  by the stratigraphical continuity with the preceding of a Cretaceous
  formation, the production of which entirely depends upon the ex
  tensive development of the humblest forms of Animal life under the
   in<U+FB02>uence of an elevated temperature, and which includes not only
  an extraordinary abundance of Sponges, but a great variety of other
  animal remains, several of them belonging to the warmer temperate
  regions; and he would naturally suppose these widely different
  climatic conditions to have prevailed at different periods. And yet
  they have been shown to exist simultaneously, at corresponding depths,
  over wide contiguous areas of the sea-bottom; in virtue solely of the
  fact that one area is traversed by an Equatorial and the other by a
  Polar current.—Further, in the midst of the land formed by the eleva
  tion of the “cold area,” our Geologist would <U+FB01>nd a hill some 1800
  feet high, covered with a Sandstone continuous with that of the land
  from which it rises, but rich in remains of animals belonging to a more
  temperate province ; and might easily fall into the mistake of supposing
  that two such different Faunse occurring at different levels must in
  dicate two distinct climates separated in time; instead of indicating,
  as they have been shown to do, two contemporaneous but dissimilar
  climates, separated only by a few miles horizontally and by 300
  fathoms vertically.
        V. But further, the examination of the sample brought up by the
  ‘ Lightning ’ dredgings, of the Fauna of the Chalk-like deposit now in
  progress over the warm area, has shown that it presents many points
  of most interesting relationship to the fauna of the Cretaceous period.
  Thus of the Siliceous Sponges which were obtained in such remark
  able abundance, some correspond so precisely in structure of the
  Ventriculites of the Chalk, that their identity cannot be doubted,
  although in the process of fossilization the original material of the
  skeleton has been replaced by carbonate of lime, to be itself applied
  to the solidi<U+FB01>cation of Sponges of another type in the production of
  Flints.* Again, the speaker stated that he had found the microscopic
      ‘' The mode in which the Silex which furnished the material of <U+FB02>ints was <U+FB01>rst
  separated from the ocean-waters, has long been an unsolved problem.     By Ehren
' berg the aid of hypothetical beds of siliceous Diatoms and Polycz/sttna which were
  subsequently removed by solution, has been invoked to account for it.   But all the
  examinations which have been made of samples of the Globigerina-rnud have in
  dicated that where this great calcareous deposit is taking place, the production of
  minute siliceous organisms is extremely limited. On the other hand, the vast
  multiplication of Siliceous Sponges, and the extension of their root-<U+FB01>bres through
  the Globigerina-mud on the surface of which they'grow, furnishes a depot of silex,
  which, if re-dissolved, would afford ample material for the solidi<U+FB01>cation of other
  sponges into <U+FB02>ints.

 Xanthidia, so common in sections of Flint, attached to a <U+FB01>lamentous
 substance entangled in fragments of Sponges washed out from the
 Globigerina—mud. Further, among Mollusca there were two Terebra—
 tulidze, of which one at least (Terebratulina caput-serpentis) may be
 certainly identi<U+FB01>ed with a Cretaceous species, whilst the second
 (Waldheimia cranium) may be fairly regarded as representing, if not
 lineally descended from, another of the types of that family so
 abundant in the chalk. Among Echinoderms the most interesting
was the little Rhizocrinus, that carries us back to the Apiocrinite tribe
which <U+FB02>ourished in the Oolitic period, and which was until lately
supposed to have had its last representative in the Bourgetticrinus of
the Chalk, to which the Rhizocrinus presents many points of remark
able correspondence.* Among Zoophytes, the Oculina met with in a
living state seems generically allied to a Cretaceous type.
     It can scarcely be doubted that a more systematic examination of
the remarkable Formation at present in progress would place in a still
stronger light the intimacy of the relationship of its Fauna to that of
the Cretaceous period; and if this view should be con<U+FB01>rmed by further
inquiry, it would go far to prove, what seems on general grounds
highly probable, that the deposit of Globigerina-mud has been going
on, over some part or other of the North Atlantic sea-bed, from the
 Cretaceous epoch to the present time (as there is much reason to
think that it did elsewhere in anterior Geological periods), this mud
being not merely a Chalk-formation, but a continuation of the Chalk
formation; so that we may be said to be still living in the Cretaceous
Epoch. For, as was pointed out by Professor Wyville Thomson, in the
letter which gave occasion to the ‘ Lightning ’ cruise, the oscillations of
the earth’s crust in the northern portion of the Northern hemisphere
do not appear to have ranged much above 1000 feet since the com
mencement of the Tertiary epoch; so that an immense area of the
North Atlantic must have been continuously submerged throughout
the Tertiary and Quaternary periods; while, for the reasons already
mentioned, there must have been a continual movement of the Equa
torial waters towards the Polar region.
     VI. It is obvious that the facts previously stated throw a great light
on the changes which Palaeontological research proves to have often
taken place in the Marine Fauna of any particular area, without any
corresponding changes in its own Geological condition. For as there
must have been deep seas in all Geological periods, so there must have
been varieties in Submarine Climate at least as great as those discovered
by the ‘ Lightning ’ temperature-soundings; depending upon those
Equatorial and Polar Currents, whose existence has been shown to be
a Physical necessity.      Hence it is obvious that since changes in the
    * This most remarkable animal, <U+FB01>rst discovered by M. Sars, near the_Lo<U+FB02>‘oden
Islands, has been since obtained not only in the ‘ Lightning ’ dredgings, but
also by Count Pourtales in the Gulf of Mexico.

direction of such opposing currents must have been produced by any
upward or downward movement of the sea-bottom (as in the areas of
elevation and subsidence marked out by Mr. Darwin in our existing
seas), a considerable modi<U+FB01>cation, or even a complete reversal, of the
Submarine Climates of adjacent areas might have been consequent
upon alterations in the contour of the land, or in the level of the sea
bottom, at a great distance,—perhaps thousands of miles off.
     A renewal and extension of the Researches of which the more
general results have thus been stated, having been asked for by the
Council of the Royal Society at the hands of her Majesty’s Govern
ment, adequate provision has been made by the Admiralty with this
object; and H.M. surveying vessel ‘ Porcupine ’ will be employed during
the ensuing season in the prosecution of them, with all the appliances
which science and experience can suggest as likely to be serviceable.
It may be con<U+FB01>dently hoped that, unless the weather should prove ex
ceptionally unfavourable, very important additions will be made by
this expedition to our knowledge of the Temperature and Life of the
Deep Sea.
     The speaker thus concluded :-“ The facts I have now brought
before you, still more the speculations which I have ventured to connect
with them, may seem to unsettle much that has been generally
accredited in Geological science, and thus to diminish rather than to
augment our stock of positive knowledge; but this is the necessary
result of the introduction of a new idea into any department of scien
ti<U+FB01>c inquiry. Like the <U+FB02>ood which tests the security of every founda
tion that stands in the way of its onward rush, overthrowing the house
built only on the sand, but leaving unharmed the edi<U+FB01>ce which rests
secure on the solid rock, so does a new method of research, a new
series of facts, or a new application of facts previously known, come
to bear with impetuous force on a whole fabric of doctrine, and subject
 it to an undermining power which nothing can resist, save that which
rests on the solid rock of Truth. And it is here that the moral value of
scienti<U+FB01>c study, pursued in a spirit worthy of its elevated aims, pre
eminently shows itself. For, as was grandly said by Schiller* in his
admirable contrast between the trader in science and the true philo
sopher,--‘ New discoveries in the <U+FB01>eld of his activity which depress the
one, enrapture the other. Perhaps they <U+FB01>ll a chasm which the growth
of his ideas had rendered more wide and unseemly; or they place the
last stone, the only one wanting, to the completion of the structure of
his ideas. But even should they shiver it into ruins, should a new
  cries of ideas, a new aspect of nature, a newly-discovered law in the
physical world, overthrow the whole fabric of his knowledge, he has
always loved truth better than his system, and gladly will he exchange her
old and defective form for a new and fairer one.’ ”            [W B G]

                  WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                         Friday, April 16, 1869.
      SIR HENRY HOLLAND, Bart. M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. President,
                                 in the Chair.
                   WILLIAM CARRUTHERs, Esq. F.L.S.
                The Cryptogamic Forests of the Coal Period.
THE student of fossil botany encounters greater di<U+FB02>iculties in his
efforts to restore the vegetation of former epochs in the earth’s history,
than those which beset the labours of the comparative anatomist in
his restoration of extinct animals. These di<U+FB01>iculties arise chie<U+FB02>y
from two causes: First, the absence in the vegetable kingdom of a
substance which would resist decay like the solid skeleton found in all
the vertebrate, and in many of the invertebrate members of the animal
kingdom, causes the fragments of plants which have escaped decom
position to be preserved much less perfectly than the remains of
animals. Carbonaceous stains or amorphous casts are the most fre
quent indications of the former vegetation of the globe; specimens
exhibiting structure are comparatively rare; and it is such specimens
only that give certain evidence of the nature and affinities of the
organisms to which they belong.
    The other serious source of di<U+FB01>iculty arises from the fact that no
relative proportions exist among the different parts of a vegetable
individual.   The size of the leaf, the <U+FB02>ower, or the fruit, can give no
indication of the size of the plant. Indeed, these are more frequently
found large in humble plants which never rise above the surface of
the ground than in large trees. And this is true, not only in the
general, but even among members of the same natural group; where
great differences exist in the size of the individuals, no corresponding
differences are to be found in the parts of which they are composed.
Thus the foliage and fruit of our only indigenous pine—the Scotch
<U+FB01>r——are greater than those of the mammoth Wellingtonia of California;
and the fruit of the small willow (Salim herbacea, L.), which covers
with a dense carpet the summits of some of the higher mountains of
Scotland, is as large as that of the huge willows which ornament the
margins of our English rivers. On the other hand, the different parts
of an animal possess such relations to each other in size, form, and
structure that a zoologist has not so di<U+FB02>icult a task before him in
restoring, even from imperfect materials, the general aspect of an
extinct animal.                '

512                         Mr. W. Carrathers                    [April 16,
    I state these di<U+FB01>iculties which face us at the very threshold of our
investigations, not to magnify the work before us this evening, but to
account for the comparatively little progress that has been made in
the interpretation of extinct <U+FB02>oras, and for the great diversity of opinion
that exists among botanists as to the systematic position of numerous
fossil plants; and further to account for the very large number of genera
and species which have been established on imperfect and fragmentary
materials, the systematic position of which is consequently indeter
minable.
    The progressive accumulation of observations, and the more care
ful preservation of instructive specimens in local and private museums
are supplying the means of dealing with fossil botany after a different
method. The most important recent advances in this science have
been made in uniting the separate fragments,—roots and stems, leaves
and fruits,—described under different names and placed in different
and often widely separated genera, so as to build up vegetable in
dividuals, the systematic position and a<U+FB02>inities of which can be under
stood.
    These observations are specially true in regard to the vegetation
of the Coal Period. Little information has been obtained from the
vast stores of the carbonized remains of the plants of this period
which are ever being brought under the inspection of man in the form
of coal, for this material is so completely altered as to be almost
destitute of structure. The best preserved plants occur in the beds
of shale which accompany the coal, or are obtained from earthy
nodules in the coal itself, which injure its marketable value, and are
consequently got rid of by the miners.
     We may at once set aside that great division of the vegetable
kingdom with which we are most familiar, comprising all plants
that have true <U+FB02>owers and seeds, and con<U+FB01>ne our attention to the
more obscure cryptogamous plants which are destitute of <U+FB02>owers, and
for seeds have bodies of much simpler structure called spores. The
cryptogams are either wholly cellular in their composition, like
the mosses and sea-weeds, or they are composed partly of cells and
partly of vessels, like the ferns and club-mosses.
     If we except some supposed Algae, no traces of true cellular plants
have been hitherto detected in the coal measures. The long-continued
maceration to which the coal plants were subjected when the beds
composed of their remains were forming on the surface of the earth,
and the subsequent changes they have undergone, have reduced to one
common structureless mass the varied vegetation of which the coal is
composed. One of the <U+FB01>rst results of these operations would be the
 disappearance of the cellular plants, which under the then existing
 very favourable conditions must have abounded; just as the soft
 cellular parts are almost always destroyed of those specimens which
have been so favourably situated as to have their vascular tissue
preserved.
     Excluding then the cellular cryptogams, we may shortly consider

 1869.]       on the Cryptogamic Forests of the Coal Period.         513
the classi<U+FB01>cation and structure of the vascular forms. They are
divided into four groups, all of which are represented in the indi
genous Flora of Britain.
      1. Ferns (Filices).   Polypody, Brake, Spleenwort, &c.
     II. Horse-tails (Eqaisetaceoe).   Horse-tail.
    III. Club-mosses Lycopodiacew). Club-moss and Quill-wort.
    _IV. Pill-worts( arsileacew). Pill-wort.
    I. The Farms have a rhizome which creeps below or upon the
surface of the ground, or rises into the air like the trunk of a tree.
This trunk in some species attains a great height ; it is nearly uniform
in diameter throughout its whole length, and is covered with the
symmetrical and regularly-arranged markings of the stalks of the old
leaves. Internally it is composed of a central cellular pith sur
rounded by a cylinder of scalariform tissue, and this is invested by a
cortical cellular layer or bark.
    The woody cylinder is composed of simultaneous vascular bundles,
which originate and are completely developed at the same time ; there
is consequently no addition to it from subsequent growth. It is
penetrated by large open meshes, each of which permits the passage
of the vascular bundles that supply a leaf, accompanied with a certain
amount of cellular tissue from the medulla which occupies the centre
of the mesh.
    The leaves, which are very variable in size and form, not only
perform the functions of ordinary leaves, but also hear the fruit, and
are hence called fronds. The fruit is produced in clusters on the
back or margin of the fronds ; each cluster contains many sporangia,
and each sporangium numerous uniform spores.
    Though there is a great diversity in the size of the plants of this
order—from the humble Wall Rue to the giant Alsophilas,—there is
a remarkable uniformity in the size of the spores.
    When the spore germinates it bursts through the outer membrane
and puts forth a tubular prolongation, which increases by cell-multi
plication until a small green leaf is produced, called the prothallus,
on the under-surface of which two kinds of glandular-like bodies are
developed: the one, the antheridia, containing numerous cells with
spermatozoids; the other, the pistillidia, one of which when fertilized
develops into a true fern.
    II. The HORSE-TAILS have slender, hollow, and jointed stems.
Each joint terminates in a toothed membranous sheath, composed of
leaves reduced to this elementary state. Whorls of branches and
branchlets are given off at the joints in some species.
    The fruit is produced in terminal cones composed of numerous
stalked peltate scales, each of which bears on its under-surface a
circle of sporangia <U+FB01>lled with numerous uniform spores. The spores
have a spiral covering, which, when they are ripe, breaks up into four
clavate threads called elaters, which are remarkably hygrometric.

514                         Mr. W. Carruthers                 [April 16,
    The spores germinate like those of ferns.
    III. The CLUB—MOSSES have solid stems composed of an axis of
spiral vessels, surrounded by a thickish‘ cortical cellular layer. The
leaves are simple, and arranged spirally on the stem. The branches
are irregular and dichotomous.
    The fruit is produced in terminal cones composed of imbricating
scales. Each scale bears on its pedicel a small sporangium full of
spores. In Selaginella two kinds of spores exist. The one, called
microspores, produces spermatozoids; the other, macrospores, germi
nates, and forms a prothallus on which pistillidia appear; and these,
when fertilized by the spermatozoids of the microspores, grow into
perfect plants. In In/copodium microspores only have been seen, and
the process of its germination is still unknown.
    The little Quillwort (Isoetes) which grows at the bottom of most
of our mountain lakes, agrees with Selaginella in having two kinds of
spores; but it differs from the true club-mosses in its habit and in the
structure of the stem. Like Welwitschia it never increases in
height; but this is even more remarkable in the Quill-wort than in
Welwitschia, seeing that in it there is, as long as the plant lives,
a continual development of nodes with their foliar appendages going
on. The axis of the stem is composed of cellular tissue. This is
surrounded by a vascular cylinder, which grows, as in exogens, by the
addition of external layers, there being in this plant a true cambium
layer outside the wood, a structure unknown in other cryptogams.
    IV. No plants allied to the PILLWORTS have hitherto been detected
in the Coal Measures; we need not, therefore, be detained by an exa
mination of their structure and development.
    In examining the paleeozoic cryptogams of the Coal Forests, I will
follow the same order as that in which we have glanced at their living
representatives.
    I. The Fnmvs need not long occupy our attention. They were
very abundant, though as a rule they were humble herbaceous plants.
Arborescent stems are extremely rare-only two undoubted species
have been met with in Britain. The numerous known forms have
either grown on the earth, or, as is very probable, been Epiphytes.
Fructi<U+FB01>cation is rare; in the few cases in which it has been found it
agrees with that of recent ferns. Occasionally young fronds exhi
biting cireinnate vernation have been met with, showing that this
method of unrolling the frond was as characteristic of the ferns of
that period as it is of those of the present.
    The fern is a remarkably stable type of vegetation. The earliest
forms, like the Cyclopteris Hibernica of Forbes from the Old Red
Sandstone, agrees in all comparable points with the recent plants; and
throughout all the intervening space no divergence in any point of
importance has been detected.
    II. No group of fossil plants can more fully illustrate the impor

1869.]        on the Cryptogamic Forests of the Goal Period.          515
feet materials with which the palaeontological botanist has to deal
than that group which I have united under the name Calamites. The
various parts of the plant-the root, the stem, the leaves, and the
fruit—have been formed into numerous genera, which have been
referred to widely different positions in the vegetable kingdom.
     Considerable diversity of structure is to be found in those stems
which are referred to Calamc'tes. I shall ask your attention to one of
these forms which I have described, and which is beautifully illustrated
by a series of drawings, recently published, of specimens in Mr. Binney’s
collection. This stem was composed of a central medulla surrounded
by a woody cylinder, composed entirely of sealariform vessels and a
thin cortical layer. The medulla penetrated the woody cylinder by
a series of regular wedges, which were continued, as delicate laminae
of one or two cells in thickness, to the cortical layer. The cells of
those laminae were not muriform; their longest diameter was in the
direction of the axis. The wedges were continuous and parallel
between each node. As the axial appendages were produced in whorls,
the only interference with the regularity of the tissues was by the
passing out through the stem at the nodes of the vascular bundles
which supplied these appendages. As the leaves of each whorl were
(with one or two exceptions) opposite to the interspaees of the whorls
above and below, there was also at each node a rearrangement of the
wedges of vascular and cellular tissues.
     The stem is described as having been <U+FB02>uted on the outer surface.
 This error had its rise in the specimens examined being only casts
in the amorphous substance of the rock of the medullary cavity, sur
rounded by a thin <U+FB01>lm of coal representing the cylinder of wood. On
 the death of the plant, the cellular medulla decayed, while the woody
 cylinder was still able to retain its original form. The hollow interior
 was <U+FB01>lled with some of the mud or sand in which the plant was buried.
 In the course of time this o<U+FB01>'ered greater resistance to the pressure of
 the beds above than the originally hard cylinder of scalariform tissue,
 now softened by the moisture in which it had so long lain : the more
 indurated amorphous axis on pressure necessarily produced its cha
 racteristic ridges and furrows on the smooth outer surface of the <U+FB01>lm
 of coal.   This coal is described as the cortex or bark, and stems
 exhibiting only the rocky casts of the medullary cavity are called
 decorticated specimens; but besides the cortical layer they have also
 been deprived of all that remained of their woody tissue.
      The stem terminated below somewhat suddenly in a blunt cone,
 the internodes of which were slightly developed; and from the nodes
 were given off whorls of large roots, which again gave o<U+FB01>‘ innumerable
 branching rootlets (Pinnularia).
      The stem or main axis was simple, supporting numerous branches
 arranged in whorls, which again produced numbers of Whorled leaves.
 Three di<U+FB02>'erent forms of leaves have been formed into as many genera.
 When the structure of the fruits associated with them is better known,
 by the discovery of better preserved specimens, it is possible they

may be found to constitute three genera, but there are no characters
possessed by the leaves which prevent them belonging to one well
de<U+FB01>ned genus.

        1 and 2, Asterophyllites; 3 and 4, Annularia; 5 and 6, Sphenophyllum.
     The simplest form of leaf (Asterophyllites) is slender and linear,
with a single nerve. This can scarcely be separated from the form to
which the name Annularia has been given, and which differs chie<U+FB02>y in
having a larger amount of cellular tissue spread out on either side of
the midrib. This form has a different aspect in the fossil state from
the other, for its whorls of numerous broad leaves are spread out on
the surface of ‘deposition, while the acicular leaves of Asterophyllites
have penetrated the soft mud, and are generally preserved in the
position they originally occupied to the supporting branch. The
third form (Sphenophyllum) consists of whorls of Wedge-shaped leaves
with one or more bifurcating veins. They occur like those of Anna
laria, spread out on the surface of the shale.

    The plan of arrangement of the three forms is the same, and fruits
are found associated with them which have the same general appear
ance; but they are so ill preserved that their internal structure has
not hitherto been determined. The different forms have been placed
together as allied genera, and have been referred, by those who have
specially studied them, to the phanerogamous order Halomgaceaz near
to the Water Milfoil (Myrz'ophyllum), with some species of which they
agree very remarkably in the arrangement and aspect of their foliage
and fruit.

518                             Mr. W. Oarruthers                       [April 16,
     The determination of the internal structure of one of these fruits
which I made, <U+FB01>rst from specimens collected by Mr. Binney, and have
since con<U+FB01>rmed from specimens which have been some years in the
cabinet of Dr. Miller, has enabled me to refer with certainty these
fossils to the cryptogamous order Equz'setacece as near allies of our
living Horsetails.
     This fruit, to which I have given the name Volkmamzia Binneyi,
is a small slender cone, composed of whorls of inbricated scales (twelve
in each), arranged like the successive whorls of leaves on the branch,
so that the scales of one whorl are in a line with the spaces between
the scales in the whorls above and below. The scales completely con
ceal the fruit-bearing leaves. These are stalked and peltate, arranged
in whorls alternating with the scales, but having only six—half the
number of the scales in a whorl.              The sporangia, four in number,
are borne on the under-surface of the peltatc leaves; their walls are
formed of elongated cells, which have in their interior a secondary
deposit of cellulose proceeding in short truncate processes from the
sides of the cell-walls which are in contact, and having the appear
ance of an incomplete spiral. The sporangia are <U+FB01>lled with simple
spherical spores, which in the closely-packed sporangium appear to
be furnished with double cell-walls. In the half-empty sporangia the
outer wall cannot be detected, but there appear instead a number of
thread-like processes proceeding from the spore like the elaters in
the living Horsetails.
     A comparison of this fossil cone with the fruit of Equisetum
exhibits a remarkable agreement in every point of importance. In
the form of the fruit-bearing leaves, the arrangement and structure of
the sporangia, the form, size, and structure of the spores, even to the
possession of hygrometric elaters, both fruits agree. The only differ
ence is that in the modern plant all the leaves of the cone are fruit
bearing, while in the fossil every other whorl retains a form closely
approaching that of the normal leaf of the plant. As these envelop
and protect the fruit-bearing leaves, they may be held to give to the
fossil a somewhat higher systematic position than is possessed by the
living genus. This superiority is further exhibited when we contrast
the complex structure of the stem, and the free leaves of Calamites
with the <U+FB01>stular and sheathless stems of Equisetum.*
     III. The stems, branches, and fruit of the genus Lepidodendron
are so abundant in the shales that cover the coal, that the external
aspect of this tree has been for a long time well known. Specimens
exhibiting structure are more rare, but these also have been met with,
so that we know the internal organization as well as the external
aspect of the fossil.
     The stem is composed of a central pith surrounded by a slender
cylinder of scalariform woody tissue, and by a large cortical layer
    * Mr. .Binney has beautifully illustrated the structure of the stern and fruit of
 Calamites in a series of drawings from specimens in his rich collection, published
by the Palaeontographieal Society in the end of last year.

spherical and thin-walled cells, and an outer made up of regularly

stem is covered with the spirally arranged and beautifully marked

dichotomous manner. The younger branches are densely covered with
small lanceolate leaves, having a single median vein.

    The fruit is a cone composed of imbricated scales arranged spirally
on the axis like the true leaves, and bearing the sporangia on their
horizontal pedicels. Three different forms of fruit belong to this
genus, or it should perhaps rather be called group of plants.
    The first of these is the cone named by Robert Brown Triplo
sporites, and described by him from an exquisitely preserved specimen
of an upper portion, in which the parts are exhibited as clearly in the
petrified condition as if they belonged to a fresh and living plant.
The large sporangia have a double wall, the outer composed of a
compact layer of oblong cells placed endwise, or with the long
diameter perpendicular to the surface; the inner is a delicate cellular
membrane. The sporangium is filled with a great number of very
small spores, each composed of three roundish bodies or sporules.
Recently Professor Brongniart has described a complete specimen of
this fruit, in which the minute triple spores are confined to the
sporangia of the upper and middle part of the cone, but the lower
portion which was wanting in Mr. Brown's specimen, bear sporangia
filled with simple spherical spores ten or twelve times larger than
the others.
     The structure of another form of cone (Lepidostrobus) has been
expounded by Dr. Hooker. The arrangement of the different parts
comprising it is precisely similar to what occurs in Triplosporites;
but the sporangia are filled with the minute triple spores throughout
the whole cone.
     The third form of cone, which I have described under the name
Flemingites, differs from the other two in having a large number of
small sporangia supported on the surface of each scale; and it agrees
with Lepidostrobus in the sporangia containing only small spores.
     In comparing these fossils with the living club-mosses, one is
struck with the singular agreement in the organization of plants so
far removed in time, and so different in size, as the recent humble
club-mosses and the palaeozoic tree Lepidendrons.
     The fruit of Triplosporites, like that of Selaginella, contains large
and small spores, the microspores being found in both genera on the
middle and upper scales of the cone, and the macrospores on those of
 the lower portion.
     On the other hand, the fruits of Lepidostrobus and Flemingites agree
 with that of Lycopodium in having only microspores.
     The size of the two kinds of spores also singularly agrees in the
 two groups. This is of some importance, for among the recent
 vascular cryptogams there is a remarkable uniformity in the size of
 the spores in the members of the different groups, even when there is
 a great variety in the size of the plants. Thus the spore of our
 humble Wall-rue is as large as that of the giant Alsophila of tropical
 regions. So also the spores of Equisetum and Calamites agree in size,
 as may be seen in Plate II., Figs. 3, 4, and 9, where the spores of the
 two genera are magnified to the same extent. And a similar comparison
 of the macrospore and microspore of Triplosporites with those of

1869.]        on the Uryptogamic Forests of the Goal Period.         521
Selaginella, and of the microspore of Lcpidostrobus with that of Lyco
podium, exhibits a similar agreement. This is made apparent by the
drawings of the two kinds of spores of Selaginella on Plate 111., Figs.
3 and 4, with those of Triplosporites, Figs. 8 and 9, which are drawn
to the same scale.
    The fossils represented by the group of stems known under the
name of Lepidodendron, and by the three fruits described, agree in all
essential characters with the living Club-mosses, the only di<U+FB02>'erence of
importance being that the stem of the fossil has a higher organization
suited to its arborescent habits. The vascular tissue continued to
increase with the growth of the plant somewhat like an exogenous
stem. In all the living vascular cryptogams, the vascular tissue is
produced at once in its full extent except in Isoetes, which has a
eambium layer surrounding the cylinder of wood in which as the
plant grows new vascular tissue is developed. The zone of thin-walled
spherical cells which surrounds the woody cylinder in Lepidodendron,
and which is so rarely preserved, has been a true eambium layer like
that in Isoctes. But for the existence of this small water-plant, the
large trees of the coal-forests would present in the growth of their
 stems an inexplicable anomaly.
    Sigillaria, a very abundant carboniferous fossil, is a member of the
same family as Lepidodendron. Its stem is rarely preserved so as to
exhibit structure, the only specimen hitherto described being S. ele
gans, Brongn.; but its roots are frequently found in a very perfect
condition. The name Stigmaria was given to the roots at a time
when they were supposed to be independent plants. Their relation
to Sigillaria was suggested by Prof. Brongniart from the correspon
dence in their structure, by Sir W. Logan from the position the two
fossils occupied in the beds in which they occur, and the matter was
<U+FB01>nally set at rest when Mr. Binney observed the roots and stems in
actual continuity.
    As the structure and arrangement of corresponding parts in the
same plant are uniform, as of the root, stem, branches, and axis of the
cone, we may supply the want of information regarding the stem by
that which can be obtained from the root.
    The root is composed of a central medulla surrounded by a cylinder
of scalariform tissue, and this again is invested by a large cel
lular layer. The vascular cylinder is broken up by meshes through
which passed the vascular bundles to the rootlets. There are no traces
whatever of medullary rays in the wood. The supposed medullary
rays which have been described in Sigillaria are the accidental results
of desiccation in particular specimens. The internal structure of the
stem is precisely the same as in Lepidodendron, to which it is closely
allied. Externally it has a very different appearance, being either a
simple cylindrical column, or in some species dividing diehotomously
into a few thick branches. The leaves are long, slender, and parallel
sided. Their scars ornament the older portions of the stem, on which
they are arranged in perpendicular series with intervening furrows.

     The fruit has been described by Goldenberg. It agrees with that
which I have described in Flemingites except that the small sporangia
 are scattered in an irregular patch over the dilated base of an ordinary
leaf, and this con<U+FB01>rms the systematic position which I have given to
Sigillaria.‘
     The ferns and other genera which I have described may be con
sidered the types of the plants to which we are indebted for our stores
of mineral fuel. They grow in extensive level plains, their <U+FB02>eshy
roots penetrating the soft mud which formed the surface soil. The
moist atmosphere (not at all likely to have been charged with more
carbonic acid gas than that of our own day) would encourage the
growth of cellular parasites and epiphytes, and the Aroid discovered
by Dr. Paterson, with the several species of Antholithes, most pro
bably represent races of epiphytes of a much higher organization than
the cryptogamic trees on which they <U+FB02>ourished.
     Coniferous trees may have grown on the margins of the plain,
but their proper habitat seems to have been the higher ground, from
which an occasional stem was <U+FB02>oated down by running water to the
plains below. What plants were associated with the Conifers in those
upland regions, is as yet quite unknown. The Flora of the coal
period as at present ascertained is that of the plains. And this is of
high interest, apart from the economic value of its products, because
it reveals to the biologist an assemblage of plants agreeing in all
essentials with some of the humble members of our present Flora, but
attaining at so early a period in the history of the world, a develop
ment not only in size, but in organization, greatly in advance of their
modern allies.

        On the Survival of Savage Thought in Modern Civilization.
THE present argument is concerned with portions of the vast mass of
evidence bearing on the subject of the development of culture, of which
some examples were discussed by the speaker two years since in a
discourse on the Early Mental Condition of Man. It is now proposed

1869.]            Savage Thought in Modern Civilization.              523
to change the point of view, and, taking for granted an early rude
condition of mankind, to explain some phenomena of our present
civilization as being traceable survivals from more primitive states of
culture.
     Among the most important uses of the study of survival in civili
zation, is the light it throws on superstition. Three times out of four
superstition is a case of survival. When the Hindu Brahman, making
his sacri<U+FB01>ce, has to forget his <U+FB02>int and steel, and go back to the simple
wooden <U+FB01>re-drill for making <U+FB01>re by friction, one Brahman pulling the
thong backwards and forwards, and another standing with tinder to
catch the sacred spark, he believes that he keeps up this time-honoured
process in order to obtain pure and holy <U+FB01>re ; but we see that it is a
rude old primitive art, long discarded in practical life, but retained for
ceremonial use: in a word it is a survival.
     Thus it is with superstition. Some old belief or custom belonging
to a low level of culture is carried on into the midst of a higher civi
lization which practically disowns it, and such relics of ancient thought
not only survive, but sometimes revive with wonderful vigour. Mediaeval
witchcraft is a typical instance ; it was no new product of medizevalism,
but a revival in principle, and mostly even in detail, from the crudest
savage sorcery, which had been carried along the course of civilization
till, <U+FB01>nding in mediaeval life a congenial soil, it burst out afresh, and
grew apace like the ill-weed it was.
     Witchcraft is all but dead among us, but there is going on at this
day a great revival of belief and philosophy from the same low stage
of culture to which belongs the witchcraft of the New Zcalander or of
the Puritan of the Commonwealth. Some details of the ethnography
of spiritualism will serve to show that it is an example of savage
thought surviving in modern civilization.)
     The world-wide doctrine of spiritual beings has been described
before by the general name of Animism. Animism is the doctrine of
all men who believe in active spiritual beings; it is essentially the
antagonist of materialism, and in some form or other it is the religion
of mankind, from the rude savage of the Australian bush or the Brazilian
forest, up to the most enlightened Christian. Now Animism in the
lower civilization is not only a religion, but also a philosophy; it has
to furnish rational explanations of one phenomenon after another,
which we treat as belonging to biology or physics. If a man is alive
and moving, the animistic explanation is that his soul, a thin, ethereal,
not immaterial being in the man’s likeness, is within him animating
him, just as one gets inside a coat and moves it. If the man sleeps and
dreams, then either the soul has gone out of him to see sights that he
will remember when he wakes, or it is lying quiet in his body, receiving
visits from the spirits of other people, dead or alive-—visits which we
call dreams. If the man when fasting or sick sees a vision, this is a
ghost or some other spirit; if he faints or falls into a <U+FB01>t, his soul has
gone out of him for a time, and must be recalled with mystic ceremonies;
if it returns, he recovers, but if it stays away permanently, then the

524                 Mr. E. B. Tyler on the Survival of         [April 23,
man is dead. If the man takes a fever or goes mad, then it is a spirit
which is hovering about the patient, shaking and maltreating him, or
it has got inside him and is driving him, tearing him, speaking and
crying by his voice.
     These details are only a few out of the great system of savage
animism, which accounts for What we call physical cause and effect as
produced by the immediate action of spiritual beings ; but even these
are enough to show that it is far from being nonsense, that in fact it
is a highly rational theory for men in a low state of knowledge.       It
is common to hear the religion of savages spoken of with contempt by
those who have never realized its meaning or its place in history, but
it is surely unjust to despise a religion which is abreast of the highest
intellectual level of the people it prevails among, and which is part
and parcel of their most advanced knowledge.
     This early animistic doctrine is to a great degree superseded by
science, which sees in dreams and visions, not objective spiritual
visits, but subjective phenomena of the mind, and regards the a<U+FB01>‘licted
cataleptic now no longer as doctor, but as patient. Yet it survives
largely in popular belief, and has even from time to time come up
vigorously in revivals. One of these revivals is the great modern
Spiritualistic movement, a movement due to many men, but perhaps
especially, though indirectly, to the intensely animistic teachings of
one man, Emanuel Swedenborg. In comparing savage and barbaric
with modern spiritualism it will be better to give typical cases rather
 than to multiply details.                        ~
     As the Australian native sorcerer or the Tatar shaman lies in
lethargy while his soul departs to the land of spirits, so it is usual in
modern spiritualistic narratives for persons to be in an insensible
 state when their apparitions visit distant places, whence they bring
back information, and where they communicate with the living. The
 Greenland angekok sees in his visions the souls of the dead; they are
pale and soft, and he who tries to seize them feels nothing, for they
have no <U+FB02>esh, nor bone, nor sinew. Among the Finns the professional
shaman can see the ghosts of the dead, but they are not visible to
common men except in dreams. Thus the apparitions of the dead are
seen by the modern spiritualist in vision or dream, as the case may be.
Swedenborg relates that for twenty-seven years he conversed with the
departed spirits of relatives and friends, of kings and princes, and wise
men ; and he protests that these are not <U+FB01>ctions of the imagination, as
many will believe, but really seen and heard in a state of complete
wakefulness. There may be some here who have visited the house of
a great living French novelist, and have seen the arm-chair where the
 spirits of the dead sit and hold converse with him——there is a chain
 fastened across the seat to keep out profane visitors.
     When the soul is liberated at death, is a suitable moment for it to
 appear to people in whom it takes an interest; and accordingly the
 wraith or fetch, the apparition which announces death, occupies in
 savage psychology the intermediate place between the outgoing soul

1869.]            Savage lhought in Modern Civilization.              525
of the living and the ghost of the dead. The Karens say a man’s la,
or spirit, appearing after death may thus announce it; the Caribs
give the name of marartgigoana to souls, which by their appearance
announce impending death ; in Madagascar, the ambiroa, or apparition
which announces death, appears not only to others but even to the
dying man himself. ‘Thence we trace on the belief into the lives of
the saints, as where, when St. Ambrose died, newly-baptized children
saw the apparition of the holy bishop, and pointed him out to their
parents; but their grosser eyes could not behold him. Folk-lore
kept up the wraith in Europe as part of the well-known Highland
second-sight. Fifty years ago Macculloch, in his ‘Description of
the Western Islands,’ declared the old superstition to be dying out;
“ ceasing to be believed, it has ceased to exist.” But if he had lived
now, he would have had to <U+FB01>nish his sentence, “ coming to be believed
again, it has again begun to exist.” Stories of wraiths are among the
most habitual phenomena of the “ night side of nature.” The mass of
apparition stories in spiritualistic books are of types so familiar that
it is needless to quote examples from them.
     Among savage animists it is to be observed that there always
arises a class of professional conjurors, who live in special intercourse
with the spirits and perform wonders by their aid. One of the old
Moravian missionaries, a century ago, gives an account of the way in
which the Greenland sorcerers used to go on their spirit journey to the‘
other world. When the angekok has drummed and writhed about for
a while, he is bound by one of his pupils, his head between his legs,
and his hands behind his back. The lamps are put out and the
windows darkened, for no one must see him hold intercourse with his
spirit ; no one must move or even scratch his head, that the spirit may
not be interfered with; or rather, as the old missionary says, that no
one may catch the sorcerer at his trickery, and there is no going up
to heaven in broad daylight. At last, after strange noises have been
heard, and a visit received from or paid to the spirit, the magician
re-appears unbound, but pale and excited, and gives an account of his
adventures. The Ojibway conjurors also do this untying trick; and
across in Siberia the shamans practise the same coarse juggle. The
shaman sits down and is bound hand and foot, the shutters are shut,
and he invokes the spirits; all at once there arises a ghostly horror
in the dark-voices are heard in different parts, and a rattling and
drumming on the dry skin the shaman sits on ; bears growl, snakes hiss,
squirrels leap about the room. At last it is over, and behold, in
walks the shaman free and unbound from outside. No one doubts,
says Castren, that it was the spirits who were drumming, growling,
and hissing in the yurt, and who released the shaman from his bonds.
The unbinding trick is not unknown in English folk-lore, and it is
needless to point out the similarity in the exhibition of the Davenport
Brothers.
    Savage animism <U+FB02>ourishes in Central Asia, where the lamas
have long been great practitioners in the now familiar art of table

526                 Mr. E. B. Tyler on the Survival of         [April 23,
moving. To quote only one instance: John Bell, of Antermony,
150 years ago, describes the process of <U+FB01>nding a thief who had stolen
some damask. The lama got on a four-legged bench, “and soon
carried it, or, as was commonly believed, it carried him to the very
tent, when he ordered the damask to be produced. The demand was
directly complied with; for it is in vain, in such cases, to o<U+FB02>‘er any
excuse.”
     One of the most celebrated of modern spiritual manifestations is
the feat of rising in the air. This, if not savage, has a long and
curious ethnographic history.        It is familiar to Buddhism, where
every saint who has attained to “ riddhi,” or perfection, is able to
rise in the air, as also to overturn the earth and stop the sun. The
appearance of the miracle in the Western World belongs it seems to
classic times; foreign conjurors were exhibiting it to the Greeks in
 the <U+FB01>rst century. After a while it became a regular prodigy of
 Christian miracle. The Lives of the Saints swarm with it. St.
Dominic, St. Dunstan, St. Philip Neri, St. Ignatius Loyola, are
among the list of saints who not only metaphorically “rose above
 the earth,” but were thought, particularly by biographers a long
 while after they were dead, to have literally hung suspended in the
 air in life. Thus, when St. Richard, the Chancellor to St. Edmund,
Archbishop of Canterbury, one day softly opened the chapel door to
 see why the archbishop did not come to dinner, he saw him raised
 high in air with knees bent and arms stretched out; falling gently
 to the ground at sight of the intruder, the prelate complained of being
 thus hindered of great spiritual delight and comfort. The old
 archbishop’s mantle, or some remnant of it, has now descended on
 Mr. Home.
      As to the means by which disembodied spirits communicate with
 living men. In the <U+FB01>rst place they appear in visions or dreams and
 talk with the living, and here the opinion of the modern spiritualist is
 absolutely identical with that of the savage. But the modern medium
 may also introduce into spiritual converse arts unknown to savage
 life, spelling and writing. Rapping spirits are so far savage in
 principle, that if one told a North American Indian that mysterious
 knocks were done by a spirit, he would assent at once, for any
 mysterious noise is to his mind the action of a spirit. But savages
 do not seem to have selected a special class of knocking spirits,
 though this spirit abounds in civilized folk-lore. He is the “lmocker”
  the Welshman hears underground; the “ Poltergeist ” who routs about
  in German peasants’ houses; the “vampire ” who tumbles about_the
 furniture in Crete. The spirits had begun to answer questions by
 knocks, as Dr. A. Bastian has shown, in the middle ages. The device
  of an alphabet of counted raps, 1 for A, 2 for B, &c., was adopted in
  America to communicate between disembodied and embodied spirits.
  Scienti<U+FB01>c spirits, it is alleged, and especially Franklin’s spirit, have
  contrived to adapt electro-magnetic vital forces to produce the rapping
  sound. That the messages the spirits send are at the intellectual

1869.]            Savage Thought in Modern Civilization.              527
level of the mediums who receive them, need hardly be said; they are
so foolish that intelligent spiritualists habitually apologize for them,
and spirituel may indeed some day become a word for “ silly.”
     Spirit writing, though of course not belonging to unlettered savages,
has a curious ethnography. It is well known in China. When a man
wishes to consult a god in this way he places a table before the image
with candles and incense, an offering of tea and sham money, and a
large platter <U+FB01>lled with sand. A V-shaped wooden handle is provided
with a sharp tooth at its point; two men hold this instrument, each
grasping one leg of it, the point resting on the sand. Then the god
is invoked, and his spirit descends and guides the pen which wriggles
about in the sand and writes the oracular message. Dr. Bastian, to
whom we owe so much valuable information as to the ethnography of
spiritualism, adds that when the sprig of the sacred apricot tree is
broken to make the spirit-pen, the precaution is taken of scratching a
suitable apology on the bark of the tree. There are old European
accounts of writing with a spirit-guided pen, and there is an instru
ment called a “ planchette” made and sold in London now, a little
tripod with a pencil, which two persons place their hands on and wait
for a disembodied spirit to guide them to write messages.
     It appears, however, that spirits can dispense with such material
instruments. We remember how, during the Council of Nicwa, two
of the bishops, Chrysanthus and Mysonius, happened inconveniently
to die, so the acts of the council were solemnly laid on their tombs,
and were found in the morning with the dead men’s subscription,
thus,—“ Although removed from earth, we have signed the volume
with our own hands.” This proceeding has been renewed in our own
day. For example, the Baron de Guldenstubbé has published a book,
‘ Pneumatologie Positive et Expérimentale,’ in which he says that the
spirits of the departed do hover near their tombs, and haunt places
where they dwelt “ during their terrestrial incarnation.” Louis XV.
and Marie Antoinette roam about the Trianon; Francis I. manifests
himself at Fontainebleau, and what is more, if you leave blank pieces
of paper in suitable places, they will concentrate an electric current
on it by their force of will, and thus impress characters on the paper.
The Baron publishes fac-similes of the spirit-writings he got thus:
Augustus and Julius Caasar’s near their statues in the Louvre, Abelard
and Heloise at their tomb at Pere-la-Chaise, with an inscription that
they are united and happy. The alphabetic writing of the surviving
ancients is, it must be confessed, rather queer sometimes, as when St.
Paul writes himself as eag‘urros 'rwv aurora-Toma ; when Hippokrates
wrote his name, which cured an attack of rheumatism in a few
minutes, the virtue of the prescription lay perhaps in the great phy
 sician spelling himself with a long ' and a short é.
     What is now being discussed is not the positive truth or falsity of
the alleged spiritual phenomena and doctrines, but their ethnography.
There may be remarkable psychological phenomena, “ brain-waves,”
 or what not, involved in what is called spiritualism, as there were

 528                 Mr. E. B. Tyler on the Survival of         [April 23,
 unquestionably remarkable morbid phenomena. involved in what was
 called mesmerism. But this is not the question here. It is not
 merely that the alleged spiritualistic facts are believed in by savages
 and barbarians, and disowned by civilized science. It is much more
 than this. It is that the spiritualistic interpretation of the alleged
 visions, and rappings, and writings, the belief that they are produced
 by disembodied spirits, belongs to the philosophy of savages. Set a.
 Chinese and an English medium to obtain written missives from the
 respective spirits they believe in, and let a wild Ojibway Indian look
 on at the performance. So far as the presence of disembodied spirits
 goes, possessing the performers and guiding the pencils, or manifesting
 themselves by raps, or voices, or other actions, the savage would un
 derstand and admit it at once, for such things are part of his recognized
 system of nature : the only part of the affair out of his line would be
 the art of writing, which does belong to a higher grade of civilization
 than his.   In a word, a modern medium is a Red Indian or a Tatar
 shaman in a dress-coat.
     Even supposing the alleged spiritualistic facts to be all true, and
 the spiritualistic interpretation of them sound, this does not alter the
 argument. It would prove that savages were wise, and that we civilized
 fools have degenerated from their superior knowledge. But it would
 remain true that modern spiritualism is a survival and a revival of
 savage thought, which the general tendency of civilization and science
 has been to discard. This is the case of spiritualism as seen from an
 ethnographic point of view.
     To turn now to another topic bearing on survival in culture.
 Modern games are often survivals of weightier matters, just as one of
 man’s most important implements of war and livelihood survives as a
 toy in the tiny bows and arrows that children play with in the streets.
 There is one interesting group of sports, which there is some ground
 for treating as survivals; these are games of chance. We all know
 that when halfpence are tossed or dice cast, no special physical action
 takes place more than when a stone is thrown to the ground. We
 know that betting on the turn-up of the coin or die is an appeal to
 chance, that is, to our own ignorance; not that the process of turning
 up is extraordinary, but that it is so di<U+FB02>icult to follow that we cannot
 foresee its result. But we also know that this scienti<U+FB01>c view of
chance is not that of early civilization. It was not thus that the
South Sea Islander looked on his divination by lots, that the African
fetish-priest shu<U+FB01>‘led his bits of leather for omens, that the crowd
prayed the gods with uplifted hands while the champions cast lots
in Agamemnon’s helm to learn who should go forth to do battle with
Hektor and help the well-greaved Greeks. The uncivilized man
fancies that lots or dice are being adjusted in their fall with reference
to the meaning he chooses to attach to it; and especially he imagines
spiritual beings standing over the diviner or the gambler, shu<U+FB01>‘ling
the lots or turning up the dice to make them give certain answers.
This view held on strongly into the middle ages, and one of the most

1869.]           Savage Thought in Modern Civilization.             529
remarkable movements of the seventeenth century was when Thomas
Gataker, the Puritan minister, attacked the supernatural theory of lots
and games of chance in a treatise in small quarto.
    The supernatural theory of lots is dying, but not dead, for fortune
telling with cards, turning up texts for omens, and so forth, still
survive largely in civilized Europe. How directly supernatural
interpretation is connected with gambling in the popular mind, we
may judge from the people of Southern Europe, who expect their
patron saints to help them to lucky numbers, or from the Lusatian
peasant, who slily hides his lottery-ticket under the cloth of the com
munion-table, that it may receive the blessing with the sacrament and
stand a better chance of a prize. Arts of divination and games of
chance are identical in principle and in great measure in detail.
The dice with which the Greek oracle and the African sorcerer give
omens are not to be distinguished from gamblers’ dice. Lots serve
both purposes. ‘The Chinese gambles by drawing lots, and also his
market-places are crowded by professional diviners who draw lots
for omens. The Chinese, however, with all their love for old customs,
dislike being practically inconvenienced by them; so when a Chinese
makes up his mind what to do, he goes to a lot-drawer and takes an
omen; but if the omen is not what he wants he will try again and
again, and at last, when he gets the omen he required, that he will
act on. Again, playing-cards are used alike for games and for carto
mancy, fortune-tellers preferring the very old fashioned ones known
as tarots, which are much more complicated than ours, and lend them
selves to a greater variety of omens.
    Now the question is, Are games of chance in general survivals from
serious divination ? It is hard to settle a precedence between them on
distinct evidence, but there are two cases where it is known which use
came <U+FB01>rst. There is a well-known South Sea Island art of divination
by spinning a cocoa-nut; the persons interested sat in a circle, and
the cocoa-nut was spun in the middle; the oracular answer was
according to the person or place towards which the monkey-face of
the fruit was directed when it stopped. Now, though the Samoan
Islanders in Mr. Turner’s time had left this off as a means of divina
tion for discovering thieves, &c., they still kept it up as a game of
forfeits.   Again, there was a Greek art of divination, called kottabos,
which consisted in <U+FB02>inging wine out of a cup into a metal basin some
way off without spilling any, the thrower saying or thinking his
mistress’s name, and judging from the clear or dull splash of the wine
what his fortune in love would be ; but in time the magic passed out
of the sport, and it became a more game played for a prize. Now the
question is whether these two cases are typical. If so, we may con
sider games of chance as survivals from the corresponding processes
of divination; that they are divination in sport made gambling in
earnest. And it is so much a rule of survival that the sportive use of
 an art is derived from its serious use, that this hypothesis of the
 general origin of games of chance seems a plausible one.

530                   Mr. E. B. Tyler on the Survival of               [April 23,
     Again, as to the superstitious practices which belong to peasant
folk-lore, and which are really survivals from a low philosophy of
religion, let us take one example. It is one of the principles of the
lower animism that diseases are caused by spirits possessing or attack
ing the patient. It is another principle that spirits may embody
themselves for a time in any material object; this is the main theory
of fetishes and fetish worship.‘ Thus the disease-spirits may be
persuaded to come out of the patient, and get into some object pre
pared for them. To take an instance from the Siberian tribes Whose
table-moving I have mentioned: when a man is possessed with a.
demon, or as we should say when he is ill, it becomes the business of
the priest to charm the spirit out into a doll, and so the patient gets
well. Or the disease-spirits may be got into rags, or looks of hair,
&c., and hung on trees. African sacred trees are hung all over with
such objects, and such trees with offerings for diseases exist to this
day within the limits of Great Britain. There are, probably, some
here who can remember their nurses charming little diseases out of
them into nails or knots, and so getting rid of them.
   But to suppose the principles and rites of the religion of the lower
races to be only represented in that of the higher races by little
surviving superstitions, would be an utterly one-sided view. \' Many
most important thoughts and rites of religion-worship, prayer, sacri
<U+FB01>ce, penance, fasting-may be traced upwards from the lower races
more or less far into the faiths of the higher nations, modi<U+FB01>ed and
adapted in their course to <U+FB01>t more advanced culture and loftier creeds.
This is too large a subject to be entered on now, but let us glance at
an example or two from the ethnography of religious ceremony.
     Ceremony is part of the gesture-language of mankind, and acts
dramatically the ideas it signi<U+FB01>es. For example, among the religious
ideas of men, few lie deeper in history than the association of bodily
cleansing with ceremonial or moral purity. By obvious metaphor,
such words as clean or pure are applied to puri<U+FB01>cation from guilt,
ceremonial contamination, or moral sin. And What we thus express
in words, the men of the lower culture began early to act in ceremony,
purifying objects or persons by various imitative rites, especially by
passing them through <U+FB01>re, or dipping them in, or sprinkling them
with, water.     If we look at the distribution of these rites of lustration
among the races of the world, we shall <U+FB01>nd that their diversity of
detail and purpose, to say nothing of other reasons, seems to forbid
our considering them as all adopted from any single common source.
    * It is well known that the Portuguese gave the name of feitiyo, “ charm,"
to the bits of stone, bone, and other rubbish worshipped by the negroes as recep
tacles of supernatural beings, and we adopted the word as fetish. But the word
had really been English ages before in a different sense. Latin faetitius became
Portuguese feitieo in the sense of magic art, but was also adopted from Norman
French into English as fetys, well made, neat.    It occurs in the best-known quo
tation from Chaucer :
                 “And Frensch sche spak ful faire and fetysly," &c.

1869.]            Savage Thought in Modern Civilization.            531
Such ceremonies are either practical cleansings done ceremonially, or
they are pure ceremonies; they have little to do with cleanly habits,
and do not in the least prove that the people who practise them hold
cleanliness to be next to godliness. Genghis Khan’s Tatars, who had
a conscientious objection to taking off their clothes, considered them
selves suf<U+FB01>ciently puri<U+FB01>ed by passing through the <U+FB01>re, and the modern
Persian is a striking example of the way in which ceremony may
override reality. He will wash his eyes when they have been polluted
by seeing an in<U+FB01>del, he will carry about a water-pot with a long spout
for his ablutions, but he neglects the simplest sanitary rules, and
obtains ceremonial puri<U+FB01>cation by dipping in a disgusting little tank
of water where a hundred people may have been before him.
    The same thought seems to run through all the ceremonies of
lustration, but the details di<U+FB02>‘er extremely, and seem to have been in
great measure developed independently, as a few typical examples will
show. The Ka<U+FB01>rs, who are not in the habit of washing on ordinary
occasions, perform a ceremonial ablution after a funeral, as do the
modern Hindus. The Romans, returning from a funeral, were puri<U+FB01>ed
both by being passed over <U+FB01>re and being sprinkled with water, and
the same double rite was observed in the annual lustration of the
<U+FB02>ocks at the Palilia. Among the aborigines of India and South
East Asia, when a child is born the mother undergoes a ceremonial
lustration, and it is then that among the Kols of Chota Nagpur the
child is named. The New Zealand ceremony of washing young
children is highly remarkable. The baby is taken to the stream and
dipped or sprinkled by a native priest; the priest chants a list of
names of its ancestors, and the one at which the child sneezes or cries
is the name it is considered to choose for itself. The object of this
ceremony seems to be the removal of the original tapu under which
the child is born, which tapu may also be removed by another cere
mony, a pretence of eating the child. The Lapps also named their
children with a ceremonial washing in early times, and long kept up
this native rite in private after their conversion to Christianity. And
again, the Jakuns of the Malay peninsula and the Aztecs of Mexico
were remarkable for lustrating infants both with <U+FB01>re and water.
    Another motive for ceremonial lustration is to drive out demons,
as was done in classic and mediseval times, and as the Zend Avesta
describes the driving out of the Drukhs Nacus by sprinkling with
holy water, which drives it from limb to limb, till it escapes at the
toes. It is needless to enter here into the ceremonial lustrations of
the Jews and their baptism of proselytes. The rite which appears
over so great a geographical range, and can be traced through so many
stages of culture, appears within the limits of Christendom in the
comparatively insigni<U+FB01>cant practice of aspersion with holy water, but
especially holds its place almost throughout Christianity in the bap
tismal ceremony.
    To take one last example from religious ceremony: we have but
to think of sunrise and sunset to understand how early must have been

 532                Mr. E. B. Tyler on the Survival of           [April 23,
 the association in men's minds of the East with the source of light and
 warmth, life and happiness and glory ; of the West with darkness
 and chill, death and decay. Where the sun goes to his daily death at
 sunset, thitherward the soul departs to the other world. As the spirit
 of the dead Australian hovers for a while on earth, and goes at last
 toward the setting sun ; as Fijian souls start for the judgment-seat from
 the Western Cape ; as the Ojibway’s shade follows a wide and beaten
 path westward, and crossing the deep and rapid river comes to the
 land abounding in game, and joins his rejoicing kindred in their lodge ;
 so the Egyptian dead went West to the death-land of Amenti, and
 among our Aryan forefathers, in Max Miiller’s words, “ As the East
 was to the early thinkers the source of life, the West was to them
 Nirriti, the Exodus, the land of death.”
     Nothing could bring out more clearly the full signi<U+FB01>cance of the
 West as the region of Death than the details of the consecration of
 the pickaxe by the murderous Thugs of India, worshippers of Kali
 the death-goddess. In her honour it is that the victims are murdered ;
 to her is dedicated the piekaxe with which the graves of the slain are
 dug. On that dreadful implement no shadow of any living thing
 must fall; its consecrator sits facing the West to perform the four
fold washing and the seven-fold passing through the <U+FB01>re, and then,
 duly consecrated, it is placed on the ground, and the bystanders
 worship it with faces turned to the West.
     On the other hand, the thought of the deities as in the region of
sunrise is familiar to the savage mind in South America, as when the
Jumanas turn the faces of their dead to the East, where dwell the two
great deities, the Good and Bad Spirit ; and so the Guarayos turn their
corpses to the East, to go to the happy country of Tamoi, the grand
father, the ancient of heaven. In countries where sun-worship prevails,
there prevails with it the right of adjusting the temple, and turning
the worshippers, to the east. One of the great ceremonial rites of the
Apalachcs was performed at sunrise, when the priest stood at the door
of the temple but and adored the Eastern sun; the cave-temples of
the Floridans opened eastward to receive the <U+FB01>rst rays of the luminary;
in Mexico men turned to the East in prayer, and the kindred Nica
raguans declared the gods to be in the region of sunrise; in Peruvian
sun-temples the doors looked east, so that at dawn the sun’s rays fell
on the golden disc, and the people saw and greeted their national
deity. This is the rite which the prophet Ezekiel describes as he sees
it in horror-stricken vision : " At the door of the temple of the Lord
about <U+FB01>ve-and-twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the
Lord, and their faces toward the east, and they worshipped the sun
towards the eas .” Predominant as sun-worship was in Aryan thought,
what is more natural than that the Brahman should turn to the east,
and that Vitruvius should give directions so elaborate for adjusting
the temples and altars of the immortal gods by the same rule of east
and west followed by church builders now.
     In speaking of the solar symbolism of cast and west within Chris

1869.]            Savage Thought in Modern Civilization.            533
tianity, I do not mean such exceptional cases as that Christian sect
which Leo I. describes in the <U+FB01>fth century, as stopping on a hill and
bowing to the rising sun before entering the Basilica of St. Peter,
which the Pope says “comes partly from ignorance and partly from
the spirit of paganism, and a<U+FB01>‘licts us extremely.” I mean rather such
ceremonies as the baptismal rite about the fourth century, which con
trasts East and West with the utmost fulness of symbolism. Cyril of
Jerusalem thus describes the scene :—“ Ye were <U+FB01>rst brought into the
ante-room of the baptistery, and placed standing toward the west (the
sunset), and then commanded to renounce Satan by stretching out
your hands against him as if he were present . . . And why did
ye stand toward the west? it was needful, for the sunset is the type
of darkness, and he is darkness, and has his strength in darkness;
therefore symbolically looking to the West ye renounce that dark and
gloomy ruler.” Then turning round to the east the catechumen took
up his allegiance to his master, Christ. Thus Jerome says :—“ In
the mysteries we <U+FB01>rst renounce him who is in the west, and dies to us
with our sins, and so turning to the east we make a compact with the
Sun of Righteousness, and promise to be his servants.” This perfect
double rite of east and west is retained in the Eastern Church, and
may be seen in Russia to this day. The partial ceremony of orientation
of churches, and the practice of turning toward the east in worship,
which quite naturally caused early Christians to be accused of being
sun-worshippers, are common to both churches.
    But it is quite curious to see how far the solar origin and meaning
of this practice has been forgotten in modern times. If you ask the
meaning you will often be told it has to do with turning towards
Jerusalem, as if the church-builders in Normandy and England did
not know east from south-east. The absurdity of the notion is shown
by the fact that the churches in Asia, on the other side of Jerusalem,
turn east as religiously as they do in Europe. But how can anyone
expect to know the origin and meaning of ceremonies, or of anything
else, without knowing the ethnographic facts which show the history
of their development. Those who would understand such things must
do as the Patriarch of Constantinople himself recommended not long
ago, they must have recourse to the “ historical method.”
    In the beginning of his ‘ Positive Philosophy,’ Auguste Comte in
cidentally lays down a maxim which all ethnographers may adopt as a
standing rule. It is simply this remark, that “no conception what
ever can be understood except through its history.” The more we
study civilization, the more clearly we shall see that the civilization
of any age is not a new creation to meet the wants of that age, but
that it is a result of past times, modi<U+FB01>ed to meet new conditions of
life and knowledge, yet showing in its cases of survival clear vestiges
of the course of its development.
    The attempt to understand advanced stages of knowledge, belief,
art, or custom, without understanding their earlier stages, is not only

                  DIRECTOR OF THE METEOROLOGICAL OFFICE.
       On the Work of the Meteorological O<U+FB01>‘ice, Past and Present.
A LITTLE more than seven years ago, Admiral FitzRoy addressed an
audience in this theatre on the subject of the system of Meteorological
Telegraphy, then for twelve months in operation--a system whose
introduction and establishment were mainly due to his own e<U+FB02>'orts. The
popularity which this subject of inquiry very naturally assumed in a
country like our own, with its extended coast-line, at times exposed
to all but incessant storms, has had a tendency to mask the work for
which the o<U+FB02>ice was in the <U+FB01>rst instance founded, and which it has
persistently endeavoured to carry out.
    Accordingly, in a discourse “ On the Work of the Meteorological
Office, Past and Present,” I may, perhaps, be excused if I occupy a
few minutes in a brief account of what the origin of the office was.
    The primary object for which it and all the other similar o<U+FB02>ices
were established, was the acceleration of ocean routes for vessels by
an accurate investigation of the prevalent winds and currents in the
various parts of the sea. Many years ago, Basil Hall said :
    “ It is one of the chief points of a sealnan’s duty to know where to
<U+FB01>nd a fair wind, and where to fall in with a favourable current.”
    Long before his time, however, Mr. Marsden, who was Secretary
to the Admiralty at the beginning of this century, had proposed the
plan of dividing the sea-surface into squares by means of the parallels
and meridians, in order to determine accurately the winds, &c., close
to the equator. Mr. Marsden’s method of subdivision has been since
universally adopted.

536                        Mr. Robert H. Scott               [April 30,
    The <U+FB01>rst impulse to the present work was given by Sir J. Bur
goyne, who, in 1852, started the idea of land observations on an
extensive scale, to be carried out by the Corps of Royal Engineers.
    Lieutenant Maury had then been working for several years at
Washington, and the United States’ authorities were consulted by our
Government as to the possibility of their co-operating in the scheme.
In their reply, they suggested its extension to sea observations.
    The correspondence was then referred to the Royal Society, who
pointed out to the Government the great di<U+FB02>iculties which stood in
the way of international co-operation in land observations, owing to the
want of satisfactory self-recording instruments which should render
the system independent of differences of scales and of hours of obser
vation, to which observers in different countries were attached.    The
Royal Society warmly supported the scheme for marine meteorology.
    In brief, then, the Brussels Conference met in August, 1853; most
maritime nations were represented at it, and a uniform plan of action
was adopted.
    Subsequent to this, the National Observatory at Washington con
tinued to work steadily until the War broke out.
    Holland established its Royal Meteorological Institute in 1854,
which is now in active operation.
    At the end of that year, Mr. Cardwell, then President of the Board
of Trade, resolved to establish a Meteorological Department of that
o<U+FB01>ice, and appointed Admiral FitzRoy, then a captain, as its chief.
    At the present time, sixteen years after the Brussels Conference,
the subject is again attracting general attention. The National Ob
servatory at Washington is being resuscitated, if I may use the
expression; and other countries are commencing the work, especially
our own countrymen in India and in the Mauritius where systematic
work has been going on for years under Mr. Meldrum.
    The most recent recruits have been the towns of Hamburg and
Bremen, who have established the Norddeutsche Seewarte, under the
able superintendence of Herr W. von Freeden, formerly of the Navi
gation School at Els<U+FB02>eth, and have commenced the investigation of
marine meteorology with great vigour.
    The Royal Society were requested by the Government in 1855 to
furnish what might be called “Sailing Directions ” for the new o<U+FB02>ice,
which they accordingly did, in a most copious and complete manner.
The suggestions contained in their letter continue to form the basis
of the operations of the o<U+FB02>ice, with the exception of one or two
matters which have been taken up by the Hydrographic O<U+FB02>ioe of the
Admiralty.
    Admiral FitzRoy on his appointment began work on a very com
prehensive scale. The <U+FB01>rst thing to be done was to provide trust
worthy instruments, and accordingly relations were entered into with
the Committee of the Kew Observatory, which have since ripened
into the present close connection between the two establishments.
    A barometer recommended by that Committee was adopted as the

1869.]           on the Work of the Meteorological O<U+FB01>ice.             537
one best suited for use at sea, and the same gentlemen furnished
speci<U+FB01>cations for the construction of the other instruments employed
in the various observations.   In addition to this, all the instruments
issued by the of<U+FB01>ce have been veri<U+FB01>ed at Kew.
    The practice of the of<U+FB01>ce is to lend to observers instruments,
which are returned at the end of the voyage, together with a register
of observations taken with them, prepared on a plan similar to that
adopted at Brussels.
    Admiral FitzRoy, in order to place in the hands of seamen results
already obtained, proceeded to publish translations of foreign works,
and more especially reproductions of Maury’s charts, embodying with
the data in them those obtained from materials in his own office. In
this way the series of Board of Trade wind-charts have been prepared.
    The issue of instruments went on for some time very freely, and
registers rapidly accumulated, so that it speedily became evident that
the staff of the o<U+FB02>ice could not cope with the work which came on it.
When this fact forced itself on the notice of the chief, his own attention
was being irresistibly attracted by a new sphere of action, the study
and prediction of weather, of which we have more to say presently.
Accordingly he checked the collection of materials, and diverted a
considerable proportion of the working energy of the o<U+FB02>ice into this
new channel.
    The marine work, however, though retarded, went on at a steady
rate, though its projector did not live to see the completion and pub
lication of the results of the inquiries he had set on foot: most
notably of that which he always looked to as his grand work, the
examination of the meteorology of the Paci<U+FB01>c, which he left in a very
incomplete state, owing to de<U+FB01>ciency of material.
    All these un<U+FB01>nished investigations are in process of being rendered
accessible to the public, either in the form of independent publi
cations bearing on special questions, such as sea-surface temperature,
or by being supplied to the Hydrographic O<U+FB01>ice for incorporation in
the pilot charts now in process of publication by the Admiralty.
    On Admiral FitzRoy’s death, the Royal Society were again con
sulted by the Government, as to the position and future work of the
o<U+FB02>ice. They stated that they saw no grounds for materially changing
the suggestions in their letter of 1855, and they added to them a
scheme for the study of British meteorology.
    Subsequently, at the request of the Board of Trade, an inquiry
was made into the working of the office, and a report presented to
Parliament in 1866 by a committee of three gentlemen, nominated
respectively by the Board of Trade, the Admiralty, and the Royal
Society. This report supported strongly the views expressed by the
Royal Society, and further suggested that the of<U+FB01>ce should be placed
under e<U+FB01>ieient scienti<U+FB01>c superintendcnce, so as to ensure its being
conducted so as best to carry out those views, and to afford a thorough
safeguard against undue prominence being given to any one of its
departments to the detriment of others.

    In November, 1866, the Royal Society were requested to under
take the superintendence of the former Meteorological Department of
the Board of Trade, and the Council agreed to accept the trust, and
to nominate a committee of eight Fellows of the Royal Society, who
would have the entire and absolute control of the o<U+FB02>ice. This is
the whole connection between the office and the Royal Society. The
Society itself has nothing whatever to do with the of<U+FB01>ce or with its
funds, beyond appointing the Superintending Committee.
     In order to ensure the e<U+FB02>icieney of the marine branch, Captain H.
Toynbee, a gentleman of long experience as a seaman and a practised
observer, was appointed to assist the director, by taking entire charge
of this most important division of the work.
     The collection of materials, especially with reference to the less
known parts of the ocean, has been recommenced, care, however,
being taken that the instruments are only issued to <U+FB01>rst-class ob
servers. Many of our leading steamship companies have consented to
co-operate in the work.
     Meanwhile the documents already in the o<U+FB01>ice are being carefully
examined, and a systematic inquiry has been begun into the entire
meteorological conditions of the area lying between the Trades in the
Atlantic Ocean, known as the Atlantic Doldrums, by which means it
is hoped that light will be thrown on several interesting and impor
tant questions which affect our climate seriously.
     Humboldt said years ago that we must look to the Tropics for the
interpretation of the complex meteorology of higher latitudes; and it
is a very remarkable fact that the area on which we are now working is
precisely that indicated more than half a century ago, by Mr. Marsden,
as the most important <U+FB01>rst <U+FB01>eld for operations.
    The present work of the o<U+FB01>ice in this department cannot be made
very interesting to the public, as it simply consists of a patient
examination of the registers, and the preparation of the materials
contained in them for future discussion.
     As this work had to be begun absolutely de novo, a year or two
must necessarily elapse before we can even form an opinion as to the
probable results which the work will yield. We trust, however, that
whatever they are they will form a useful contribution to our know
ledge of marine meteorology, and one worthy of the justly earned
reputation of the mercantile marine of this country.
    As I said at the commencement of the discourse, this is the work
for which the o<U+FB01>ice was established, and for the performance of which
Parliament, fourteen years ago, consented to supply funds. Marine
meteorology must ever be considered the prime object of its attention,
an object the value and importance of which was recognized before
self-registering instruments for land meteorology had been perfected,
before storm warnings were dreamt of, and before most, if not all, of
my audience were born.

                     Telegraphic Weather Intelligence.
     The origin and development of this branch of the o<U+FB01>ice is fully
 traced in the report of the committee of inquiry already referred to.
 Admiral FitzRoy, in 1861, devised a code of meteorological telegraphy
in cipher, and instituted a regular service, by means of which inform
ation of weather was received from stations on the coast, and issued
to the public. This information consisted of occasional warnings of
storms, and of forecasts of probable weather, which were published in
 the daily papers.
     The storm-warnings extended over three days at a time, and con
veyed distinct intimations of the direction and probable force of the
wind which would blow on the line of coast where the signal was
hoisted. The forecast of weather was only for two days in advance.
     As is known to every one, the signals used by Admiral FitzRoy
were a drum and a cone, which latter, according to its position, indi
cated N. or S. winds. The system was a very decided advance on the
 scheme originally proposed both here and in France, which was to
convey by telegraph the fact of the existence of a storm on any part
of the coast, to parts not yet visited by it.
     This appears to have been what was contemplated by the com
mittee appointed at the Aberdeen Meeting of the British Association,
under whose sanction the system of meteorological telegraphy was
commenced. It was most distinctly the plan proposed by M. Le Verrier
in a letter to the Astronomer Royal a little later.
     The <U+FB01>rst warnings were issued in February, 1861, and the <U+FB01>rst
forecasts of weather in August of the same year. The service con
tinued almost without alteration for about <U+FB01>ve years.
     Doubts were entertained before Admiral FitzRoy's death, as to
whether he was justi<U+FB01>ed in pronouncing so positive opinions as to
coming weather as he did; and in 1866 the committee of inquiry
reported strongly against the system as actually carried on, and the
Royal Society only consented to appoint a committee to take charge
of the of<U+FB01>ce on the express proviso that they should not be called upon
to issue storm-warnings. The Royal Society recommended that if
these were to be continued, the Government should itself <U+FB01>nd means
of carrying them on. This was not done, and their issue was sus
pended by the Government in December, 1866.
    The warnings were, however, very popular; several memorials
were presented to Parliament, praying for their restitution; and
ultimately in May, 1867, the committee were requested by the Board
of Trade to give some intimation of storms.
    They at once, three months prior to the Dundee Meeting of the
British Association, consented to issue intelligence of the nature of
that originally contemplated, viz. to communicate to the ports the
fact of the actual existence of an atmospherical disturbance, or, in
other words, of a storm, or the signs of an imminent storm on any

  540                         Mr. Robert H. Scott                [April 30,
  part of the coast, without implying the faintest idea of a prediction
  that the storm would probably strike the ports warned. They simply
  give the information to such ports as they think likely to pro<U+FB01>t by it,
  leaving the recipients to draw their own conclusions as to whether the
  storm would come to them or not, but furnishing them at the same
  time, by means of circulars and the ‘Fishery Barometer Manual,’
  with the most approved and trustworthy rules for forming a judgment
  as to Weather, when aided by observations of the Fishery Barometers
  so liberally
I National        supplied
             Lifeboat       to <U+FB01>shing stations by this o<U+FB01>ice and by the
                       Institution.
       The drum signal is hoisted whenever a message is received from
  London, and it remains up for thirty-six hours, during which time
  the weather will probably have declared itself. The general facts
  which have led to the issue of the order to hoist the drum are
  conveyed in the telegram, which is posted up for the public to read
  at many of the ports; while information as to weather previously
  prevailing elsewhere may be obtained from a copy of the daily
  weather report of the day before, which is sent regularly by post
  to any port which asks for it.
       The system has now been in operation for <U+FB01>fteen months, and the
  drum is hoisted at 100 British stations, and in addition intelligence
  is sent to the entire coast of the continent from Norway to Spain.
       The French Government co-operates most warmly in the scheme.
       It is obvious, that in order to make full use of the present system,
  it is necessary that the facts which have been made known by tele
  graph should be made public. In order to convey to shipping and
  to persons at a distance from the <U+FB02>agsta<U+FB02>' this intelligence, a sema
  phore was invented by my colleague, Captain Toynbee, which shows
  at one glance the direction and force of the wind, and the locality
  where the storm is blowing. A diagram explanatory of the semaphore
  and its use has been printed and distributed Widely. In order to test
  the apparatus, it has been erected on trial at three ports, London,
   Liverpool, and North Shields, but no de<U+FB01>nite decision as to its use
   has as yet been arrived at.
       We now come to the practical utility of the present mode of giving
  intelligence. It is obvious that such a system can do comparatively
  little for our exposed Atlantic coasts, but fortunately those are not
  the shores most frequented by shipping.
       As most, not all, of our storms are felt <U+FB01>rst on the west coast of
  Ireland, we are usually able to give intimation to the ports on the
  Irish Sea, the English Channel, and a fortiort' the North Sea, before
  the gale comes on. This is a natural consequence of the general
  easterly motion of storms. When the test of results is applied to
  messages sent to distant stations, we <U+FB01>nd that out of thirty-seven
  messages sent to Hamburg in the course of last year, nineteen were
  followed by gales, nine by strong winds, six by no change of weather
  at all, while in only three instances did the storm precede the
  warning.

1869.]            on the Work of the llleteorulogical O<U+FB01>ice.           541
    The possibility of such a system of warnings as Admiral FitzRoy
proposed depends mainly on the knowledge of three things :—
       1. The signs of approach of a storm.
       2. The direction of its motion.
       3. The rate of its progress.
Uncertainty as to any one of these points is fatal to the accuracy of
the forecast. Now, even if we have discovered that a storm is coming
on, some interval of time must elapse before we have learnt the course
it will take and its speed of progression.
    Had we a series of advanced posts outside our coasts, such as the
line of observing-vessels anchored in deep water on“ the Irish coasts
and connected by telegraphic wires with the shore, a plan o<U+FB02>icially pro
posed by a foreign meteorologist of eminence, we might hope to gain
some earlier information than is now to be had; but meanwhile we
must wait until the proposer of the scheme has discovered the secret
of mooring vessels in water as deep as is to be met with there. As it
presents itself at present, the problem is somewhat similar to what the
determination of the path of a comet would be were we to be called
upon to lay this down from the <U+FB01>rst set of simultaneous observations
made of it on a short, clear interval on a cloudy night.
    Storms are simpler in their character on sea than on land, as the
inequalities of surface divert the wind from its true course. Every
one knows that it blows much harder on the coast than inland, and so
storms have a tendency to pass along the channels, where the air, at
least that stratum of it which is nearest the earth’s surface, has greater
freedom of motion. When a storm is <U+FB01>rst felt on the west coast of
Ireland, it is always a di<U+FB02>ieult matter to say Whether it will go up the
Irish or the English Channel. When it reaches Holyhead or Pen
zance we know more about it; but then much time has been lost.
    We are at times visited by storms travelling in an unusual direc
tion, like that on Easter-day, which came down from the north, and
wrecked the ‘Ferret’ at Dover; or moving at such a rate that they
are upon us before we are aware of their approach. These are the
most dangerous of all. A gale at the end of a long spell of bad
weather in winter does comparatively little damage to shipping, for
all colliers and coasters are safe in harbour; but a sudden storm
coming after calm weather strews our shores with wrecks. Such
was the gale of August 22, 1868, of which I exhibit a diagram.
On the afternoon before it (the 21st), there were no serious signs of
disturbance, and yet next morning there was a furious gale. News
was at once sent to Liverpool,.and it reached that port at noon;
while the storm did not actually reach the Mersey until late in the
evening.
    Such a storm as this must have a<U+FB02>'orded a signal instance of failure
of any forecasts of weather for two days in advance, had such been
made at the time of its occurrence.
    I must now proceed to give an account of the modes adopted in

542                        Mr. Robert H. Scott                 [April 30,
the o<U+FB01>ice for the study of weather, and of the practical results which
appear to be showing themselves. I say advisedly appear, for I dare
not say more. I may perhaps venture to hope that the diagrams
I have exhibited may possibly contain ideas which may hereafter,
when carefully worked up, furnish materials for satisfactory weather
study.
    The <U+FB01>rst step taken by direction of the committee was the inspec
tion of the stations in order to ascertain the trustworthiness of the
reports sent up.   This was effected in 1867, and the state of things
revealed by it was far from satisfactory. The geographical position
of the stations was in most instances well chosen; but their local
situation was frequently very faulty. The reporters were telegraph
clerks, who had been left to put up the instruments wherever they
pleased ; and accordingly the thermometers were at several places
attached to the walls of railroad stations, e<U+FB01>'ectually sheltered from
the weather, and exposed to heat from engines blowing off steam.
One was unavoidably reminded of the gentleman who put up his bare
meter in the open air, but hung his thermometer close to the study
<U+FB01>re, fearing that so small and delicate an instrument might be damaged
by exposure to the weather. The climax of mismanagement occurred
at one very important station, where a boy of thirteen years of age was
in charge of the instruments. His barometrical readings were unac
countably irregular; and after several letters had beenwritten, an
o<U+FB02>icial reply was received from him, assigning as a reason for the
unsatisfactory nature of his reports that the landlord of the house kept
boiled cabbage in the room with the barometer. It is needless to say
that no time was lost in dismissing this young gentleman.
    The whole service is now carried on in a much better way. The
reporters are more on the alert; thanks to the new and clear instructions
which have been supplied to them, and to a constant system of inquiry
which is instituted whenever anything goes wrong.
    Weather study has now been carried on for two years, and daily
weather-charts have been drawn, the examination and comparison of
which has led to some results which appear encouraging.
    A principle has been much before the public of late, which was
<U+FB01>rst urged by Professor Buys Ballot, of Utrecht. It may be stated as
follows :—
    Stand with your back to the wind, and the barometer will be lower
on your left hand than on your right.
        [This law was illustrated by a diagram.]
    This law is evidently that which holds good in cyclones; but it
does not follow from it that the air never moves except in cyclonical
sweeps. No matter how gently the wind blows, the law is found to
be true. This fact in itself, however interesting, is of no use to us
in enabling us to judge of coming weather.                 ,
    Accordingly we set to work to test the relation which the differ
ences of barometrical reading, reported every morning, had to the
winds_experienced during the succeeding twenty-four hours, and thus

1869.]            on the Work of the Meteorological O<U+FB02>ice.          543
to see what indications storms gave of their approach, both as to
direction and force, by means of the relations and distribution of
atmospherical pressure. It will be carefully remembered that no
consideration of temperature was taken into account at all.
     The committee have allowed the results of this inquiry to be
privately printed, and they are brie<U+FB02>y these :—
     If we take the area from Valencia to Helder, and from Nairn to
Rochefort, we <U+FB01>nd that whenever the difference of barometrical readings
between any two stations is 0-6 in. on any morning, the chance is
7 : 3 that there will be a storm before next morning, whose direction
will have been indicated by the law, somewhere within the area covered
by our network of stations. On the other hand, the chance is
9 :1 that no storm will come on without having given unmistakable
signs of its approach by means of barometrical readings, even though
the absolute difference observed may not have reached 0'6 in.
     As regards localizing the storm, the area was triangulated, and,
for the lines thus obtained, factors were calculated, and the observed
differences turned into gradients per 100 miles. Each morning these
gradients were calculated, and the winds which succeeded them were
compared with the gradients in their vicinity. On the assumption
that a gradient of 0' 12 in. per 100 miles indicated a wind of force 8
(Beaufort scale), the percentage of success of the law was about 60.
The accordance with facts was greatest with S.W., while exceptions
were most common with N.W. winds; a wind notably liable to
“back.”
     These results show us that we do know something about the
wind which is coming, from the atmospherical disturbances of pressure
which precede it. We do not know how many hours after this dis
turbance of pressure has been observed the storm will burst upon us,
nor how long it will last; but we do know that when the barometer
is much higher in France than in Scotland, it is, at least, extremely
unlikely that an easterly gale will come on us. The two great causes
of failure of this principle of forecasting have been already pointed
out. They are—irregularity, either in the direction, or in the rate of
advance of the storm; any uncertainty about either of these points
throws all our calculations out.
     Hence we are driven to look for some principle which shall give
us a deeper insight into the motion of the air than Buys Ballot’s law
does.
     The results as to this law which have been obtained were arrived
at by examination of the daily charts. Of these charts, a very large
number has by this time accumulated, and, by their intercomparison,
very interesting results are coming out.
     It has been known of old by those skilled in the science, and in
fact by every one that watches the weather, that certain types of
weather have a tendency to recur. Thus, two of the diagrams ex
hibited form part of a ten-day series which occurred in January, 1868,
and again in December last.      The existence of such parallelisms of

544                          Mr. Robert H. Scott                    [April 30,
weather at once leads us to look for what may be called sequences
of weather, in fact, the <U+FB01>rst step towards the discovery of a relation of
cause and effect.
     On January 22, 1868, a very remarkable state of things was
observable. A westerly gale was blowing in the Channel, easterly
winds all over England; a long trough of barometrieal depression
appeared on the line of demarcation between the two currents, and a
thick fog was noticed in London. Next day the barometer rose very
rapidly, with northerly winds, and, on the morning after, a terri<U+FB01>c
hurricane burst on Scotland, and did immense damage in Edinburgh.
Now, on the 8th of December last, similar conditions of the co-exist
ence of the two currents, equatorial and polar, were reported, and
were followed at the same interval of time by the same sequence of
storms. This would attract anyone’s attention, and accordingly it
was determined to investigate all cases in which the two currents
existed, <U+FB02>owing at the earth’s surface, the polar winds lying to the
northward of the equatorial. This relation of the two currents
(allowing for the difference of the hemispheres) has long been insisted
on by Mr. Charles Meldrum, the secretary of the Meteorological
Society of the Mauritius, who has had great experience in charting
the weather of the Indian Ocean. A diagram has been prefaced from
an illustration to a recent paper of his in the ‘Journal of the British
Meteorological Society.’ In this paper he says that cyclones invari
ably commence between two parallel currents of air, the channel of
the polar winds lying on the polar side of the equatorial winds. You
will remember what has been already said about tropical meteorology
by Humboldt, and although, with the limited super<U+FB01>cial area from
which our information is taken, we cannot say whether this principle
of Mr. Meldrum’s strictly holds true or not, we may say that there
seem to be reasons for suspecting that it does. The conditions of co
existence of the two currents are rarely observed; but whenever they
present themselves, a southerly storm, or at all events a sudden and
considerable freshening of the wind from S.E. or S., a wind which did
not exist in the district before,* is nearly sure to result within a day or
so. I have selected two instances of this: one, a winter gale, which I
have just described; the other, a summer one, in fact, that which
preceded the naval review at Spithead in 1867.
     Conditions similar to those of July 13, 1867, occurred three
weeks ago, on the 8th instant, and were succeeded by southerly winds,
which did not attain the dignity of a gale, but ushered in that extra
ordinary burst of warm weather which we had

tion are simply bare facts. No attempt at a theoretical explanation
has been made—matters are not ripe for that yet. What is mainly

necessary for us, is to shape out the solid foundation stones, which
will make but little show hereafter, but will have to bear the weight
of the entire edi<U+FB01>ce of weather study-—a study with the credit of
which the name of Admiral FitzRoy will be ever and deservedly
connected.
                 Land Meteorology of the British Islands.
    We now come to the last branch of the operations of the com
mittee, their self-recording observatories. I told you at the beginning
of the discourse that, fourteen years ago, the Royal Society stated to
the Government that there was not much chance of the establishment
of a satisfactory system of land meteorology at that time, owing to
the want of self-recording instruments which should render the obser
vations uniform in method and independent of the personal con
venience of the observers. This Want has now been supplied, mainly
by the e<U+FB01>'orts of the Observatory at Kew. The barographs and
thcrmographs adopted have been almost entirely constructed there.
The anemograph is the well-known one invented by Dr. T. Romney
Robinson, of Armagh.      Messrs. Beck, of Cornhill, have kindly lent a
barograph and anemograph for exhibition to-night.
    In the case of the last-named instrument, there is no di<U+FB02>iculty in
obtaining su<U+FB01>‘icient mechanical force to produce a record; for when
ever there is wind the cups will revolve, and there will be abundance
of mechanical power to make a mark on paper. When there is no
wind, the pencil will not be moved. The actual mode adopted is very
easily explained. If a pencil which is at rest be pressed against a
cylinder which is covered with paper and caused to revolve, a circle
will be traced out. If the pencil move parallel to the axis of the
cylinder, a helix will be described, the pitch of which will depend on
the relative velocities with which the cylinder and pencil are moving,
and will thus measure the velocity of the wind. The instrument
records direction on a similar principle.
    When we come to the barograph or thermograph, we have no
source of mechanical power, and must therefore call photography to
our aid. Every one knows that at the top of the column of mercury
in a barometer there is an empty space, the Torricellian vacuum. If
a light, either of gas or of a para<U+FB01>in lamp, be placed behind the
instrument and a lens before it, an image of the illuminated space
above the mercury can be thrown on sensitive paper, and so a photo
graphic picture can be produced, the depth of which will depend on
the level of the mercury in the barometer.
    The arrangements of the thermograph are somewhat similar, with
the exception that the gas-lamp must not be placed near the thermo
meter [the actual arrangement was shown in a diagram], and that
the light is not transmitted through the empty space above the mer
cury, but through a small bubble of air introduced into the thread of

 546            Mr. R. H. Scott on the Meteorological O<U+FB01>ice.  [April 30,
mercury, which acts like a pinhole. The light, passing through this,
produces a mark which develops into a little dot on the paper.
     In both instruments the paper is stretched on drums moved by
 clockwork, so that continuous photographic pictures are produced.
         [Barograms, enlarged to six times their size, were represented
             on a diagram.]
     Such arrangements as these render us quite independent of the
convenience of observers as to the particular hours at which they may
like to take their readings. All the care that the instrument requires
is attention to the lamp, winding up the clock, and changing the paper
 regularly.
     Having got the instruments, the committee proceeded to select
stations Where they should be placed, so as to represent as completely
as possible the various conditions of climate afforded by our islands.
 The Kew committee of the British Association at once consented that
their observatory should be the central and normal establishment.
To this were added two others in England: one at Falmouth, the
other at Stonyhurst. Two stations were chosen in Ireland: one at
Armagh, under the supervision of Dr. Robinson himself, and one on
the island of Valencia, in order to obtain as westerly a position as
possible. In Scotland, the Universities of Glasgow and Aberdeen have
become stations. The committee were anxious to have founded another
observatory in the extreme north of Scotland; but the funds placed
at their disposal would not suffice for this extension of their scheme,
however desirable it undoubtedly is.
     It will be seen from what I have said that existing establishments
have been made use of, in so far as their geographical situation would
admit. This condition is of course paramount. Accordingly, the com
mittee were compelled to create an observatory at Valencia, without
doubt the most important position in these islands. The claims of
Wick or Thurso for an observatory have not been overlooked; but
funds as yet do not su<U+FB02>ice for its establishment.
    The whole of this observational system is centred at Kew, under
the immediate superintendence of my colleague, Dr. Balfour Stewart,
who supervises all the observatories, and examines all the records
received from them to see that they are thoroughly correct and trust
worthy, before they are sent on for discussion to the central office.
This is the special department in which the two committees, that of
Kew and of the Meteorological O<U+FB02>ice, work in such close accord with
each other. Of this connection it can only be said that without its
existence, it would have been all but impossible to 'have brought the
system of observations of land meteorology to its present satisfactory
condition at all.
    The <U+FB01>rst observatories began work at the beginning of 1868, and
Valencia, the last of them, six months later. Some months were
necessarily consumed in getting so complicated a system thoroughly
started, and accordingly it is only now that the discussion of the
results furnished by the instruments is being commenced, so as to

ascertain the mean values of the meteorological elements for each
station and to trace the changes of weather.
    It would therefore be premature to attempt to give an account of
the work done. To show what is doing I exhibit a curve from Aber
deen, to show how irregular atmospherical pressure occasionally is.
The second diagram represents a barometrical oscillation which passed
over all the stations within twenty-four hours, and which shows how
perfectly hopeless it is trying to give an account of such a phenomenon
by‘ means of eye-observations, no matter how frequently these are
ta en.
    Similar diagrams might have been drawn to show the changes in
temperature and in wind, but that which is exhibited is su<U+FB01>icient for
an illustration.                                                  ’
    Hereafter, if the o<U+FB02>ice is allowed to continue, we may hope to be

all by the intrinsic value of the science of meteorology to our agricul

      SIR HENRY HOLLAND, Bart. M.D. D.C.L. F.R.S. President,
                                   in the Chair.
                               CAPTAIN MONCRIEFF,
 On the Moncrr'e<U+FB02>‘ System of Working Artillery as applied to Coast
                                      Defence.
UNTIL the time of the Crimean war very little and very slow progress
had been made in artillery. Cannon were manufactured on nearly
the same models, and of the same materials that had been used for
 300 years.
     Before that time cast-iron was not in use, but the forged or bronze
 guns, although in some cases large, were not what is now considered
 powerful ; and the penetration of their shot was not suf<U+FB01>cient to pass
 through a parapet of earth that is now pierced even by light ri<U+FB02>ed
 artillery.
     The conditions, therefore, under which artillery was worked, and
 the means provided for protection against its <U+FB01>re, remained much the
 same as they were in the time of Vauban.
     Several events during the Crimean campaign con<U+FB01>rmed an impres
 sion that has always been more or less entertained, that an increase
 in the power of individual guns produced greater results than could
 be obtained by a much greater weight of metal, distributed among a
 larger number of small pieces of artillery.
     It is not too much to say, that the development of this art has,
 since 1855, changed the character of war both on land and water.
      It has established completely the superiority of a few large pieces
 over a much greater weight of metal in smaller guns.
     It has given artillery of all classes a range, a penetration, and an
 accuracy of Fire, which throw into the shade the greatest results that
 had been previously obtained.
     It has also stimulated the advocates of cast-iron smooth bores to
 produce guns that might rival the ri<U+FB02>ed artillery; and yet it is by no
 means probable that the limit of power, either of large smooth-bores
 or ri<U+FB02>ed guns, has been arrived at.
      When it became apparent that mighty results were to be obtained

 1869.]           Moncrie<U+FB01>‘ System of Working Artillery.                551
 from improved artillery, a great deal of engineering talent was directed
 to the subject. Comparatively new appliances, such as the steam
hammer, and new methods of working steel, were called to aid in the
 construction of the new and powerful guns. So much interest, indeed,
was taken in the subject, and so much attention absorbed by it, that
the conditions which these improvements in artillery themselves im
ported with them ran some danger of being neglected.
     The power of artillery became so great, that the ordinary provi
sions for protection against its <U+FB01>re were rendered useless. Forts that
were considered strong twenty years ago would crumble under the
shock of modern projectiles, and in some cases would even be too
weak to support the guns while they were <U+FB01>red.
    That service which the new artillery a<U+FB01>‘ected most palpably was
the Navy, and the Navy accordingly took the initiative in introducing
means calculated to resist the penetration of the new and terrible
projectiles. Every one is more or less conversant with the process
that has been going on of covering ships’ sides with iron, which has
increased in thickness till it really looks as if the process at last would
only be limited by a ship’s power of <U+FB02>otation.
    War-ships, however, not only protect their sides against shot, but
they also carry the heaviest artillery on their decks. This fact could
not be overlooked by those who had to construct coast defences, as
well as other works against which modern heavy artillery might be
used.
    I shall not enter into details regarding the successive steps which
were taken. in England in this direction, as I understand Colonel
Jervoise has already done so in this Institution. It is enough to state
that great engineering skill has been exercised, and unwearied efforts
have been made to meet the new conditions.
    That skill and these efforts have, with the experiments at Shoebury
ness, given us defensive iron structures which are marvels of strength
and ingenuity. Unfortunately they are also marvels of costliness; and
there is room to hope that their use will therefore be generally con
<U+FB01>ned to such positions on land as can only be protected by such iron
structures.
    This hope is founded on another system, with which my name is
connected, and which I am here to explain.
    Before doing so I shall point out the dilemma which left military
engineers no alternative, and which compelled them to give up in
succession the use of earth, concrete, granite, &c., and at last to resort
to the most expensive, but the strongest, material—iron.
    There are two considerations always to be taken into account in
providing the means of using artillery: the one is to place the gun
so as to be most formidable to the enemy, and the other is to place
it at the same time under as much cover as possible, so that it is not
liable to be disabled, nor are the men serving it liable to be destroyed
by hostile <U+FB01>re.
    These two conditions interfere with one another; that is to say,

552                     Captain Monorie<U+FB01>' on the                 [May 7,
whatever has hitherto been gained in one direction has been lost in
the other. Guns, en barbette, lack protection; guns in embrasures or
in casemates sacri<U+FB01>ce, on the other hand, free lateral range, and it
is more di<U+FB02>icult in their case to see the enemy, and therefore to lay
the guns in action.
    The difficulty that presented itself with the introduction of late
improvements in artillery was simply that the increased precision
and range, coupled with great improvements in the manufacture of
large shells and also in small arms, rendered barbette batteries too
exposed to be relied on. At the same time the tremendous penetration
and precision of the new artillery rendered the ordinary parapet and
embrasures useless.
    What was to be done under these circumstances ?
    Protection from direct <U+FB01>re must be got at any price.
    The <U+FB01>rst impulse would be, to thicken the parapet.
    This could not, however, be done, as the necessary angle in the
cheeks of the embrasures required for training the guns opens up a
wider aperture, in direct proportion to the thickness of the parapet,
making the maximum thickness in practice 30 feet.
    But shot have been known to penetrate more than 30 feet into
the earth; and the most important part of the parapet, viz. that
near the guns, must always be thin and weak, whatever may be the
thickness of the rest.
    Shells, striking this part, would just meet suf<U+FB01>cient resistance to
burst them, and would make havoc among the men.
    Next, granite masonry was thought of; but it proved in some
respects worse than earth, and was found practically bad ; there was
no alternative but to go to iron.     This conclusion was reluctantly
arrived at, and reluctantly it was acted on.
    The decisions of committees which investigated all the bearings of
the question, the opinions of professional men, and the experiences of
the American war, all coincided, and accordingly our important coast
works were designed to receive iron shields, casemates, and cupolas.
    Vital positions in England, such as dockyards and arsenals, must
be forti<U+FB01>ed.   It would be false economy indeed to use any method of
forti<U+FB01>cation that experience has proved to be insu<U+FB02>‘ieient. N0 savings
could justify the erection of works that might prove at once the tomb
of their defenders and perhaps of the nation’s honour. Therefore the
only proper decision was, to take that means to meet the di<U+FB01>iculty
which was at the time considered best and safest. Expense was
properly a consideration very secondary in importance to e<U+FB02>iciency.
    I shall now endeavour to point out the difficulty of the task which
lay before the engineer, even after the decision in favour of iron, from
the extraordinary advances, already spoken of, in artillery. There
is only one morsel of comfort left for those who have to provide for
the requirements of defence, viz. that a form of artillery-<U+FB01>re of a very
galling nature remains exactly as before, and indeed is not much
better than it was in the time of Queen Elizabeth.

 1869.]          Moncrie<U+FB01>’ System of Working Artillery.               553
     What is alluded to is vertical, or mortar <U+FB01>re. There is some
consolation, too, in the re<U+FB02>ection that the cause of this <U+FB01>re not being
much improved is one to a great extent likely to be lasting. Ri<U+FB02>ed
mortars would no doubt lessen de<U+FB02>ection to right or left; but as long
as gunpowder is affected in strength by the slightest atmospheric or
other in<U+FB02>uence, and still more certainly as long as a slight error in
elevation at long ranges will make a large error on the plane of <U+FB01>re,
the comparative inaccuracy of vertical <U+FB01>re must continue.
     To show how little can be done in this way compared with the
admirable precision and accuracy of direct <U+FB01>re, I may state that 100
rounds were <U+FB01>red one day last season at Shoeburyness at 800 yards
range with a 18-inch mortar at the row of experimental casemates
which cover a good deal of ground. The mortar was laid with spirit
levels and all the appliances of the school of gunnery, and yet the
100 rounds were expended without a single hit.
    If such is the case with a steady platform and under such excep
tionally favourable circumstances, it can easily be seen how uncertain
in its effects would practice be from mortar-boats, which move with
every wave, if directed at an equally small object. During the eleven
months’ siege of Sevastopol the French had 242 mortars engaged,
which were themselves exposed to vertical <U+FB01>re, and yet not one of these
mortars was disabled.
    It is indeed a strange contrast, that while direct <U+FB01>re is getting
more powerful, more accurate, and more destructive every year, vertical
<U+FB01>re remains much as it was, and can only be relied on to hit a large
object, such as a fort, a town, or anything that covers a great deal of
ground. Notwithstanding this, it would be a great mistake to despise
it as a powerful and galling means of attack. '
    To return to the difficulties of meeting direct <U+FB01>re in coast defence.
    It must be borne in mind that batteries intended to engage ships are
obliged to meet an enemy who can move his position to that quarter
where he is least exposed, who can continue in motion while he is con
ducting his attack, and who can seek out the most vulnerable face of
the land-work to operate upon.
    In constructing such batteries it is <U+FB01>rst of all necessary to make
them of su<U+FB02>icient strength to resist the guns of ships which are the
most powerful that can be made.
    It is next required that these batteries should be constructed in
such a manner that they can direct their <U+FB01>re with rapidity and
precision in any direction in which the ships can take up their
position.
    And lastly, it is required that they should mount guns of sufficient
weight and power to be formidable to the heaviest iron-clads.
    In former times guns on barbette were preferred for this purpose,
because they met the two <U+FB01>rst requirements alluded to; that is to say,
that from not being con<U+FB01>ned by embrasures or ports, they were able
freely to follow their <U+FB02>oating enemy whatever position he might take
up, naval <U+FB01>re at that time being neither so correct nor so formidable as
                                                            2 o 2

to make such batteries unserviceable. The case, however, is now
completely changed; for not only have guns been improved, but am
munition also; and heavy shells are most destructive. Rear-Admiral
Porter, of the United States Navy, in a report on coast defences, says,
“Such guns, standing so high up, are just the objects that naval gun
ners would delight to explode their Shrapnell against, and from my
experience in naval gunnery, the third shell would kill every man at
the gun.”
     Von Scheliha, in his treatise on coast defences, says, “Guns
mounted en barbette may always be silenced by an iron-clad.”
     This form of battery, therefore, is disposed of.
     We shall now examine the dif<U+FB01>culties connected with the other
alternatives. Common masom'y batteries have been condemned as
worse than useless, as they would only make the ship’s <U+FB01>re more
destructive than if directed against guns en barbette.
     Next comes the expensive alternative which has been adopted,
viz. iron shields, casematcs, and turrets. It is most interesting to
examine how far this system of iron, the last alternative left, meets
the three requirements of coast defence alluded to, and to see what
very great dii<U+FB01>culties had to be encountered in applying it.
     The three requirements are thus recapitulated :—
     lst. Strength of the battery to resist naval <U+FB01>re, and give su<U+FB02>icient
protection to the men.
     2nd. Power of <U+FB01>ghting the guns with accuracy and effect, of fol
lowing the enemy with ease as he moves, of being able to face him on
any side from which he approaches.
     3rd. Power of using the most formidable guns to advantage.
     The <U+FB01>rst di<U+FB01>iculty was to decide the matter of strength.
     Now guns are becoming more and more weighty and powerful
every day, and therefore the strength required to resist them is an
unknown quantity.
     An iron casemate of the present proposed strength costs, accord
ing to o<U+FB01>icial returns, with all the battery adjuncts except the gun
and carriage, about 50001. or 60001. for each gun. A 2-g1m turret,
about 25,0001. or 30,0001?“
     If guns of 50 tons are introduced in ships, as is proposed, these
defences are at once quite ine<U+FB02>icient, and it is not known how strong
or how expensive should be the iron works to replace them. Such
questions must be very embarrassing indeed to those who have to
decide these matters. Besides protecting the gun and carriage from
the enemy’s shot, protection must also be given to the men. This
is the most serious of all considerations in coast defence, for the

    The best experience we have regarding naval attacks on land
works is derived from the late American war, in which a great many
actions of that kind took place. It would be unwise to ignore this
experience, because the increasing power of artillery only gives it
more weight.
    During the whole of that war very few guns were destroyed by the
naval <U+FB01>re in earthen batteries.                                          -
    At Fort Wagner only three guns were totally dismounted,
although 2864 shot and shell were <U+FB01>red into it in forty-eight hours,
and the bomb-proofs were hit 1200 times. Seventeen siege-mortars,
several cohorns, and thirteen heavy pieces of artillery were incessantly
employed.
    At Fort Fisher the bombardment was opened at the rate of 115
shells per minute, and although the guns were mounted en barbette,
only two of them were dismounted when the place fell.
    At Fort Powell a tremendous bombardment from mortar and gun

                                                         not a single gun
was dismounted.
    The success of the ships over the forts was gained by demolishing
the works, and still oftcner by making the service of the guns so dan
gerous that the men could not work them.
     Rear-Admiral Porter, U. S. Navy, in his report on coast defence,
states, “ The new-fashioned casemates turned out to be no better than
the guns en barbette. They were perfect slaughter-houses, and were
piled up with dead and wounded. Every shell that went through the
port-holes killed and wounded every man in the close casemate. This
proved to me most satisfactorily that guns in casematcs were no better
 protected from shells than those en barbette.”
     With such evidence as this before them, from men who were con
 versant with all the events of that great war, it was indeed a serious
 question to decide what was to be done. I myself cannot see how men
 in an iron casemate are as much exposed as in a barbette battery; but
there is no doubt that if the port of the strongest casemate was as large
as those referred to by Admiral Porter, it would be open in the same
circumstances to the same dangers as the damage was done by entrance
of shell through the port.
     The protection a casemate would a<U+FB01>'ord from vertical <U+FB01>re in such
 a case would be but a poor advantage if more correct and more
 deadly weapons than the mediaeval mortar could still search out at
 times the exposed point of the casemate and kill every man inside.
     The next requirement in a coast battery, viz. to be able to follow
an enemy amidst clouds of smoke, and to lay the guns on him with
precision and dispatch, formed a more embarrassing difficulty still.
     On the one hand, the ports must be constructed for muzzle
 pivoters to give protection. On the other hand, if they are made so
 small it is di<U+FB01>icult to see through them, to fire correctly and quickly
at different elevations, and on different sides on a moving enemy.

 his vitals to his enemy’s lance or put on armour that paralyzes his
 sword   arm.is as much protection in the power of 7 being able to strike
      There
 as there is in being able to guard.
      As naval actions are likely to be short and decisive, it must have
 appeared extremely doubtful whether it was worth purchasing in
 creased safety at the expense of losing the attacking power.
      The last of the three requirements in coast defence stated was the
 necessity of using the most powerful cannon.
      This did not present the same di<U+FB02>iculty as the other two, because
 the designers of our defences had been presented by my friend Captain
 Ooles with the means of mounting the heaviest guns to <U+FB01>re in any
 required direction. When very large and valuable guns are used, it
 is not advisable to cramp their action and restrict it to a small area.
 The turret was therefore preferred to the casemate when lateral range
 was required; and though apparently very expensive it was in reality
 cheaper than casemates, because, although the mounting of the guns
 in this manner cost more, they were enabled to do much more work,
 and there was thus an economy both of guns and men.
     Having thus far endeavoured to describe the extraordinary di<U+FB01>i
 culties which the new improvements in artillery inevitably entailed
 on the engineers, I shall now direct your attention for a short time to
 the di<U+FB01>iculties in which the same improvements involved the artillery
 men themselves.
     These difficulties, though not quite so important as the engineering
 ones, were very serious indeed, and have not yet been quite overcome.
 They consisted chie<U+FB02>y in the dif<U+FB01>culty of making carriages and plat
 forms strong enough for the new and powerful ri<U+FB02>ed guns. These
pieces burnt enormous charges of powder, and hurled bolts as heavy
 as an old <U+FB01>eld-piece at 1000 feet a-second.
     The recoil of such guns represents a violence of force the like of
 which man has never had to deal with before.       Imagine 12, 18, or
25 tons of compact iron started in an instant into rapid motion with a
 violence that mocks the blow of a steam-hammer.
     This force has to be controlled and restrained. It is no wonder
 then that, when met directly and stopped by friction, as is now done
in the ordinary system, the di<U+FB01>iculties are enormous. The horizontal
strain on the platforms, pivots, and racers, is so great that it has not
yet been quite successfully met: constant changes and inventions are
being made to render this force more harmless.
     I hope I have now conveyed to your minds some idea of the
embarrassment and di<U+FB01>iculties which have fallen upon both the artil
lery and engineers by the rapid improvement of these formidable
engines of war; and of the persistent and able struggle which both
have maintained to meet directly the terrible forces with which they
have to contend.
     They have both succeeded to a wonderful extent, but their success

 1869.]            Moncrie<U+FB01>’ System of Working Artillery.              557
 is blighted by that curse of the science they practise; the law that up
 to this time has existed-viz. that what was gained in protection was
 lost in efficiency, and the converse.
      Happily I had the good fortune to conceive and develops an idea
 which abrogates this law. The very force the existence of which has
 been so great a dii<U+FB01>culty in the artillery question has been compelled
 to perform a service that at once sweeps out of existence a great many
 of those other di<U+FB02>iculties that embarrassed forti<U+FB01>cation.
     When two evils co-exist, it is sometimes good policy to make them
 destroy each other.
      I shall now refer shortly to the train of ideas that led me to think
 of solving the important problem in quite a different manner from
 that in which it had been attempted, which had led to the adoption
 of a most expensive class of works.
     My solution gives a system capable of mounting the heaviest
 artillery, while it simpli<U+FB01>es the vexed question of forti<U+FB01>cation. It
gives protection without the expense of using iron, and free lateral
range to the guns without exposure.
     The system is indeed a simple one; it does not require either brute
strength or heavy expenditure for its application; nor does it need
mighty forges to weld iron walls to protect our guns and gunners; it
only calls to our aid the simplest and most docile forces of nature.
     Instead of trying to meet force by force, I make my guns bow to
the inevitable conditions which science has imposed; and instead of
wasting energy, money, and skill in attempts to raise a buttress against
the new artillery, I employ the hitherto destructive force of recoil to
lower the gun below the natural surface of the ground, where it
can be loaded and worked in security and in comfort; and, at the
same time, I have made that destructive force so much my servant
that I compel it at my pleasure to raise the gun again into the <U+FB01>ght
ing position whenever it is required.
     In 1855, while watching the interesting operations before Sevas
topol, and endeavouring, as well as I could, to understand the condi
tions under which the siege-artillery was used, I conceived the idea
which is now realized. It was then that I saw the value of earth and
the importance of simple expcdients.
     It was plain that the weak point of a battery was the embrasure,
which formed a mark to <U+FB01>re at, an opening to admit the enemy’s shot,
and required constant repair even from the effects of its own gun,
which in <U+FB01>ring injured the revetments of the cheeks.
     I also came to the conclusion in my own mind that a remedy for
some of these defects could be devised. Afterwards I worked at
various plans, of which sketches were made or models; but each
design had defects which discovered themselves to me as my expe
rience increased.
     The real difficulty of the thing arose from the necessity of pro
viding for the enormous strain of the recoil.
     These early designs, which were sometimes excellent in other

558                       Captain Moncrieff on the               [May 7,
respects, broke down at this difficulty, and although some of them no
doubt would answer with small guns, they were not calculated to meet
the tremendous recoil of large rifled pieces.
     At last I hit on a simple principle that would meet this difficulty
to advantage, the interposition of a moving fulcrum between the gun
and platform. Then I knew that the problem could be solved; and
feeling the great importance of the subject, I resolved to devote my
efforts to working it out completely.
     While directing my attention to this simple and then apparently
obscure matter, I was, as you may imagine, neither an idle nor dis
interested watcher of the progress of artillery. Every step in advance
was riveting the certainty in my mind that the system would one day
be required, and with this conviction I refused to allow either dis
couragement or delay to make me desist. I shall now endeavour to
explain shortly the system which bears my name, as far as it relates
to coast defence.
     It consists of three parts:—
         1st. The mechanical principle of the gun carriages.
         2nd. The form internal and external of the batteries.
         3rd. The selection of ground for placing the batteries, and the
                 arrangement for working them to the greatest effect;
                 or, in other words, the tactics of defence for positions
                 where the system is employed.
     The principle on which the carriage is constructed is the first and
most important part of the new system, because on it depends the
possibility of applying the other parts. This principle may be shortly
stated as that of utilizing the force of the recoil in order to lower the
whole gun below the level of the crest of the parapet so that it can be
loaded out of sight and out of exposure, while retaining enough of the
force above referred to to bring the gun up again into the firing or
fighting position.
     This principle belongs to all the carriages; but the forms of these
carriages, as well as the method in which this principle is applied,
vary in each case.
     For instance, in siege-guns, where weight is an element of import
ance, the recoil is not met by counterpoise.
     With heavy garrison guns, on the other hand, which when once
mounted remain permanent in their positions, there is no objection to
weight. In that case, therefore, the force of gravity is used to stop
the recoil, because it is a force always the same, easily managed, and
not likely to go wrong; and as these carriages are employed for the
most powerful guns, it is a great advantage to have the most simple
means of working them.
     It has been already mentioned that the principal difficulty arose
from the enormous and hitherto destructive force of the recoil of
powerful guns; and here I shall point out the manner in which that
 difficulty is overcome.

1869.]            Moncrieff System of Working Artillery.               559
     That part of the carriage which is called the elevator may be
spoken of and treated as a lever; this lever has the gun-carriage axle
at the end of the power-arm, and the centre of gravity of the counter
weight at the end of the weight-arm, there being between them a
moving fulcrum.
     When the gun is in the firing position the fulcrum on which this
lever rests is almost coincident with the centre of gravity of the
counter-weight, and when the gun is fired the elevators roll on the plat
form, and consequently the fulcrum, or point of support, travels away
from the end of the weight-arm towards the end of the power-arm, or in
other words it passes from the counter-weight towards the gun.
     Notice the important result of this arrangement.
     When the gun is fired its axle passes backwards on the upper or
flat part of a cycloid. It is free to recoil, and no strain is put upon
any part of the structure, because the counter-weight commences its
motion at a very low velocity. As the recoil goes on, however, the
case changes completely, for the moving fulcrum travels towards the
gun, making the weight-arm longer and longer every inch it travels.
Thus the resistance to the recoil, least at first, goes on in an increas
ing progression as the gun descends, and at the end of the recoil it is
seized by a self-acting pawl or clutch.
     The recoil takes place without any jar, without any sudden strain,
and its force is retained under the control of the detachment to bring
up the gun to the firing position at any moment they may choose to
release it. The recoil moreover, however violent at first, does not put
injurious horizontal strain on the platform. In my experiments at
Edinburgh with a 32-pounder, I found that so slight was the vibration
on the platform caused by firing, that the common rails on which the
elevators rolled in that experiment, and which were only secured in
the slightest manner, did not move from their position, nor even when
heavy charges or double shot were used, did sand and dust fall off
their curved tops.
     At a still earlier experiment made with a model of a 95-cwt. gun,
the model was fired on the ice with excessive charges, and neverthe
less remained stationary.
     This valuable concomitant of the system cannot be appreciated
fully without referring to the difficulties that have been experienced,
and are now felt, in getting pivots, platforms, &c., on the ordinary
system strong enough to mount the new artillery, where the recoil is
stopped by friction applied directly by means of what are technically
called compressors attached to the platform.
     I shall not detain you by detailing these difficulties, but will only
state that the first two 12-ton guns on ordinary carriages that were
 fired in casemates (which happened a few months ago) at Gilkicker
 Fort were both hors de combat the first shot. This alarming event
 showed that with all the experience of ancient and modern artillery
 (and the carriages referred to were the legitimate exponents of the
 results of that experience), there was still room to doubt whether the

 560                      Captain Moncrie<U+FB01>” on the                [May 7,
 problem of meeting recoil had been at that time completely solved by
 the existing system.
      The accident referred to was serious, because it might occur in
 action, and in that event would disable the gun, pro tempore, as
 completely as if it had been dismounted by a shot.
     Some credit may be claimed for the new system, on the ground
 that it provided a carriage for a heavy piece of artillery on an
 entirely new principle, in which not a single part was copied from
 anything that had been formerly used, dealing with new conditions
 and performing new functions that no other carriage had done, and
 yet this new carriage (the <U+FB01>rst complete one of its kind) has now
 <U+FB01>red two hundred rounds.
     This practice has been carried out with only a few accidents which
 pointed to defects in the gearing, which were easily remedied.
     By treating this violent force in the manner above described, a
good deal of the strength that is required in other systems becomes
unnecessary, and at the same time the recoil, however violent, can not
only be met, but utilized.
     Together with the carriages there are some improvements of minor
importance, such as trunnion pointers, re<U+FB02>ecting sights, graduated
racers, and so on, which it would be out of place to discuss at present,
but which contribute to the efficiency and completeness of the system,
and are more or less required for carrying it out as a consistent whole
for coast defence.
     The second part of the system, viz. the pro<U+FB01>le of the batteries, is
of the highest importance, because unless it is attended to great ad
vantages are lost.
     This, unfortunately, makes the system extremely di<U+FB01>icult of adapt
ation to existing works. In order to get the full advantage of it no
exterior slope of parapet should be exposed to the view of the enemy.
This prevents him from being able to tell whether the <U+FB01>re be correct
or wasted, and a<U+FB02>'ords no means to him of correcting error.
     The battery in fact is masked; so that at some distance, or in dull
weather, a moving ship would have considerable di<U+FB02>iculty in laying
her guns on one battery, and still more di<U+FB01>‘iculty if there‘ were several
batteries judiciously placed for the purpose of deceiving the eye.
    It can easily be understood that the slightest error in elevation
would either carry the shot harmlessly over the battery or else cause
it to ricochet off the glacis or superior slope.
    In fact when the gun is down the enemy has nothing to aim at but
an unde<U+FB01>ned horizontal line.
    In connection with this I should mention a very interesting fact,
brought out by General Simmons at the last discussion of the Royal
Engineers on a paper of mine.
    He stated that on analyzing the range reports of the Armstrong
and Whitworth competitive trials, which were very carefully con
ducted, he found that the mean horizontal and vertical errors were
very different.

1869.]           Moncrieff System of Working Artillery.              561
    The horizontal error increased almost directly as the range, that
is to say, at 400 yards it was four times as great as at 100 yards, but
that the vertical error went on in a rapidly increasing progression,
showing that it would be much more difficult to hit a low object than
a high one of the same area.
    This law has an important bearing on the subject, and should not
be lost sight of in designing defensive works of any kind.
    It will be observed that the interior slope of the parapet gives the
most complete protection to the men, especially when the dome-form
is adopted.

     Up to the present time the new system has only been considered as
an improvement, and its value has only been estimated as an adaptation
to existing forts, and there are no proposals for applying it per se.
     I am extremely anxious to impress on you and on my countrymen
that its full value cannot be seen in this manner, and that it suffers
injustice by being thus treated. I trust its proper use will be fully
discovered before the inevitable lesson is dictated by war, and that it
may be applied in works expressly designed for it, and not merely
adapted to its use.
     The third part of this system consists in its application to given
positions, the disposition of the batteries, and methods of working them
in concert with or in support of each other.
     If I might be excused for using the paradox, the system for coast
defence consists in the absence of any de<U+FB01>ned system; that is to say,
instead of making large regular forts, and forcing surrounding circum
stances into harmony with them, every accident of the ground in this
case would be seized, where available, and small batteries, consisting
of a few guns, or even one powerful gun, laid down so as not to take
 away the natural aspect of the position.
     These batteries would be well retired from the channel, and placed
 so asto support each other in case of attack, and should, when circum
 stances permit, a<U+FB01>'ord <U+FB02>ank defence to each other, in conjunction with
 obstacles of any character that could be conveniently employed, and with
 strongholds for infantry and light artillery, commanding, if possible,

the sea-batteries, so as to make them untenable by an enemy, and so
placed as to be in the best position for a reserve, ready to support any
point attacked; the whole connected with good and sheltered roads.
    In stopping the passage of a navigable river or channel, for in
stance, the guns, instead of being massed, would be scattered round
the points where marine obstructions were placed.
    These guns would be disposed in such a manner as to retain as
much as possible for the defence the advantages of a free lateral range,
converging <U+FB01>re, and di<U+FB02>'erent amounts of command. In other words,
the method consists in placing in position the heaviest and most
powerful artillery to the greatest advantage, making that the <U+FB01>rst
consideration, and afterwards protecting the batteries, by separate and
distinct arrangements easily devised by o<U+FB02>‘icers on the spot, against
assault by any force that ships might land for that purpose.
    When an object is to be attained, I prefer to grapple with the
most difficult and important part of it <U+FB01>rst,--d0 that well,—and meet
the other requirements afterwards, with as little loss of e<U+FB02>iciency as
possible.
    The <U+FB01>rst object of coast defence is to meet and defeat the attack
of powerful ships; the next is to protect the shore-batteries against
landing parties.
    It must not, however, be forgotten that there are positions of
such importance that they might be attacked by an army on land.
Such positions must either be defended by another army placed in
a favourable position by such arrangements as those above referred
to, or else by regular and complete earthworks thrown up in time of
danger, which would enable a still smaller garrison to resist anything
but regular approaches.
    There are, however, few coast positions of such importance as to
draw the attack of a whole army; and such positions, as a rule, are
now provided with regular works of a very high order; whereas there
are many positions exposed to a heavy naval attack, such as our large
mercantile ports, &c. They are almost invariably centres of popula
tion, who require only <U+FB01>eldworks and good small arms (which are now
more powerful than ever) to repel the most determined attacks of any
numbers that war-ships could land.
    I believe many of the present coast-works are defensible only
against a coup de main.
    Wherever land attack is of more importance than naval, the
character and e<U+FB02>iciency of sea-batteries must give precedence to those
considerations which provide against assault. On the best provisions
for meeting this I do not pretend to give an opinion. In such cases,
the possibility of attack by both direct and vertical <U+FB01>re must be kept
in view.
    Where my system is employed for arming such works, one or two
precautions would increase the power of resistance.

and parades to each, should be kept as far apart as space will admit.

    2nd. Ample and thoroughly-complete bomb-proof cover for the
whole garrison should, if possible, be supplied in the middle of the
work, with arrangements for interior defence (not barracks, but places
for emergency), thoroughly secure from vertical <U+FB01>re-—good and
healthy barracks for the men being made independent of the works,
and by preference kept out of the way.
    3rd. Howitzers and light artillery ought to be kept in reserve,
in bomb-proofs constructed for the purpose, and (with the new system
this can easily be done) also with the means of changing these to any
required face.
    The dispositions of defensive batteries such as those I have very
imperfectly attempted to describe would not be complete without
good arrangements for internal communications, not only by roads,
but by telegraph, with a clearly laid down and simple method of
working them; that is, not liable easily to go wrong, nor to lead to
mistakes, and which would not require very high skill.
    Such arrangements would increase the power of the defence, and
indeed would be necessary with the detached system.
    I have accordingly given them some attention, and designed a
general plan of laying off the ranges and working the telegraphs,
which will make it possible to supply simultaneous information.
    The system I refer to (which has been submitted to the Director
(‘xeneral of Ordnance) would apply to any position, but its particular
application would vary in each case.
    It is extremely simple. One part of it depends on electrical
instruments which I have invented for the purpose, and which,
without either calculations or experience, give the range and posi
tions of an indicated ship at every gun in the position.
    Another part of it enables the o<U+FB02>icer directing the defence to
deliver in one instant, by the touch of his <U+FB01>nger, a converging volley
from one or both sides of a channel on a vessel sailing past.
    The possibility of delivering correct <U+FB01>re in this manner on
a moving object, without aiming, and by an officer not even in
the battery, was illustrated in one of my experiments with the
7-ton gun-carriage at Shoeburyness; and I trust I may be given
some day a chance of showing to what perfection this system can be
carried.
    Methods of determining the distance of vessels from batteries are
practised here and in some continental countries. My method is
designed to be quicker, simpler, and therefore more effective. It is
adapted to work in conjunction with the arrangements for submarine
mines. That part of it which gives the required information for
sighting the guns is of so simple a character, that the most uneducated
gunner cannot make a mistake in its application.
    There are many other features of the system besides those I have
particularly referred to which I shall not now discuss; each requires
different treatment.
    Among these there are methods of mounting guns in ships, in

 1869.]           Moncr'ie<U+FB01>' System of Working Artillery.             565
 <U+FB02>oating-batteries, Moncrie<U+FB02>-carriages for heavy guns of position,
 adapted for locomotion, for coast-defence, siege-carriages, &c.
     I may remark in passing that some of these applications are
considered by o<U+FB02>icers of eminence to be quite as important as the class
of Moncrie<U+FB02>lcarriages best known.
     For instance, I take the liberty of quoting from a letter I received
from Colonel Brialmont, the great Belgian engineer and military
writer, in November, 1868.      He says :—
     “I am at present engaged in publishing a great work on forti<U+FB01>ca
tions. I shall naturally speak of your invention in it, and if agreeable
to you I shall likewise mention your proposal with regard to barbette
system in batteries of attack. I believe this idea is destined to have a
great future. This last invention will perhaps bring you less renown
than the one you have experimented on at Shoeburyness, but it will
have a more general and easier application.”
     I am most anxious to impress the national importance of this
question of coast defence in relation to the system of earthworks
which are now possible.
     The day has gone by when the general principles of any science need
be considered a mystery, and I submit that any man of intelligence,
without knowing all those details which are the particular business
of o<U+FB02>icers trained to apply them, may nevertheless form valuable
opinions on the general principles of coast defence, and may, with care
and observation, be able to arrive at sound conclusions regarding them.
     The security of a country like this does not depend so much on
fortresses as on the efforts that can be made by a contented, brave, and
patriotic people. If it is known by those who would invade us that
we have not only brave hearts, skilled hands, and powerful guns, but
a system of applying our resources that is capable of making any
coast position formidable to war-ships, that knowledge will have its
effect.
     In war-time a good general disposes of his forces in that manner
which will be most embarrassing and most formidable to the enemy.
In time of peace we might arrange and prepare our coast defences on
similar principles.
    The improved artillery applied in earthworks made thoroughly
efficient on the new system, together with the facilities which the
existing network of railways slightly extended would supply, should
be made to go some way in meeting the corresponding advantages, that
have been conferred on the power of attack by steam navies and iron
clad war-ships.
    If my labours have in any degree the effect of diverting the great
resources of this country from a more expensive to a cheaper and
more e<U+FB01>‘icient system of coast defence both in the colonies and at home,
and if thereby the security from outrage and disaster is increased,
the consciousness of having helped to do so will itself be to me a
reward for the delays, anxieties, and trouble that it has cost me to
bring this matter forward.                                    [A M_]

                     On the Newest Colouring Matters.
SEVEN years ago the subject of the Coal-tar Colours was <U+FB01>rst brought
under your notice in this Institution by the illustrious Dr. Hofmann,
whose brilliant lecture on Mauve and Magenta must still be fresh in
your memories. Since then your attention has been directed to a
further development of the same subject by Mr. Frederick Field;
and it may appear strange that I should invite you after so short an
interval to listen to another discourse on the chemistry of the arti
<U+FB01>cial colouring matters. I need not remind you, however, that in this
age of progress the most remarkable advances are those which are
assisted by the hand of science; and the bare statement that the pro
gressiveness of scienti<U+FB01>c work is strikingly exempli<U+FB01>ed by the history
of these colouring matters will, I trust, be deemed a suf<U+FB01>cient justifi
cation of my review of the subject.
    The <U+FB01>rst of the coal-tar colours, the “Mauve,” came before the
world nearly thirteen years ago ; the “ Magenta ” appeared about tWO
years later ; and each succeeding year has seen additions to this
remarkable class of products. Indeed so rapidly have these colours
multiplied, that I can only notice the chief points of interest in their
chemical history.
    I may remind you that coal-tar is produced in the manufacture of
illuminating gas by the destructive distillation of coal, and that it
consists of a host of products, from a few of which our coal-tar colours
are derived. Many of these colours are derivatives of aniline, one of
the organic bases found in coal-tar. The separation of this base from
the other coal-tar products is attended with much di<U+FB02>iculty, and for
this reason the whole of the aniline employed in the manufacture of
colouring matters is prepared from the more volatile product benzol.
 By the action of nitric acid the benzol is converted into a dense yellow
oil called nitro-benzol, and by the action of nascent hydrogen this new
 compound is transformed into aniline. The benzol of commerce,
 however, is invariably a mixture of benzol and toluol, and the product

1869.]                on the Newest Colouring Matters.               567
obtained from it is a mixture of the allied bases aniline and toluidine,
both of which are required for the formation of the arti<U+FB01>cial colouring
matters. The commercial aniline thus constituted is an oily liquid
usually of a pale sherry colour. It dissolves readily in dilute acids,
forming nearly colourless solutions, which yield when treated with
bichromate of potassium a sooty black powder. This unpromising
product contains that beautiful colouring matter the Mauve, which
may be extracted by dilute spirit of wine.
    As the Mauve is the oldest of the coal-tar colours, and a child of
my own, I feel constrained to say something about its peculiarities.
I may remind you in the <U+FB01>rst place that it is characterized by great
stability, a quality not shared by all the coal-tar purples. The pure
colouring matter contains a powerful organic base now called mauveine.
This base dissolves in spirit of wine, forming a solution of a dingy
violet colour, and the development of the beautiful mauve or purple is
the result of the union of the base with an acid. The colouring
matter generally used is the acetate of mauveine, a salt which may be
obtained in <U+FB01>ne crystals having a green metallic lustre. So great is
the af<U+FB01>nity of mauveine for even the most feeble acids, that the dull
colour of its alcoholic solution rapidly changes to purple under the
in<U+FB02>uence of the carbonic acid of the breath. Mauveine is decolorized
by nascent hydrogen, but its original colour is instantaneously restored
by the oxygen of the air. Ordinary indigo is similarly affected, but
it does not resume its colour as rapidly as mauveine.
    As early as 1836, Range obtained from the products of the de
structive distillation of cool a basic oil, which exhibited a remarkable
blue coloration when treated with chloride of lime. This oil, which
he named kyanol, or blue oil, was afterwards found to be aniline; and
since the discovery of the mauve, the blue coloration produced by
chloride of lime has often been ascribed to the formation of that
colouring matter. I have lately succeeded in obtaining the product
of Runge’s experiment in the solid condition, and I <U+FB01>nd that it dis
solves in alcohol, forming a solution of a nearly pure blue colour,
which is changed to a brownish-red by the action of caustic alkali.
It, therefore, di<U+FB01>'ers essentially from the mauve, an alcoholic solution
of which when treated with caustic alkali passes from purple to violet.
 The blue product, which I propose to call “ Runge’s Blue,” undergoes
a very remarkable change when subjected to the action of heat. It is
rapidly converted into a purple colouring matter, which is found to be
the true mauve. Indeed Runge’s blue is so prone to change into the
more stable mauve that its composition cannot be satisfactorily
determined.
     The beautiful crystalline colouring matter Magenta, and its base
rosam'line, have been brought under your notice, with ample illustra
tions of their formation and properties, on previous occasions. I
shall not stop, therefore, to recount the chemical history of these
important compounds, but will proceed to develop the principles
 which elucidate the structure of the arti<U+FB01>cial colouring matters. I

may remark, however, that rosaniline now occupies much the same
position with respect to the coal-tar colours as aniline occupied
formerly. It is now the principal raw material in the manufacture
of these colouring matters.
    Nearly all the coal-tar colours contain organic bases which may
be regarded as representatives of ammonia. It is scarcely necessary
to remind you that this typical body ammonia is composed of three
atoms of hydrogen and one atom of nitrogen, its symbolic formula
being HaN. Chemists have found that certain groups of carbon and
hydrogen atoms can take the place of single atoms of hydrogen in
chemical compounds. These groups are called radicals, and many of
them are distinguished by special names; thus we have the radicals
        C Ha Methyl              C, H, Phcnyl             C“, H, Napthyl
each of which has the combining value of an atom of hydrogen. Now
we can take ammonia and by chemical means insert any one of these
radicals in the place of hydrogen, so as to produce a complex form of
ammonia. With the radicals I have mentioned we may get this series
of compounds:
         H                  H                  H                     H
         H] N               H} N              H} N                   H    N

       Ammonia.          Methylumine.     I'honylamine.        Naphlhylamine.
Phenylamine is merely the systematic name for aniline; so you see we
actually start with an ammonia in the preparation of our colouring
matters. The process of displacing hydrogen may be continued until
we get ammonias in which compound radicals are substituted for two
thirds or even the whole of the hydrogen. We have thus obtained
the compounds-—
            H               o H,                H                o, H;

        Dimethylamine.   Trimethylamine.   Dipbenylamine.      Triphenylamine.
    In addition to those radicals, like methyl and phenyl, which dis
place single atoms of hydrogen, we have other groups of carbon and
hydrogen atoms, called bivalent radicals, each of which can displace
two atoms of hydrogen. The formula: and names of two radicals of
this class are here given, dashes being used to indicate the combining
va ue :
             (C, 11,)" Ethylene                 (C, H,,)" Phenylene
Now when we attempt to displace the hydrogen of ammonia by one of
these radicals, we obtain a very remarkable result. Instead of taking
the place of two atoms of hydrogen in a single molecule of ammonia,
the radical acts upon two molecules, displacing a single atom of each

or diamine, thus:

By means of these bivalent radicals we may thus bind three molecules
of ammonia together and obtain a triple ammonia or triamine; and we
may even bind four molecules together and produce a quadruple am
monia or tetramine. The formulae of these complex ammonias may be
written in a comparatively simple manner, thus:
            "'s,
            Ethylene-diamine.
                                     "'s,

Most of the bases of our coal-tar colours are compounds of this class.
     Mauveine, the base of the mauve, appears to be a tetramine in
which the group C, H, takes the place of eight atoms of hydrogen.
This group really consists of several radicals, but it may be con
veniently represented as an integral part of the formula, thus:
                                    (e."'s.Mauveine.
Rosaniline, the base of the magenta, is undoubtedly a triamine, in
which the place of six atoms of hydrogen is filled by the group C, His,
also consisting of several radicals, which need not be written sepa
rately for our present purpose. We accordingly represent the anhy
drous base by the formula
                                             ''

     If we boil a salt of rosaniline with aniline or phenylamine we find
that the radical phenyl displaces the hydrogen that is not combined
with carbon, and we obtain successively salts of three new bases which

These successive substitutions of phenyl for hydrogen are attended with
remarkable alterations of colour. The beautiful red or magenta colour
of the rosaniline salt is changed <U+FB01>rst to violet, then to blue violet, and
lastly to a magni<U+FB01>cent blue. The salts of triphenyl-rosaniline con
stitute the important colouring matter which is known commercially
as “ Bleu de Lyon ” or “ Opal Blue,” while the salts of the other two
bases form the beautiful product called “ Violet Impériale.” The re
markable relationship of these colouring matters to rosaniline was
elucidated by Dr. Hofmann.
     But phenyl is not the only radical that can be substituted for
hydrogen in a complex molecule, and Dr. Hofmann has succeeded in
producing methyl and ethyl rosanilines analogous to the phenyl deri
vatives. By heating rosaniline with iodide of methyl we displace one
hydrogen atom by the group CH8 and obtain methyl-rosaniline, a base
which forms salts of a red violet colour. By the further action of the
iodide of methyl a second hydrogen atom is displaced, and we get
dimethyl-rosanilinc, the salts of which exhibit a bluer shade of violet.
A third substitution of methyl for hydrogen gives us trimethyl-rosani
line, which forms salts of a very blue violet colour. The methyl and
ethyl derivatives of rosaniline are the bases of the magni<U+FB01>cent colour
ing matters known as the “ Hofmann Violets,” and extensively used
by the dyer and the printer.
     I may mention at this point that up to the present time I have only
been able to effect a single substitution of methyl for hydrogen in
mauveine. The most remarkable fact connected with this substitution
is, that the methyl in<U+FB02>uences the colour of the product in the opposite
manner to that observed in the case of rosaniline ; instead of making
 the colour bluer it causes it to become redder.
     Our theoretical considerations must now be interrupted, as I have
 to call your attention to a few colouring matters upon which chemistry
 has thrown but little light as yet.
     Oil of turpentine when treated with bromine and water yields a
 very peculiar viscid body having the composition Clo Hl5 Br,. I found
 that when this product was heated with a solution of rosaniline in
 methylated spirit, purple and violet colouring matters of great beauty
 were produced. These colours are now very extensively used by the
 dyer and printer, being commercially known as the “ Britannia
 Violets.” They appear to be amorphous and are easily fusible,
 consequently they are not very promising subjects for chemical
 investigation.
     The next colouring matter that comes under our notice is another
 derivative of rosaniline. When experimenting with rosaniline, M.
 Lauth found that a solution of this base in concentrated sulphuric
 acid reacted with the colourless and volatile liquid called aldehyd to
 form a beautiful blue colouring matter. Unfortunately this product
 was characterized by great instability, a quality not generally desir-
 able in a colour. A dyer named Chirpin endeavoured to turn this
 blue to practical account, but all his attempts to render it permanent

1869.]                   on the Newest Colouring Matters.                571
were fruitless. He happened, however, to mention his difficulty to a
friendly photographer, who having unbounded faith in the powers of
 the chemicals employed in his own art, confidently recommended hypo
sulphite of sodium as a fixing agent. Though the connection between
 the fixing of a dye and the fixing of a photograph was not sufficiently
 obvious to inspire hope, the dyer resolved to test the efficacy of his
 friend's hyposulphite. Much to his astonishment he found that the
 salt turned his useless blue into a splendid green, which fortunately
 proved to be a fast colour. This is the history of the beautiful
 colouring matter known as the “Aldehyd Green,” or “Night Green,”
 the latter name having been applied to it on account of its brilliancy
 under artificial light. Though its chemical nature is not perfectly
 understood, there can be no doubt that it is the salt of a colourless
 organic base capable of decomposing ammonia salts.
     We must now resume the consideration of our compound am
monias. I have told you that all the hydrogen in ammonia may be
displaced by compound radicals, and have referred to trimethylamine
as a product of this complete displacement. These complex forms of
ammonia were studied by Wurtz and Hofmann, but more particularly
by the latter, whose magnificent researches in connection with these
bodies have secured him an exalted position among modern chemists.
Having succeeded in displacing the whole of the hydrogen in am
monia, Dr. Hofmann naturally thought that the substitution process
could be carried no further; but disregarding preconceived ideas, he
submitted his altered ammonias to the action of the iodides of methyl
and ethyl. He found to his astonishment, that a compound ammonia,
like trimethylamine, would unite with the iodide to produce a splendid
crystalline body. These new products were found to be comparable
to the iodide of ammonium. The methyl compound for instance may
be viewed as iodide of ammonium modified by the substitution of
methyl for hydrogen.          We may thus indicate the relationship of the
two bodies:

          Iodide of ammonium.            Iodide of tetramethyl-ammonium.
When strongly heated the iodide of tetramethyl-ammonium splits up
into the very products from which it was prepared, namely, trimethyl
amine and iodide of methyl.
     We have seen that methyl can be introduced into rosaniline by
three separate displacements of hydrogen. An interesting question
now arises: Will trimethyl-rosaniline combine, like trimethylamine,
with iodide of methyl? It will, and the product is a beautiful colour
ing matter. Recollecting that the development of a blue tint in the
Hofmann violets indicated successive substitutions of methyl for hy
drogen, we might reasonably conclude that this new methyl compound

  would be still bluer than a salt of trimethyl-rosaniline. The excess
  of methyl, however, gives us a colour which lies beyond pure blue,
  our complex product being the important bluehgreen colouring matter
  known as the “ Iodine Green.” It is now extensively used for dyeing
  cotton and silk, and owing to its strong blue tinge it gives a great
  Variety of shades when employed in combination with yellow. This
  green product when strongly heated splits up into the compounds
  from which it was formed, namely, trimethyl-rosaniline and iodide of
  methyl.
       There is still another aniline green which is now very extensively
  employed for calico printing. It is a feeble organic base producing
. crystalline salts, but its chemical relations have not been fully studied.
  It is known commercially as “ Perkin’s Green.”
       I must now call your attention to a red colouring matter, which,
  like the mauve, is a product of the oxidation of aniline. Its shade of
  colour approximates to that of “ sa<U+FB02>iower extract,” the colouring matter
  of the Oarthamus tinctorius, and is much redder than magenta. I <U+FB01>rst
  obtained this product several years ago, but only in small quantities.
  Improved methods for preparing it have been proposed, and it is
  already employed to a limited extent in the arts. It is commonly
  called “Aniline Pink.” It is also known as “Safranine,” but this name
  properly belongs to the colouring matter of saffron. I am at present
  engaged in an investigation of the chemical nature of this body, and
  from the results already obtained, I conclude that it contains an
  organic base which gives crimson solutions with acids and forms
  crystallizable salts. This base appears to be composed of 0,, H1, N‘,
  and its reactions show that it is closely related to mauveine.
       Last year, M. Olavel, of Basle, patented a process for producing
  a new colouring matter from naphthalin, or rather from naphthylamine,
  or, according to his own statement, from “an isomer of naphthylamine.”
  This process consists in heating together equal quantities of the
  “isomeric naphthylamine,” acetic acid, and nitrite of potassium to
  about 120° (1., and then adding naphthylamine, the temperature being
  maintained at 120° C. until the desired colour is produced. When
  puri<U+FB01>ed, the product is a beautiful crimson colour, specially adapted
  for silk dyeing.
       Several years ago, Mr. Church and myself obtained by the action
  of nitrites on salts of naphthylamine a beautiful crystalline compound,
  called azo-dinaphthyl-diamine, consisting of two molecules of naphthy
  lamine linked together by an atom of trivalent nitrogen occupying the
  place of three atoms of hydrogen. Its formula may be written thus:
                                  0.0111
                                  010 57      N2

                              Azo-dlnaphthyl-diamine.
  This substance is an organic base, giving a solution of an orange

 yellow colour, and producing with acids various salts, some of which
 are violet. Now I <U+FB01>nd that M. Olavel’s new colouring matter can
 readily be produced from this azo-dinaphthyl-diamine by a process
 which appears to elucidate its chemical nature without compelling us
 to assume the existence of an isomeric naphthylamine. On heating
 azo-dinaphthyl-diamine with ordinary naphthylamine and an acid, we
 obtain the new product by a reaction which seems to be analogous to
 that which occurs when rosaniline is boiled with aniline. In the latter
 case we know that phenyl is substituted for hydrogen, and there can
 be little doubt that the reaction we are now considering consists in
 the substitution of naphthyl for hydrogen, the product being azo-tri
naphthyl-diamine, which may be thus formulated :
                               010 H1
                               0.011.
                               010 H1      N’
                                   N!!!
                          Azo-trinaphthyl-diamine.
This new dye is known in commerce as “ Magdala.” On boiling our
azo-dinaphthyl-diamine with aniline we obtain another red colouring
matter which is probably azo-phenyl-dinaphthyl-diamine.
    The aniline pink and the magdala are characterized by a remark
able <U+FB02>uorescence 'in the green rays of the spectrum.
    The last result obtained in the production of colouring matters
indicates a perfectly new line of research. Nearly all the coal-tar
colours contain organic bases which may be viewed as representatives
of ammonia, but the discovery referred to directs our attention to
products of a di<U+FB02>‘crent class-products which do not contain nitrogen.
This discovery derives additional importance from the fact that it is a
precedent for the arti<U+FB01>cial production of the natural colouring matters.
The product recently obtained is in fact the true colouring matter of
the madder root, namely “Alizarine.”
    Graebe and Liebermann found that nascent hydrogen converted
natural alizarine into a hydro-carbon, which proved to be anthracene,
one of the coal-tar products. This result naturally suggested an
attempt to produce alizarine from anthracene by working backwards,
and the well-directed labours of the two chemists have been crowned
with success. Several years since, Dr. Anderson obtained an oxy
genated derivative of anthracene, having the composition 0,, H8 0,,
and now called anthrakinone. On treating this with bromine, Graebe
and Liebermann obtained bz'bromo-anthrakinone, having the formula
C,,(H,Br,) O2, and this compound, when digested with potash, gave
them alizarine, which has the formula CHHBQ. I may remind you that
alizarine is one of our most important colouring matters, being exten
sively used for the production of Turkey red, and our lilac, pink, and
chocolate prints.
    I have given you a brief history of the principal arti<U+FB01>cial colour
ing matters, and have endeavoured to elucidate the constitution or

574                 Professor Fleeming Jenkin on the                   [May 21,
structure of those which have been studied by chemists. Though the
beautiful relations of rosaniline and its derivatives are now very evident,
it must be admitted that for want of su<U+FB02>icient data we are compelled
to regard many of our colouring matters as isolated products. We
may, however, detect some slight connecting threads of chemical re
lationship between all the coal-tar colours. They may be said to have
a common origin, as they can be generally described as phenylic deri
vatives. The hydro-carbons from which most of them are produced
contain the radical phenyl; thus benzol is the hydride of phenyl, while
toluol may be regarded as a compound of phenyl and methyl. We do
not <U+FB01>nd, however, that these and other substances containing phenyl are
colouring matters, but the development of colour seems to attend the
removal of hydrogen from phenyl. Thus in rosaniline and mauveine
We appear to have the radical phenylene C6 H‘, which is simply phenyl
deprived of an atom of hydrogen. I do not assert that this particular
radical is common to all the colour-producing bases, but I have come
to the conclusion that each of these bases contains a phenyl residue,
that is to say, phenyl more or less dehydrogenated. The natural
colouring matters have been only partially studied, but some of them
 undoubtedly contain phenyl residues. We thus trace a connection
between the colours produced arti<U+FB01>cially and those formed in the labo
ratory of nature.
    When I commenced my lecture, I referred to the rapid advances
of applied science. The history of the production of arti<U+FB01>cial colour
ing matters is a striking illustration of scienti<U+FB01>c progress. The new
industry which emerged from the laboratory only thirteen years ago a
has attained such vast proportions, that its present annual value is
computed to be more than a million and a quarter. Now that we are
beginning to produce the natural colouring matters from coal-tar, it is
impossible to form any conception of the ultimate magnitude of this
 important industry.

     Table No. 1 gives the dimensions, weights, and strengths of each
of the component parts. The wire served with hemp will bear a greater
weight than the sum of the weights borne separately by the wire and
the strands ; and, again, the ten served Wires, when formed into a rope,
bear a greater weight than the sum of the weights which each will bear.
Moreover, while the homogeneous iron elongates less than one per
cent. before breaking and the hemp elongates only 0 ' 75 per cent., the
two combined stretch three per cent. This paradoxical result is due
to want of absolute uniformity in the strength of each part; when
separate, each breaks at the weakest point ; when combined, the
weakest points seldom coincide; hence the strength of the combination
is the sum of the mean strengths of the parts, necessarily greater than
the sum of the minimum strengths.
     The so-called spiral or helical form does not really render the
cable elastic or liable to stretch, nor does it compress the core inside
 the sheathing, as was shown by an experiment where the core was
 actually withdrawn without causing the collapse of the sheathing.
     The manner of coiling the cable on board ship was explained by
 diagrams and models ; it being shown that in order to avoid putting a
 twist into the rope when taking it out of the hold, it was necessary to
 put a twist in when coiling it away. Bad coiling produces kinks or
 loops drawn tight, which are avoided by a cone <U+FB01>lling the eye of the
 coil, and by rings or equivalent arrangements preventing the bight as
 drawn out of the hold from lashing out under the in<U+FB02>uence of centri
fugal force.
     The following table gives the dimensions and contents of the Great
 Eastern tanks as arranged for the Atlantic expedition.                     These tanks

keep the cable under water on board ship to facilitate the electrical
tests. They carry a weight of 5000 tons, in a bulk of 180,000 cubic
feet, the tanks not being <U+FB01>lled quite to the top.

     Notwithstanding their enormous weight and“ size, these tanks
occupy a very insigni<U+FB01>cant proportion of the whole bulk of the Great
Eastern.
     Mr. C. W. Siemens has for light cables employed a sort of reel or
drum on a turn-table with partial success, instead of the <U+FB01>xed tank
and coil.
     From the tank the cable when paid out passes over a pulley and
along a trough to the break drum, the object of which is to restrain
the free exit of the cable to such an extent as is desired.
     The cable is laid hold of by being passed several times round a
drum, as a rope making fast a vessel may be seen to be passed round
a bollard; the friction allows a slight strain at one end to prevent a
very heavy pull at the other end from causing the rope to slip round
the drum. The slight pull at what may be called the light end of
the rope is given by a series of jockey pulleys which play the part
of the hand when the rope is allowed to slip round a bollard, but in
paying out a cable the rope does not slip round the drum; the drum
itself turns round restrained by a friction band or belt.
     It is essential that this restraining friction should be constant ; a
result attained by the Appold Break, which was explained by models
and diagrams. In this arrangement both ends of the break strap are
attached to one lever in such a manner that when the drum begins to
turn it tends to lift the lever and weight hanging to it, and as the
lever is lifted it slackens the break strap until the di<U+FB02>'erence of
tension on the two ends of the strap is equal to the weight hanging
on the lever. When this is the case, the lever is no longer lifted,
but remains stationary with the strap, allowing the drum to turn,
restrained by a constant friction equal to the weight on the lever. If
the coef<U+FB01>cient of friction’increases, the lever will be a little more
lifted and the strap slackened ; if the coe<U+FB02>icient of friction diminishes,
the lever and weight will fall, tightening the strap; but in any case
the retarding force will be simply equal to the weight.
     From the break drum the rope dips under a weighted pulley,
which rides as it were suspended on a V of taut cable; if the strain
increases, the rope straightens, and raises the pulley; if the strain
diminishes, the weight and pulley fall; thus the height of the pulley
indicates the strain. This instrument is called the dynamometer.
Lastly, the rope passes over a pulley into the sea.
    Having shown how the cable was treated, the speaker proceeded

1869.]       submersion and Recovery of Submarine Cables.                      577
to show how the strains to be expected could be calculated. A cable
paid out in air hangs in a catenarian curve, but in water lies in a
straight line, and the strains in the two cases are wholly di<U+FB01>‘erent.
In air the rope meets with no sensible obstacle to its motion either
longitudinally or in a direction perpendicular to its own length; in
water, on the contrary, each foot of a cable meets with an opposition
to its motion perpendicular to its length, which we may call q, and
for the Atlantic cable
                                   q = 0 ' 154 v’,
where v is the velocity of the cable normally to its own length in
feet per second. Thus, as the cable weighs 0‘2575 lb. per foot, it
cannot sink faster than the speed given by the equation
                                0-2575 = 0-154 11,“,
from which 11,, the settling velocity, is found to be 1'294 foot per
second, or O '765 knot per hour.
     The result of this resistance to displacement is that the cable lies
in a straight line, not in a catenary curve, supported as it were by an
inclined plane of water constantly yielding at the velocity 0,.
     The inclination of the straight line depends on the velocity of the
ship and on 1;, not being at all a<U+FB02>'ected by the tension of the rope.
     The angle e at which the cable will lie may be calculated as
follows. Let P be the resistance of the water to displacement by
each foot of the cable of the weight w when lying at the angle rp,
                                    P = w cos. g5 ;

itself,

with the horizon. The rough Atlantic cable, when the ship was going
at the speed of six knots per hour, lay at an angle of 6%", so that the
inclined plane was seventeen miles long, and each foot of the cable
took nearly three hours to reach the bottom.
     The strain T at the top of the inclined plane, if there were no
friction preventing the rope from slipping back along the plane,
would be equal to the weight of a piece of cable hanging plumb from
the surface of the water to the bottom, or
                                   T = w as,
where w is the weight per foot run of the cable and m is the depth in feet.
     But there is a sensible friction which helps to relieve the strain
precisely as when a chain is lying on a solid inclined plane ; calling m,
the coefficient of friction in lbs. per foot length of cable at the velocity
'v in feet per second, and assuming that m,=q,v’, the experiment of
the Atlantic cable showed that q1 = ‘00504 (this is equivalent to
0'81 cwt. per knot of cable when slack is paid out at the rate of one
knot per hour). The result is, that when slack is paid out, say at the
rate of l knot per hour, and when (p = 6 ‘45°, the strain is diminished
by one-half, and if slack were paid out at the rate of 1 '4 knot per
hour, or 23% per cent., this particular cable would require no retarding
force whatever.
     The strain T,, when the velocity of the cable is cm, can be found

q1 may easily be so great as to relieve the break of most of the strain
which would be necessary to lay a cable of equal weight but small
bulk and smoother surface, with the same amount of slack. If no
slack were laid there would be little difference between the tension
required for cables of di<U+FB02>'erent construction but of equal weights in
water. When much slack is laid, all cables will be considerably less
strained than if laid without slack; and <U+FB01>nally, the faster the ship
goes the less slack is required to produce any given amount of relief.
     The correctness of the above theory-has been amply proved in
practice. If in seas 2 miles deep the cable hung in a catenary 12% miles
long, the weight to be carried would be 8% tons, and the strain on the
cable 29 tons; while if the cable hung in a catenary the inclination of
which to the horizon at the stern was 9° 30', the length would
be 24 miles, the weight 17 tons, and the strain 102 tons instead of
about 14 cwt.—the strain actually observed for the Atlantic cable
when being paid out at 7 knots per hour while the ship was going at
6 knots per hour. The rise and fall of the ship, even in heavy
weather, very slightly a<U+FB01>'ects the strain while paying out, on account
of the slight inclination of the cable to the horizon.

                  The margin of strength in deep-sea cables of the Atlantic type is
             even greater than is given in most Engineering works, since the cable
             will bear tenfold the strain which is found necessary ‘in laying.
                  The process of grappling was next described, and the operation
             illustrated by dragging a miniature grapnel over the <U+FB02>oor, so as to
             hook a chain lying there. When the cable is hooked, the strains on
             the grapnel rope are simply the weights of the bight lifted, and the
             length of this bight depends on the slack. Thus with 14 per cent. of
             slack the length of the cable lifted will be 4 ' 89 times the depth to which
             it is raised. Thus in 2 miles of water about 9 ' 8 miles of cable will be

             lifted, the weight on the grapnel will be 6'86 tons, but the strain on
             the cable will be only one component of this weight resolved in the
             direction of the tangent to the curve at the grapnel; this strain will
             be 5' 5 tons. Thus it is clear that in calm weather, with 14 per cent.
             slack, the cable can be lifted from a depth of two miles. This was
             actually done upon one occasion; but owing to pitching of the ship
             the cable parted, and was successfully recovered by the obvious device
             of grappling the cable in two points about 2!; knots apart, and breaking
             the cable at the point furthest from land; the loose end then hung
             down over the other grapnel, and it is obvious that by this plan the
             strain on any cable in any depth can be limited to the simple weight
             of a length of cable hanging from the surface to the bottom. The
             Atlantic cables will bear <U+FB01>ve times the strain due in this manner to
             2 miles of depth, and for this operation the margin of strength is also
             ample. The cable is hauled in by machinery very similar to that
             adopted for paying out ; the drum being simply turned in the opposite
             direction by a steam engine, if only a small length is to be picked up.
             If many miles are required, the cable is transferred to the bow, and
             hauled up by a double drum to avoid the <U+FB02>eeting necessary on a single
             drum. The friction of the water during this operation adds to the
             strain : thus with the value of ql previously found, at 1 mile per hour
             the friction per mile would be 0' 81 cwt., adding in a depth of 2 miles
             1'61 cwt. to the strain due to the simple weight; besides this there
             is some resistance due to the displacement of the water by the bight
             of the rope at the bottom, and some extra weight due to the fact that
             the cable hangs in a catenary, not in a straight line. The length of this
             catenary depends on the rate at which the cable is hauled through the
             water; but even after allowing for all these things, the strength of
             the cable is from three to four times greater than the strain which in
             fair weather need come on the cable when being picked up from a
             depth of 2 miles ; a margin of strength not unfrequently adopted even
             in permanent Engineering works.
                  It was by calculations like these that before the 1865 cable had
             been recovered in 1866, the speaker was able to write in ‘ The Times ’
             of August, 1865, “ If the cable retain its strength, as it probably will,
             it can certainly be raised;” and now that experience has con<U+FB01>rmed
             theory, engineers are justi<U+FB01>ed in looking forward with great con<U+FB01>dence
             to the continued prosperity and extension of deep-sea telegraphy.

     On Recent Discoveries in Solar Physics made by means of the
                                        Spectroscope.
 IN the year 1865 two very important memoirs dealing with all the
 telescopic and photographic observations accumulated up to that time
 on the subject of solar physics were given to the world. One of them
 was privately printed in this country, the other appeared in the
 ‘ Compte Rendu ’ of the Paris Academy of Sciences.
      I shall not detain you with a lengthened notice of these remark

                                                                       <U+FB02>ag
1869.]           on Recent Discoveries in Solar Physics.             583
able papers. .I shall merely refer to the explanation given in both of
them of the reason that a sun-spot appears dark—the very keystone
of any hypothesis dealing with the physical constitution of the sun.
    English science, represented by Messrs. De la Rue, Stewart, and
Loewy, said that a spot is dark because the solar light is absorbed by
a cool, non-luminous, absorbing atmosphere, pouring down there on
to the visible surface of the sun, in other words, on to the photo
sphere.
    French science, represented by M. Faye, said that a spot is dark
because it is a hole in the photosphere, and the feebly luminous and
therefore radiating interior gases of the sun are there alone visible.
    Now most of you will see in a moment that here was a clear issue,
which probably the spectroscope, and possibly nothing else, could
solve; for the spectroscope is an instrument whose special me'tier it is
to deal with radiation and absorption. It tells us that the light
radiated from di<U+FB02>'erent bodies gives us spectra of di<U+FB02>'erent kinds,
according to the nature of the radiating body,—continuous spectra
without bright lines in the case of solids and liquids, and bright
lines, with or without continuous spectra, in the case of gases and
vapours. It tells us also that absorption dims the spectrum through
out its length when the absorption is general, and dims it here and
there only when the absorption is selective, the well-known Fraunhofer
lines being, as you will readily see, an instance of the latter kind.
So that we have general and selective radiation, and general and
selective absorption.
    Now then, with regard to the English theory, if there were more
absorption in a spot than elsewhere, we might expect evidences of
absorption ; that is, the whole solar spectrum would be visible in the
spectrum of a spot, but it would be dimmed, either throughout the
length of the spectrum or in places only.
    With regard to the French theory, radiating only gaseous matter
to deal with, we should, according to the then generally received idea,
get bright lines only in the spot spectrum.
    Here then was a tempting opportunity, and one which I considered
myself free to use ; for, although the spectroscope had then been
employed—and you all know how nobly employed-for four years in
culling secrets from stars and nebulae, there was not, so far as I know,
either published or unpublished observation on the sun, the nearest
star to us. The <U+FB01>eld was therefore open for me, and I was not
entering into another man’s labour, when, on the 4th of March, 1866,
I attached a small speetroscope to my telescope, in order to put the
rival theories to a test, and thus bring another power to bear on a
question which had remained a puzzle since it was <U+FB01>rst started by
Galileo some two-and-half centuries ago.
    What I saw I will describe more fully by-and-by. It is su<U+FB02>icient
here to mention that it was in favour of the English theory. There
was abundant evidence of absorption in the spots, and there was not
any indication of gaseous radiation.

584                         Mr. J. N. Lockyer                   {May 28,
     Having then thus spectroscopically broken ground on the sun,
at very natural inquiry was how next to employ this extension of a
method of research, the discovery of which Newton had called, nearly
two hundred years before, “ the oddest, if not the most considerable,
detection which hath hitherto been made in the operations of nature.”
     There seemed one question which the spectroscope should now put
to the sun above all others, and it was this :—
     “Assuming this absorbing atmosphere to encircle the sun, in
accordance with the general idea and Kirchho<U+FB01>'s hypothesis, what are
those strange red <U+FB02>ames seen apparently in it at total eclipses, jutting
here and there from beyond the sun’s hidden periphery, and here
again hanging cloudlike ? ”
     The tremendous atmosphere, which apparently the spectroscope
had now proved to be a cool absorbing one, was supposed to be
indicated during eclipses by a halo of light called the “ Corona,” in
which corona the red <U+FB02>ames are visible.      Now, as the red <U+FB02>ames are
always observed to give out more light than the corona, they were
probably hotter than it; and reasoning thus on the matter with my
friend Dr. Balfour Stewart one day, we came to the conclusion that
they were most probably masses of glowing gas.
     Now, this being so, the spectroscope could help us, and in this
way.
     The light from solid or liquid bodies, as you all I am sure know,
is scattered broadcast, so to speak, by the prism into a long band of
light, called a continuous spectrum, because from one end of it to
the other the light is persistent.
     The light from gaseous and vaporous bodies, on the contrary, is
most brilliant in a few channels; it is husbanded, and, instead of being
scattered broadcast over a long band, is limited to a few lines in the
band-in some cases to a very few lines.
     Hence, if we have two bodies, one solid or liquid and the other
 gaseous or vaporous, which give out exactly equal amounts of light,
 then the bright lines of the latter will be brighter than those parts
 of the spectrum of the other to which they correspond in colour or
 refrangibility.
     Again, if the gaseous or vaporous substance gives out but few
lines, then, although the light which emanates from it may be much
less brilliant than that radiated by a solid or liquid, the light may be
 so localized, and therefore intensi<U+FB01>ed, in one case, and so spread out,
and therefore diluted, in the other, that the bright lines from the
feeble light source may in the spectroscope appear much brighter than
the corresponding parts of the spectrum of the more lustrous solid
body. Now here comes a very important point: supposing the con
 tinuous spectrum of a solid or liquid to be mixed with the disconti
nuous spectrum of a gas, we can, by increasing the number of prisms
in a spectroscope, dilute the continuous spectrum of the solid or
liquid body very much indeed, and the dispersion will not seemingly
reduce the brilliancy of the lines given out by the gas; as a conse

1869.]           on Recent Discoveries in Solar Physics.             585
quence, the more dispersion we employ the brighter relatively will
the lines of the gaseous spectrum appear.
     The reason why we do not see the prominences every day in our
telescopes is that they are put out by the tremendous brightness of
our atmosphere near the sun, a brightness due to the fact that the
particles in the atmosphere re<U+FB02>ect to us the continuous solar spectrum.
There is, as it were, a battle between the light proceeding from the
prominences and the light re<U+FB02>ected by the atmosphere, and, except in
eclipses, the victory always remains with the atmosphere.
     You will see, however, in a moment, after what I have said, that
there was a possibility that if we could bring a spectroscope on the
<U+FB01>eld we might turn the tide of battle altogether, assuming the pro
minences to be gaseous, as the re<U+FB02>ected continuous spectrum might be
dispersed almost into invisibility, the brilliancy of the prominence
lines scarcely suffering any diminution by the process.
     The <U+FB01>rst attempt was made in 1866, a Herschel-Browning spectro
scope being attached to my telescope, and the <U+FB01>rst and many suc
ceeding attempts failed; there was not dispersion enough to dilute
the spectrum of the regions near the sun sufficiently, and as a conse
quence the tell-tale lines still remained veiled and invisible. 'Nature’s
secrets were not to be wrested from her by a coup de main.
     The year 1868 brought us to the now famous eclipse, to see which
 scienti<U+FB01>c men hastened from all civilized Europe to India. To this
 eclipse and its results I need only refer, as they have already been
 dwelt on at some length in this theatre; suf<U+FB01>ce it to say that in the
 eclipse the spectroscope did its duty, and that the gaseous nature of
 the prominences was put beyond all question.
      But there was a magni<U+FB01>cent pendant to the eclipse, to which I
 must request your special attention. One of the observers, M.
 Janssen—a spectroscopist second to none-—the representative, in that
 peaceful contest, of the Académie des Sciences and of the Bureau des
 Lougitudes, was so struck with the brightness of the prominences
 rendered visible by the eclipse that, as the sun again lit up the scene,
 and the prominences disappeared, he exclaimed, “ Je reuerrai ces lignes
 1&1”; and, being prevented by clouds from putting his design into
 execution that same day, he rose next morning long before the
  sun, and as soon as our great luminary had risen from a bank of
  vapours, he succeeded in obtaining spectroscopic evidence of the
  protuberances he had seen surrounding the eclipsed sun the day
 before. During the eclipse M. Janssen had been uncertain even
 as to the number of lines he had observed, but he now by this new
 method at his leisure determined that the prominences were built up
  of hydrogen, this fact being indicated by the presence of two bright
  lines corresponding to the dark lines C and F in the ordinary solar
  spectrum.
       Let me show you how this result was accomplished, by throwing
 an enlarged photograph of my telescope and spectroscope on the

screen. We have <U+FB01>rst the object-glass of the telescope to collect the
sun’s rays and to form an image of the sun itself on a screen. In
this screen is an excessively narrow slit, through which alone light
can reach the spectroscope. This entering beam is grasped by
another little object-glass and transformed into a cylinder‘ of light
containing rays of all colours, which is now ready for its journey
through the prisms. In its passage through them it is torn by each
succeeding prism more out of its path, till at last, on emerging, it
crosses the path it took on entering. and enters the little telescope
you see, thoroughly dismembered but not disorganized.
     Instead now of a cylinder of light containing rays of all colours,
we have a cylinder of each ray which the little telescope compels to
paint an image of the slit. Where rays are wanting, the image of the
slit remains unpainted-we get a black line ; and when the telescope
is directed to the sun, so that the narrow slit is entirely within the
image of the sun, we get in the <U+FB01>eld of view of the little telescope a
glorious coloured band with these dark lines crossing it.
     Of course it is necessary for our purpose to allow only the edge of
the sun to fall on the slit, leaving apparently a large portion of the
latter unoccupied. What is seen, therefore, is a very narrow band in
the <U+FB01>eld of view of the little telescope, and a large space nearly dark,
as the dispersion of the instrument is so great that the atmospheric
light is almost entirely got rid of, for a reason you are already
acquainted with.
     Mr. Ladd will now show you on the screen what is seen when the
slit reaches a prominence. First a line in the red, very obvious and
brilliant, next a more delicate line in the yellow, then another in the
green, and two others in the violet; all these lines, with the exception
of the yellow line, are in the positions occupied by known lines of
hydrogen.
     As the height of these bright lines must vary with the height of
the prominences, and as the lines will only be visible where there is
any hydrogen to depict, it is obvious that the form of the prominences
may be determined by con<U+FB01>ning the attention to one line, and slowly
sweeping the slit over it.
     The <U+FB01>rst fruits then of this new method of working with an un
eclipsed sun was to tell us the actual composition of the prominences,
and to enable us to determine their shapes and dimensions.
    For the next steps you must permit me to refer more particularly
to my own observations.
    When I was <U+FB01>rst able to obtain results in this country similar to
those previously obtained by M. Janssen, though unknown to us, my
instrument was incomplete; when other adjustments had been added
by Mr. Browning, I found that at whatever part of the sun’s edge I
looked I could not get rid of the newly discovered lines. They were

not so long as I had seen them previously, but there they were, not to
be extinguished, showing that for some 5000 miles in height all round
the sun there was an envelope of which the prominences were but the
higher waves. This envelope I named the “ Chromosphere,” as it
is the region in which all the variously coloured e<U+FB01>'ects are seen in
total eclipses, and because I considered it of importance to distin
guish between its discontinuous spectrum and the continuous one of
the photosphere. And now another fact came out. The bright line
F took the form of an arrow-head, the dark Fraunhofer line in the
ordinary spectrum forming the shaft, the corresponding chromospherio
line forming the head; it was broad close to the sun’s edge, and
tapered off to a <U+FB01>ne point, an appearance not observed in the other
lines.
    Nature is always full of surprises, and here was a surprise and a
magni<U+FB01>cent help to further inquiry lurking in this line of hydrogen!
MM. Pliicker and Hittorf had already recorded that, under certain
conditions, the green line of hydrogen widened out; and it at once
struck me that the “arrow-head ” was nothing but an indication of
this widening out as the sun was approached,
    I will now, then, for one moment leave the observatory work to
say a word on some results recently obtained by Dr. Frankland and,
myself, in the researches on the radiation and absorption of hydrogen
and other gases and vapours, upon which we have for some time been
engaged.
   First, as to hydrogen, what could laboratory work tell us about
the chromosphere and the prominences ?
    It was obviously of primary importance
    1. To determine the cause to which the widening of the F line
was due.
    2. To study the hydrogen spectrum very carefully under varying,
conditions, with a view of detecting whether or not there existed a
line in the orange.
    We soon came to the conclusion that the principal, if not the only
cause of the widening of the F line was pressure.
    Having determined, then, that the phenomena presented by the F
line were phenomena depending upon and indicating varying pressures,
we were in a position to determine the atmospheric pressure ope
rating in a prominence, in which the red and green lines are nearly of
equal width, and in the chromosphere, through which the green line
gradually expands as the sun is approached.
    With regard to the higher prominences, we have obtained evidence
that the gaseous medium of which they are composed exists in a con
dition of excessive’ tenuity; and that even at the lower surface of the
chromosphere, that is, on the sun itself, in common parlance, the
pressure is very far below the pressure of the earth’s atmosphere.
    Now I need hardly point out to you that the determination of the
above-mentioned facts leads us necessarily to several important modi

<U+FB01>cations of the received theory of the physical constitution of our
central luminary——the theory which we owe to Kirchhoff, who based
it upon his examination of the solar spectrum. According to his
hypothesis, the photosphere itself is either solid or liquid, and it is
surrounded by an extensive cool and non-luminous atmosphere com
posed of gases and the vapours of the substances incandescent in the
photosphere.
    We <U+FB01>nd, however, instead of this compound cool and non~luminous
atmosphere outside the photosphere, one which is in a state of in
candescence, is therefore luminous, and which gives us merely,
or at all events mainly, the spectrum of hydrogen ; and the tonuity
of this incandescent atmosphere is such that it is extremely impro
bable that any considerable atmosphere, such as the corona has been
imagined to indicate, exists outside it.
    Here already, then, we <U+FB01>nd the “ cool absorbing atmosphere ” of
the theorists terribly reduced in height, and apparently much more
simple in its composition than had been imagined by Kirchhoff and
others. Dr. Frankland and myself have shown separately—
    1. That a gaseous condition of the photosphere is quite consistent
with its continuous spectrum, whether we regard the spectrum of the
general surface or of spots. The possibility of this condition has also
been suggested by Messrs. De la Rue, Stewart, and Loewy.
    2. That a sun-spot is a region of greater absorption.
    3. That when photospheric matter is injected into the chromo
sphere, we see bright lines.
    4. That there are bright lines in the solar spectrum itself.
    All these are facts which indicate that the absorption to which the
reversal of the spectrum and the Fraunhofer lines are due takes place
in the photosphere itself or extremely near to it, instead of in an
extensive outer absorbing atmosphere.          And this conclusion is
strengthened by the consideration that otherwise the newly discovered
bright lines of hydrogen should themselves show traces of absorption
on Kirchho<U+FB01>'s theory; but I shall show you presently that, so far
from this being the case, they appear bright actually in the very centre
of the disc, and, moreover, the vapours of sodium, iron, magnesium,
and barium are often bright in the chromosphere, showing that they
would always be bright there if the vapours were always present, as
they should be on Kirchho<U+FB02>"s hypothesis ; so that we may say that the
photosphere plus the chromosphere is the real atmosphere of the sun,
and that the sun itself is in such a state of fervid heat that the actual
outer boundary of its atmosphere, 'i.e. the chromosphere, is in a state
of incandescence.
    With regard to the line in the orange I have nothing yet to telL
Dr. Frankland and myself are at the present moment working upon
it.
    I have next to take you a stage lower into the bowels, not of the
earth, but of the sun.

    As a rule, the chromosphere rests conformably, as geologists would
say, on the photosphere, but the atmosphere (as I have just de<U+FB01>ned
it) is tremendously riddled by convection currents; and where these
are most powerfully at work the upper layers of the photosphere are
injected into the chromosphere. Thus I have observed the lines due
to the vapour of sodium, magnesium, barium, and iron in the spectrum
of the chromosphere, appearing there as very short and very thin lines,
generally much thinner than the black lines due to their absorption
in the solar spectrum.
    These injections are nearly always accompanied by the strangest
contortions of the hydrogen lines, of which more presently. Some
times during their occurrence the chromosphere seems full of lines,
those due to the hydrogen towering above the rest.
    At the same time we have tremendous changes in the prominences
themselves, which I have recently been able to see in all their beauty.
I attempted to accomplish this in the <U+FB01>rst instance by means of an
oscillating slit, but hearing that Mr. Huggins had succeeded in doing
the same thing by means of absorptive media, using an open slit, it
struck me at once that an open slit was quite sufficient, and this I <U+FB01>nd
to be the case. By this method the smallest details of the prominences
and of the chromosphere itself are rendered perfectly visible and easy
of observation, and for the following reason. As you already know,
the hydrogen Fraunhofer lines (like all the others) appear dark
because the light which would otherwise paint an image of the slit in
the place they occupy is absorbed, but when we have a prominence on
the slit, there is light to paint the slit, and as in the case of any one
of the hydrogen lines we are working with light of one refrangibility
only, on which the prisms have no dispersive power, we may consider
the prisms abolished. Further, as we have the prominence image
coincident with the slit, we shall see it as we see the slit, and the
wider we open the slit the more of the prominence shall we see. We
may use either the red, or yellow, or green light of hydrogen for the
purpose of thus seeing the shape and details of the prominences; how
far the slit may be opened depends upon the purity of the sky at the
time. I have been perfectly enchanted with the sight which my
spectroscope has revealed to me. The solar and atmospheric spectra
being hidden, and the image of the wide slit and the part of the pro
minence under observation alone being visible, the telescope or slit
is moved slowly, and the strange shadow-forms <U+FB02>it past, and are seen
as they are seenin eclipses. Here one is reminded, by the <U+FB02>eecy,
in<U+FB01>nitely-delicate cloud-<U+FB01>lms, of an English hedge-row with luxuriant
elms; here of a densely intertwined tropical forest, the intimately
interwoven branches threading in all directions, the prominences
 generally expanding as they mount upwards, and changing slowly,
indeed almost imperceptibly.
    It does not at all follow that the largest prominences are those in
which the intensest action, or the most rapid change is going on—the
action as visible to us being generally con<U+FB01>ned to the regions just in,

590                           Mr. J. N. Loekyer                 [May 28,
or above, the chromosphere; the changes arising from violent uprush
or rapid dissipation—the uprush and dissipation representing the birth
 and death of a prominence. As a rule, the attachment to a chromo
 sphere is narrow and is not often single; higher up, the stems, so to
 speak, intertwine, and the prominence expands and soars upward
 until it is lost in delicate <U+FB01>laments, which are carried away in <U+FB02>oating
 masses.
     Since last October, up to the time of trying the method of using
 the open slit, I had obtained evidence of considerable changes in the
 prominences from day to day. With the open slit it is at once
 evident that changes on the small scale are continually going on ; but
 it was only on the 14th of March that I observed any change at all
 comparable in magnitude and rapidity to those already recorded by
 M. Janssen.
     About 9h. 45m. on that day, with the slit lying nearly along the
 sun’s edge instead of across it as usual, I observed a <U+FB01>ne dense pro
 minence near the sun’s equator, on the eastern limb, with signs of
 intense action going on. At 10h. 50m., when the action was slacken
 ing, I opened the slit and saw at once that the dense appearance had
 all disappeared, and cloud-like <U+FB01>laments had taken its place. The
 <U+FB01>rst sketch, now exhibited, embracing an irregular prominence with a
 long perfectly straight one, was <U+FB01>nished at 11h. 5m., the height of the
prominence being 1' 5", or about 27,000 miles. I left the Observatory
for a few minutes, and on returning, at 11h. 15111. I was astonished to
<U+FB01>nd that the straight part of the prominence had entirely disappeared;
not even the slightest rack appeared in its place. Whether it was
entirely dissipated, or whether parts of it had been wafted towards
the other part, I do not know, although I think the latter explanation
the more probable one, as the other part had increased.
     So much then for the chromosphere and the prominences, which I
think the recent work has shown to be the last layer of the true atmo
sphere of the sun. I shall now invite your attention to spots.
     Now, as a rule, precisely those lines which are injected into the v
photosphere by convection currents are most thickened in the spec
trum of a spot, and the thickening increases with the depth of the
spot, so that I no longer regard a spot simply as a cavity, but as a
place in which principally the vapours of sodium, barium, iron, and
magnesium occupy a lower level than they do ordinarily in the atmo
sphere.
     I have told you before, that when these lines are observed in the
chromosphere, they‘ imually are thinner than their usual Fraunhofer
lines.
     I will now show a photograph of a spot spectrum on the screen.
You will see a black band running across the ordinary spectrum; that
black band indicates the general absorption which takes place in a sun
spot. Now mark the behaviour of the Fraunhofer lines; see how they
widen as they cross the spot, putting on a sudden blackness and
width in the ease of a spot with steep sides, expanding gradually

 1869.]          on Recent Discoveries in Solar Physics.              591
in a shelving one. The behaviour of these lines is due to selective
absorption.
     We have, then, the following facts : mark them well
     1. The lines of sodium, magnesium, and barium, when observed in
the chromosphere, are among those which are thinner than their usual
Fraunhofer lines.
    2. The lines of sodium, magnesium, and barium, when observed in
a spot, are among those which are thicker than their usual Fraunhofer
lines.
    They show, I think, that a spot is the seat of a downrush or
downsinking.
    Messrs. De la Rue, Stewart, and Loewy, who brought forward the
theory of a downrush before my observations of an actual downrush
were made in 1865, at once suggested as one advantage of this expla
nation that all the gradations of darkness, from the faeulaa to the
central umbra, may be supposed to be due to the same cause, namely,
the presence to a greater or less extent of a relatively cooler absorbing
atmosphere; thus suggesting as one cause of the darkening of a
spot
    1. The general absorption of the atmosphere, thicker here than
elsewhere, as the spot is a cavity.
    To which the spectroscope added in 1866, as you know——
    2. Greater selective absorption.
    I have Dr. Frankland’s permission to exhibit an experiment con
nected with our researches on absorption which will show you that
this increased selective absorption can be fairly grappled with in our
laboratories. I will show you on the screen the absorption line due
to sodium vapour, in one part as thin as it is in the ordinary solar
spectrum; in another, almost if not quite as thick as it appears in a
spot; and I accomplish this result in the following way :—Here I
have an electric lamp, and by means of this slit I only permit a <U+FB01>ne
line of light to emerge from it; here the beam passes through a bi
sulphide of carbon prism, and there you see on the screen the glorious
spectrum, due to the dismemberment of the <U+FB01>ne line of polychro
matic light. Mr. Pedler will now place a glass tube containing
metallic sodium, scaled up with hydrogen, in front of the slit, and
will heat it with a spirit lamp.
    As the sodium vapour rises you see the dark line of absorption
make its appearance as an extremely <U+FB01>ne line, and <U+FB01>nally you see
that the light which traverses the upper layer of the sodium scarcely
suffers any absorption—the line is thin ; while, on the contrary, the
light which has traversed the lower, denser layers has suffered tremen
dous absorption: the line is inordinately thick, such as we see it in
the spectrum of a spot.
    So much then for the selective absorption. My recent observations,
to which I will shortly draw attention, show, I think, that it is of
great importance, especially in connection with the fact that the pas
sage from the penumbra to the umbra is generally less gradual than

592                      ‘  Mr. J. N. Lochyer                    [May 28,
that from the photosphere to the penumbra. You see now how much
is included in the assertion that the photosphere is gaseous.
     You are all, I know, familiar with that grand generalization of
Kirchho<U+FB01>’s, by which he accounted for the Fraunhhofer lines.
     If we have a gas or a vapour less luminous than another light
source, and view that light-source through the gas or vapour, then we
shall observe absorption of those particular rays which the gaseous
vapour would emit if incandescent.
     Let us con<U+FB01>ne our attention to the hydrogen Fraunhofer lines'
     When I observe the chromosphere on the sun’s limb, with no
brighter light-source behind it, I observe its characteristic lines
bright. But when I observe them on the sun itself—that is, when the
brighter sun is on the other side of the hydrogen envelope, then, as a
rule, its function is reduced-is toned down-the envelope acts as an
absorber—the lines are observed black.
     Now what must we conclude when I tell you that, at the present
time, it is almost impossible to observe the sun for an hour without
observing the hydrogen lines, every now and then, bright upon the sun
itsel !
     {Yet only are the lines observed bright, but it would appear that
the strongly luminous hydrogen is carried up by the tremendous con
vection currents at different pressures ; and under these circumstances
the bright line is seen to be expanded on both sides of its normal
position. Moreover, at times there is a dim light on both sides the
black line, and the line itself is thinned out, showing that, although
there is an uprush of strongly luminous material, the column is still
surmounted by some less luminous hydrogen, possibly separated from
the other portion, which still performs the functions of an absorber.
This seems established by another fact, namely that at times the
lines, still black, expand on both sides, as if, in fact, in these regions
there were a depression in the chromosphere ; you already know that
the pressure is greater at the base of the chromosphere than at the
summit.                                           _
     For this reason it is best to observe these phenomena by means of
the green line, which expands in a more decided manner by pressure
than does the red.
     I now come to a new <U+FB01>eld of discovery opened out by these inves
tigations, a branch of the inquiry which I fear you will consider more
startling than all the rest—-a branch, however, which I have had
many opportunities of studying, and which has required me to move
with the utmost caution. I allude to the movements of the hydrogen
envelope and prominences at which I have before hinted.              -
     Any one who has observed the sun with a powerful telescope,
especially in a London fog—all too great a rarity unfortunately for
such work-will have been struck with the tremendous changes
observed in spots. Now, change means movement, and as spot

1869.]            on Recent Discoveries in Solar Physics.            593
phenomena occur immediately below the level of the chromosphere
we may easily imagine that the chromosphere and its higher waves,
the prominences, will also partake of the movements, be they up- or
down- rushes, cyclones, or merely lateral motions. I have thrown on
the screen a photograph of a drawing of a sun-spot observed under
the clear sky of Rome by Father Secchi—a drawing I regard as a
most faithful counterpart of nature.
    You see how the photosphere is being driven about and con
torted; how here it seems to be torn to ribbons by the action of
some tremendous force, how here it is dragged down and shivered to
atoms.
    The spectroscope enables us to determine the velocities of these
movements with a considerable approach to accuracy; and at times
they are so great that I am almost afraid to mention them to you.
    Let me <U+FB01>rst endeavour to give you an idea how this result is
arrived at, and I must here beg your indulgence for a gross illustration
of one of the most supremely delicate of nature’s operations.
    Imagine a barrack out of which is constantly issuing with measured
tread and military precision an in<U+FB01>nite number of soldiers in single
or Indian <U+FB01>le ; and suppose yourself in a street seeing these soldiers
pass.    You stand still, and take out your watch, and <U+FB01>nd that so
many pass you in a second or minute, and that the number of soldiers,
as well as the interval between them, is always the same.
    You now move slowly towards the barrack, still noting what
happens. You <U+FB01>nd that more soldiers pass you than before in the
same time, and, reckoned in time, the interval between each soldier
is less.
    You now move still slowly from the barrack, i. 6. with the soldiers.
You <U+FB01>nd that fewer soldiers now pass you, and that the interval
between each is longer.
    Now suppose yourself at rest, and suppose the barrack to have a
motion now towards you, now from you.
    In the <U+FB01>rst case the men will be paid out, so to speak, more
rapidly. The motion of the barrack-gate towards you will plant each
soldier nearer the preceding one than he would have been if the
barrack had remained at rest. The soldiers will really be nearer
together.
     In the second case it is obvious that the interval will be greater,
and the soldiers will really be further apart.
     So that, generally, representing the interval between each soldier
by an elastic cord, if the barrack and the eye approach each other by
the motion of either, the cord will contract; in the case of recession,
the cord will stretch.                                     -       _
     Now let the barrack represent the hydrogen on the sun, perpetu
ally paying out waves of light, and let the elastic cord represent one
of these waves; its length will be changed if the hydrogen and the
eye approach eachv other by the motion of either.

594                        Mr. J. N. Lockyer                   [May 28,
    Particular wave lengths with the normal velocity of light are
represented to us by different colours.
    The long waves are red.
    The short waves are violet.
    Now let us <U+FB01>x our attention on the green wave, the refrangibility
of which is indicated by the F line of hydrogen. If any change of
wave length is observed in this line, and not in the adjacent ones, it is
clear that it is not to the motion of the earth or sun, but to that of
the hydrogen itself and alone that the change must be ascribed.
    If the hydrogen on the sun is approaching us the waves will be
crushed together; they will therefore be shortened, and the light will
incline towards the violet, that is, towards the light with the shortest
waves; and if the waves are shortened only by the wwlmth of
a millemeter We can detect the motion.
    If the hydrogen on the sun is receding from us the Waves will be
drawn out, they will therefore be longer, and the green ray will
incline towards the red.
    I must next point out, that there are two different circumstances
under which the hydrogen may approach or recede from the eye.
    I have here a globe, which we will take as representing the sun.
Fix your attention on the centre of this globe : it is evident that an
uprush or a downrush is necessary to cause any alteration of wave
length. A cyclone or lateral movement of any kind is powerless;
there will be no motion to or from the eye, but only at right angles
to the line of sight.
     Next <U+FB01>x your attention to the edge of the globe—the limb, in
astronomical language; here it is evident that an upward or downward
movement is as powerless to alter the wave length as a lateral move
ment was in the other case, but that, should any lateral or cyclonic
movement occur here of su<U+FB01>icient velocity, it might be detected.
     So that we have the centre of the disc for studying upward and
downward movements, and the limb for studying lateral or cyclonic
movements, if they exist.
     If the hydrogen-lines were invariably observed to broaden out on
both sides, the idea of movement would require to be received with
 great caution; we might be in presence of phenomena due to greater
pressure, both when the lines observed are bright or black upon the
 sun; but when they widen out, sometimes on one side, sometimes on
 the other, and sometimes on both, this explanation appears to be
 untenable, as Dr. Frankland and myself in our researches at the
 College of Chemistry have never failed to observe a widening out,
 equally or nearly so, on both sides the F line when the pressure of
 the gas has been increased.
     You see now on the screen a diagram showing the strange con
 tortions which the F hydrogen line undergoes at the centre of the
 sun’s disc. Not only have we the line bright, as I have before told you,

1869.]            on Recent Discoveries in Solar Physics.              505
but the dark one is twisted in places, generally inclining towards the
red; and often when this happens we‘ have a bright line on the violet
side. You see it, sometimes, stopping short of one of the small sun
spots ; swelling out prior to disappearance; invisible in a facula
between two small spots ; changed into a bright line, and widened out
on both sides two or three times in the very small spots; becoming
bright near a spot, and expanding over it on both sides; very many
times widened out near a spot, sometimes considerably, on the less
refrangible side; and, <U+FB01>nally, extended as a bright line without any
thickening over a small spot.
    Now the other Fraunhofer lines on the diagram may be looked
upon as so many milestones telling us with what rapidity the uprush
and downrush take place; for these twistings are npthing more or
less than alterations of wave length, and thanks to Angstr<U+FB01>m’s map
we can map out distances along the spectrum from F in jvo-glmths
of a millimeter from the centre of that line; and we know that an
alteration of that line molmth mm, towards the violet means a
velocity of 38 miles a second towards the eye, i. e. an uprush; and
that a similar alteration towards the red means a similar velocity
from the eye, i. e. a downrush.    The fact that the black line inclines
to the red shows that the less bright hydrogen descends; the fact that
the bright line—where both are visible side by side—inclines to the
violet, shows that the more vivid hydrogen ascends; and the alteration
of wave length is such that 20 miles a second is very common.
    Now, observations of the lateral motions at the limb are of course
made by the chromospheric bright lines seen beyond the limb. Here
the velocities are very much more startling; not velocities of uprush
and downrush, as you now know, but swinging and cyclonic motions
of the hydrogen.
    I will <U+FB01>rst show you a cyclone observed on the 14th of March,
but before I do so let me make one remark. Although the slit used
is as narrow as I can make it, let us say m‘mth—l have not measured
it—of an inch, a strip of this breadth, of the sun’s image, is something
considerable, as the glorious sun himself is painted by my object-glass
only about ' 94 inch in diameter, so that after all the slit lets in to be
analyzed a strip some 1800 miles wide.
    Now, suppose we have a cyclone of incandescent hydrogen some
1500 miles wide tearing along with a very rapid rotatory motion, it
is clear that all this cyclone could fall within the slit; and that if the
rotatory motion were sufficiently rapid the spectroscope should sepa
rate the waves which are carried towards us from those which are
receding. It does this: as you see, we have an alteration of wave-length
both towards the red and violet, amounting to something like 40 miles
a second. Now it should be clear to you that, by moving the slit <U+FB01>rst
one way and then the other, we may be able to bring it in turn to
such positions that only the light proceeding from either side of the
cyclone can enter it. Then we shall have changes of wave-length in
one direction only, in each case precisely as you see was observed.

596                        Mr. J. N. Lockyer                   [May 28,
    Now, let us suppose that instead of a cyclone, we have a motion of
some portions of the prominence towards the eye; and that, moreover,
the rate of motion varies excessively in some portions. What we
shall see will be this. The portion of the prominence at rest will
give us no alteration of wave-length; its bright line will be in a line
with the corresponding black one in the spectrum. The portion
moving towards the eye, however, will give us an alteration of wave
length towards the violet. You are now in a position to grasp the
phenomena revealed to me by my spectroscope on the 12th instant,
when at times the F line was triple! the extreme alteration of wave
length being such that the motion of that part of the prominence
giving the most extreme alteration of wave-length must have exceeded
120 miles per second, if we are to explain these phenomena by the
only known possible cause which is open to us.
    By moving the slit it was possible to see in which part of the
prominence these great motions arose, and to follow the change of
wave-length to its extremest limit.
    By the kindness of Dr. Balfour Stewart I am able to exhibit to
you some of the Kew sun-pictures which show you how these spectro
scopic changes are sometimes connected with telescopic ones.
    On the 21st April there was a spot very near the limb which I was
enabled to observe continuously for some time. At 7.30 A.M. there
was a prominence visible in the <U+FB01>eld of view, in which tremendous
action was evidently going on, for the O, D, and F lines were magni
<U+FB01>cently bright in the ordinary spectrum itself, and as the spot-spectrum
was also visible it was seen that the prominence was in advance of the
spot. The injection into the chromosphere surpassed anything I had
seen before, for there was a magnesium cloud quite separated from the
limb, and high up in the prominence itself.
    By 8.30 the action had quieted down, but at 9.30 another throb
was observed, and the new prominence was moving away with tre
mendous velocity. While this was going on, the hydrogen lines
suddenly became bright on the other side (the earth’s side) of the
spot, and widened out considerably—indeed to such an extent that I
attributed their action to a cyclone, although, as you know, this was
a doubtful case.
    Now, what said the photographic record? The sun was photo
graphed at 10h. 55m. A.M., and I hope you will be able to see on the
screen how the sun’s surface was disturbed near the spot. A sub
sequent photograph at 4h. 1m. P.M. on the same day shows the limb
to be actually broken in that particular place : the photosphere seems
to have been absolutely torn away behind the spot, exactly when the
spectroscope had afforded me possible evidence of a cyclone!
    In connection with the last branches of the research I have
brought to your notice, I may remark that we have two very carefully
prepared recent maps of the solar spectrum, one by Kirchhoff, the

1869.]           on Recent Discoveries ‘in Solar Physics.             597
other by Angstrom, made a few years apart and at different epochs
with regard to the sun-spot period. If you look at these maps you
will see a vast di<U+FB01>'erence in the relative thicknesses of the C and F
lines, and great differences in the relative darkness and position of the
lines; and if I had time I could show you that we now may be sup
plied with a barometer, so to speak, to measure the varying pressures
in the solar and stellar chromospheres ; for, depend upon it, every
star has, has had, or will have, a chromosphere, and there are no such
things as “ worlds without hydrogen,” any more than there are stars
without photospheres. I suggested in 1866 that possibly a spectro
scopic examination of the sun’s limb might teach us somewhat of the
outburst of the star in Corona, and already we see that all that is
necessary to get just such an outburst in our own sun is to increase
the power of his convection currents, which we know to be ever at
work. Here, then, is one cataclysm the less in astronomy—one less
“ World on Fire,” and possibly also a bright light thrown on the past
history of our own planet.
    I might show you further that we now are beginning to have a
better hold on the strange phenomena presented by variable stars, and
that an application of the facts I have brought to your notice this
evening, taken in connection with the various types of stars which
have been indicated by Father Secchi with admirable philosophy,
opens out generalizations of the highest interest and importance 3 and
that having at length fairly grappled with some of the phenomena of
the nearest star, we may soon hope for more certain knowledge of the
distant ones.
    At present, however, we may well leave speculation for those who
prefer it to acquiring facts; let us rather, emboldened by the work
which this new method of research has enabled us to accomplish in
this country, under the worst atmospheric conditions, in seven short
months, go on quietly deciphering one by one the letters of this strange
hieroglyphic language which the spectroscope has revealed to us-a
language written in <U+FB01>re on that grand orb which to us earth-dwellers
is the fountain of light and heat, and even of life itself.             .

                  WILLIAM ODLING, Esq. M.B. F.R.S.

                   On the Simplest Organic Compounds.
ALL the olefine hydrocarbons are found to have one and the same
ultimate composition, or ratio of carbon to hydrogen.
                        C. H.     ...   ...  Ethylene
                        C, H,     ...   ...  Propylene
                        C. He     ...   ...  Butylene
                        C, Hio    ...   ...  Amylene
                        C. H. ...       ...  &c, &c.
But these hydrocarbons obviously differ in the complexity of their con
stitution. Some of them are gases, differing from one another in conden
sability; others of them are liquids, differing from one another in vola
tility; while others of them are solids, differing from one another in
fusibility. The exact degree of complexity of each hydrocarbon is shown
by its reactions. . Thus the hydrogen of gaseous ethylene being ex
perimentally divisible into four parts, and its carbon into two parts,
there is deduced for it the formula C.H., ; while the hydrogen of
liquid amylene being experimentally divisible into ten parts, and its
carbon into five parts, there is deduced for it the formula C.H.
Again, it is possible to extract from a given volume of ethylene gas
and amylene vapour, four times and ten times respectively the actual
weight of hydrogen obtainable from the same volume of hydrochloric
acid gas; and also to extract therefrom two times and five times re
spectively the actual weight of carbon that is obtainable from the
same volume of carbonic acid gas—these two gases, formulated as
HCl and CO, containing within a given volume the smallest observed
weights of hydrogen and of carbon respectively. The olefine hydro
carbons are said to be polymeric, and their different properties are
satisfactorily referable to the different relative weights of their units or
molecules. There exist many other series of polymeric bodies, that
is of bodies having one and the same ultimate composition, but dif
ferent molecular weights.

    Acetone, propion-aldehyd, and allyl-aleohol are entirely different
substances, possessed of well-marked distinctive properties. Like the
several ole<U+FB01>nes, they have the same ultimate composition as each
other; but, unlike the several ole<U+FB01>nes, they have also the same mole
cular weight as each other, and are expressed by the same molecular
formula C,H,O. In each of them the carbon is experimentally divi
sible into three parts, and the hydrogen into six parts, while the
oxygen is indivisible; and it is possible to extract from any given
volume of one of them exactly the same weights of carbon, hydrogen,
and oxygen that are obtainable from the same gas-volume of each of
the other two.    These different bodies are said to be metameric, and
their different properties are necessarily referable to a difference in
the arrangement of their constituent elements.
                                   III.
    The existence of a determinate structural arrangement in chemical
compounds is further demonstrated by a host of considerations; but
the dif<U+FB01>culty of making out the actual structure of individual compounds
has hitherto proved insuperable. The facility of setting forth imagi
nary structure, however, is very great; and accordingly the presenta
tion of imaginary for ascertained structure has been freely practised
by chemists from the <U+FB01>rst introduction of chemical formulae until now.
But in what degree soever a determination of absolute chemical structure
may hereafter be achieved, the possibility exists very generally, even
at the present day, of determining relative chemical structure-of
making out that in such and such a body the structural arrangement
is similar to, or di<U+FB02>'erent from, that of some other and usually more
simple body. Hence the importance of studying the structural ana
logies of the simplest organic bodies.
                                    IV.
    Marsh-gas is furnished by the decay of moist vegetable tissue, and
in other ways. Chloride of methyl-gas is furnished by the action of
hydrochloric acid upon narcotine, codeine, wood-spirit, &c. The
ultimate composition of the two gases is expressed by the formulas
CH, and (311,01 respectively. Marsh-gas is transformable into methyl
chloride by the action of chlorine; and methyl-chloride into marsh
gas by the action of hydrogen. From this mutual metamorphosis, and
from the parallelism of their properties, formations, and transformations,
the two gases are inferred to have one and the same molecular struc
ture, whatever that may be; and the same conclusion is applicable to
the entire series of bodies formulated below :

    Wood-spirit is usually furnished by the destructive distillation of
wood, but is procurable from many other sources, and especially from
essential oil of winter-green, by its decomposition with potash. The
ultimate composition of wood-spirit is expressed by the formula
CH.O; and it is observable that the difference of ultimate composition
between wood-spirit and methyl-chloride CH,Cl, is the same as that
between water H.O, and hydrochloric acid HCl ; as is shown more
clearly by the following formulae, in which the differential constitu
ents of the two pairs of bodies are included in parentheses.
         H(Cl) ... ... H(HO).         CH (Cl) ... ... CH.(HO).
     Further, the residue H of hydrochloric acid and residue CH, of
methyl-chloride are transformable into water and wood-spirit respect
ively, and re-transformable from water and wood-spirit back to hydro
chloric acid and methyl-chloride respectively, by precisely similar
reactions.
     From the mutual metamorphoses and parallel habitudes of the two
bodies, methyl-chloride and wood-spirit, it is inferred that, with regard
to their common residue CH, they have the same structure as one
another; while, with regard to their differential constituents, (Cl) and
(HO), their difference of structure is analogous to the difference
between hydrochloric acid and water.
                                   VI
     Hydrochloric acid HCl, and water H.0, are the first and second
 terms of a series of bodies of which the third and fourth terms are
 constituted by ammonia HaN, and marsh-gas H.C respectively. Hence
 arises a question as to the existence of organic bodies bearing to
 methyl-chloride and wood-spirit the relation that ammonia and
 marsh-gas bear to hydrochloric acid and water.
                                    VII.
     Many years ago, methyl-amine was discovered by Wurtz. It is
 now known to occur as a product of the putrefaction of, and also
 of the action of alkalis upon, many animal substances.        Its resem
 blance in properties to ammonia is most remarkable, and its differen
 tiation therefrom somewhat difficult. Its ultimate composition is ex
 pressed by the formula CHN; whence it appears that the difference
 of ultimate composition between methyl-amine and wood-spirit and
 methyl-chloride is the same as that between ammonia and water and
 hydrochloric acid.
         HCl     ...  ... CH, Cl         H (Cl)    ... ... CH, (Cl)

      Moreover, methyl-amine, wood-spirit, and methyl-chloride are
 mutually convertible, through exchanges of their differential consti

tuents, by processes effecting similar mutual conversions of hydro
chloric acid, water, and ammonia. From the mutual metamorphoses
and parallel habitudes of the three bodies, it is inferred that, with
regard to their common residue CH5, they have the same structure as
each other, while with regard to their differential constituents (Cl),
(HO), and (HQN), their difference of structure is similar to the dif
ference between hydrochloric acid and water and ammonia.
                                 VIII.
    Wood-spirit or methyl-hydrate is producible by the action of
methyl-chloride upon sodium-hydrate NaHO; and methyl-amine by
the action of methyl-chloride upon sodium-amide NaHgN. Simi
larly, methyl-methide is producible by the action of methyl
chloride upon sodium-methide NaH,G. (Action of methyl-iodide
upon zinc-methide.——-Frankland and Kolbe.)

This methyL-methide is now known to be identical with the hydro
carbon C,H,, producible by the indirect deoxidation of common
alcohol C,H,O, and known as ethane or hydride of ethyl. Ethane
CH, H8O), being susceptible of two distinct and similar sets of
mars —gas reactions, just as methyl-amine OH,,(H,N) is susceptible
of one set of marsh-gas and one set of ammonia reactions—as before,
an identity of structure between ethane and methyl-amine is in
ferred with respect to their common residue 0H,, and a difference of
structure with respect to their differential constituents (HQ) and
(HgN), parallel to the difference in structure between marsh-gas and
ammoma.

been shown in the above, and might be shown in many other com
pounds. But oxygen, altogether unsaturated by hydrogen, has the
additional property of being exchangeable for two proportions of
chlorine or hydrogen; and nitrogen, altogether unsaturated by hydro
gen, has the additional property of being exchangeable for three
proportions of chlorine or hydrogen, as indicated by the succeeding
formulae for mercuric oxide and mercuric chloride, and for boric
nitride and boric chloride respectively.

    Marsh-gas compounds, in which hydrogen or chlorine has been
exchanged for half-saturated oxygen and two-thirds saturated nitro
gen, have been already adduced in wood-spirit CILO, and methyl
amine CH,N ; and reference has also been made to the corresponding
hydro-carbon CH.,C or C211,. The question now arises as to the
existence of marsh-gas compounds in which hydrogen or chlorine
has been exchanged for else unsaturated oxygen and nitrogen, and of
hydrocarbons corresponding to these compounds.
                                   X.
    Some few years back a curious oxidation product of wood-spirit
was discovered by Hofmann. It is now called formic aldehyd, and its
ultimate composition is expressed by the formula CHgO. In respect
of ultimate composition its relationship to the second marsh-gas
chloride 0H,,Cl, is obviously similar to that of mercuric oxide HgO,
to mercuric chloride HgOl,. Both formic aldehyd and methylen di
chloride, however, are imperfectly studied compounds, and their
actual metamorphoses are unknown. But in the case of many other
aldehyds and corresponding organic dichlorides, the relationship of
mutual metamorphosis is well established, whence it is believed to
exist between these two compounds also. On this assumption formic
aldehyd CH,,O", and methylen dichloride CHQCIQ, are inferred to
have one and the same structural arrangement in respect to their
common residue CH2, and a di<U+FB01>'erence of structure in respect to
their di<U+FB01>'erential constituents O" and 01,, similar to the difference
 between oxide and chloride of mercury for example.
                                  XI.
    Prussic acid is a well-known organic compound producible by the
action of water on bitter almond kernels, and in various other ways.
Its ultimate composition being expressed by the formula OHN, the
difference in ultimate composition between it and chloroform CHCl3,
is obviously similar to the difference in composition between nitride
and chloride of boron, BN and B01, respectively. Now chloroform
is readily converted into prussic acid, and boric chloride into boric
nitride, by the similar action of ammonia upon the two compounds,
with exchange of Cl, for N”', thus :—
              01101, + H,N = OHN + 3HO1
                 E01, + H,N              BN + 31101.
Prussia acid CHN’”, and chloroform 01101,, are accordingly inferred to
have one and the same structure in respect of their common residue
CH, and a difference of structure in respect of their differential con
stituents N'” and C1,, parallel to the difference between nitride and
chloride of boron for example.

                                   XII.
    Allowing for the different replaceable values of oxygen O", and
nitrogen N'", the relationship of methyl-amine to prussic acid is com
parable with that of formic aldehyd to wood-spirit:—
Wood-spirit CH, O | Formic aldehyd CH, O
Methylamine CH, N                           35      Prussic acid C. H. N.
Ethane . . CH, C Ethylene . . CH, C | Acetylene . CH, C
Prussic acid and formic aldehyd are procurable from methylamine
and wood-spirit respectively, by similar processes of dehydrogenation
or oxidation; while methyl-amine actually, and wood-spirit analogically,
are reproducible from prussic acid and formic aldehyd by the reverse
process of hydrogenation. Now the difference in ultimate composition,
between othane and olefiant gas, or ethylene, is similar to that between
wood-spirit and formic aldehyd; and the difference of ultimate com
position, between the hydrocarbons ethane and acetylene, is similar to
that between methyl-amine and prussic acid. Moreover ethane is
convertible successively into ethylene and acetylene by oxidation; and
acetylene is reconvertible into ethylene and ethane successively by
hydrogenation.
                                  XIII.
    The experimental relationship of ethane, methyl-amine, and wood
spirit has been already considered. Formic aldehyd being a very
imperfectly-studied compound, the relationship between it and
ethylene is as yet analogical only; but the experimental relationship
between acetylene and prussic acid has recently been established by
Berthelot, who has shown that mixed acetylene and nitrogen are con
vertible into prussic acid, and that prussic acid is reconvertible into
mixed acetylene and nitrogen, by the action of the electric spark.

                                   XIV.
    Just as the existence in methyl-chloride, in formic aldehyd, and in
prussic acid of one marsh-gas residue, plus one hydrochloric acid
residue Cl', and one water residue O", and one ammonia residue N",
respectively, is inferable from the relationships and behaviour of the
respective bodies—so is the existence alike in ethane, ethylene, and
acetylene of two marsh-gas residues inferable from the relationships
and behaviour of these respective bodies. As shown more especially by
Kekulé, the individual marsh-gas residues of every hydrocarbon are
found to be susceptible of changes exactly similar to those of marsh
gas itself, and resulting in the formation of similarly characterized
bodies, as indicated below in the case of some ethane and ethylene
derivatives.

     In any hydrocarbon or chlorhydrocarbon, the substitution of half
saturated oxygen HO", for one proportion of hydrogen or chlorine, is
productive of a compound either similar or dissimilar in its properties
to common alcohol C.H.0 or CH, CH,(HO). Hence, from an exami
nation of the resulting product, and of its other modes of formation,
an inference is deducible as to its genesis having resulted from a change
effected in the marsh-gas residue CH, in the former case, and from a
change effected in one or other of the marsh-gas residues CH, and
CH in the latter case.
     In any hydrocarbon or chlorhydrocarbon, the substitution of one
