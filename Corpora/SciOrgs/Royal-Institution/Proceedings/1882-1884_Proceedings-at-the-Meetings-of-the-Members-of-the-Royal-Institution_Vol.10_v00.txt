In  the olden time comets were looked upon as the portents of all
kinds of woe. In the words of Du Bartas, as rendered by Sylvester* :—
           " There with   long bloudy haire, a Blazing Star
             Threatens the World with Famin, Plague and War :
             To Princes, death : to Kingdoms, many crosses :
             To all Estates, ineuitable Losses :
             To Heard-men, Rot : to Plough-men, hap-lesse Seasons           :
             To Saylers, Storms   : to Cities, ciuill Treasons."
     In the past year, including telescopic comets, no fewer than seven
of these blazing stars have threatened us, and certain contemporary
events might seem, indeed, to justify this view of their malign
influence.      But though comets are no longer a terror to us, they are
still, in some respects, a great mystery. When we attempt to explain
the marvellous phenomena they present, by the rigid application of
the laws of physics, we find ourselves confronted by prodigious diffi-
culties.     We are almost led to think that in the heavens, at least,
                                                                    "
there is more " than is dreamt of in our philosophy — some profound
and still unknown mystery of nature.                    Not to mention the many
absurd theories which are heard on all sides when a great comet
appears, on no phenomenon of nature have we so many guesses at
truth by the masters of science on different and even opposing prin-
ciples of explanation. At the present moment there is no consensus
of opinion as to the nature of comets.
     But within the last few years, from two opposite directions —
from the use of the spectroscope and from mathematical investigation
applied to the periodical displays of shooting stars — much knowledge
has been gained of their nature, though there are still many points
on which we can only speculate.
      It is my purpose this evening to give chief prominence to the new
 knowledge which these two methods of research have placed within
our reach, and to distinguish as clearly as may be possible between
what we know about comets and what is not more than speculation.
     To carry out this purpose we must first study carefully the phe-

nomena which have to be explained, namely, the essential appear-
ances and changes which comets present during their approach to the
sun, at the time that they are visible to us.
     It is not necessary hero to describe in detail the more purely
astronomical side of the subject.        It will be sufficient to say, in two
words, that some comets have become permanent members of our
system, while others probably visit us once only, never to return.             It
depends    upon  a comet's  velocity  whether    its course   shall be  a  hyper-
bola, a parabola, or an ellipse.     In the latter case only can it become a
permanently attached member of our system.              If  the velocity of the
comet when at the earth's distance from the sun exceeds 26 miles a
second, the comet must go off into space, never to come back to us.            If
the comet is moving less swiftly its path will return into itself, and
 it will visit us periodically after longer or shorter wanderings. In
the case of many comets, including the brightest comet of last year,
their velocity is so near the parabolic limit that it is scarcely possible,
from observations made in the small part of their orbit near the sun,
to be quite sure whether they will return to us or not.              A number
of comets, chiefly small ones, are certainly periodic, and of some
comets     several returns, true to the calculated time, have been
observed.
      The small portion of the comet's life during which we are able to
study it is quite unlike its ordinary humdrum existence.                  It con-
sists of the short period of extreme excitement into which it is thrown
by a more or less near approach to the sun — a state of things which is
accompanied by rapid and marvellous changes, often on a stupendous
scale.
      The appearances which comets put on under the sun's influence
 differ widely from each other.      A few of these forms, passing from an
 almost invisible nebulosity up to a brilliant comet of the grand type,
 are represented on these diagrams.         In nearly all these forms three
 essentially distinctive parts may be seen.
      1. The nucleus.   With the aid of a telescope, in the heads of most
 comets a minute bright point may be found.            This apparently insig-
 nificant speck is truly the heart and kernel of the whole thing — poten-
 tially it is the comet. It is this small part alone which conforms
 rigorously to the laws of gravitation, and moves strictly in its orbit.
 If  we could see a great comet during its distant wanderings when it
 has put off the gala trappings of perihelion, it would be a very sober
 object, and consist of little more than nucleus alone.          It is only this
 part of the comet which can have any claim to solidity, or even appre-
 ciable weight. Though many of the telescopic comets are of extremely
 small mass, nucleus included — so small, indeed, that they are unable
 to perturb such small bodies as Jupiter's satellites — yet in some large
 comets the nucleus may be a few hundred miles in diameter, and may
 consist of solid matter.   I need not say that the collision of a cometary
 nucleus of this order with the earth would be fraught with danger on
  a very wide scale.

   1882.]                           on Comets.                              3
        2. The coma. This appears usually as a luminous fog surrounding
   the nucleus, and gradually shading off from it.          The nucleus and
   the coma form together the head of the comet.
        3. The tail.    The tail may be considered as a continuation, in a
   direction opposite to that of the sun, of the luminous fog of the coma.
   This appendage may be scarcely distinguishable as a slight elongation
   of the coma, or it may extend half across the heavens, and be many
   millions of miles in length.      The tail may be single, or composed of
  several branches.
        We must now study more closely the cometary appearances as
  they may be seen when a large telescope is directed to a brilliant
  comet.     I  have selected for this purpose the Great Comet of 1858,
  and    I shall exhibit on the screen a series of views of this comet, taken
  at intervals of a few days.      The first set shows the growth, position,
  and forms of the tail, as a whole.      The second group represents the
  more detailed structure and changes of form of the head of the comet,
  as viewed in a large telescope.        These views are, of course, from
  sketches made at the telescope.        Last year several attempts were
  made to photograph the comet which appeared in June. Mr. Janssen
  has kindly sent me a positive taken from the original negative.          It
  is now upon the screen.        Mr. Janssen purposely sacrificed detail in
  the head of the comet, for the sake of obtaining the structure and
  form of the tail, exposing the plate for thirty minutes.            From a
  careful examination of several similar negatives, Janssen made a
  drawing of the comet. A photograph of this drawing is now upon
  the screen.      Mr. Common, at Ealing, with a fine three-foot reflector
  of his own construction, also photographed the comet, but his object,
  different from that of Janssen, was to get the form of the nucleus.
  For this purpose he gave an exposure of only ten minutes — far too
  short to obtain an impression of the tail.            The comet was also
 photographed by Dr. Draper, of New York.               My own work was
 confined to the comet's spectrum, of which       I shall speak presently.
       We may now advance to the consideration of two primary ques-
 tions   : —
       1. Does a comet shine wholly by reflected solar light, or has it
 also light of its own?
      2. Of what materials is a comet composed ?
      The spectroscope has furnished us with information on both these
 points. The first successful application of the spectroscope to a comet
 was in 1864, when Donati discovered in its light three bright bands.
             I
 In 1866 was able to distinguish two kinds of light from a telescopic
 comet — the one kind giving a continuous spectrum and presumably
 solar light, and the other a spectrum of three bright bands, similar
 to those which had been seen by Donati.        But in 1868 a great advance
was made.        The close agreement of measures     I took of the bands of
the comet b of that year with those         I  had previously taken of the
 spectrum of certain compounds of carbon led me to compare, directly,
in conjunction with my friend Dr. W. Allen Miller, the spectrum of
                                                                  b 2

4                                  Dr. Huggins                              [Jan. 20,
the induction    spark in olefiant gas with the comet's spectrum, in the
manner shown upon the screen.
     The next diagram shows the result of this direct comparison.*
There could be no longer any doubt of the oneness of chemical nature
of the cometary stuff with the gas we were using, in fact, that carbon,
in some form or in some state of combination, existed in the cometary
matter.     From that time some twenty comets have been examined by
different observers.      The general close agreement, notwithstanding
some small divergencies, of the positions of the three bands with those
seen in the flame spectrum of hydrocarbons, leaves no doubt whatever
that the original light of comets is really due to matter containing
carbon in combination with hydrogen.
     At first, indeed, for certain reasons,         I  was led to consider this
spectrum to be that of carbon itself in the form of gas, a view still
held by some physicists ; but subsequent                  researches     by several
experimentalists on this point appear to me to be strongly in favour
of carbon combined with hydrogen. f
     Last year another advance was made. For the first time since the
spectroscope has been in the hands of the astronomer the coming of a
bright comet made it possible to extend this mode of research into
the more refrangible region of the spectrum.                  Making use of the
apparatus and arrangements which           I   employed   for photographing the
                    I
spectra of stars, % succeeded in obtaining a photograph of the spectrum
of the head of comet      b.
     A  copy of this spectrum is now upon the screen (see plate). There
is a continuous spectrum which can be traced from about G to beyond
K, in which are seen distinctly several of the Fraunhofer lines, G, h,
H, K, and many others. The presence of these lines was crucial,
and made it certain that this continuous spectrum was really due to
reflected solar light.§
     But there was also present a second spectrum consisting chiefly of
two groups of bright lines.          These evidently were due to the same
light which is resolved, in the visible region, into the three bright
groups.
     I  regarded them with intense interest, for there was certainly
hidden within these hieroglyphics some new information for us.
Measures of their position in the spectrum, taken under the micro-
scope, brought out that these groups were undoubtedly the same
    * These hydrocarbon    groups may be seen with a pocket spectroscope in the
blue base of a candle flame or in the flame of a Bunsen burner.

1882.]                               on Comets.                               5
which appear in certain compounds of carbon.             Professors   Liveing
and Dewar had recently shown that these groups indicate a             nitrogen
compound of carbon, namely, cyanogen.           On this view there    must be
in the cometary matter, besides carbon and hydrogen, the              element
nitrogen.
     A few days after my photograph was taken, Dr. Draper succeeded
in obtaining a photograph of the comet's spectrum, which appears to
confirm mine so far as the bright lines, but does not give the
Fraunhofer lines.
     About the same time that the observations were made on the comet,
Professor Dewar succeeded in confirming his results, by the reversal
of the groups, employing either titanic cyanide or boron nitride.
     The positions and characters of these bands, together with those in
the visible spectrum, leave no doubt that the substances, carbon, hydro-
gen, and nitrogen, and probably oxygen, are present in the cometary
matter, and that this light-emitting stuff appears to be essentially
of the same chemical nature for all the comets, some twenty, which
have been observed up to the present time.            Certain minor modi-
fications of the common type of spectrum are often present, and
show, as was to be expected, that the conditions prevailing in different
comets, and indeed in any one comet from day to day, are not rigidly
uniform.
     The temperature, the state of tenuity, the more or less copious
supply from the nucleus of the gaseous matter, must be subject to con-
tinual variation.       At times it is probable that the hydrocarbon
spectrum is complicated by traces of the spectrum of the oxygen com-
pounds of carbon.         These and other possible variations betray them-
selves to us in the spectrum, by the length of range of refrangibility
through which each group can be traced, by an alteration in the posi-
tion of maximum brightness in the groups, by the relative brightness
of the groups, by a more or less breaking up of the shaded light of the
bands and the visibility or otherwise of bright lines, by a more or
less distinctness of the violet group, and, lastly, by the visibility
in the brightest comet of last year of a less refrangible band of
the hydrocarbon spectrum which occurs between C and D of the
spectrum.*
     We must now consider the information about the nature of comets
which has come to us from a wholly different source.
     On almost any fine night, after a short watch of the heavens, we
shall see the well-known appearances of " shooting stars." At
ordinary times, these are small, and appear indifferently in all parts
of the heavens, but on certain nights they show themselves in great
numbers, and of such brilliancy as to present a spectacle of much
magnificence.      On such occasions one remarkable feature presents
    * For these reasons measures of these bands should be considered as strictly
applicable to the particular comet at the time of observation only, and not
necessarily as applicable  to other comets.

6                               Dr. Huggins                      [Jan. 20,
itself, which is well marked in the diagram on the screen.            The
meteors    all shoot forth from one spot, which is called the radiant
point.    A little consideration will show that this appearance is
really due to perspective, and represents the vanishing point of the
parallel courses in which the meteors are moving. Hence we learn
that they all belong to an enormous swarm of these bodies which the
earth is meeting, and further, we may find the direction in which
the swarm is moving relatively to the earth.           Now the researches
 of Olbers, H. A. Newton, and Adams showed that the November
 shower is really a planetary swarm, revolving round the sun in
 about 33J years.      Further investigations of Schiaparelli, Leverrier,
 and Oppolzer brought out the astonishing result that the path of
 the November meteors is really identical with that of a comet
 discovered by Tempel in 1865.         Schiaparelli showed further, that
 another independent group of meteors which appears in August, has
 an orbit identical with the third comet of 1862.        We are thus led
 to see the close physical connection, and oneness of origin, if not
 indeed identity of nature, of comets and of these meteors.       Now the
 meteors on these occasions are too minute to pass through the ordeal
 of ignition by our atmosphere, they are burnt up before they reach the
 earth, but at other times small celestial masses come down to us, which,
 there can be little doubt, are of the same order of bodies, and similar
 in chemical nature. The meteorites we have in our hands, contain
 matter of the same kind probably as that which gives rise to cometary
 phenomena.       These two small meteorites, which fell at Estherville,
 were kindly sent to me by Professor Newton, as probably good
 examples of the sort of stuff of which the nuclei of comets are composed.
  The question arises, are the revelations of the spectroscope about
  comets in harmony with what we know of the chemical nature of
  these celestial waifs and strays ?
       Meteorites may be arranged in a long series, passing from metallic
  iron alloyed with nickel at one extremity, to those of a stony nature,
  chiefly silicates, at the other.    In meteorites more than twenty of
  the elementary bodies have been found, including hydrogen, carbon,
  and nitrogen, which the spectroscope has shown to be in comets.        It
  may be, however, that in the sun's action on comets, we have to do
  not with the decomposition of the cometary matter, but with the
  setting free of gases occluded within the meteoric matter, forming the
   comet's nucleus.   If the meteoric matter were decomposed, we should
  expect a more complicated spectrum.
       In the year 1867 Professor Odling, lecturing on Professor
   Graham's researches, lighted up this room with the gas brought by a
  meteorite from celestial space.      This meteorite, of the iron type,
   yielded nearly three times its volume of gas, of which 85 per cent,
   was hydrogen, 5 per cent, was carbonic oxide, and 10 per cent,
   nitrogen.   Since that time Professor A. W. Wright has experimented
   with a meteorite of the stony type, containing, however, numerous
   very small grains of metallic iron and sulphide of iron scattered

through the mass. This meteorite gave off about two and a half
times the volume of the meteorite as a whole, or twenty times that
of the iron scattered within it. The same gases came off, but in a
different proportion ; there being a larger proportion of the oxide of
carbon, at a low temperature carbon dioxide was chiefly given off.*
Now in all these cases, a spectrum similar to that of comets would
be given by these gases under suitable conditions.
     Some years ago, in conjunction with my friend Professor Maskelyne,
I  examined the spectra of certain meteorites, and obtained in several
cases a spectrum similar to that of comets.            Some meteorites like that
of Bokkveldt, contain a large percentage of hydrocarbons.                 Professor
Vogel has recently experimented in the same direction, and finds that
the gas which comes off from the meteorite he used gives a hydro-
carbon spectrum mixed with that of carbonic oxide, and under certain
conditions the spectrum of hydrocarbon predominates and becomes
almost exactly similar to that of comet b 1881.f                  We are at a dis-
advantage in one particular, for we cannot get at meteorites as they
exist in celestial space, but only after superficial ignition in passing
through the air.
     The experiments hitherto made throw but little light on the
question, whether cyanogen ready formed is present in combination
or otherwise in the comet, or whether it is formed at the time by the
interaction of carbonaceous and nitrogenous matter. In the latter
case we should have to admit a high temperature, which would be
in favour of the view of an electric origin of the comet's light.
Professor A. Herschel and Dr. Von Konkoly have pointed out that the
spectra of the periodic meteors are different for different groups.                I
may also mention that Captain Abney considers that he has evidence
of hydrocarbons in the outer portion of the sun's atmosphere.

     We have now advanced to the extreme boundary of the solid ground
of our knowledge of comets.             Before us lies the enchanted region of
speculation.        Without    being   too  venturesome, we may well consider
a few points which may explain more in detail some of the phenomena
of comets. Of whatever nature we may regard the tremendous changes
which take place in them to be, we must certainly look for the primary
disturbing cause to the sun.            Is the solar heat sufficient to account
directly    for  the  self-light   of   comets,   or does it act the part of a
trigger, setting free      chemical    or  electrical  forces ? On this point of
the sufficiency of the solar radiation we must not look to the few cases
of exceptionally close approach to the sun, but to the more average
distance of comets at perihelion.              Professor Stokes has suggested
that some results obtained by Mr. Crookes may throw light upon this
question.       He concluded from his experiments that in such vacua as
exist in planetary space the loss of heat, which in such cases would
take place only by radiation, would be exceedingly small.*                In this
way    the  heat   received    from   the   sun   by  the   comet would  accumu-
late, and we should get a much higher temperature than would other-
wise be possible. In this connection may be mentioned the remark-
able persistence of the bright trains of meteors in the cold upper air,
which sometimes remain visible for three-quarters of an hour before
the light fades out by the gradual dissipation of the energy.
     I  need hardly say that the enormous tails of bright comets, many
millions of miles in length, cannot be considered as one and the same
material object, brandished round like a great flaming sword, as the
comet moves about the sun. It is but little less difficult to suppose that
the cometary mass is of so large an extent as to include all the space
successively occupied by the sweep of the tail at perihelion.             On the
material theory we seem to be shut up to the view that the tail is con-
stantly renewed and reformed, either by matter streaming from the
nucleus or in some other way. But this view involves velocities far
greater than the force of gravitation can account for. Let us consider
the order of the phenomena.           Under the sun's influence, luminous jets
issue from the matter of the nucleus on the side exposed to the sun's
heat.     These are almost immediately arrested in their motion sun-
wards, and form a luminous cap ; the matter of this cap then appears
to stream out into the tail, as if by a violent wind setting against it.
Now, one hypothesis supposes these appearances to correspond to the
real state of things in the comet, and that there exists a repulsive
force of some kind acting between the sun and the gaseous matter,
after it has been emitted by the nucleus. On this hypothesis the
forms of the tails of comets, which are usually curved, and denser on
the convex side, admit of explanation.            Each particle of matter of the
tail must be moving in a curved course, under the influence of the
motion it originally possessed, combined with that of this hypothetical
repulsive force.       But in the form which the tail assumes for us we

have not only to consider the effect of perspective, but also that the
comet itself is advancing, so that the visible tail is due to the portion
of space which at the time contains all the repelled matter, each
particle describing its own independent orbit, and reflecting to the
eye the solar light or giving out its own light, as the case may be.*
The value of the repulsive force which would be necessary on this
theory has been investigated by Bessel, Peirce, and others, f Eecently
Bredichin J has investigated the curvatures of the tails of a number
of comets. According to him, they fall into three classes, which are
represented in this diagram, each type of curve depending upon a
different assumed value of the repulsive force.             This leads to another
point, namely, the secondary tails which are often present.                  Some
of these appear to be darted off with an energy of repulsion so enor-
    * As a rule, the tails of comets appear to be luminous by reflected solar light,
but at times the stuff which emits the light giving a spectrum of bright bands
is carried into the tail to a greater or less distance from the head.

 10                                 Dr. Iluggin,                          [Jan. 20,
 mously great that the original motion of the nucleus tells for very
 little, and hence the secondary tail is but slightly curved, or even
is sensibly straight. Again, if we take the hypothesis that this
 repulsive force, of whatever character it may be, varies as the surface,
 and not, like gravity, as the mass, substances of different specific
 gravity would be differently affected and separated from each other,
 and these secondary straight, or nearly straight tails would, on this
 view, consist of the lightest matter.
       On this hypothesis a comet would suffer of course a large waste
  of material at each return to perihelion, as the nucleus would be
  unable to gather up again to itself the scattered matter of the tail ;
  and this view is in accordance with the fact that no comet of short
  period has a tail of any considerable magnitude.
       A theory, based on chemical decomposition, has been proposed by
  Professor Tyndall,* but as this view has been illustrated here
  by the eloquent author himself,       I will not now enter upon it.
       A different view of the whole matter has been suggested by
  Professor Tait.f He supposes, not the nucleus only, but the whole
  comet, to consist of a swarm, of enormous dimensions, of minute
  meteoroids, which become self-luminous at and about the nucleus, in
  consequence of the impacts of the various meteoric masses against
  each other, giving rise to incandescence, melting, the development of
  glowing gas, and the crushing and breaking up of the bodies into frag-
  ments of different sizes, and endowed               with a great variety of
  velocities.    The tail he conceives to be a portion of the less dense
  part of the train illuminated by sunlight, and visible or invisible to
  us, according not only to circumstances of density, illumination, and
  nearness, but also of tacfcic arrangement, as of a flock of birds
  under different conditions of perspective, or the edge of a cloud of
1
  tobacco smoke.
       On this hypothesis we should expect to find a more complicated
   spectrum, and the spectra of comets to differ greatly from each other.
       There seems to be a rapidly-growing feeling among physicists that
   both the self-light of comets and the phenomena of their tails belong
   to the order of electrical phenomena.        One of the most distinguished of
   the American astronomers wrote to me recently : "As to the American
   views of the self-light of comets         I cannot speak with authority for
   any one but myself, still      I think the prevailing impression amongst
   us is that the light is due to an electric, or, if        I may coin the word
   electric-oid action of some kind."           Here    I  confess   I  tread most
   cautiously, for we have no longer any stepping-stones of fact on
   which to place our feet.       I  am ready to admit that the spectroscopic
   evidence, especially that furnished by the photographs of last year,
   favours, though it does not necessarily demand, the view that the
   self-light of comets is due to electric discharges.            I  do not attach

much       importance to the fact that the bright groups in the visible
spectrum          of comet b agreed with those of the so-called " flame
spectrum," for the reason that the same spectrum may be obtained
from the induction spark, when suitable arrangements are used to
make the discharge one of comparatively low temperature.*
       As we are now fairly on the wide ocean of speculation,          I need not
say that the precise modes of application of the principle of elec-
tricity which have been suggested are many. Broadly, they group
themselves about the common idea that great electrical disturbances
are set up by the sun's action in connection with the vaporization
of some of the matter of the nucleus, and that the tail is matter carried
away, possibly in connection with electric discharges, in consequence
of the repulsive influence of the sun, which is supposed to be in a state
of constant high electrical potential of the same name. Further, it
is supposed that the luminous jets and streams and caps and envelopes
belong to the same order of phenomena as the aurora, the electrical
brush, and the stratified discharges of exhausted tubes.                    Views
resting more or less on this basis have been suggested by several
physicists, and, in particular, have been elaborated at great length
by Zollner, who endeavours to show that on certain assumed data,
which appear to him to be highly probable, the known laws of
electricity are fully adequate to the explanation of the phenomena
of comets.f
       All   the theories we have considered assume that the bright lines
seen      in   the spectra of comets indicate heated luminous gas.             An
alternative hypothesis has been suggested by Professor Wright^ and
especially by Mr. Johnstone Stoney,§ who considers that the compound
of carbon vapour is opaque in reference to the particular rays which
appear as bright lines, and they appear as bright lines in consequence
of sending back to us the sun's rays falling upon the vapour.
Further, he considers the phenomenon to be of the order of phos-
phorescent bodies, and he states that the conditions existing in the
cometary gas are such as will eminently promote phosphorescence, and
therefore visibility, in presence of a luminary. ||
       Here     I  must stop.        I
                                May venture to hope that the experience of
the past hour has not been such as to confirm in your minds the old
view to which          I referred at the beginning of the lecture, that the
influence of comets is always a malign and woeful one.                   [ W. H.]

     || Respighi (' Comptes Rendus,' 5 Sept. 1882) has sought indeed to explain the
occurrence of bright bands by supposing them to be simply the remaining portions
of the continuous spectrum of reflected sunlight after absorption through the
enormous depth of the comet's atmosphere.        This view appears to me for many
reasons improbable, especially if we take into account the extreme relative
brilliancy of the most refrangible group in the photographic spectrum of comets.

The speaker stated that his object was to show the connection between
the ancient Egyptian and Alexandrian educational institutions, and
expressed his gratitude for the invaluable aid of the eminent French
Egyptologist, M. Revillout.
     The sources of information are chiefly old hieratic papyri, some of
which are actually exercise-books of students, and they tell us of
colleges attached to temples in various towns. When Plato and others
visited Egypt, Heliopolis was most famous.           The subjects taught
were religion,   law, mathematics, especially geometry and astronomy,
medicine and language. There were also primary schools for all
classes.    Libraries were attached to the temples, and there was a
royal library existing at least as early as B.C. 2500.
     The Alexandrian foundations were due to the wisdom with which
the first three Ptolemies carried out the large-minded policy of Alex-
ander the Great. They were meant to benefit the mixed population
of Alexandria — Egyptian, Greek, and Hebrew.
     The Museum was a sacred building in the palace, where learned
men were maintained by the State to prosecute research.           Law and
religion were excluded in order to avoid controversy. A botanical
garden and a menagerie were added.
     Besides the similarity of scheme, and the evident succession of
Alexandria to Heliopolis, a strong point of contact was the old method,
as seen in the mathematical processes of the second Heron.
     To the first library, originally Greek only, translations were added,
and the temple of Sarapis received surplus books.         The first librai;
was burnt when Julius Caesar captured Alexandria.             The second
enriched by Antony with the Pergamus collection, is said to ha\t
been burnt at the Arab conquest, when it disappeared.
     The effect of the Alexandrian foundations was very great. Th
intelligence of the East and West here met, and it is due to this that
the Old Testament was translated into Greek.
     The Alexandrian University was restored by an Arab Prince, the
caliph El-Mutawekkil, two centuries after the conquest; and the

1882.]        on the Museum and Libraries        of Alexandria.         13
great University of Cairo was founded by a Greek officer of the
Fatimite caliph in a.d. 969-70.
    The University of Cairo practically includes all the Alexandrian
faculties except medicine, which is considered by the Arabs to be un-
suited to public education.    Lately, of 5000 students 2500 were there
educated and maintained free of all cost to themselves.           The pro-
fessors, who now receive moderate rations from the State, make a
modest income by outside teaching and copying MSS.

      The following Resolution         passed by the Committee of Managers
 at a Special Meeting held           on December 16, 1881, was read and
adopted by the Members : —
     1.    The Board of Managers of the Eoyal Institution received with great
            regret Mr. Warren De La Rue's letter of December 3, 1881,
            addressed to Professor Tyndall, announcing that the state of his
            health compelled him to resign the office of Honorary Secretary to
             the Eoyal Institution.
     2.    The    Managers fully appreciated the considerate offer made by
             Mr. De La Rue to continue in the post of Honorary Secretary for
            some time longer, if such a course were deemed desirable for the
            advantage of the Institution ; but they believed it to be their duty
            to secure for Mr. De La Rue the immediate release from the cares of
            office which seemed indispensable.
     3.   The Managers trust that Mr. De La Rue may be enabled, after due
            rest and medical treatment, to resume those scientific pursuits in
            which so much of his life has been spent, and to the prosecution of
            which by others so much generous assistance has always been
            extended by him.
     4.   The Managers cannot bid farewell to Mr. De La Rue, as Honorary
            Secretary to the Royal Institution, without tendering to him their
            warmest thanks for the ability, zeal, and liberality with which he
            has aided the Royal Institution while filling that important office.
     5.   The devotion of Mr. De La Rue's time and attention to the interests
            of the Institution will always be remembered with gratitude in
            connection with the services of other distinguished men, many of
            whose names, like his own, belong to the history of science — a
            history to which the work done in the Royal Institution has made
            such signal contributions.
     William Bowman, Esq.             LL.D. F.R.S.     was   elected   Honorary
Secretary, and Warren De            La Rue, Esq. M.A. D.C.L. F.R.S.           was
elected Manager.

                            Climate in Town and Country.
The speaker began by describing the construction and uses of the
instruments with which he had studied the conditions of climate, for
many years past, in various parts of Europe.                For the determination
of sun temperature, he used a thermometer technically known as the
blackened bulb in vacuo laid in full sunshine upon a sheet of white
paper.     The shade or air temperature was measured by an ordinary
thermometer with a clear glass bulb and a scale engraved upon the
stem.     This thermometer was placed upon the same sheet of paper,
and was shaded by a small white paper arch which admitted of a free
circulation of air around the bulb.
     He then explained the terms " sun temperature," " shade tempera-
ture," and " solar intensity."           By shade temperature is meant the
temperature      of free air in full sunshine. Strictly it ought to be
ascertained without any shade at all ; for as soon as a shade is
produced, conditions are introduced which often entirely baffle the
object of the observer.          The shade of a parasol has a different tem-
perature    from    the  shade of a tree, and this, again, differs widely from
that of a house.        The temperature of the shade of a sheet of tinfoil
is quite different from that of a sheet of writing paper.                 Indeed it
may be truly said that every shade has its own peculiar temperature.
The following table shows the effect of the area of shade, and of
the quality of the shading material : —
                                                                      o
             Beneath    larch tree                                  19*5 C.

                 „      small white paper arch                      35*0
                „       small arch of bright tinfoil                45*2
     Thus shade temperatures, measured during 1£ hours of unin-
terrupted sunshine in the middle of the day, and within a few yards
of the same spot, differed by no less than 25 ¦7° C. These observa-
 tions were, however, made at Pontresina, 5915 feet above sea-level,
and so wide a range does not occur at lower altitudes.
     The most effective shading material is, obviously, that which most
 perfectly reflects solar heat ; and of all materials with which he had
 experimented white paper was found to be the best, white linen and

18                          Dr. E. Franhland                           [Feb. 10,
zinc-whito being nearly equal to it. The most trustworthy shade
thermometer, therefore, is one having its bulb covered with a thin
layer of one of these materials ; or the naked bulb may be shaded by
a small arch of white paper.
     The term " sun temperature," as commonly employed, has a very
vague meaning.      If a body could be placed in sunlight under such
circumstances as to absorb heat rays and emit none, its temperature
would soon rise lo that of the sun itself.      But, as all good absorbers of
heat are also good radiators, the elevation of temperature caused by the
exposure of even good absorbers to sunlight is comparatively small.
Thus an isolated thermometer, with blackened glass bulb, placed in
sunshine, will rarely rise more than 10° C. above the temperature
which it marks when screened from direct sunlight.                 Under these
circumstances, however, the thermometer loses heat not merely by
radiation, but also by actual contact with the surrounding cold air.          If
the latter source of loss be obviated, a much higher sun temperature is
obtained. Thus, the blackened bulb enclosed in a vacuous clear glass
globe will sometimes, when placed in sunlight, rise as much as 60° C.
above the shade temperature, and a still higher degree of heat may be
obtained by exposing to the sun's rays the naked blackened bulb of
a thermometer enclosed in a wooden box padded with black cloth,
and closed by a lid of clear plate glass.       Thus he obtained with such
a box, on the 22nd of December, in Switzerland, when the air was
considerably below the freezing point, a temperature of 105° C, and
a still higher temperature could doubtless be obtained by surrounding
the thermometer with a vacuous globe before enclosing it in the
padded box.     These widely different temperatures, produced under
different conditions by the solar rays, show that such observations
can be comparative only when the thermometer employed to measure
them is always surrounded by the same conditions.                  All the sun
temperatures   here  mentioned    were    measured     when    the  "blackened
                "
bulb in vacuo was laid horizontally upon a sheet of white paper
with its stem at right angles to the direction of the sun's rays.
     " Solar intensity " is relative only, and means the number of
degrees through which the sun raises the temperature of a blackened
bulb in vacuo over the shade temperature. Hence the two tempera-
tures must be observed simultaneously, which is a laborious operation
when continued half-hourly throughout the day.                By the use of a
peculiar self-registering differential thermometer, however, which he
had recently described to the Koyal Society,* the maximum solar
intensity during the day is recorded by one reading only. The solar
intensities commented upon in this discourse were ascertained by
subtracting, in each case, the shade temperature from the sun tem-
perature taken synchronously.          The precautions necessary are
described in the paper to the Koyal Society just quoted.
    The chief things affecting climate are the following :—(1) The
              * 'Proceedings of the Royal

sun. (2)    Laud aud water — ocean and atmospheric currents. (3) Aspect
— slope of ground,         exposure or shelter.          (4) Nature of surface.
(5)   Reflection  from   land   and  water.    (6)  Eain   and clouds — suspended
matter in the air. (7) Latitude — incidence of solar rays, thickness of
air. (8) Presence or absence of aqueous vapour. Of these, the first
three are obvious and require no comment.                The remainder are less
well known, but their importance demands our special attention.
     Climate, or rather genial climate, is ultimately resolvable into two
prime factors — sun-warmth and air-warmth.                     The amount of sun-
warmth (assuming the sun's heat to be constant) depends upon two
things only — length of day, and quantity of suspended matter and
aqueous vapour in the air.             The warmth of the air depends upon
contact with matter heated by the sun's rays and upon the stoppage
of radiation from the earth by aqueous vapour. This heated matter
is : — (1) Sea or land. (2) Suspended matter in the air — cloud, dust,
smoke.      (3) Aqueous vapour.
     These two factors were first considered in their relation to
                                 Country Climate.
     The feeling of warmth and comfort in the open air is produced
either by direct solar radiation, even if the air be very cold ; or by
the warmth of the air itself.            Upon both of these, the nature of the
surface upon which the sunlight falls has a paramount influence, as is
seen from the results of experiments on sun temperature recorded in
the following table : —

     The warmth of the air over these surfaces was in the inverse
order, caoutchouc heating the air most, white paper and snow least.
The nearer the colour of the ground approaches to white, the more
genial will be the climate from radiation and the cooler will be the
air. The nearer it gets to black, the warmer will be the air and the
less will temperature be due to radiation.                 Dark surfaces warm the
air ; light surfaces keep it cool, but warm the body by radiant reflec-
tion. The difference is substantially the same out of doors as that
produced indoors by a close stove on the one hand, and an open fire
on the other ; but calm air is required for the enjoyment of radiant
heat.
     The sun's radiant         heat     may be greatly reinforced by reflection
from surrounding objects.           There are two kinds of reflectors ; those
which, like white paper, white linen, and whitewash, scatter the solar
heat in all directions, and those which, mirror-like, reflect it in one
direction only.         To the former belong snow, chalk, light-coloured
sand,   and   light  -coloured  earth ; to the latter, water.        The former are
useful on whatever side they may be, the latter only when they are
between the observer and the sun.                     The observations in the fol-
lowing table illustrate this effect of reflection from surrounding
objects  : —

     M. Dufour has observed              the same phenomenon on the            lake of
Geneva between Lausanne and Vevay.                     He has measured the     propor-
tions of direct and reflected heat at five different stations                   on the
northern shore of the lake, and the results are condensed                       in the
following table : —

      When the sun was higher than 30° the reflected heat was hardly-
 perceptible.       Hence this reflection is of the greatest value in winter,
 when it is most wanted, and it also tends to equalise temperature
 during the day ; for in the early morning and evening, when the sun
 is low, and his direct heat is small, the reflected heat is greatest.
      The bearing of these observations upon winter refuges for invalids
 is obvious.       While the primary conditions to be secured must ever
 be fine weather and a sheltered position, the next in importance is,
 doubtless, exposure all day long to reflected, as well as direct, solar
 radiation.     To realise this, a southern aspect and a considerable
 expanse   of  water      or snow are necessary, and it is important that the
 sanitarium should be considerably and somewhat abruptly elevated
 above the reflecting surface, so that it may receive, throughout the
 entire day, the uninterrupted reflection of the sun's rays. At or near
the sea-level, however, it is impossible, owing to solid and liquid
matters floating in the lower regions of the atmosphere, to enjoy any-
thing approaching to a uniform temperature from sunrise to sunset.
     Although this suspended matter exists even at great altitudes, the
bulk of it floats below 5000 feet, and whilst only one-sixth of the atmo-
sphere is below this height, there is probably much more than one-
half of the suspended matter at a lower elevation. As might be
expected, therefore, solar intensity is much greater at high than at
low elevations, although the temperature                   of the air continually
decreases as it is further removed from the earth's surface.                              The

      The sun's altitude was unfavourable for the comparison ;
  nevertheless,     there were here observed differences                 of 8*6 C. and
  10-6°.
      The farther we recede from the earth, the nearer we realise the
 conditions of solar radiation altogether outside the limits of the
 atmosphere, where the solar intensity (assuming the sun's emission
 to remain constant) is uniform from sunrise to sunset.                      Throughout
 the dreary winter days, when, even in the country, a leaden sky
 oppresses us, it is tantalising to reflect that, at the moderate height
 of 5000 feet, which can be reached by a balloon in a few minutes,
 there is probably blue sky and brilliant sunshine.
      Latitude profoundly, though irregularly, affects air temperature,
 for in high latitudes less solar heat falls upon each square foot of
 the earth's surface, and therefore the air resting upon that surface is
 warmed to a less extent.              But obliquity of the sun's rays has no such
 influence on solar intensity, for the highest readings of solar heat
 at or near sea-level have been observed near to the Arctic circle, as
 is seen from the following table : —

     These results show that, with an obliquity of only 6°, the sun
temperature and solar intensity were respectively only 78 '9° and
41-7° C; whilst, with an obliquity of 41°, they were 82*5° and
48 • 7° C.     On the equator at noon, with a nearly vertical sun, the solar
intensity was actually 7° C. lower than in Bomsdal, only 4° S. of the
Arctic circle. On the other hand, air-warmth diminishes, as a rule, with
increase of latitude, although, as the following table shows there are
some remarkable exceptions, for it was 1° higher in lat. 52° N. with
an obliquity of 29°, than in lat. 5° N. with an obliquity of only 12°,
and in the high latitude 63°, with an obliquity of 41°, it was only
1° C. in arrear of the air- warmth at the equator with an obliquity of
only 6°.

                                         Town Climate.
      The climate of towns depends upon the same essential conditions
as  that of the country, but some of these are more within our own
control in towns.
      The great evils of our town climate are excessive heat in summer

and cheerless gloom in winter.          We suffer less, however, from exces-
sive solar intensity than continental cities between the same parallels
of latitude, owing to the very causes which plunge us into a more
miserable gloom in winter.          Light-coloured walls neither make our
streets look cheerful     nor feel  hot. Such sad colours as brick, stone,
stucco, or paint give to our houses are soon changed to a grimy
neutral tint, powerless to reflect either solar light or heat.
     The darker the colour of the houses, the cooler the streets and
the hotter the rooms during sunshine, and vice versa.             Whilst the
summer climate      in our  streets   and  houses  is thus, to a considerable
extent controllable, that of winter, which depends so much on a clean
atmosphere, is still more so.          All our towns are nearly at the sea-
level, a position favourable for air-, but not for sun-warmth. In our
large towns, however, we artificially create an impenetrable barrier
to solar radiation by throwing into the air the imperfectly burnt
products of bituminous coal.
     These products are of three kinds — soot, tar and steam.          Every
ton of bituminous coal burnt in our grates gives off about 6 cwts.
of volatile but condensable products. The less perfect the combus-
tion the more tar and the less steam will be produced.           If perfectly
burnt without any smoke, then about 9 cwts. of steam, occupying
 27,359 cubic feet at 100° C, or 20,024 cubic feet at 0° C. will be sent
into the air.      Now 33,333 tons of bituminous coal are, on the
average, daily    consumed     in London in winter, giving 667,460,000
cubic feet  of  steam   at 0° C.
     This combustion of enormous quantities of bituminous coal acts
in the production of town fog in three ways: — 1st. By supplying
the basis of all fog — condensed watery particles. 2nd. By determining
the condensation of atmospheric moisture in the form of fog.
3rd. By coating the fog particles with tar, and thus making them
more persistent.
     All fogs have for their basis watery particles, and the greater
part even of the suspended matters visible in a ray of electric
light consists of these particles, for the air becomes nearly clear
when it is heated somewhat above 100° C.                [Experiment shown].
Everything therefore which increases the proportion of aqueous
vapour in town air tends to produce fog.          But aqueous vapour alone
would probably never produce fog, for it condenses at once to large
particles, which rapidly fall as rain. When, however, solid or liquid
 particles are present in the air, the minute spherules of fog are
 produced.    This was first shown by Messrs. Coulier and Mascart, in
 1875, and their results have since been confirmed by Mr. Aitkin.
 The speaker showed that air filtered through cotton wool, though
 afterwards saturated with moisture, produced no fog when its
 temperature    was lowered ; but as soon as a small quantity of the
 dusty air of the theatre was admitted fog was immediately formed,
 whilst, when a little coal smoke was introduced, a dense and moro
 persistent fog was the result.

20                                   Dr. E. FranMand                          [Feb. 10,
     The fog once formed is rendered more persistent by the coating
of tarry matter which it receives from the products of the imperfect
combustion of smoky coal.                    The speaker had made numerous
experiments on the             retardation    of evaporation by films of coal tar.
He had found that the evaporation of water in a platinum dish
placed in a strong draught of air was retarded in one experiment by
84 per cent, and in another by 78 6 per cent., when a thin film of
                                                  *
coal tar was placed on the surfaces.' Even by the mere blowing of
coal smoke on the surface of the water for a few seconds, the
evaporation was retarded by from 77*3 to 81*5 per cent.                       Drops of
water suspended in loops of platinum wire were also found to have
their evaporation retarded by coal smoke.                 Hence arise the so-called
dry fogs which have been observed by Mr. Glaisher in balloon ascents,
some examples of which are given in the following table : —

     Thus the smoke of our domestic fires constitutes a potent cause
both for the generation and the persistency of town fogs.                   In London,
at all events, if all manufacturing operations were absolutely to
cease, the fogs would not be perceptibly less dense or irritating.
Granting then this cause of town fogs, what are the remedies open
to us ?    The speaker was of opinion that the substitution of a suffi-
cient number of smoke-consuming grates (assuming a smoke-con-
suming grate to have been invented), for the 1,800,000 fire-places of
London was quite hopeless, and that one remedy only could be
 of any appreciable service — the importation of bituminous coal must be
forbidden.        This is a case in which individual effort can do nothing ;
 but State    or   municipal action would be simple and decisive.
      There need be no fear that the price of smokeless fuel would rise
inordinately, for the sources of this fuel are too numerous and inex-
 haustible to admit of either a monopoly or a serious rise in price. In
 addition to the enormous stores of smokeless coal in the Welsh coal-
 fields, every bituminous coal yields a smokeless coke, either in the
 retorts of gasworks or in coke ovens.                On the average, 100 tons of
 smoky coal yield 60 tons of coke, the remaining 40 tons being
 driven off as combustible* gas, ammoniacal liquor and tar; and as
 there is an almost unlimited demand for these products, it is not

  1882.]                on Climate  in Toivn and Country.                    27
 unlikely that tbey would, under the circumstances contemplated, repay
 the cost of coking, and it is worthy of note that coal of very inferior
 quality makes fairly good coke.
      The only objection to the domestic use of smokeless coal and coke
 is the difficulty of lighting the fire, but this is obviated by the use of
 gas as proposed by Dr. Siemens.         In ordinary grates, however, there
 is little difficulty in lighting and burning these smokeless fuels if the
 throat of the chimney be contracted so as to increase the draught. In
 this way nearly every grate in London could be rendered smokeless at
 an expenditure of a couple of shillings.
      It is unnecessary to enumerate the many advantages of a smoke-
 less atmosphere, but it may here be mentioned that London fogs not
 only seriously injure health but annually destroy the lives of thou-
 sands.     In one week alone upwards of 1100 lives have been thus
 sacrificed in London.        We have doubtless still long to wait before
 the only remedy for London fogs will be adopted ; but in the mean-
 time, immunity from their effects, so far as the respiratory organs are
 concerned, may be obtained by the use of a small and very portable
cotton-wool respirator which is made, in accordance with the speaker's
directions, by Mr. Casella, of Holborn.               [Kespirator exhibited.]
 Armed with this little instrument, he had often passed through the
densest and most irritating fogs with perfect immunity, breathing, in
fact, all the time, air even purer than that of the country.             Such a
remedy     is, however,   obviously  of extremely   limited application.
     In conclusion he said, though we may, with justice, complain of
the scanty share of sunshine now received by us, let us not forget that,
in our coal-fields, we are compensated by vast stores of the sunlight
of past ages.        How far, through electricity, these stores can be
evoked to supplement the present defective supply, he would be a
 bold man who would venture to predict. Let us not, however, con-
tinue to use this great legacy of light of the past to obscure the small
one of the present.

                   WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                           Friday, March 3, 1882.
    William Bowman, Esq. LL.D. F.E.S. Honorary Secretary            and
                        Vice-President,  in the Chair.
                    Alfred Ttlor,     Esq. F.G.S. M.B.I.
                Roman Antiquities recently found in London.
The speaker began by referring to some Roman remains discovered
near Warwick Square, E.C. London, last year, about nineteen feet below
the present surface ; and with remarks on a series of diagrams illus-
trating the history of Eoman London, and its site, boundaries, walls,
 and streets, and the principal roads issuing from it to other parts of
 the island.
      Many specimens of the relics discovered and large drawings of
 others were exhibited. They will go to the British Museum, on loan.
      The collection includes several cinerary urns, containing tha
results of the cremation of human bodies.         One urn, fifteen inches
high, was of glass.       A remarkable turned vase of stone was found.
 Four of the urns were inclosed in leaden ossuarise, made without
 solder ; some of the remainder were protected by roofing tiles.
      On the inside of one ossuarium was an emblem of Mithra, the
 Persian sun-god. The lecturer explained its difference from the
 emblem chosen by the Emperor Constantine.             It diners from the
 early Christian labarum in being an eight-rayed cross without the R.
      In reference to the ossuariae, Mr. Tylor said that the arts of smelt-
 ing and working lead were practised and probably invented in this
 country in very ancient times ; and that at Avignon and Lyons he saw
 Roman lead-work, bearing the inscription " Cantius," i. e. " a Kentish-
 man."      Another British word, Cunobarrus, was found on lead-work
 at Caistor near Peterboro'.       This specimen is now in the British
 Museum.
       The coins found during Mr. Tylor's excavations were dated from
 a.d. 46 to 300.    The date of the Mithraic emblem was considered to
 be soon after a.d. 50, much earlier than that on the Portland Vase.
       Suggestive remarks were made on the probably advanced stage of
  civilisation in Britain at the time of the Roman invasion indicated by
  the statements of contemporary historians and other sources.
       In conclusion, Mr. Tylor stated that the greatest care had been
  taken to lay down the exact position of each article found, on a plan,
                                              '            '

1882.]      Mr. Swan   on   Electric Lighting  by Incandescence.          33
                 WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                         Friday, March 10, 1882.
   Sir Frederick Bramwell, F.K.S. Vice-President,          in the Chair.
                         Joseph W. Swan, Esq.
                   Electric Lighting   by Incandescence.
Speaking in this place on electric light,    I can neither forget, nor for-
bear to mention, as inseparably associated with the subject and with
the Eoyal Institution, the familiar, illustrious, names of Davy and
Faraday. It was in connection with this Institution that, eighty years
ago, the first electric light experiments were made by Davy, and it
was also in connection with this Institution that, forty years later, the
foundations of the methods, by means of which electric lighting has
been made useful, were strongly laid by Faraday.
    I do not propose to describe at any length the method of Davy.         I
must, however, describe it slightly, if only to make clear the differ-
ence between it and the newer method which        I wish more particularly
to bring under your notice.
    The method of Davy consists, as almost all of you know, in pro-
ducing electrically a stream of white-hot gas between two pieces of
carbon.
    When electric light is produced in this manner, the conditions,
which surround the process are such as render it impossible to obtain
a small light with proportionally small expenditure of power.            In
order to sustain the arc in a state approaching stability, a high
electro-motive force and a strong current are necessary ; in fact, such
electro-motive force and such current as correspond to the production
of a luminous centre of at least several hundred candle-power. When
an attempt is made to produce a smaller centre of light by the em-
ployment of a proportionally small amount of electrical energy, the
mechanical difficulties of maintaining a stable arc, and the diminution
in the amount of light (far beyond the diminished power employed),
put a stop to reduction at a point at which much too large a light is
produced fur common purposes.
    The often-repeated question, " Will electricity supersede gas?"
could be promptly answered if we were confined to this method of
producing electric light ; and for the simple reason that it is im-
possible, by this method, to produce individual lights of moderate
power.
    The electric arc does very well for street lighting, as you all
know from what is to be seen in the City.        It also does very well for

the   illumination of such large enclosed spaces as railway stations ;
but it is totally unsuited for domestic lighting, and for nine-tenths of
the other purposes for which artificial light is required.      If  electricity
is to compete successfully with gas in the general field of artificial
lighting, it is necessary to find some other means of obtaining light
through its agency than that with which we have hitherto been
familiar.                                             I
               Our hope centres in the method — will not say, the new
method — but the method which until within the last few years has
not been applied with entire success, but which, within a recent
                                                         I
period, has been rendered perfectly practicable — mean the method
of producing light by electrical incandescence.
     The fate of electricity as an agent for the production of artificial
light in substitution for gas, depends greatly on the success or non-
success of this method ; for it is the only one yet discovered which
adapts itself with anything like completeness to all the purposes for
which artificial lighting is required.
     If  we are able to produce light economically through the medium
of electrical incandescence, in small quantities, or in large quantities,
as it may be required, and at a cost not exceeding the cost of the same
amount of gas light, then there can be little doubt — there can,       I think,
be no doubt — that in such a form, electric light has a great future
before it.        I   propose, therefore, to explain the principle of this
method of lighting by incandescence, to show how it can be applied^ and
 to discuss the question of its cost.
     When an electrical current traverses a conducting wire, a certain
amount of resistance is opposed to the passage of the current.              One
 of the effects of this conflict of forces is the development of heat. The
amount of heat so developed depends on the nature of the wire — on
 its length and thickness, and on the strength of the current which
 it carries.      If  the wire be thin and the current strong, the heat
 developed     in  it may be so great as to raise it to a white heat.
     The experiment         I have just shown, illustrates the principle of
 Electric Lighting by Incandescence, which is briefly this — that a state
 of white heat may be produced in a continuous solid conductor by passing
 a sufficiently strong electrical current through it.
     A principle, the importance of which cannot well be overestimated,
 underlies this method of producing light electrically — namely, the
 principle of divisibility.       By means of electric incandescence it is
 possible   to  produce    exceedingly small centres of light, even so small
 as the light      of  a single candle ; and with no greater expenditure of
 power, in proportion to the light produced, than is involved in the
 maintenance of light-centres 10 or 100 times greater.          Given a cer-
 tain kind of wire, for example a platinum wire, the 100th of an inch
 in diameter, a certain quantity of current would make this wire white-
 hot whatever its length.        If in one case the wire were one inch long
 and in another case ten inches long, the same current passing through
 these two pieces of similar wire, would heat both to precisely the
 same temperature.          But in order to force the same current through

1882.]            on   Electric Lighting   by Incandescence,                 35
the ten times longer piece, ten times the electro-motive force or, if        I
may be allowed the expression, electrical pressure, is required, and
exactly ten times the amount of energy would be expended in pro-
ducing this increased electro-motive force.
    Considering, therefore, the proportion between power applied and
light produced, there is neither gain nor loss in heating these different
lengths of wire. In the case of the longer wire, as it had ten times
the extent of surface, ten times more light was radiated from it than
from the shorter wire, and that is exactly equivalent to the propor-
tional amount of power absorbed. It is therefore evident that ivhether
a short piece of wire or a long piece is electrically heated, the amount
 of light produced is exactly proportional to the power expended in
producing it.
      This is extremely important ; for not only does it make it possible
  to produce a small light where a small light is required, without
  having to pay for it at a higher rate than for a larger light, but it
 gives also the great advantage of obtaining equal distribution          of
 light. As the illuminating effect of light is inversely as the square
 of the distance of its source, it follows that where a large space is to
 be lighted, if the lighting is accomplished by means of centres of
 light of great power, a much larger total quantity of light has to be
 employed, in order to make the spaces remotest from these centres
 sufficiently light, than would be required if the illumination of the
 space were obtained by numerous smaller lights equally distributed.
      In order to practically apply the principle of producing light by
 the incandescence of an electrically heated continuous solid conductor,
 it is necessary to select for the light-giving body a material which
 offers a considerable resistance to the passage of the electric current,
and which is also capable of bearing an exceedingly high temperature
without undergoing fusion or other change.
      As an illustration of the difference that exists among different
substances in respect of resistance to the flow of an electric current,
and consequent tendency to become heated in the act of electrical
transmission, here is a wire formed in alternate sections of platinum
and silver; the wire is perfectly uniform in diameter, and when              I
pass an electric current through     it,
                                       although the current    uniform in
                                                               is
every part, yet, as you see, the wire       not uniformly hot, but white-
                                           is
hot only in parts. The white-hot sections are platinum, the dark
sections are silver.    Platinum offers higher degree of resistance to
                                           a
the passage of the electric current than silver, and in consequence of
this, more heat  is developed in the platinum than in the silver sections.
     The high electrical resistance of platinum, and its high melting-
point, mark it   out as one of the most likely of the metals to be useful
in the construction of incandescent lamps.       When platinum      mixed
                                                                        is
with 10 or 20 per cent, of iridium, an alloy         formed, which has
                                                     is                      a
much higher melting-point than platinum         and many attempts have
                                                ;
been made to employ this alloy in electric lamps.      But these attempts
have not been successful, chiefly because high as       the melting-point

of iridio-platinum, it is not high enough to allow of its being heated
to a degree that would yield a sufficiently large return in light for
energy expended.      Before an economical temperature is reached,
iridio-platinum  wire  slowly volatilises and breaks.   This is a fatal
fault, because in obtaining light by incandescence there is the greatest
imaginable advantage in being able to heat the incandescing body to an
extremely high temperature.     I will illustrate this by experiment.
     Here is a glass bulb containing a filament of carbon. When               I
pass through the filament one unit of current, light equal to two
candles is produced.      If  now   I  increase the current by one half,
making it one unit and a half, the light is increased to thirty candles,
or thereabout, so that for this one half increase of current (which
involves nearly a doubling of the energy expended), fifteen times more
light is produced.
                                                     I
     It will readily be understood from what have shown that it is
essential to economy that the incandescing material should be able to
bear an enormous temperature without fusion.           We know of no metal
that fulfils this requirement ;    but  there is a non-metallic substance
which does so in an eminent degree, and which also possesses
another necessary quality, that of low conductivity.        The substance is
carbon.     In attempting to utilise carbon for the purpose in question,
there are several serious practical difficulties to be overcome.        There
is, in the first place, the mechanical difficulty arising from its intract-
                                                       brittle and non-elastic
                                               it,
ability. Carbon, as we commonly know           is    a
substance, possessing neither ductility nor plasticity to favour its
being shaped suitably for use in an electric lamp. Yet, in order to
render      serviceable for this purpose,
              it                          it   isnecessary to form      into
                                                                       it    a
 slender filament, which must possess sufficient strength and elasticity
 to allow of its being firmly attached to conducting wires, and to
prevent its breaking.     If  heated white hot in the air, carbon burns
away and  ;    therefore  means  must be found for preventing its com-
 bustion. It must either be placed in an atmosphere of some inert gas
or in     vacuum.
          a
     During the last forty years, spasmodic efforts have from time to
 time been made to grapple with the many difficulties which surround
 the use of carbon as the wick of an electric lamp.          It only within
                                                              is
 the last three or four years that these difficulties can be said to have
 been surmounted.       It now found that carbon can be produced in
                         is
 the form of straight or bent filaments of extreme thinness, and
 possessing     great degree of elasticity and strength.
                   a                                           Such filaments
 can be produced in various ways — by the carbonisation of paper,
 thread, and fibrous woods and grasses.         Excellent carbon filaments
 can be produced from the bamboo, and also from cotton thread treated
 with sulphuric acid.     The sulphuric acid treatment effects change in
                                                                   a

 This     done by surrounding them with charcoal.

       Here is an example of       a carbon filament produced from parch-
 mentised     cotton thread.    The filament is not more than the *01 of an
 inch in diameter, and yet a length of three inches, having therefore a
 surface of nearly the one-tenth of an inch, gives a light of twenty
 candles when made incandescent to a moderate degree.
       I have said, that, in order to preserve these slender carbon filaments
 from combustion, they must be placed in a vacuum ; and experience
 has shown that if the filaments are to be durable, the vacuum must be
 exceptionally good.        One of the chief causes of failure of the earlier
 attempts    to utilise the incandescence of carbon, was the imperfection
 of the vacua in which the white-hot filaments were placed ; and the
 success which has recently been obtained is in great measure due to
 the production of a better vacuum in the lamps.
      In the primitive lamps, the glass shade or globe which enclosed
 the carbon filament was large, and usually had screw joints, with
 leather or indiarubber washers.           The vacuum was made either by
 filling the lamp with mercury, and then running the mercury out so
 as to leave a vacuum like that at the upper end of a barometer, or the
 air was exhausted by a common air pump.                The invention of the
 mercury pump by Dr. Sprengel, and the publication of the delicate
 and beautiful experiments of Mr. Crookes in connection with the radio-
 meter, revealed the conditions under which a really high vacuum could
 be produced, and in fact gave quite a new meaning to the word vacuum.
 It was evident that the old incandescent lamp experiments had not
 been made under suitable conditions as to vacuum ; and that before
condemning the use of carbon, its durability in a really high vacuum
required still to be tested. This idea having occurred to me,          I com-
municated it to Mr. Stearn, who was working on the subject of high
vacua, and asked his co-operation in a course of experiments having
for their object to ascertain whether a carbon filament produced by
the carbonisation of paper, and made incandescent in a high vacuum
was durable. After much experimenting we arrived at the conclusion
that when a well-formed carbon filament is firmly connected with con-
ducting wires, and placed in a hermetically sealed glass ball, perfectly
exhausted, the filament suffers no apparent change even when heated to
an extreme degree of whiteness.        This result was reached in 1878. It
has since then become clearly evident that Mr. Edison had the same
idea and reached the same conclusion as Mr. Stearn and myself.
      A necessary condition of the higher vacuum was the simplification
of the lamp. In its construction there must be as little as possible of
any material, and there must be none of such material as could occlude
gas, which being eventually given out would spoil the vacuum. There
must besides be no joints except those made by the glass-blower.
      Therefore, naturally and per force of circumstances, the incan-
descent carbon lamp took the most elementary form, resolving itself
into a simple bulb, pierced by two platinum wires supporting a filament
of carbon. Probably the first lamp, having this elementary character,
ever publicly exhibited, was shown in operation at a meeting of the

88                          Mr. Joseph W. Swan                        [March 10,
Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle in February, 1879.
The vacuum had been produced by Mr. Stearn by means of an im-
proved Sprengel pump of his invention.
      Blackening of the lamp glass, and speedy breaking of the carbons,
had been such invariable accompaniments of the old conditions of
imperfect vacua, and of imperfect contact between carbon and con-
ducting wires, as to have led to the conclusion that the carbon was
volatilised.       But under the new conditions these faults entirely dis-
appeared ;     and  carefully conducted experiments have shown that well-
made lamps are quite serviceable after more than a thousand hours'
continual use.
      Here are some specimens of the latest and most perfected forms of
lamp. The mode of attaching the filament to the conducting wires by
means of a tiny tube of platinum, and also the improved form of the
lamp, are due to the skill of Mr. Gimmingham.
      The lamp is easily attached and detached from the socket which
connects it with the conducting wires ; and can be adapted to a great
variety of fittings, and these may be provided with switches or taps
 for lighting or extinguishing the lamps.         I     have here a lamp fitted
 especially for use in mines.           The current may be supplied either
 through main wires from a dynamo-electrical machine, with flexible
 branch wires to the lamp, or it may be fed by a set of portable store
 cells closely connected with it.          I     will give you an illustration
 of the quality of the light these incandescent lamps are, capable of
 producing by turning the current from a Siemens' dynamo-electric
 machine (which is working by means of a gas engine in the
 basement of the building) through sixty lamps ranged round the
 front of the gallery and through six on the table.             (The theatre was
 now completely illuminated by means of the lamps, the gas being
  turned off during the rest of the lecture.)
       It is evident by the appearance of the flowers on the table that
  colours are seen very truly by this light, and this is suggestive of its
  suitability for the lighting of pictures.
       The heat produced is comparatively very small ; and of course
  there are no noxious vapours.
                I
       And now may,     I     think, fairly say that the difficulties encountered
  in the construction of incandescent electric lamps have been com-
  pletely conquered, and that their use is economically practicable. In
  making this statement     I      mean, that, both as regards the cost of the
  lamp    itself  and  the cost   of supplying electricity to illuminate  it,light
  can be produced at   a    cost which will compare not unfavourably with
   the cost of gas light.       It
                                is     evident that if this opinion can be sus-
   tained, lighting by electricity at once assumes    a     position of the widest
   public   interest, and  of  the  greatest economic    importance and in view
                                                                  ;

   tion of the facts which support it.
        There has now been sufficient experience in the manufacture of
   lamps to leave no doubt that they can be cheaply constructed, and we

know by actual experiment that continuous beating to a fairly bigb
degree of incandescence during 1200 hours does not destroy a well-
made lamp.     What the utmost limit of a lamp's life may be, we
really do not know. Probably it will be an ever-increasing span ; as,
with increasing experience, processes of manufacture are sure to
become more           and more perfect.         Taking            it,   therefore,   as   fully esta-

             is                 the means
                                     of      its illumination.
                                                        of
      This question in its simplest form          that of the more or less
                                                             is
 economical use of coal; for coal       the principal raw material alike in
                                               is
 the production of gas and of electric light.        In the one case, the coal
is   consumed in producing gas which           burnt in the other in pro-
                                                        is              ;
 ducing motive power, and, by its means, electricity.
      The cost of producing light by means of electric incandescence
 may be compared with the cost of producing gas light in this way, —
2   cwt. of coal produces 1000 cubic feet of gas, and this quantity of
 gas, of the quality called fifteen-candle gas, will produce 3000 candle-
 light for one hour. But besides the product of gas, the coal yields
 certain bye products of almost equal value.           will, therefore, take
                                                                  I                               it
 that we have, in effect, 1000 feet of gas from one cwt. of coal instead
 of from two, as     actually the case.
                        is
      And now, as regards the production of electricity.           One cwt. of
 coal — that   the same measure in point
              is                                 value as gives 1000 feet of
                                                             of
 gas — will give 50 horse-power for one hour.         Repeated and reliable
experiments    show  that  we  can   obtain through the medium of incan-
descent lamps at least 200 candle-light per horse-power per hour.
But as there      waste in the conversion of motive power into electri-
                   is
city, and also in the conducting wires, let us make          liberal deduction
                                                                            a
of 25 per cent., and take only 150 candle-light as the nett available
product of       horse-power; then for 50 horse-power (the product
                  1
of cwt. of coal), we have 7500 candle-light, as against 3000 candle-
     1
light from an equivalent value of gas. That            to say, two and
                                                                    is     half               a
times more        light.
     There still remains an allowance to be made to cover the cost of
the renewal of lamps.        There        parallel expense in connection
                                               is   a

globes, gas chimnies, &c.       cannot say that
                                     I                think these charges
                                                                    I
against gas lighting will equal the corresponding charges against
electric lighting, unless we import into the account — as         think               I           it
             —
right to do the consideration that, without         good deal of expense
                                                                    a

be given, far beyond what         actually given, to all the conditions
                                          is
under which the gas         burned, nothing like the full light product
                                is
which    Ihave allowed to be obtainable from the burning of 1000 cubic

obtained, especially in domestic lighting.      Taking this into account,
and considering what would have to be done to obtain the full yield
of light from gas and that        be not done, then the estimate
                                     if   it                         havo                 I

made is too favourable,         I   think but little, if any, greater allowance
need be made for the charge in connection with the renewal of
lamps in electric lighting than ought to be made for the corresponding
charges for the renewal of gas-burners, globes, chimneys, &c.                  But it
 will be seen that even if the cost for renewal of lamps should prove
to be considerably greater than the corresponding expense in the case
of gas, there is a wide margin to meet them before we have reached
the limit of the cost of gas lighting.
     I  think too it must be fairly taken into account and placed to the
credit of electric lighting, that by this mode of lighting there is
entire avoidance of the damage to furnishings and decorations of
houses, to books, pictures, and to goods in shops, which is caused
through lighting by gas, and which entails a large expenditure for
repair, and a large amount of loss which is irreparable.
      I have based these computations of cost of electric light on the
supposition that the light product of 1 horse-power is 150 candles.
 But if durability of the lamps had not to be considered, and it were
an abstract question how much light can be obtained through the
medium of an incandescent filament of carbon, then one might, with-
 out deviating from ascertained fact, have spoken of a very much larger
 amount of light       as  obtainable by this expenditure of motive power.
 I might    have assumed double         or even more than double the light for
 this expenditure.        Certainly double and treble the result              I have
 supposed can actually be obtained.               The figures    I  have taken are
 those which consist with long life to the lamps.                  If we take more
 light   for a  given expenditure        of power,  we  shall   have   to renew the
 lamps oftener,      and  so  what    we  gain  in one way we lose in another.
 But it is extremely probable that a higher degree of incandescence
 than that on which       I  have based my calculations of cost, may prove
 to be compatible with durability of the lamps.                  In that case, the
 economy     of  electric lighting     will be greater than   I  have  stated.
      In comparing the cost of producing light by gas and by electricity,
 I  have only dealt with the radical item of coal in both cases.                  Gas
 lighting is entirely dependent upon coal — electric lighting is not,
  but in all probability coal will be the chief source of energy in the
  case of electric lighting also.         When, however, water power is avail-
  able, electric lighting is in a position of still greater advantage, and,
 in point of cost, altogether beyond comparison with other means of
  producing light.
       To complete the comparison between the cost of electric light and
  gas light, we must consider not only the amount of coal required to
  yield a certain product of light in the one case and in the other, but
  also the cost of converting the coal into electric current and into gas ;
  that is to say, the cost of manufactuee of electricity and the cost
  of manufactuee of gas.             I cannot speak with the same exactness of
  detail on this point, as        I  did on the comparative cost of the raw
  material.     But if you consider the nature of the process of gas manu-
  facture, and that it is a process, in so far as the lifting of coal by

1882.]             on Electric Lighting    by Incandescence.                  4]
manual labour is concerned, not very unlike the stoking of a steam
boiler, and if electricity is generated by means of steam, then the
manual labour chiefly involved in both processes is not unlike.            It is
evident that in gas manufacture it would be necessary to shovel into
the furnaces and retorts five or six times as much coal to yield the
same light product as would be obtainable through the steam engine
and incandescent lamps.        But here again it is necessary to allow for
the value of the labour in connection with the products other than
gas, and hence it is right to cut down the difference       I have mentioned
to half — i.e. debit gas with only half the cost of manufacture, in the
same way as in our calculation we have charged gas with only one-
half the coal actually used. But when that is done, there is still a
difference of probably three to one in respect of labour in favour of
electric lighting.
      I  have made these large allowances of material and labour in
favour of the cost of gas, but it is well known that the bye products
are but rarely of the value       I have assumed.       I  desire, however, to
allow all that can be claimed for gas.
      With regard to the cost of plant,          I think there will be a more
 even balance in the two cases.         In a gasworks you have retorts and
 furnaces, purifying chambers and gasometers, engines, boilers, and
 apj)liances for distributing the gas and regulating its pressure. Plant
 for generating electricity on a large scale would consist principally
of boilers, steam engines, dynamo-electric machines, and batteries for
storage.
      No such electrical station, on the scale and in the complete form
 I am    supposing, has yet been put into actual operation ; but several
 small stations for the manufacture of electricity already exist in
 England, and a large station designed by Mr. Edison is, if                I  am
 rightly informed, almost completed in America. We are therefore
 on the point of ascertaining by actual experience, what the cost of
 the works for generating electricity will be.          Meanwhile, we know
 precisely the cost of boilers and engines, and we know approximately
 what ought to be the cost of dynamo-electric machines of suitably
 large size.    We have, therefore, sufficient grounds for concluding
 that to produce a given quantity of light electrically the cost of
 plant would not exceed greatly, if at all, the cost of equivalent gas
 plant.
       There remains to be considered, in connection with this part of
 the subject, the cost of distribution.     Can electricity be distributed as
 widely and cheaply as gas ? On one condition, which               I fully hope
 can be complied with, this may be answered in the affirmative.              The
 condition is that it be found practicable and safe to distribute
 electricity of comparatively high tension.
       The importance of this condition will be understood when it is
 remembered that to effectively utilise electricity in the production of
 light in the manner     I have been explaining, it is necessary that the
  resistance in the carbon of the lamps should be relatively great to the

12                              Mr. Joseph W. Swan             [March 10,
resistance in the wires which convey the current to them.   When lamps
are so united with the conducting wire, that the current which it
conveys is divided amongst them, you have a condition of things in
which the aggregate resistance of the lamps will be very small, and
the conducting wire, to have a relatively small resistance, must either
be very short, or, if it be long, it must be very thick, otherwise there
will be excessive waste of energy ; in fact, it will not be a practical
condition of things.
    In order to supply the current to the lamps economically, there
should be comparatively little resistance in the line.           A waste of
energy through the resistance of the wire of 10 or perhaps 20 per
cent, might be allowable, but if the current is supplied to the lamps
in the manner       I   have described — that of multiple arc, each lamp
being as it were a crossing between two main wires, then — and even if
the individual lamps offered a somewhat higher degree of resistance
than the lamps now in actual use — the thickness of the conductor
would become excessive if the line was far extended.            In a line of
half a mile, for instance, the weight of copper in the conductor would
become so great, in proportion to the number of lamps supplied
through     it, as to be    aserious charge on the light. On the other
hand, ifa     smaller conducting wire were used, the waste of energy and
consequent cost would greatly exceed that      I     have mentioned as the
permissive limit.
    Distribution in this manner has the merit of simplicity,   it   involves
no danger to life from accidental shock and    ;     it   does not demand
great care in the insulation of the conductor. But        it  has the great
defect of limiting within comparatively small bounds the area over
which the power for lighting could be distributed from one centre.
 In order to light large town electrically on this system,
                        a                                         it  would
 be necessary to have          number of supply stations, perhaps half
                                a                                         a
mile or    a   mile apart. It       evidently desirable to be able to effect
                                    is
a  wider distribution than this, and     I   hope that either by arranging
the lamps in series, so that the same current passes through several
 lamps in succession, or by means of secondary voltaic cells, placed as
electric reservoirs in each house,        may be possible to economically
                                         it
obtain a   much wider distribution.
     Whether by the method of multiple arc (illustrated by Diagram       I.)
 which necessitates the multiplication of electrical stations; or by
 means of the simple series (illustrated by Diagram II.), or by means
 of secondary batteries connected with each other from house to
 house in single series, the lamps being fed from these in multiple
 arc (as illustrated by Diagram III.),        I     am quite satisfied that
 comparatively with the distribution           of gas, the distribution of
 electricity   issufficiently economical to permit of its practical applica-
tion on a    large scale.

authority of Sir Wm. Thomson, who has just had his house com-
pletely fitted with incandescent lamps from attics to cellars— to the

entire banishment of gas— that the cost of internal wires for the
electric lamps is less than the cost of plumbing in connection with
gas pipes.
    I  have expended an amount of time on the question of cost which
I  fear must have been tedious ; but         I
                                            have done so from the con-
viction that the practical interest of the matter depends on this
point.   If  electric lighting by incandescence is not an economical
process, it is unimportant ; but if it can be established — and       Ihave
no doubt that it can — that this mode of producing light is economical,
the subject assumes an aspect, of the greatest importance.
     Although at the present moment there may be deficiencies in
the apparatus for generating and storing electricity on a very large
scale, and but little experience in distributing it for lighting purposes
over wide areas, and consequently much yet to be learnt in these
respects ; yet, if once it can be clearly established that light for light,
electricity is as cheap as gas, and that it can be made applicable to
all the purposes for which artificial light is required, electric light
possesses such marked advantages in connection with health, with
the preservation of property, and in respect of safety, as to leave it
as nearly certain as anything in this world can be, that the wide
substitution of the one form of light for the other is only a question
of time.

          The Attitudes of Animals in Motion, illustrated with  the
                               Zoop-axiscojpe.
The problem of animal mechanism has engaged the attention of man-
kind during the entire period of the world's history.
     Job describes the action of the horse ; Homer, that of the ox ; it
engaged the profound attention of Aristotle, and Borelli devoted a
lifetime to its attempted solution.         In every age, and in every
country, philosophers have found it a subject of exhaustless research.
Marey, the eminent French savant of our own day, dissatisfied
with the investigations of his predecessors,        and with the object
of obtaining more accurate information than their works afforded
him, employed a system of flexible tubes, connected at one end
with elastic air-chambers, which were attached to the shoes of a
horse ; and at the other end with some mechanism, held in the hand
of the animal's rider. The alternate compression and expansion of
the air in the chambers caused pencils to record upon a revolving
cylinder the successive or simultaneous action of each foot, as it
correspondingly rested upon or was raised from the ground. By this
original and ingenious method, much interesting and valuable in-
formation was obtained, and new light thrown upon movements until
then but imperfectly understood.
      While the philosopher was exhausting his endeavours to expound
the laws that control, and the elements that effect the movements
associated with animal life, the artist, with a few exceptions, seems to
 have been content with the observations of his earliest predecessors
 in design, and to have accepted as authentic without further inquiry,
the pictorial     and sculptural   representations of moving animals
bequeathed     from the remote  ages of tradition.
      When the body of an animal is being carried forward with
uniform motion, the limbs in their relations to it have alternately a
progressive and a retrogressive action, their various portions acce-
lerating in comparative speed and repose as they extend downwards
 to the feet, which are subjected to successive changes from a condition
of absolute rest, to a varying increased velocity in comparison with
that of the body.
      The action of no single limb can be availed of for artistic purposes
without a knowledge of the synchronous action of the other limbs ;

1882.]                   on Animals in Motion.                        45
and to the extreme difficulty, almost impossibility, of the mind being
capable of appreciating the simultaneous motion of the four limbs of
an animal, even in the slower movements,        may be attributed the
innumerable errors into which investigators by observation have been
betrayed.    When these synchronous movements and the successive
attitudes they occasion are understood, we at once see the simplicity
of animal locomotion, in all its various types and alternations. The
walk of a quadruped being its slowest progressive movement would
seem to be a very simple action, easy of observation and presenting
but little difficulty for analysis, yet it has occasioned interminable
controversies among the closest and most experienced observers.
      When, during a gallop, the fore and hind legs are severally
and consecutively thrust forwards and backwards to their fullest
extent, their comparative inaction may create in the mind of the care-
less observer an impression of indistinct outlines ; these successive
appearances were probably combined by the earliest sculptors and
 painters, and with grotesque exaggeration adopted as the solitary
 position to illustrate great speed.   Or, as is very likely, excessive
 projection  of limb  was intended to symbolise speed, just as excess in
 size was an indication of rank. This opinion is to some extent cor-
 roborated by the productions of the Grecian artists in their best
 period, when their heroes are represented of the same size as other
 men, and their horses in attitudes more nearly resembling those
possible for them to assume.      The remarkable conventional attitude
 of the Egyptians, however, has, with few modifications, been used by
artists of nearly every age to represent the action of galloping, and
prevails without recognised correction in all civilised countries at the
present day.
      The ambition and perhaps also the province of art in its most ex-
 alted sense, is to be a delineator of impressions, a creator of effects,
 rather than a recorder of facts.   Whether in the illustrations of the
 attitudes of animals in motion the artist is justified in sacrificing
 truth, for an impression so vague as to be dispelled by the first
 studied observation, is a question perhaps as much a subject of con-
 troversy now as it was in the time of Lysippus, who ridiculed other
 sculptors for making men as they existed in nature ; boasting that he
 himself made them as they ought to be.
      A few eminent artists, notable among whom is Meissonier, have
 endeavoured in depicting the slower movements of animals to invoke
 the aid of truth instead of imagination to direct their pencil, but
 with little encouragement from their critics ; until recently, however,
 artists and critics alike have necessarily had to depend upon their
 observation alone to justify their conceptions or to support their
  theories.
      Photography, at first regarded as a curiosity of science, was soon
 recognised as a most important factor in the search for truth, and
  its more popular use is now entirely subordinated by its value to the
  astronomer, the anatomist, the pathologist, and other investigators of

46                            Eadweard Muybridge                 [March 13,
the complex problems of nature.          The artist, however, still hesitates
to avail himself of the resources of what may be at least acknowledged
as a handmaiden of art, if not admitted to its most exalted ranks.
     Having devoted much attention in California to experiments in
instantaneous photography, I, in 1872, at the suggestion of the editor
of a San Francisco newspaper, obtained a few photographic impres-
sions of a horse during a fast trot.
     At this time much controversy prevailed            among   experienced
horsemen       as to  whether all the feet of a horse while trotting were
entirely clear of the ground at the same instant of time.          A few ex-
periments made in that year proved a fact which should have been
self-evident.
     Being much interested with the experiments of Professor Marey, in
1877    I invented a method for the employment of a number of photo-
graphic cameras, arranged in a line parallel to a track over which the
animal would be caused to move, with the object of obtaining, at
regulated intervals of time or distance, several consecutive impres-
sions of him during a single complete stride as he passed along in
front of the cameras, and so of more completely investigating the

     I   explained the plan of my intended experiments to a wealthy
resident of San Francisco — Mr. Stanford — who liberally agreed to
place the resources of his stock-breeding farm at my disposal, and to
reimburse the expenses of my investigations, upon condition of my
supplying him, for his private use, with a few copies of the con-
templated results.        The apparatus used and its arrangement will be
better understood by a reference to the accompanying drawings.

     Fig.  2. Back view of electro-exposor.       Two shutters PP, each
comprising two panels, with an opening O between them, are adjusted
to move freely up and down in a frame ; they are here arranged ready
for an exposure, and are held in position by a latch L and trigger T,
all light being excluded from the lens. A slight extra tension of
the thread B, Fig. 4, will cause a contact of the metal springs M S, and
complete a circuit of electricity through the wires WW and the
electro-magnet M ; the consequent attraction causes the armature A
to strike the trigger, the latch is released, the shutters are drawn
respectively upwards and downwards by means of the rubber springs
S S, and light is admitted to the sensitised plate while the openings
in the shutters are passing each other in front of the lens.

      Fig. 5. General view of studio, operating track, and background.
In the studio are arranged 24 photographing cameras at a distance
of 12 inches from the centre of each lens ; an electro-exposor is
securely fixed in front of each camera.       Threads 12 inches apart are
stretched across the track (only two of which are introduced in the
                                     Fig. 5.
 engraving), at a suitable height to strike the breast of the animal
 experimented with, one end of the thread being fastened to the back-
 ground, the other to the spring, Fig. 4, which is drawn almost to the
 point of contact.
      The animal in its progress over the track will strike these threads
 in succession, and as each pair of springs is brought into contact,
 the current of electricity      thereby created effects a photographic
 exposure,   as described  by  Figs.  2 and 4 ; and each consecutive expo-
 sure records the position of the animal at the instant the thread is
 struck and broken.
      For obtaining successive exposures of horses driven in vehicles,
 one of the wheels is steered in a channel over wires slightly elevated
 from the ground ; the depression of each wire completes an electric
  circuit, and effects the exposures in the same manner as the threads.

    Fig. 6. Operating track, covered with corrugated indiarubber, and
marked with transverse lines 12 inches apart.    Each line is numbered,
for the purpose of more readily ascertaining the length of the
animal's stride. On one side of the track, and opposite to the battery
of cameras, a white background is erected at a suitable angle.

     The camera in which any one negative in a series of exposures is
made is designated on that negative by the parallel direction of the
vertical stake with the horizontal line extending to the corresponding
number immediately opposite. The discriminating number of each
series is marked on each negative by the large numbers — 229, for
example — which are changed for each movement illustrated.
     For recording the successive attitudes of animals not under
control, an apparatus is used, comprising a cylinder, around which
are spirally arranged a number of pins ; upon the cylinder being set
in motion through gearing connected with a spring or weight, these
pins are consecutively brought into contact with a corresponding
number of metal springs ; a succession of electric currents are thereby
created which act through their respective magnets attached to the
electro-exposors at regulated intervals of time. The cylinder is put in
motion either by bringing it into gearing with other parts of the appa-
ratus already in motion ; or by releasing a break with the hand, or by
the action of some object at a distance by means of an electric current.
     This apparatus is principally used for illustrating the flight of
birds, the motions of small animals, and changes of position without
continuous progressive motion, such as occur during wrestling or
turning a summersault ; when the cameras are directed towards the
place where the movements are being executed.
     The boxes outside the studio (Fig. 5) contain cameras and electro-
exposors for obtaining synchronous exposures    of a moving object from
different points of view.
     The following analyses of some of the movements investigated by

the aid of electro-photographic exposures, are repeated by permission
of the President and Council from a paper read by the author before
the Royal Society, and are rendered more perfectly intelligible by the
reproductions of the actual motions projected on a screen through
the zoopraxiscope.
                                 The Walk.
     Selecting the horse for the purposes of illustration, we find that
during his slowest progressive movement —the walk —he has always
two, and, for a varying period, three feet on the ground at once.
With a fast walking horse the time of support upon three feet is
exceedingly brief ; while during a very slow walk all four feet are
occasionally on the ground at the same instant.
     The successive order of what may be termed foot fallings are
 these. Commencing with the landing of the left hind foot, the next
to strike the ground will be the left fore foot, followed in order by
the right hind, and right fore foot.     So far as the camera has revealed,
these successive foot fallings during the walk are invariable, and are
probably common to all quadrupeds. But the time during which
each foot, in its relation to the other feet, remains on the ground,
varies greatly with different species of animals, and even with the
same animal under different conditions.         During an ordinary walk,
at the instant preceding the striking of the left hind foot, the body is
supported on the right laterals, and the left fore foot is in act of
passing to the front of the right fore foot. The two hind feet and
the right fore foot immediately divide the weight.         The right hind
foot is now raised, and the left hind with its diagonal fore foot
sustains the body ; the left fore next touches the ground and for an
instant the animal is again on three feet ; the right fore foot is
immediately raised and again the support is derived from laterals —
 the left instead of as before the right.   One half of the stride is now
completed, and a similar series of alternations, substituting the right
feet for the left, completes the other half.        These movements will
perhaps be more readily understood by a reference to the longitudinal
elevation, Fig. 7, No. 1, which illustrates some approximate relative
positions of the feet of a rapid walking horse, with a stride of
5 feet 9 inches. The positions of the feet indicated in this, and also in
the other strides illustrated in Fig. 7 are copied from photographs,
and from them we learn that during an ordinary walk the consecutive
 supporting feet are :
     1. The left hind and left fore — laterals.
     2. Both hind, and left fore.
     3. Right hind and left fore — diagonals.
     4. Right hind and both fore.
     5. Right hind and right fore — laterals.
     6. Both hind, and right fore.
     7. Left hind and right fore — diagonals.
     8. Left hind and both fore.

     Commencing again with the first position ; it is thus seen that
when a horse during a walk is on two feet, and the other two feet are
suspended between the supporting legs, the suspended feet are laterals.
On the other hand, when the suspended feet are severally in advance
of and behind the supporting legs, they are diagonals.
     These invariable rules seem to be neglected or entirely ignored by
many of the most eminent animal painters of modern times.
                                  The Trot.
     By some observers     the perfect trot is described as an absolutely
synchronous     movement     of the diagonal feet.    This simultaneous
action may be considered desirable, but it probably never occurs.
     Sometimes the fore foot will be raised before the diagonal hind
foot, sometimes afterwards ; but in either instance, the foot raised first
will strike the ground first ; repeated experiments with many racing
and other trotting horses confirmed this want of simultaneity. Select-
ing for an example of the trot a horse making a stride of 18 feet in
length, we find that at the instant his right fore foot strikes the
ground, the left hind foot is a few inches behind the point where it
will presently strike at about 38 or 40 inches to the rear of the fore
foot.    When both feet have reached the ground, the right hind leg is
stretched back almost to its fullest extent, with the pastern nearly
horizontal, while the left fore leg is flexed under the body.      As the
legs approach a vertical position the pasterns are gradually lowered,
and act as springs to break the force of the concussion until they are
bent nearly at right angles with the legs.
     At this period the left fore foot is raised to its greatest height,
and will frequently strike the elbow, while the right hind foot is but
little raised from the ground and is about to pass to the front of the
left hind.
     The pasterns gradually rise as the legs decline backwards until
the   right fore foot has left the ground and the last propelling force
is being exercised by the left hind foot ; which accomplished, the
animal is in mid air.
     The right hind foot continues its onward motion until it is some-
times much in advance of its lateral fore foot, the former, however,
being gradually lowered, while the latter is being raised.      The right
hind and both fore legs are now much flexed, while the left hind is
stretched backwards to its greatest extent with the bottom of the foot
turned upwards, the left fore leg is being thrust forwards and gradu-
ally straightened, with the toe raised as the foot approaches the
ground ; which accomplished, with a substitution of the left limbs for
the right we find them in the same relative positions as when we
commenced our examination, and one half of the stride is completed.
      With slight and immaterial differences, such as might be caused
by irregularities of the ground, these movements are repeated by the
other pair of diagonals, and the entire stride is then complete.
                                                               e 2

     Line 4 illustrates a stride of 18 feet 3 inches, and the order of
supporting feet are : —
     1. The right fore foot.
     2. The left hind and right fore feet.
     3. The left hind foot.
     4. Without support.
     5. The left fore foot.
     6. The right hind and left fore feet.
     7. The right hind foot.
     8. Without support.
     It appears somewhat remarkable that until the results of M.
Marey's experiments and of those obtained by electro-photography
were published, many experienced horsemen were of opinion that
during the action of trotting at least one foot of a horse was always
in contact with the ground.
     If the entire stride of a trotting horse is divided into two por-
tions, representing the comparative distances traversed by the
aggregate of the body while the feet are in contact with, and while
they are entirely clear of, the ground ; the relative measurements
will be found to vary very greatly, they being contingent upon length
of limb, weight, speed, and other circumstances.
     Heavily built horses will sometimes merely drag the feet just
above the surface, but, in every instance of a trot, the weight of the
body is really unsupported twice during each stride (see stride 2,
positions 4 and 4 d). It sometimes happens that a fast trotter, during
the two actions of a stride, will have all his feet clear of the ground
for a distance exceeding one-half of the length of the entire stride ;
this elasticity of movement is however exceptional.
     The action of a fast-trotting horse while drawing a vehicle is
very different from his action under the saddle ; in the latter case,
 the hind legs are kept thrust back for a longer period, and their final
forward movement is much more rapid.
                                The Amble.
     Assuming our observation of this movement to commence when,
during   a stride of about 10 feet, the left hind foot has just struck the
ground slightly to the rear of where the right fore foot is resting ;
the left fore leg will be well advanced but still flexed, with the toe
pointed downwards, and the right hind foot having been the last to
leave the ground, will be thrust backwards with the pastern nearly
horizontal.
     As the right fore foot leaves the ground, the left fore leg is
gradually straightened during its thrust forwards ; the right hind foot
in the meantime is gradually advancing, and the horse is supported
on the left hind foot alone.
     The left fore foot is now brought to the ground, and the body
rests on the left laterals, with the right laterals suspended between
them.

      As the left fore leg attains a vertical position, its lateral leaves
 the ground, and the support of the body devolves on the left fore
 foot alone, the right fore leg being considerably flexed, with the
 foot in advance of the left fore leg.
      The right hind foot now strikes the ground, and one half of
  the stride is accomplished; these movements are repeated with a
 change of the limbs for the remaining portion of the stride, and the
 horse is again in the position in which we first observed him.
     We shall see by reference to stride No. 5 the consecutive support-
 ing feet to be :
      1. The left hind foot.
     2. The left hind and left fore feet— laterals.
     3. The left fore foot.
     4. The left fore and right hind feet — diagonals.
     5. The right hind foot.
     6. The right hind and right fore feet — laterals.
     7. The right fore foot.
     8. The right fore and left hind feet— diagonals.
     The right fore foot being raised, the horse is again in the first
 position.
      The amble and the walk are the only regular progressive move-
 ments of the horse wherein the body is never without the support
 of one or more legs, in all others the weight is entirely off the ground
 for a  longer or shorter period.
                             The Bach or Pace.
     The rack differs from the trot in the nearly synchronous action
 of the laterals instead of the diagonals.
     In some countries the rack is naturally adopted by the horse as
 one of his gaits, but it is probably caused by the effects of training
 exercised  over many generations   of his ancestors.
     The movements already described are regular in their action, and
a stride may be divided into two parts, which are essentially similar
to each other.
                                The Canter
and the gallop, however, cannot be so divided, and a complete stride
in either of those gaits is a combination of several different move-
ments.
     The canter is usually regarded as a slow gallop, probably from
the facility with which a change from one gait to the other can be
effected ; an important difference will, however, be observed.
     Assuming a horse after his propulsion through the air, during a
stride of 10 feet, to have just landed on his left hind foot, the right
hind foot will be on the point of passing to the front of the left. The
left fore leg will be thrust forward and nearly straight, while the
right fore leg will be flexed with the foot elevated about 12 inches
from the ground, and somewhat behind the vertical of the breast.

the impression of rapid motion, although, curiously enough, the atti-

 of the left hind, each as they land being forward of the centre of

                     is

time the left fore leg     perfectly straight, the foot, with the toe much

higher than the heel,      thrust forward to     point almost vertical with

 a  brief space of time the diagonals are upon the ground together.
 The left fore leg, however, immediately assumes the entire respon-
 sibility of the weight, and soon attains a vertical position, with its
 pastern at right angles to it.
       In this position the right hind foot is thrust back to its fullest
 extent, at an elevation of 12 or 14 inches, with the pastern nearly
 horizontal.    The left hind foot is considerably higher and somewhat
 more forward ; the right fore leg is straight, stretched forward, with the
 foot about 15 inches from the ground, and almost on a perpendicular
 line from the nose. The right fore foot strikes the ground 48 inches
 in advance of the left fore, which, having nearly performed its office,
 is preparing to leave the ground; the animal will then be sup-
 ported on the right fore foot alone, which immediately falls well to
 the rear of the centre of gravity, which is sometimes passed by the
 left hind foot at a height of about 12 inches ; the right hind foot is
 some distance in the rear, and the left fore foot, at a height of 24 inches,
 is suspended somewhat in advance of its lateral.
      In this position the horse uses the right fore foot for a final act
 of propulsion, and is carried in mid air for a distance of 60 inches,
 after which the left hind foot descends, the stride is completed, and
the consecutive motions renewed.
      The measurements and positions herein given do not pretend to
exactness, as they must depend to some extent upon the capability,
 training, and convenience of the animal ; but they may be accepted
as representing an average stride of 20 feet with a horse in a fair con-
dition for racing.
      From this analysis it will be seen, by reference to stride 9, that
a horse, during an ordinary gallop, is supported consecutively by :
      1. The left hind foot,
      2. Both hind feet,
      3. The right hind foot,
      4. The right hind and left fore feet,
      5. The left fore foot,
      6. Both fore feet,
     7. The right fore foot,
with which he leaves the ground, while the only position in which we
find him entirely without support is when all the legs are flexed
under his body.
     It is highly probable, however, that more exhaustive experi-
ments with long-striding        horses in perfect training, will discover
there is sometimes an interval of suspension between the lifting of
one fore foot and the descent of the other ; and also between the
lifting of the second hind foot which touches the ground, and the
descent of its diagonal fore foot (see imaginary stride 10).         Should
this latter be the case, it will, from the necessary positions of the
other limbs, afford but a very shadowy pretext for the conventional
attitude used by artists to represent a gallop.            It is extremely
doubtful if there can be any interval of suspension between the

56          Eadweard Muybridge    on Animals in Motion.        [March 13,
lifting of one hind foot and the descent of the other, no matter what
the length of stride.
     Many able scientists have written on the theory of the gallop,
but I believe Marey was the first to demonstrate, that in executing this
movement,    the horse left the ground with a fore foot and landed on a
hind foot.
                                 The Leap.
     There is little essential difference in general characteristics of
either of the several movements that have been described, but with
a number of experiments made with horses while leaping, no two
were found to agree in the manner of execution. The leap of the
same horse at the same rate of speed, with the same rider, over the
same hurdle, disclosed much variation in the rise, clearance, and
descent of the animal.         Apart from this, the horses were not
thoroughly trained leapers, and the results are perhaps not repre-
sentative of those that would be obtained from the action of a well-
trained hunting horse.      A few motions were, however, invariable.
While the horse was raising his body to clear the hurdle, one hind
foot was always in advance of the other, and exercised its last
energy alone.
     On the descent, the concussion was always received by one fore
foot, supported by the other more or less rapidly, and sometimes as
much as 30 inches in advance of where the first one struck, followed
by the hind feet, also with intervals of time and distance between
their several falls.    It is highly probable future experiments will
 prove these observations to be invariable in leaping.
     It is highly probable that these photographic investigations,
 which were executed with wet collodion plates with exposures
not exceeding in some instances the one five-thousandth part of
 a second, will dispel many popular illusions as to gait, and that
future and more exhaustive experiments, with all the advantages of
 recent chemical discoveries, will completely unveil to the artist all the
 visible muscular action of men and animals during their most rapid
 movements.
      The employment of automatic apparatus for the purpose of obtain-
 ing a regulated succession of photographic exposures is too recent
 for its value to be properly understood, or to be generally used for
 scientific experiment ; at a future time, the pathologist, the anatomist,
 and other explorers for hidden truths will find it indispensable for
 their complex investigations.

            Spectrum Analysis in the   infra red of the Spectrum.
At    the Koyal Institution it would be almost an impertinence on my
part were    I to attempt to prove the existence of dark rays which lie
below the red of the spectrum : Professor Tyndall has made you all
so thoroughly acquainted with these dark rays that        I may assume not
only your acquaintance with them, but also your interest in them.
The most accessible means hitherto of exploring this region of the
spectrum has been by a study of its heating effect, as shown by the
thermopile ; and more particularly when an integration of the effect
produced by its component rays is required.         Beautifully delicate is
the thermopile, but it must not be forgotten that it depends for its
delicacy largely on the area of its face.       A little consideration will
show that if you wish to examine the spectrum by its means, you
must be prepared for a drawback.
     In the thermopile     I  have here, the elements composing it are
                            I
arranged in a line, and can allow any fineness of beam to penetrate
to its surface by means of this adjustable slit.       Unfortunately, how-
ever, the narrower the slit the smaller is the heating effect on the
                           I
thermopile ; so that, if wish to measure the heating effect of a very
narrow beam of radiation which may find its way between the jaws of
the slit, the heating effect will be so small that it may escape detection.
In the visible solar spectrum, as you are all aware, there are breaks
of continuity presenting to the eye the appearance of fine dark lines,
and showing a diminished radiation.           Now, suppose for an instant
that the part of the spectrum which is visible to us was dark, not
exciting vision, it is manifest, even were the energy of this part of
the spectrum very much greater than it is, that to ascertain the
existence of these fine lines by means of the thermopile would be
next to impossible; since the slit would have to be closed to an
excessive degree of fineness, and when so closed the thermopile
would be insensible to radiations when such existed.            Now this is
precisely the case with which we have to deal in the spectrum below
the red. We know of its existence ; but with any source of radia-
 tion, such as the sun for instance, the thermopile would stand but a
 small chance of finding any narrow breaks in its continuity.        I need

 58                        Captain W.  de  W. Abney             [March 17,
 only refer to Lamansky's thermogram (Fig. 1) of the solar spectrum,
 taken by a linear thermopile, in which, after taking extraordinary
 precautions, he found the existence of three breaks. The thermo-
 pile, with its galvanometer, takes no cognizance of time; given a
 constant and steady flux of radiation striking it during a certain
 time, the electrical current generated, which is shown by the deflection
 of the galvanometer needle, remains constant, and no increase of time
 gives a greater deflection.      If we could imagine a thermopile the
 current generated by which, by the efflux of time, would proportionally
 increase the deflection of the needle, then the most limited radiation
          Q      T      JE     H         £
striking the pile could be measured and calculated. At present
there seems to be no method capable of taking account of time for
this purpose except photography, and until recently it seemed chi-
merical to apply it.       I should like to show you how photography
takes cognizance of time, and also why it seemed unsuitable for in-
vestigating the dark rays below the red end of the spectrum.      I propose
to photograph the spectrum on an ordinary photographic compound.
     A piece of paper has been coated with silver bromide, and this
compound, when placed in the spectrum, is acted upon by the ultra
violet, the violet and the blue rays.     If I cover up § of the slit of the
lantern and allow an exposure of the paper to the spectrum of two
seconds, then with the next ^ of the slit an exposure of ten seconds,
and with the remaining ^ give an exposure of thirty seconds, it will be
seen when    I develop the image that the length of the spectrum varies,
and also the darkening of the different portions.         Thus the longest
exposure will show the greatest intensity of action and the greatest
length of spectrum. [Shown.]          This experiment serves a double
purpose, for whilst it makes it clear that photography takes cognizance
of time, yet it seemingly shows that it is unfitted for exploring the
infra-red region, since ordinary photographic compounds are unacted
upon by them.       Could a compound be found which was sensitive to
the dark rays, it is manifest that the battle would be won, and that
investigations full of interest might be the outcome.

            on Spectrum   Analysis in   the   infra red of   the Spectrum.   59
1882.]
     Some eight years ago      I
                               tried my hand at the matter, and after
several years of experimenting it was my good fortune to find a com-
pound which was chemically acted upon by the dark radiations.
   I   will not weary you with the various experiments undertaken ;
suffice it to say that silver bromide was selected as the salt to work
upon. My aim was to prepare an emulsion of bromide of silver in
collodion (an emulsion being silver bromide in a fine state of
division suspended in collodion) which should transmit green-blue
light. Let me show you why.
    The spectrum on the screen, when unabsorbed by any medium,
shows every colour.      If, however, a piece of green glass is inserted
before the slit, it is seen at once that the violet is absorbed and also the
lowest part of the red.       Inferentially it may be supposed that the
infra-red rays are also absorbed.       Orange is the usual colour of the
silver bromide, and a piece of orange glass placed in front of the
slit cuts off from the spectrum all the most refrangible part of
the spectrum and none of the least refrangible.
     On the principle of conservation of energy, where radiation is
absorbed,    there work must be done  by the absorbing body and show
itself as heat or chemical action.     Heat with the thermopile, for
instance, and chemical action with the salt of silver.   Thus, with the
orange bromide we should expect,      as  we  have  already seen is the
case, that the violet and blue rays would do work on it whilst the
other rays would be passive.
    The green state was attained after much labour. The colour of
this new preparation of silver bromide, and that of the old, are now
shown by means of the lantern on the screen.
    Now you will see that if the work done in the green bromide
was chemical decomposition, the problem was solved, and that the
unknown might be made to write down, in hieroglyphics perhaps,
but still in a manner capable of being deciphered, its character and
peculiarities.
    I  will endeavour to experimentally illustrate that the green
compound is acted upon by the dark rays. It will be in your recol-
lection that Professor Graham Bell's recently introduced photophone
is in reality an instrument consisting of a perforated disc rotating in
front of a source of radiation, and by means of a lens the radiant
energy is focussed on the surface of a selenium cell, to which a
telephone is attached, and that by this means a musical sound is pro-
duced in the telephone.
    Professor Bell showed that the same effect was produced when a
piece of ebonite was introduced between the source of light and the
selenium cell.    Dr. Huggins proposed to me that                I
                                                          should try the
permeability of the ebonite by the dark rays ; and this was done, with
the result that the spectrum was taken through          showing an im-
                                                               it,
pression on the green bromide of the dark rays.        An image of the
incandescent carbon points of the electric light are now formed on           a
piece of ebonite, and behind        it   glass plate covered with the
                                         is   a

bromide ; an exposure of twenty seconds will suffice to impress the
image of the points by their dark rays.             [The image was developed
and subsequently shown.]        It will be seen that the bromide in this
state is somewhat sluggish to respond to the vibrations of the dark
rays.   I  will now make an experiment to show how different is
the behaviour of the orange bromide.               Behind this rotating disc,

was rotating ; and developed before the audience and subsequently
the photograph was shown.]       The exposure is estimated by Cazin
as TGiyQwu of a second.     It would require twenty such sparks to
impress the red end of the spectrum on a pure bromide plate.                                  I
should wish to show you one more remarkable example of the
action of the dark rays on the blue-green silver bromide. On the
screen we have a slide showing certain opaque discs and triangles.
They were produced in the following manner : A card was perforated
with such discs and triangles, and placed |- of an inch above a green
bromide plate ; above this was suspended a kettle of boiling water,
and the radiation from the kettle acted on the plate through these
holes, with the result that, after considerable exposure, an image
of the holes was developed on the bromide below. This shows
that this particular form of silver salt responds to waves of very low
refrangibility.
    The first application   of the new compound was to the solar
spectrum, and on the screen we have the first impression of the infra-
red region ever taken. On the diagram (Fig. 2) there are bands    and                  cf>    ij/
drawn which do not appear in the photograph only on two occasions  ;
have they been impressed, for reasons which will be explained.       To

     In the visible portion of the solar spectrum, most of the lines
 have been traced to the absorption of different metallic or other
 vapours existent in the solar or our own atmosphere.       The cause of
 the absorptions in the invisible part of the spectrum are as yet
 untraced, except in one or two instances to which         shall have to     I
 allude presently.     With the exception of sodium and calcium, no
 metallic vapours seem to have what would be bright lines, were
 they visible, in the infra-red portion of the spectrum    hence we are      ;

almost bound to suppose that absorption lines in this region are
really due to compound bodies of some description.               Knowing the
results that Professor Tyndall had got with the hydrocarbon and
other vapours and liquids in the infra-red region by thermopile
integration, Colonel Festing and myself determined to see if we could
disintegrate Professor Tyndall's integrations, and locate in the in-
visible spectrum the absorptions which he had noted.
     We commenced with water, and were delighted to find that water
gave a very definite spectrum ; and        I propose to show the method
adopted for this research. In front of the slit of the spectroscope,
which has three prisms, was placed a tube of water or other liquid, in
some cases of the length of two feet, but more generally of six inches.
The crater or bright luminous patch from the positive pole of the
electric light was projected on the slit, the rays having to traverse
the liquid. The image of the spectrum was then received on a
sensitive plate. In this manner       I  propose to take the spectrum of
a two-foot length of water.       [The  photograph   was taken and subse-
quently   shown   on   the  screen.]  Before   proceeding further,     I will
again show you       the   superior sensitiveness of the orange form of
bromide for blue rays over the green bromide for the dark rays. The
same length of spark as before shall be used, and the light from it
projected by means of a lens through a couple of prisms, and the
image be focussed on an orange bromide film. The spark passes,
and the most refrangible end of the spectrum will be found to be
impressed.    [The photograph was developed before the audience,
and at the close of the lecture thrown upon the screen.] Our next
attempts were with alcohol and ether, and in these we got many
definite absorptions, some lined and some banded, the bands being
more or less shaded.        On trying ethyl iodide, however, we came
upon a spectrum which was composed of fine lines and bands with
comparatively sharp edges, differing in this respect from the two
former spectra.    The difference in composition between alcohol and
ethyl iodide is shown in the following diagram.

    The prime difference is the presence of oxygen in the one and its
absence in the other.        We next tried methyl iodide, and got a

      We therefore tried chloroform, and much to our surprise all the
broad bands had vanished, and we had a linear spectrum.                                  What
 would happen if we removed the last hydrogen?                             In carbon tetra-
 chloride the last hydrogen is removed, and we got no absorption
 spectrum at all ; indicating that hydrogen had a most important
 bearing on the absorptions. Carbon disulphide and cyanogen gave
 us the same results. On the other hand, when we spectroscoped hydro-
 chloric acid we had a linear spectrum, as we had with ammonia,
 sulphuric acid, and nitric acid.             Even water was found not to be free
 from lines, as the boundary of each band was a line.                           I  think, then,
 that this satisfactorily settles the point that hydrogen gives the
 initiative to all the special absorptions we noticed.                     The introduction
 of oxygen gives shaded bands ; but on measurement it was found that
 shades were made up of step by step absorptions between two or more
 positions of hydrogen lines. Again, what is called the radical of each
 group of compounds was found to have a definite absorption in a
 definite locality ; hence this spectroscopic method became a means of
 qualitatively determining the composition of an unknown compound
 and its molecular structure.             I would point out also how the absorp-
 tions found by the photographic method go hand in hand with those
 found by Professor Tyndall.               In the annexed table we have the value
 of the absorptions found by him, and following the absorption spectra
 of the same bodies through six inches of liquid. The coincidence is
 remarkable and worthy of attention.

    Your attention should be drawn more especially to the water
spectrum, in which it will be seen what a large proportion of the
infra red is cut off by even a small thickness. Aqueous vapour
absorbs in the same locality as the water;    hence you will see

of the spectrum to find its way through our atmosphere.

the above organic bodies, we found that the principal lines of the
benzine and ethyl series found   a  place in the solar absorptions and   ;

  they exist is a moot point, but there is no doubt that they are some-
 where present in it.        That alcohol is to be found in the sun would
 be perhaps to stretch a point too far ; and it would be unwise to wish
 to find it there, as it might rouse the animosity of a small section
 of the community against this branch of spectrum analysis. The
 ingredients to make it are there, however, without any doubt.
      In regard to these same class of spectra it is interesting to find
 that there is a marked difference in bodies containing the same
 relative proportions of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but molecularly
 different. Take for example aldehyde and paraldehyde (Fig. 5).               A

 molecule of the latter contains three molecules of the former, and we
 see that their spectra differ materially.        If such be the case in organic
compounds, we may surely expect to find the same difference in the
spectra of the elements, if there is a different molecular grouping of
them at different temperatures.           Whether the changes in metallic
spectra   are  due  to  this cause  has   still  to be proved, though it seems
probable    that it may be so.
     The latest point in our research in this subject which will be of
interest to chemists appears to be the possibility of distinguishing
between para- and ortho-organic compounds.                  Our experiments so
far demonstrate that this can be done.                If on further research it
prove to be the case, this branch of spectrum analysis would be
worthy of study by chemists for this reason alone.

We have grown so accustomed to the regular announcement —
"serious accident on such and such a railway, several passengers
        "
injured — that we have almost come to regard railway accidents as
inevitable, just as parents mistakingly think the measles and whooping
cough necessary accompaniments of childhood.       But speed no more
means disaster than a densely crowded city means disease.      The first
effect of overcrowding is undoubtedly to produce fever and other
complaints.    If, however, the knowledge and practice of the laws of
hygiene increase more rapidly than the population of a town, the
death rate, as we have seen, diminishes, instead of augmenting.    And
so it is with locomotion ; the stage-coach journeys of our ancestors
were slow enough for the most staunch conservative, and yet the per-
centage of the passengers injured on their journeys was far greater
than even now with our harum-scarum railway travelling.        The
number of passengers has increased enormously, but the safety has
increased in an even greater rate.                If
                                       then we can devise methods
introducing still greater security, far larger number of passengers
                                              a
may travel at a far greater speed and with less fear of danger than
at present.
    Accidents constitute one charge against railway conveyance, but
there is another, and that is the cost.    Cheap as railway travelling
now   is,compared  with  the departed stage-coach locomotion, the price
of the tickets    still far too high for railways to fulfil, even in
                       is                                                    a

expect the railway companies to lower their fares merely to benefit
humanity. If, however, we can prove to them that the present system
of railways     neither the most remunerative to themselves nor the
                  is
most beneficial to the community at large, we may hope to win the
attention of railway directors, whose stock question           is,

    Those of you who have read the life of Stephenson know what              a
protracted fight he had to carry one of his most cherished ideas, and
that was the employment of        locomotive engine to draw the train,
                                        a
instead of stationary engine to pull
              a                            with ropes or chains. His

  adversaries saw the disadvantage of adding the weight of the loco-
  motive to the weight of the train, whereas Stephenson was especially
  struck with the enormous waste of power in the friction of ropes or
  chains passing over pulleys. [Experiments were then shown proving,
first, that the mass of the locomotive necessitated the engine having a
  greater horse-power to get up the speed of the train quickly as well
  as a greater horse-power to keep up the speed ; secondly, that the
  friction and wear and tear of ropes, such as were employed on the
  London and Blackwall Railway, would have been an insuperable
 hindrance to the development of railways.]       From this was deduced
 that, since in Stephenson's day the only feasible mode of communi-
 cating the power of a stationary engine to a moving train was by
 means of ropes, his decision to adopt the locomotive was perfectly
 correct at the time it was made.
      Attempts have been made to propel trains by blowing them
 through tubes, or by blowing a piston attached to the train through a
 tube, but such attempts at pneumatic railways have nearly all been
 abandoned.    The employment of air compressed into a receiver on the
 train by fixed pumping engines stationed at various points along the
 line, and employed to work compressed air engines on the carriages
 has been effected with considerable success by Colonel Beaumont,
 especially for tram-lines.  The weight of the compressed air engine
 is, however, still very considerable. Any system of pumping water
through a pipe and employing the water to work a hydraulic engine
on the train is hardly worth considering, seeing that the mechanical
difficulties of keeping up a continuous connection between the moving
train and the main through which the water is pumped seems in-
superable.    Gas-engines worked with ordinary coal gas, stored perhaps
under pressure, might be employed on the moving train, but the
advantage arising from the absence of boiler and coal would be more
than compensated for by the fact, that the weight of a gas-engine per
horse-power developed is so much greater than that of a steam-engine.
None of these systems, then, of dispensing with a locomotive is by any
means perfect, and the success of the recent experiments on the
electric transmission of power has turned the attention of engineers
to the consideration, whether electricity could not successfully supplant
steam for the propulsion of trains and tram-cars ; whether it could
not, in fact, supply an efficient means of transmitting power, the
absence of which caused Stephenson to abandon ropes in favour of a
heavy locomotive engine.
    The whole question, like every similar one, is mainly a question of
expense ; and what we have to consider          is,
                                               whether electric trans-
mission on the whole leads to greater economy than can possibly be
obtained by the employment of any kind of locomotive.      The average
weight of a locomotive  is about that of six carriages full of people ;
ten carriages compose an ordinary train, hence the presence of the
mass of the locomotive adds at least 50 per cent, to the horse-power
absolutely necessary to propel the carriages alone, and therefore at

least 50 per cent, to the amount of coal burned. But there is another
most serious objection to the engines, perhaps even more important
than the preceding. The heavy engine passing over every part of the
line necessitates the whole line and all the bridges being made many
times as strong, and therefore many times as costly, and the expense
of maintenance consequently also far greater, than if there were no
locomotive. And it is not possible to make the engine much lighter ;
for it would not have then sufficient adhesion with the rails to be able
to draw the train ; in fact, you cannot diminish the weight as long as
the train is propelled with only one or two pair of driving wheels as
at present. The employment of electricity, however, will enable a train
to be driven with every pair of wheels, just as the employment of
compressed air enables every pair of wheels to brake the train.
     To propel a train we must either utilise the energy of coal by
burning   it, or use the energy possessed by    mountain stream, or the
                                                a
energy    stored  up  in chemicals,  and which     given out when the

chemicals are allowed to combine, or we must employ the energy of
the wind.     Practically we employ at present only the first store for
propelling railway trains — the potential energy of coal and that    ;           is
to   agreat extent the store on which we shall still draw, even when
we employ Electric Eailways.        For experience shows that, with the
modern steam-engine and dynamo, at least one-twentieth of the energy
in coal can be converted into electric energy and that this
                                                   ;             at least is
twenty times as economical as the direct conversion of the energy of
zinc into electric energy by burning     it    in galvanic battery.

until Pacinotti, in 1860, suggested the solution of the problem of
obtaining  a   practically continuous current from          anumber of inter-
mittent currents, and until Gramme, about 1870, carried out Pacinotti             's
suggestion in the actual construction of large working machines, that
the mechanical production of currents became commercially possible.
[Experiments were then shown illustrating the complete electric trans-
mission of power,   a   gas-engine on the platform giving rapid motion
to magneto-electric machine, and the current thereby produced sent
     a
through an electro-motor at the other end of the room, which worked
an ordinary lathe.]
    In electric transmission of power there not only waste of power
                                                 is
from mechanical friction, but also from electric friction arising from
the electric current heating the wire, through which            it

     It was then explained and demonstrated experimentally that this
latter waste could be made extremely small by placing so light                    a
load on the electro-motor, that   it    ran nearly as fast as the generator or
dynamo,    which   converted  the  mechanical     energy into electric energy     ;

 work done by the steam-engine on the generator, quite T7F of a foot-
 pound of work can be done by the distant motor.
      One reason why electric transmission of power can be effected with
 so little waste is because electricity has apparently no mass, and con-
 sequently no inertia ; there        therefore, no waste of power in making
                                   is,

                                             is
 material fluid. Another reason why electro-motors are so valuable for
 travelling machinery    is   on account of the light weight of the motor.
 Experiment shows, that one horse-power can be developed per 50 lbs.
 of dead weight of electro-motor         ;  result immensely more favourable

      In addition to the loss of power arising from the heating of the
 wires by the passage of the current, there           another kind of loss that
                                                      is

 arising from actual leakage     of the electricity due   to defective insulation.
 To send an electric current through distant motor, two wires, "going"

 and " return" wire must be employed, insulated from one another by
 silk, guttapercha, or some insulating substance            and if the motor be

 on  a moving   train, there  must   be some   means  of  keeping up continuous
 connection between the two ends        of  the moving electro-motor and the
 going and return wire. The simplest plan              isto use the two rails as
 the two wires, and make connection with the motor through the
 wheels of the train; those on one side being well insulated from
 those of the other, otherwise the current would pass through the
 axles of the wheels, instead of through the motor.             It  isthis simple
plan that  is  employed in Siemens' Lichterfelde Electric Railway, now
running at Berlin the insulation arising from the rails being merely
                     ;
laid on wooden sleepers having been found sufficient for the short
length,  1J   mile.     The car     issimilar to an ordinary tram-car, and
holds twenty passengers.          [Photographs were then projected on the
screen of this and of the original electric railway laid by Siemens in
the grounds of the Berlin Exhibition of 1879, and exhibited in 1881
at the Crystal Palace, Sydenham.]              It was explained, that on this
latter railway, which was 900 yards long, both the ordinary rails were
used as the return wire, and that the going wire was            a third insulated
rail rubbed by the passing train. [Photographs were then projected
on the screen of Siemens' electric tram-car at Paris, used to carry fifty
passengers backwards and forwards last year to the Electrical
Exhibition.]      In this the going and return wires were overhead
and insulated, connection being maintained between                     them    and
the moving car by two light wires attached to the car, and which
pulled along two little carriages running on the overhead in-
sulated wires, and making electric contact with them.                    [Experi-
ments followed,        proving that although two bare wires lying
on the ground could be quite efficiently employed as the going and
return wire, if the wires were short and the ground dry, the leakage
that occurred   if   the wires were long and the ground moist was so
great, as to more than compensate for the absence of the locomotive.]

Consequently Professor Perry and myself have for some time past
been working out practical means for overcoming these difficulties,
and we have arrived at what we hope is an extremely satisfactory
solution.     Instead of supplying electricity to one very long, not very
well insulated rail, we lay by the side of our railway line a well-
insulated cable, which conveys the main current. The rail, which is
rubbed by the moving train, and which supplies it with electric
energy, we subdivide into a number of sections, each fairly well in-
sulated from its neighbour and from the ground ; and we arrange that
at any moment only that section or sections, which is in the immediate
neighbourhood of the train, is connected with the main cable ; the
connection being of course made automatically with the moving train.
As then leakage to the earth of the strong propelling electric current
can only take place from that section or sections of the rail, which is
in the immediate neighbourhood of the train, the loss of power
by leakage is very much less than in the case of a single imper-
fectly insulated rail such as has been hitherto employed, and which
 being of great length, with its correspondingly large number of points
 of support, would offer endless points of escape to the motive current.
      Dr. Siemens has experimentally demonstrated that an electric
 railway can be used for a mile or two ; Professor Perry and myself,
 by keeping in mind the two essentials of success, viz. attention to
 both the mechanical and electrical details, have, we venture to think,
 devised means for reducing the leakage on the longest railway to less
 than what it would be on the shortest.
      For the purpose of automatically making connection between the
 main well-insulated cable and the rubbed rail in the neighbourhood
 of the moving train we have devised various means, one of which is
 seen from the following figure.
      A B is a copper or other metallic rod resting on the top of and
 fastened to a corrugated tempered steel disc D D (of the nature of, but
 of course immensely stronger than the corrugated top of the vacuum
 box of an aneroid barometer), and which is carried by and fastened to a
 thick ring E E made of ebonite or other insulating material. The
 ebonite ring is itself screwed to the circular cast-iron box, which latter
 is fastened to the ordinary railway sleepers.     The auxiliary rail A B
 and the corrugated steel discs D D have sufficient flexibility that two
 or more of the latter are simultaneously depressed by an insulated
 collecting brush or roller carried by one or by all of the carriages.
 Depressing any of the corrugated steel discs brings the stud F, which
 is electrically connected with the rod A B, into contact with the
 stud G electrically connected with the well-insulated cable.
      As only a short piece of the auxiliary rail A B is at any moment
 in connection with the main cable, the insulation of the ebonite ring
  E E will be sufficient even in wet weather, and the cast-iron box is
  sufficiently high that the flooding of the line or the deposit of
  snow does not affect the insulation.     The insulation, however, of G,
  which is permanently in connection with the main cable, must be far

 better.   For this purpose we lead the guttapercha, or indiarubber,
 covered   wire coming from the main cable through the centre of a
 specially formed telegraph insulator, and cause it to adhere to the
                                   Fig. 1.
 inside of the earthenware tube forming the stalk. And as, in addition,
 the inside of each contact box is dry, a very perfect insulation is
 maintained for the lead coming from the main cable.     Consequently
 as all leakage is eliminated except in the immediate neighbourhood
                                  Fig.  2.
of the train, this system can be employed for the very longest electric
railways.    Fig. 2 shows a modification of the contact box when the
insulated rail instead of extending all along the line is quite short

downwards a metallic fork on the contact box, thus making contact
between F and G.          [Other diagrams were explained, illustrating
modifications of the contact boxes, in one case the well-insulated
cable is carried inside the flexible rail, which then takes the form of
a tube, shown in Fig. 3, in another case the cable is insulated with

Fig.  4, &c]
     The existence of these contact boxes at every 20 to 50 feet also
enables the train to graphically record its position at any moment on
a map hanging up at the terminus, or in a signal-box or elsewhere, by a
shadow which creeps along the map of the line as the train advances ;

stops when the train stops ; and backs when the train backs.      This is
effected thus : — as the train passes along, not only is the main contact
between F and G automatically made, as already described, but an
auxiliary contact is also completed by the depression of the lid of the
contact box, and which has the effect of putting, at each contact box
in succession, an earth fault on an insulated thin auxiliary wire run-
ning by the side of the line. And just as the position of an earth fault
can be accurately determined by electrical testing at the end of the

 the position of the train itself, is automatically recorded by the pointer
 of a galvanometer moving behind a screen or map, in which is cut out
 a slit representing by its shape and length the section of the line on
 which the train is, as shown in Fig. 5. In addition, then, to the
 small sections of 20 feet or more into which our auxiliary rubbed rail
 is electrically divided, there would be certain long blocked sections
 one mile or several miles in length, for each of which on the map a
 separate galvanometer and pointer would be provided.         [Experiments
 were shown of the system of graphically automatically recording the
 progress of a train.]

                       Matter and Magneto- Electric Action.
The late Professor          Clerk Maxwell, in his work on { Electricity
                   '                                                    " the
and Magnetism          (vol. ii. p. 146), lays down as a principle that
mechanical force which urges a conductor carrying a current across
the lines of magnetic force, acts, not on the electric current, but on
the conductor which carries it.    If the conductor be a rotating disk or
a fluid it will move in obedience to this force, and this motion may
 or may not be accompanied with a change of position of the electric
current which it carries. But if the current itself be free to choose
 any path through a fixed solid conductor or a network of wires, then,
when a constant magnetic force is made to act on the system, the path
of the current through the conductors is not permanently altered, but
after certain transient phenomena, called induction currents, have
 subsided, the distribution of the current will be found to be the same
as if no magnetic force were in action.       The only force which acts
on electric currents is electromotive force, which must be distinguished
from the mechanical force which is the subject of this chapter."
     In the investigation on electric discharges, on which Mr. Moulton
and myself have been long engaged, we have met with some phenomena
of which the principle above enunciated affords the best, if not the
only, explanation.    But whether they be regarded as facts arising out
of that investigation, or as experimental illustrations of a principle
laid down by so great a master of the subject as Professor Clerk
Maxwell,     Ihave ventured to hope that they may possess sufficient
interest to form the subject of my present discourse.
                                     I                      I
     The experiments to which refer, and of which now propose to
offer a summary, depend largely upon a special method of exciting an
induction coil. This method was described in two papers, published
in the 1 Philosophical Magazine' (November 1879) and in the ' Pro-
                                '
ceedings of the Royal Society (vol. xxx. p. 173), respectively ; but as
its use appears to be still mainly confined to my own laboratory, and
to that of the Royal Institution,        I
                                     will, with your permission, devote
a short time to a description of         it,
                                      and to an exhibition of its general
effects.
    The method consists in connecting the primary circuit directly
with   a   dynamo- or magneto-machine giving alternate currents. In
the present     case,
                   I  use one of M. de Meritens' excellent machines

70                           Mr. Spottiswoode                   [March 31,
driven by an Otto gas engine.           The speed of the de Meritens'
machine, so driven, is about 1100 revolutions per minute.
     In this arrangement the currents in the secondary are of course
alternately in one direction and in the other, and equal in strength ;
so that the discharge appears to the eye, during the working of the
machine, to be the same at both terminals.
     The currents in the primary are also alternately in one direc-
tion and in the other, and consequently, at each alternation, their
value passes through zero.        But they differ from those delivered
in the primary coil with a direct current and contact breaker in an
important particular, namely, that while the latter, at breaking, fall
suddenly from their full strength to zero, and then recommence with
equal suddenness, the former undergo a gradual although very rapid
change from a maximum in one direction through zero to a maximum
                      in the opposite direction. The ordinary currents
                      with a contact breaker would be represented by a
                  — figure of this kind, while those from     the alternate
machine approximately by       a  curve   of   the following form.      The
                      rise and fall of the latter are, however, sufficiently
    [ J  \ \j   j     rapid  to induce currents of high tension and of
                      great quantity in the secondary.
     From these considerations it follows : first, that as the machine
effects its own variations in the primary current, no contact breaker is
necessary ; secondly, that as there is no sudden rupture of current,
there is no tendency in the extra current to produce a spark or any
of the inconveniences due to an abrupt opening of the circuit, and
consequently that the condenser may be dispensed with ; thirdly, that
the variations in the primary, and consequently the strength and
period of delivery of the secondary currents are perfectly regular ;
 fourthly, that the strength of the currents in the secondary is very
 great.                                     I
          With a 26-inch coil by Apps have obtained a spark about
 7 inches in length, of the full thickness of an ordinary cedar pencil.
 But for a spark of thickness comparable at least with this, and of
 2 inches in length, an ordinary 4-inch coil is sufficient.
     Owing to the double currents, the appearance of the discharge is
that of a bright point at each terminal, and a tongue of the yellow
 flame, such as is usually seen with thick sparks from a large coil,
issuing from each.       This torrent of flame (which, owing to the
rapidity with which the currents are delivered by the machine, is
apparently continuous) may be maintained for any length of time.
The sparks resemble those given by my great coil (exhibited in this
theatre on Friday, April 13th, 1877, and described in the 1 Philo-
sophical Magazine,' 1877, vol. iii. p. 30) with large battery-power
and with a mercury break ; but with that instrument it is doubtful
whether such thick sparks could be produced at short intervals, or in
a rapid shower, as in this case.
     In order to contrast the effects of the two methods,    I  will excite
the coil, first with a battery, and secondly with the alternating

1882.]             on Hatter and Magneto-Electric Action.                  77
machine.      You will notice that with the battery we can obtain either
long, bright, and thin sparks, or short and comparatively thick
discharges; but, unless the latter are made very short, they occur
only at comparatively long and even perceptible intervals of time.
On the other hand, with the alternate machine, although the method
does not lend itself so readily to the production of long and bright
sparks, we can produce a perfect torrent of discharges more rapid and
more voluminous than by any other means yet devised.            Long bright
sparks can, however, be obtained by interrupting the flow of the
currents from the machine, and by allowing only single currents to
pass at comparatively long intervals.        It may be interesting to know
that the number of currents given out by the machine, and consequently
the number of discharges issuing from the coil, is no less than 35,200,
that is, 17 3600 in each direction, per minute. The number may be
determined by the pitch of the note which always accompanies the
action of an alternate machine.
     A comparison of the two methods may also be made when a
Leyden jar is used as a secondary condenser.         This application of the
jar is well known as a valuable aid in spectroscopic research ; and the
employment of the alternating machine so materially heightens the
effects that, judging from some experiments made in the presence of
Mr. Lockyer, and from others of a different character in the presence
                         I
of Professor Dewar, am led to hope from it a further extension of
our knowledge in this direction.        In order that you may form, at all
events, some rough     idea  of the nature                      I
                                           of such discharges, venture, at
the risk of causing some temporary inconvenience from the noise, to
project the spectrum of this spark.
     I  will detain you with only one more instance of comparison.
 The ordinary effect of an induction coil in illuminating vacuum tubes
is well known. The result is usually rather unsteady.                 Several
 instruments have been devised to obviate this inconvenience, e. g. the
                                      '              '
 rapid breakers described in the Proceedings of the Eoyal Society
                                                                     "
 (vol. xxiii. p. 455, and vol. xxv. p. 547), or the break called the Trem-
 bleur" of Marcel Deprez (see 'Comptes Eendus,M881, I. Semestre,
 p. 1283). The use of the alternating machine, however, not only gives
 all the regularity in period, and uniformity in current, aimed at in
 these instruments, but also at the same time supplies currents of great
 strength. The result is a discharge of great brilliancy and steadiness,
 and it is perhaps not too much to say that the effects are comparable
 to those obtained with Mr. De La Eue's great chloride of silver
 battery. The configuration of the discharge produced in this way
 can also be controlled by a suitable shunt applied to the secondary
 circuit ; for example, one formed by a column of glycerine and water,
 or the one consisting of a film of plumbago spread upon a slab of
 slate, constructed by my assistant Mr. P. Ward, and here exhibited.
      One test of the strength of current passing through a tube is
 the amount of surface of negative terminal which it will illuminate
 with a bright glow.       I here have a tube with terminals in the form

 78                            Mr. Spottiswoode                [March 31,
of rings, each of which would be regarded of ample size for currents
obtained in the ordinary way.       These are now all connected together
so as to form one grand negative terminal ; and it will be found that
with the currents from the alternate machine the whole system is
readily illuminated at once.
     It should perhaps be here remarked that, while the strength of the
secondary currents passing through the tube is partly due directly to
the strength of the primary currents from the machine, it is probably
also in part due to the rapidity with which the secondary currents
follow one another. Owing to the latter circumstance the column of
gas maintains a warmer and more conductive condition than would
prevail if the interval between the discharge was longer ; and in
consequence of this a larger portion of the discharges can make its
way through than would otherwise be the case.
     Before leaving the instrumental part of my discourse,     I desire to
bring under your notice a modification of the machine which we have
thus far used^ for producing, by the intervention of the induction coil,
currents of high tension.       This consists of a machine of the same
general construction as the other, but having the armatures wound
with a much greater number of convolutions of much finer wire. The
result is a machine giving off currents of sufficient tension to effect,
by direct action, discharges through vacuum tubes, and even in air.
The currents are of course alternate ; but by diminishing the size of
one of the terminals to a mere point, as well as by other methods
described elsewhere, it is possible to shut off the currents in one
direction, leaving only those in the other direction to discharge them-
selves through the tube.      I hope on some future occasion to give a
fuller account of this remarkable machine, which has only quite
recently been completed.
    Eeturning to the discharge in air, it will be noticed that when the
terminals are set horizontally the torrent of thick discharges assumes
the appearance of a flame, which takes the form of an inverted V.
This is the result of convection currents due to the heat given off by
the discharges themselves.       The discharges are by their nature as it
were fixed  at each end,   but  within the limits of discharging distance
free to move about and to extend themselves in space, especially in
their central part. Further, it may be observed that the length of
the spark which can be maintained is greater than that over which it
will leap in the first instance. The explanation of this is to be sought
in the fact that when the sparks follow very rapidly in succession, the
whole path of each discharge remains so far in a heated state as to
assist the passage of the next ; and, further, that in the middle part
of the discharge or apex of the a, where the heat is greatest, the heat
prevails to such an extent as to render a portion of the path highly
conductive. This may be illustrated by holding a gas jet near the
path of the discharge. The flames will then leap to the two ends of
the jet, which will perform the part of a conductor; and the real
length of the discharge will be that traversed from terminal to

 1882.]            on  Hatter and Magneto -Electric Action.                  79
 terminal, minus the length of the intervening flame.                The per-
 manently heated part of the flame will act in the same manner in
 extending the effective length of the discharge.
      The discharge which we are now examining is not homogeneous
 throughout, but consists of more than one layer.            The flame, which,
 from the fact of   its forming   the  outer  sheath  of  the discharge, is the
 most prominent feature, consists mainly of heated but solid particles
 emanating from the terminals. That this is the case may be inferred
 in a general way from the colours which the flame assumes when
 different substances are placed upon the terminals; for example,
 lithium or sodium.       The spectrum of the flame appears to be always
 continuous. A convenient substance to affix to the terminals is boron
 glass, on account of the brilliancy to which it gives rise in the dis-
 charge ; this will enable us to project the phenomenon.           Within this
 sheath of flame, the discharge consists of the pink light characteristic
 of air, and in the centre of all the true bright spark. There is reason
 to think that, under certain circumstances, there are more layers to
 be seen ; but the above division is sufficient for our present purpose.
 In this somewhat complicated structure, the pink light corresponds
 to the arc, and the flame to a similar accompaniment which is seen
 playing about the upper carbon in electric lamps when a current of
 great strength is used.
      From this account of the methods here employed now turn to I
 the main question.      In the investigation, to which allusion was made
at the beginning of this lecture, it occurred to us that an examination
of the effects of a magnetic field on discharges of this character
through air or other gases at atmospheric pressure, and a comparison
 with those obtained at lower pressures, might throw some fresh
light on the nature of electrical discharges in general.            It is these
phenomena     to  which  I  now propose   to ask your   attention.
     When the discharge, originally in the form of a vc ^ical spindle,
is submitted to the action of a magnet whose poles are horizontal, it
spreads out into two nearly semicircular disks, one due to the dis-
charges in one direction, and the other to those in the opposite
direction.     As the magnetism is strengthened, the flame retreats
towards   the  edge of the disks, and ultimately disappears.         The disk
then consists mainly of the pink discharge ; but with a still stronger
magnetic field, it is traversed at intervals by bright semicircular
sparks at various distances from the centre.            In every case, bright
sparks pass    directly   between   the  terminals   at  the opening of each
separate discharge.
     In order further to disentangle the parts of this phenomenon,
recourse was had in the original experiments to a revolving mirror. The
light in the disks is insuflicient to allow of a projection of the effects,
but the accompanying diagrams represent the appearances seen in the
mirror.     Fig. 1 shows the arrangement of the terminals and the
magnetic poles ; Fig. 2 the appearance of the discharges in a plane
at right angles to that of Fig. 1 ; Fig. 3 the appearance             of three


 1882 .]         on Matter and Magneto-Electric Action.                  81
   successive discharges (in the same direction) with a weak magnetic field
   and a slowly revolving mirror ; Fig. 4 the same, with a slightly more
   rapid rate of revolution ; Fig. 5 a single discharge, with a stronger
   field and greater speed of mirror ; Fig. 6 a single discharge in a
   strong field, with a still greater speed of mirror.     It should be men-
   tioned that in all these figures the images to the left are to be
   regarded as anterior to those on the right, and that they represent
  various phases of the left-hand discharge in Fig. 2.
       If, however, we observe the right-hand discharges with a mirror
  revolving in the same direction as before, it is clear that the actual
  curvature of the discharge will be turned in the opposite direction
  (with reference to the motion of the mirror) to that in the case of the
 left-hand discharges.     The consequence will be that the appearance
  in the mirror, when the rate of revolution is not too great, will be
  something like Fig. 7, instead of Fig. 6. As the speed of the mirror
 is increased, the convexity will diminish, and ultimately be replaced
 by a concavity of the same kind, although not so marked, as that in
 the case of the left-hand discharges.
       These diagrams show that each coil discharge commences with a
 bright spark passing directly between the terminals ; that this spark
 is in general followed by the pink light or arc discharge, which passes
 first in the immediate neighbourhood of the initial spark, and gradually
 extends like an elastic string in semicircular loops outwards; and
 that the flame proper is a phenomenon attendant on the close of the
 entire discharge. It should be added that observations with a mirror
 revolving on a horizontal axis, and with a horizontal slit in front of
 the discharge, show that the disk is not simultaneously illuminated
 throughout, but that it is a locus of a curvilinear discharge which moves
 outwards and expands in its dimensions from the centre.
       The mechanism of the discharge would therefore seem to be as
follows : In the first place, as soon as the tension is sufficient, the
electricity from the terminals breaks through the intervening air,
but with such rapidity that the fracture is like that of glass, or other
rigid substance.      This opens a path, along which, if there remains
sufficient electricity of sufficient tension, the discharge will continue
to flow.     During such continuance the gas becomes heated, and
behaves like a conductor carrying a current ; and upon this the
magnet can act according to known laws.           As long as the electricity
continues to flow, the heat will at each moment determine the easiest,
although not the shortest path for its subsequent passage.           In this
way the gas, which acts at one moment as the conductor of the dis-
charge, and at the next as the path for   it,   will be carried further and
further out until the supply of the electricity from the coil fails, and
the whole discharge ceases. We are, in fact, led by these experiments
to the conclusion that    it   the gas in the act of carrying the current,
                               is
and not the current moving freely in the gaseous space, upon which
the magnet acts.

 receives strong support from the phenomena represented in Figs.
 5, 6, and 7.    The successive bright lines there shown must be due to
 successive falls and revivals of tension within a single coil discharge.
 The existence of such alternations in coil discharges of large
 quantity is otherwise known.        When the fall in temperature is such
 that the conductivity of the gas is insufficient to maintain the arc,
 the discharge can make its way through the air only by a fresh rent
 of the same kind as the first fracture.      But how can this be recon-
 ciled with the fact that the tension can never reach its original degree,
 and must, on the whole, be gradually falling, and that, in addition,
 the paths represented by these various sparks are successively longer
 and longer?      The answer to this question is to be found plainly
 written in the phenomena themselves.          Any irregularity in one of
 these bright lines is always found to be accurately repeated in all of
 the same series.      Now, it is scarcely to be conceived that, at succes-
 sive instants of time and in different portions of space, irregularities
in the discharge itself, and in the distribution of the gas, so precisely
 the same, would constantly and for certain recur ; and we are there-
fore driven to the conclusion that it is the same portion of gas which
at first occupied the centre of the field, with its same yet unhealed
 rent, which is moved outward under the action of the magnet.        If this
 be so, we have in this repetition of minute details nothing more than
 what would necessarily follow from successive reopenings of the
weak parts of the gas, which would be surely found out by the elec-
tricity in its struggle to pass.
     The view here taken of the material character of the luminous
discharge is further borne out by the fact that the spindle of light is
capable of being diverted by a blast of air. When the blast is gentle,
the discharge becomes curvilinear, approximately semicircular, and
the yellow flame may be seen playing about the outer edge, in the
same way as in a weak magnetic field.         When the blast is stronger,
the sheet of light becomes irregular in form, and it is traversed by a
series of bright lines, all of which follow, even in their minute details,
the configuration of the sheet.        The analogy between this and the
phenomena produced        in  a  strong  magnetic field needs no further
remark.    If   the strength  of  the blast be still further increased, the
flame and the sheet of light both disappear, and nothing remains
but bright sparks passing directly, and undisturbed, between the
terminals.     In this case the air is both displaced and cooled so
rapidly by    the  blast, that it no longer offers a practicable conduc-
tive path for the remainder of the electricity, coming from the coil,
to follow.    Of this a succession of disruptive sparks is a necessary
consequence.
     The effect thus produced by a very strong blast is in fact similar
to that observed when a jar is used as a secondary condenser.            In
this case the electricity, instead of flowing gradually from the coil,
passes in one or more instantaneous discharges with finite intervals
of- time between them. Each of these has to break its way through

the  air; and, that done, it ceases. Hence, neither a magnet, nor a
blast of air will have any effect in diverting such a discharge.
    As a last stage of the phenomena, it may be mentioned that, if the
interval between the terminals be near the limit of striking distance,
either a blast of air, or the setting up of a magnetic field will alike
extinguish the discharge.
    Our experiments have been thus far carried on in air at atmo-
spheric pressure; but there is nothing in this pressure which is
essential to them or to the conclusions to which we have been led.
We may therefore repeat them in air, or any other gaseous medium, at
any pressure we please.    This consideration leads us into the region
(so fertile in an experimental point of view) of discharges in vacuum
tubes.
      Commencing with             of moderate diameter and of very slight
                                      a tube
exhaustion,      we can at once  recognize our former phenomena slightly
changed.      Proceeding to another tube, of larger diameter and of
moderate exhaustion, and placing it axially or equatorially in a mag-
netic field, we see not only that the discharge (or rather the con-
ductor carrying             displaced, but also that the displaced part
                           it)

                                 is
spread   out   into     sheet
                           a   or ribbon, showing that the discharge
affected gradually, exactly in the same way as was found in the
open air.
     When the exhaustion           carried further, the phenomena become
                                          is
rather more complicated. At an early stage there           isdistinct separa-

tion between the "negative glow" and the rest of the luminous
column and at more advanced stage the column itself
         ;             a                                          broken into
                                                                      is
separate luminosities or striae.       When this      the case,
                                                      is               usually
                                                                       it   is
said that the negative glow follows the lines of magnetic force, while
the luminous column distributes itself according to Ampere's law.
     It will, however, be found that when completely analysed the
action of the magnet upon the striae, taken individually,            the same
                                                                           is
as that upon the negative glow, due allowance being made for the
differences in local circumstances subsisting between the one and the
other.    We have elsewhere shown that the negative glow            in reality
                                                                       is
as truly     a stria as any other individual member of the luminous
column but with this difference, that

                       a
is  dependent on the variable form and position of the stria immediately
next in order, reckoning from the negative end of the tube.               The
action of    a  magnet   in  throwing    the negative glow into       sheet of
                                                                           a
light, which      isthe locus of the lines of force passing through the
terminal, and which consequently varies with the position of the tube
in the field,    is phenomenon so well known that we need repeat only
                      a
a  single experiment by way of reminder.
     Although     it   not altogether so easy to show that the other striae

magnetic field is strong, it is quite possible to form a magnetic arch at
any part of the column.       In this experiment it will be noticed that
for the formation of the arch in mid-column it is necessary that both
poles of the magnet should act upon one and the same stria.         This,
in fact, means that the pole nearest the negative end anchors the
stria, and thereby brings it into conditions similar to those of the
negative glow. When this is effected the two exhibit similar modifi-
cations in the magnetic field.
     In support of this view, we may adduce another and quite indepen-
dent method of anchoring a stria, and of thereby producing a magnetic
arch elsewhere than at the negative terminal.          It was noticed by
Goldstein and others that if the negative terminal of a tube be
enveloped by an insulating surface of any form pierced with a number
of holes, or if a diaphragm similarly pierced be placed anywhere in
the tube, that the pierced surface will act as a negative terminal. He
also found that the finer and closer the holes, the more complete the
resemblance to the action of a negative terminal.      But even when the
substance is metallic, and when the holes are neither very small nor
very numerous, a perforated diaphragm will so far act like a negative
terminal as to serve as a point of departure of a stria. There is,
however, this difference, that the blank space immediately adjoining
the diaphragm, as it is usually called, is not generally so large as
that at the true terminal; and the striae thus artificially formed
always lie close up to the holes.       The diaphragm, in fact, anchors
the stria, and renders it susceptible of the same magnetic effect as
was shown in the cases studied before.
     The action of a diaphragm in a magnetic field gives rise to many
other interesting and remarkable results ; some of which would further
illustrate the views now submitted for your consideration. But these
must be reserved for another occasion.
     In the foregoing experiments, and in the remarks which have
accompanied them,     I have endeavoured to illustrate, by reference to
gaseous media, the principle enunciated at the outset, that in the dis-
placement of the discharge in a magnetic field, the subject of the
magnetic action is the material substance or medium which conveys
the discharge.     I  have shown also that, even when the discharge
takes place in media so attenuated as to produce the phenomena of
striae, the same principle applies not only to the discharge as a whole,
but also to each component stria or unit ; and, lastly, that the
 apparent diversity of effect on the various striae is due to local cir-
 cumstances, and not to any fundamental difference between the " nega-
            "
 tive glow and the members of the " positive column."
     Seeing now that the magnetic displacement of the luminous dis-
charge means displacement of the matter in a luminous condition, and
that a crowding of such luminous matter involves an increase of
 luminosity, may we not infer with a high degree of probability that
 the striae are themselves aggregations of matter, and that the dark
spaces between them are comparatively vacuous.

      It is true that such a view of the case would seem to imply that, in
  gaseous media, the better the vacuum the more easily can the elec-
 tricity pass ; aud that this might at first sight appear to be at variance
 with the known fact that the resistance of a tube decreases with the
 pressure until a minimum, determinate for each kind of gas, and then
 increases.    But it has been suggested by Edlund (' Annales de Chemie
 et de Physique,' 1881, torn. iii. p. 199) that the resistance of a tube
 may really consist of two parts, first that due to the passage of the
 electricity through the gas itself and, secondly, that due to its passage
 from the terminals to the gas ; and also that the former decreases,
 while the latter increases, as the pressure is lowered.           On this
 supposition the observed phenomena          may be explained, without
assigning any limit to the facility with which electricity may traverse
the most vacuous space.
     We may even carry the suggestion of a resistance of the second
kind a little further, and suppose that there is a resistance due to the
passage of electricity from a medium of one density to that of another,
or from layer to layer of different degrees of pressure.         And from
this point of view we may regard the strise as expressions of resistance
due to the varying pressure in different parts of the tube.       Into the
question, whence this variation of pressure,        I  am not at present
prepared to enter ; it must suffice for this evening to have shown that
the conclusions which we have drawn from our experiments are not
in disaccordance with other known phenomena of the electrical
discharge.

                   Some    of   the   Dangerous Properties of Dusts.
When dealing with the subject of so-called accidental explosions, in
a discourse delivered to the Members of the Royal Institution, in
March 1875, the lecturer pointed out that combustible, and especially
inflammable substances, if sufficiently light and finely divided to
allow of their remaining for some time suspended in air in consider-
able quantity, so as to form an intimate mixture with                      it,
                                                                      may, when
ignited in this condition, produce explosive effects. The combustion
of the finely divided particles which, under such conditions, are first
inflamed, at once communicate flame to those in their immediate
vicinity, and combustion           thus transmitted by and through the sur-
                                      is
rounding mixture of dust and air with               rapidity regulated by the
                                                     a
inflammability of the dust, and by the proportion and state of division
in which      it   isdistributed through the air.           If rapidly burning
                                                                 a
mixture of     this  kind     confined, its combustion will be attended by
                             is
explosive effects, the degree of violence of which               determined by
                                                                  is
the combustibility of the dust, by the quantity of mixture ignited,
and the nature of its confinement. Its behaviour                   indeed quite
                                                                     is
similar   to  that  of   amixture   of inflammable   gas or vapour and of air               ;
at the instant of its ignition each dust-particle            to
                                                             is    more or less
                                                                       a
considerable extent converted into inflammable vapour, or                 at any is,
rate, surrounded by an envelope of burning vapour, so that                   the       if
particles   are  in  sufficiently  close  proximity  to each other,  the rapidly
 successive development of vapour from them as the flame spreads, gives
 rise to  a  condition of things very like that which obtains when an
 inflammable gas, or vapour, originally existing as such,                 mixed  is
with air.
      Even the most inflammable solid, in the form of dust, must be
mixed in large proportion with air, must, indeed, be present in the
 form of dense cloud, in order that the transmission of flame may
          a
 proceed continuously from the portion first ignited to surrounding
parts of the mixture.        A dense cloud of Lycopodium dust in air will
transmit flame with rapidity and violence throughout its whole extent,
but  if  the particles in the cloud be not in very close proximity, the
 application of flame to           will only produce short flashes in the

  vicinity of the source of flame, and the fire will not spread to surround-
  ing particles.
      The difficulty of maintaining, if only for a brief period, a
  sufficiently uniform and highly charged mixture of air with even a
  very light inflammable powder, to ensure the propagation of flame
  through   it, and the circumstance that, with powders which are not
 very highly and completely inflammable, only some portion of the
 combustible matter          actually burned when flame
                            is                                 applied to the
                                                                is
 mixture of dust and air, necessitate the presence of proportion of
                                                                 a
 dust more or less considerably exceeding that which            proportionate
                                                                 is

                                                                        is
 flame is   to be transmitted by the mixture.
      This condition    is not difficult of fulfilment in practical opera-
 tions in which inflammable dust           dealt with, and flame may con-
                                          is
 sequently     be  transmitted  upon      large scale through mixtures of
                                          a
 inflammable dusts and air, with        rapidity calculated to produce more
                                         a
 or less violently explosive effects, as has been demonstrated by many
accidents in works where manufacturing operations have been attended
 by the production and escape into the air of large quantities of
inflammable dust.       The accidental inflammation of sulphur dust in
chambers in which its pulverisation has been carried on, has given
rise to more than one considerable and somewhat violent explosion.
 Cotton mills have been known to become rapidly fired by the
ignition of, and transmission of flame by, mixtures of cotton dust and
air, and very quickly spreading conflagrations originating from dust-
explosions have occurred in other works dealing with even less
inflammable and dust-producing materials             thus at the Guarancine
                                                      ;
Mills, at Sorgues, an explosion occurred in 1878, consequent upon the
ignition of   a   mixture of air with the dust of that substance.         But
the most numerous and extensive             calamities connected with the
accidental ignition of mixtures of light inflammable dust and air have
occurred in flour- and rice-mills.
      The cause of many disastrous explosions and fires which occurred
in flour mills at Budapest in Hungary, at Frideat in Germany, in other
parts of the Continent, and in England, prior to 1872, appeared
enveloped in much mystery, until Dr. Watson Smith directed attention
to the fact that an Austrian observer had apparently traced their
origin to the ignition, by flame or some incandescent body (such as
sparks produced by the millstones), of mixtures of air and the dust of
meal and husks formed during the grinding of corn or subsequent
treatment of flour.      The occurrence of very serious explosion and
                                                  a
fire at the Tradeston Flour Mills in Glasgow, in January 1872, caused
that gentleman to direct public attention to what appeared the true
explanation of these disasters, and on the occasion of that catastrophe,
when several persons were killed and            number injured, the subject
                                                 a
was carefully investigated by Messrs. Rankin and Macadam.                The
origin of the explosion was conclusively traced to the striking of fire
by a    pair of millstones, through the stopping of the feed, and the

 90                           Mr. F. A. Abel                     [April  28,
consequent    friction of their bare surfaces against each other ; the
results being, the ignition of the mixture of air and fine flour-dust by
which the millstones were surrounded, and the rapid communication
of flame thereby to the mixture of dust and air which filled the
conduits in communication with the exhaust box : this being the
common receptacle into which the mixture of dust and air is drawn,
by an exhaust fan, through the conduits communicating with the several
mills. From the exhaust box, where a portion of the suspended flour-
dust was deposited, the air, still laden with dust, passed, in the
Tradeston as in other flour mills, to another chamber, called the
stive room, where a further quantity of the flour dust would deposit.
A connected series of channels and larger enclosed spaces was there-
fore filled with a dust-laden atmosphere, through which flame was so
rapidly transmitted from the millstones where the first ignition
occurred as to produce violent explosive effects, which succeeded
each other with very great rapidity in different parts of the building.
The production of the blaze at the millstones was observed to be
immediately succeeded by a crackling noise as the flame rapidly
spread through the conduits to the exhaust box upon an upper floor,
whence a loud report almost at once proceeded.
     Messrs. Rankin and Macadam's inquiries elicited the facts that
other flour-mill explosions had been attended by a similar succession
of effects to those above indicated, and that at the Tradeston Mills
themselves a less violent explosion, resulting in the bursting open of
an exhaust box, attended by injury to some workmen, and the blowing
out of windows and loosening of tiles, had taken place on a previous
occasion.    In the later accident, the more violent explosion of the
exhaust box was followed by other distinct explosions in distant parts of
those extensive mills, to which fire was led by the dust-laden air existing
in the many channels of communication, and in which the cleansing and
sifting operations, all attended by the escape of dust, were carried on.
     Messrs. Rankin and Macadam ascertained that accidents of this
nature at flour mills were of frequent occurrence, especially since the
exhaust arrangements had been applied to the larger flour mills, and
in their report they point out that it seems scarcely possible to guard
against such accidents, though their frequency may be reduced by
adopting efficient precautions for avoiding the stoppage of the feed
to the millstones and the access of nails or other iron particles to
the stones; and by prohibiting the employment of naked lights in
                                                 '
the vicinity of the mills or dust passages.        They also suggest that
measures should be taken to reduce, as far as possible, the violence of
explosions and the risk of injury to life and property, by constructing
all receptacles into which the dust-laden air is drawn or passed from
the mills, &c, as lightly as possible, so as to offer little resistance to
the sudden expansion due to the ignition of an inflammable mixture,
and by placing such receptacles as the exhaust box and stive room
outside the building.
     Since the publication of Messrs. Rankin and Macadam's valuable

 1882.]       on Some  of the Dangerous  Properties of Dusts.              91
 report, the accidents at flour mills appear, however, to have been
 scarcely less numerous or disastrous than before the date of the
 Tradeston catastrophe.     Thus, in September 1874, a similar though
less serious explosion occurred at the Port Dundas City Mills, and in
May 1878, another flour-mill explosion, quite unparalleled for its
destructive effects, occurred at Minneapolis,           Minnesota, where
eighteen lives were lost and six distinct corn mills were destroyed.
Mr. Peckham, writing after the event from the University at Min-
neapolis, states that two dull explosions rapidly succeeding each other
were heard by him, and on looking towards the manufacturing part of
the city a large volume of black smoke was seen to envelop the
spot where the Washburn A Mill stood, a column of smoke being at
the same time projected to a height of several hundred feet.        A storm
was blowing at the time in the direction from the Washburn Mill to
other mills in the neighbourhood, and in about five minutes from the
time that the explosion was heard five neighbouring mills, with
adjoining premises, were in flames.        Persons who were in close
vicinity to the scene of the calamity at the time of the first explosion
heard a succession of sharp hissing sounds, doubtless caused by the
very rapid spread of flame through the dust-laden air in the passages
leading from the mills to the exhaust box, and, at the instant of the
explosion, the Washburn A Mill was observed to be brilliantly illu-
minated from top to bottom.        The nearest mill to the latter was
25 feet distant, and appears to have exploded directly the flames
burst through the first mill. The explosion of a third, 25 feet
distant from the second, followed almost immediately ; and the
other three mills, about 150 feet distant in another direction,
were at once fired.   Windows were thrown out of buildings about a
quarter of a mile distant, consequent upon the back rush of air
following the explosion, and portions of the building materials were
projected to very considerable distances.     The cause of the explosion
was carefully inquired into (by Messrs. Pick, Peckham, &c), and it
was attributed to fire being generated by the stoppage of the feed to
a pair of stones, or by the accidental passage of some very hard
substance between them.       The consequent explosion of dust-and-
air mixture round the stones and in the communicating passages
added, by its concussion, to the quantity of dust suspended in the air
in different parts of the mill, and a second more violent explosion
was thus immediately brought about.          The attention of Professor
Lawrence Smith was directed to the subject of flour-mill explosions by
this accident, and, in a letter to M. Dumas, of May 4th, 1878, which
was published in the ' Annales de Chimie et Physique,' he states his
conviction, based upon experimental inquiry, that such accidents are
due to the formation of explosive mixtures of finely divided organic
matters (such as flour) with the air, and refers to this as a " revelation
                                                                            "
of the existence of a previously unknown danger connected with an
important industry, being apparently unaware of its elucidation by
Rankiu and Macadam, and Watson Smith in 1872.

92                            Mr. F. A. Abel                     [April   28,
     Attention has again been recently directed to this subject of flour-
dust explosions by a fatal and extensive calamity of the kind which
occurred at a flour mill at Macclesfield in September 1881, and has
been made the subject of an interesting report to the Home Secretary
by Mr. T. J. Richards, of the Board of Trade, in which he confirms
the conclusions of Messrs, Rankin and Macadam, and repeats the
recommendations made by them.
     In this particular case, again, there appears to have been no doubt
that the inflammation of the dust-and-air mixture surrounding a
particular pair of millstones was due to the stones remaining empty
for some time, sufficient heat being consequently developed to ignite
some portions of flour dust existing between the bearing surfaces.
One of the owners of this mill deposed that he had seen flame pro-
duced by stones when remaining empty, and that the appearance of
the stones in question convinced him that flame had been thus
produced. A very dry grain was, moreover, being ground at the time
of the explosion. A strong consensus of opinion appears to exist that
it is very difficult, with the best arrangements for feeding the mill-
stones with grain, to guard against their running empty occasionally,
and there is no doubt that on these occasions portions of flour are
exposed to heat sufficiently great to char and sometimes even to ignite
them.     In connection with this effect of the heat to which portions
of flour may be exposed between " dry " stones, the opinion of an
"experienced person" (quoted as a regrettable one by Mr. Richards)
deserves not to be lost sight of.    It is to the effect that a stive room
can at all times be safely entered with a naked light " except when
there is observed the peculiar odour which is noticed there when one
of the millstones has been previously running empty." It is not
difficult to demonstrate that fine flour very thickly suspended in air
will produce with the latter an inflammable mixture, through which
flame will be rapidly transmitted ; there is also no doubt that     if,as  is
frequently the case, the enclosed dust-and-air mixture in the air-
passages of  a    millis   somewhat warm, the propagation of flame
through the mixture will be facilitated.       But experimental observa-
tions which the lecturer has had occasion to make in connection with
another branch of the subject of this discourse, lead him to consider
it not impossible that the development of even very small quantities
of inflammable gas or vapour from flour particles which become
                         " stones to an
heated between " dry                      extent to be charred, may, in
some cases, decidedly facilitate the propagation of flame by      a  parti-
cular mixture of dust and air, which might otherwise only be bordering
 upon an explosive mixture.
     Mr. Richards calls attention, in an appendix to his report, to four
very disastrous fires which had occurred in flour mills at Wakefield,
 York, Liverpool, and Deptford, within two months of the completion
of his report, the origin of the fire being in each case unknown.
There  is   no doubt that the number of fires occurring in corn- and
rice-mills, the origin of which  is wrapped in obscurity,   is very great   ;

and it is stated upon good authority that only about 20 per cent, of
the explosions in flour mills which can be actually substantiated, are
made public, the miller being unwilling to direct increased attention
to the risks of his business, which, as it             is,
                                                         have given rise to the
establishment of high      rates  of  insurance    upon corn mills.           If
                                                                           efficient
measures can be adopted in mills for preventing the dispersion of
fine flour-dust by other than the comparatively imperfect contri-
vances for promoting its partial deposition (as in the exhaust box
and stive room), flour-mill explosions will certainly be reduced in
frequency and importance.           The efficiency of at any rate one simple
device for arresting the dust, by            a  species of filtration of the air
which    isremoved from the millstone chambers, seems to have been
already decisively demonstrated by practical results, and there appears
reason to hope that the millowner will ere long have no valid excuse
for permitting      acontinuance of conditions favourable to what have
appeared to be hidden risks of danger to his property and to the
lives of those whom he employs.
     There appears no doubt that some instances of explosion or of
very rapidly spreading fire in flour mills have been ascribable to
the employment — accidentally, or with the permission of those in
authority —of naked lights in the vicinity of particular parts of the
factory where dust may be thrown into the air in large quantities. An
explosion from this cause occurred at the mills of Messrs. Ellis and
Co., of Bradford.      A spout from         a sieve having become choked,          a
man removed the lid        ;   quantity of dust at once flew out, and the
                               a
mixture, meeting either          lamp in the man's hand or
                                  a                                     naked gas

driving   a blast  of  air   into  five   purifying chambers       these purifiers
                                                                      ;
were fired simultaneously, and the explosion then passed to the
adjacent exhaust purifiers and thence to the dust room, so that the
mill was fired throughout almost immediately. In another instance,
the floor of  ameal chamber broke, letting through the flour, which, on
falling into the air, was ignited by flame in the vicinity, and speedily
                                            a
fired the mill. Judging from statements made at recent meeting of a
the National Association of British and Irish Millers, the opinion                 is
entertained by many millowners that the running of millstones
empty must not be credited with too great             a share in the origination
of explosions or fires in mills; but that many are caused by the
so-called     accidental ignition (by naked flames) of dust-and-air
mixtures.     If such be the case, grave responsibilities are incurred by
millowners     and managers who permit the existence of lights other
than safety  lamps in localities where there      any possibility of
                                                             is                    a
considerable quantity of dust becoming suspended in the air, or do
not establish and strictly enforce regulations prohibiting the carrying
of naked lights in or near any working part of the mill.

less abundance in all coal-mine workings, in aggravating and extending

the injurious effects of fire-damp explosions, was originally pointed
out with great force by Messrs. Faraday and Lyell, in the report which
they submitted to the Home Secretary, in 1845, on the explosion at the
Has well Collieries in September 1844, and on the means of preventing
similar accidents.    It does not come within the scope of this dis-
course to examine into the chief part of this most interesting and
instructive report, which deals exhaustively with the cause of the
explosion and the means of guarding against the recurrence of such a
calamity ; but the lecturer, having had occasion to study carefully
 what has been published on the subject of coal-mine explosions and
their causes within the last three years, cannot forbear pointing out
that the observations and conclusions published by Faraday and Lyell
thirty-seven years ago have been repeatedly re-clothed with the garb
of originality by workers who have but extended and amplified the
original observations of those eminent men.
      After discussing the subject of the accumulation of fire-damp in
 the goaves of the mines, its dislodgement by the drawing of juds, by
falls of the roofs in the goaves, and by changes in atmospheric pressure,
 its diffusion into the surrounding air in the mine ways, its ignition
 by a defective lamp, and the spreading of the flame to the gas-
 mixture with which the goaf was charged, the reporters say : " In
 considering the extent of the fire from the moment of the explosion,
 it is not to be supposed the fire-damp was its only fuel ; the coal dust
 swept by the rush of wind and flame from the floor, roof, and walls of
 the works would instantly take fire and burn, if there were oxygen
 enough present in the air to support its combustion ; and we found the
 dust adhering to the faces of the pillars, props, and walls in the direc-
 tion of and on the side towards the explosion, increasing gradually to a
 certain distance as we neared the place of ignition.      This deposit was
 in some parts half an inch, in others almost an inch thick ; it adhered
  together in a friable coked state. When examined with the glass it
  presented the fused round form of burnt coal dust, and when examined
 chemically and compared with the coal itself reduced to powder, was
 found deprived of the greater portion of the bitumen, and in some
  instances entirely destitute of it. There is every reason to believe
 that much coal gas was made from this dust in the very air itself of
  the mine, by the flame of the fire-damp, which raised and swept it
  along, and much of the carbon of this dust remained unburnt only
  for want of air.
      " At first we were greatly embarrassed by the circumstance of the
  large number of deaths from choke-damp, and in the evidence that
  that had been present in very considerable quantities compared with
  the small proportion of fire-damp, which, in the opinion of those in
  and about the works just before, must have occasioned the explosion.
   But, on consideration of the character of the goaves as reservoirs
  for gaseous fuel, and the effect of dust in the mine, we are satisfied that
  these circumstances fully account for the apparent discrepancy."
       On January 17th, 1845, Faraday delivered a discourse to the

1882.]        on Some    of the Dangerous Properties of Dusts.          95
members of the Royal Institution, in which he dealt with the substance
of the above report, and with the experimental inquiry made by
himself with reference to the provision of means for preventing a
recurrence of such disasters as that at Haswell.     In a brief account of
this lecture published in the number of the Athenceum following its
delivery, the substance of his remarks relating to the effect of coal-
dust is given in these words : " The ignition and explosion of the
(fire-damp) mixture would raise and then kindle the coal dust which
is always pervading the passages, and these effects must in a moment
have made the part of the mine which was the scene of the calamity
glow like a furnace."
     The report of Faraday and Lyell was published in the ' Philo-
                       '
sophical Magazine for January 1845, and was followed by a letter
from Faraday in the February number of the same publication, in
which he referred to the lecture just delivered at the Royal Institu-
tion, and made further suggestions with respect to the method of
ventilating the mines suggested in the report. But it appears that
these publications remained long unknown in France, for in 1855
M. du Souich, Chief Government Mining Engineer of the Saint Etienne
arrondissement, when referring to an explosion which had occurred at
Firminy, advanced, as new, the view that the deposition of crusts of a
light coke upon the props was due to dust which was swept up and
transported to a distance by the violent current produced by the ex-
plosion, and which, being in part inflamed, would carry on and pro-
long the effects of the fire-damp. The fact that men near the pit's
 mouth received burns and other injuries, while others who were in
 workings near the seat of the explosion, but out of the main air-
 current, escaped unhurt, was ascribed by him to this ignition and
 carriage of flame by dust.        Had the results of the explosion been
entirely   due  to the   mine   being highly charged with gas, the explo-
 sion must, he considered, have extended to those portions.         On the
 occasion of two explosions in 1861, M. du Souich again dwelt upon
 his views regarding the part played by coal-dust in increasing the
 disastrous effects of fire-damp explosions. In 1864-67, M. Verpilleux
instituted experiments which led him to the conclusion that coal dust
 plays an important part in coal-mine explosions ; the subject was
 also pursued by several other French mining engineers at about the
 same time, and especially by M. Vital, who made some experiments
 on a small scale, in 1875, in connection with an inquiry into the
 nature and cause of an explosion which had occurred the year before
 at the Campagnac Colliery, and in a part where no fire-damp had
 ever been detected.       An examination for gas had been made by the
 overman with a Mueseler lamp just before a shot was fired, and after
 the first shot, a second shot was prepared, and the fuze having been
 ignited, the men retreated, when, after a short interval, an explosion
 took place, and the men stated that they saw a body of reddish flame
 advancing upon them.        After examining the nature of dust collected
 in the mine, and instituting some special experiments upon a very

  small scale for the purpose of ascertaining whether, and to what extent,
  the flame from a small charge of powder was lengthened, when pro-
 jected, like the flame from a blown-out shot, into air containing fine
  coal dust in suspension, M. Vital concluded that very fine coal dust,
  very rich in volatile (inflammable) constituents, will take fire when
  raised by an explosion, and that portions of the coal are successively
  decomposed, yielding explosive mixtures with the air, whereby the
  fire is carried along ; the intensity or violence of the burning being
  much influenced by the physical characters (fineness, &c.) of the
  dust.    He also pointed out that an explosion of fire-damp, while
  taking place almost instantaneously, inflames or decomposes a small
  quantity of coal dust raised thereby ; explosive action being thus
 propagated after the fire-damp explosion has ceased.          Soon after
 M. Vital's investigation of the subject, Mr. W. Galloway commenced a
 series of valuable experiments upon a larger scale, with the view of
 investigating the influence of coal dust in colliery explosions, and the
 results were communicated by him to the Eoyal Society in two papers
 in 1876 and 1879. The conclusions to which Mr. Galloway was led
 by the experiments described in his first paper, were to the effect that
 a mixture of air and a particular coal dust which had been made the
 subject of chemical examination and practical experiment was not
 inflammable at the ordinary pressure and temperature, but that the
 presence of a very small proportion of fire-damp in the air, the exist-
ence of which could not be detected with the Davy lamp by the most
 experienced observer, rendered this dust inflammable, and caused it
to burn freely with a red, smoky flame.         From this it was inferred
that an explosion, when originated in any way whatever in a dry and
dusty mine, may extend itself to remote parts of the workings, where
the presence of fire-damp was quite unsuspected.
      In his second paper, Mr. Galloway shows that the return air of a
fiery mine which, though furnishing no indication of the presence of
gas when examined in the usual way (by means of a Davy safety
lamp), might in his opinion contain from 2 to 2*5 per cent., may
be rendered inflammable by suspending coal dust in it.           He also
described experiments by which it appeared to be demonstrated that
the flame produced by the explosion of fire-damp in a particular part
of a mine might be propagated, at any rate to some extent, by coal-
dust raised by the explosion and suspended in the air travelling through
the mine, even in the complete absence of fire-damp in the air.       The
apparatus used by Mr. Galloway was constructed on a somewhat exten-
sive scale.     In connection with the channel or gallery through which
a current of air, with or without coal dust in suspension was passed, was
a receptacle in which a mixture of pit gas (from Llwynpia Colliery)
and of air was prepared and exploded.          The direct communication
between the gas vessel and the gallery (representing a mine way) was
only interrupted by a diaphragm composed of from two to six leaves
of newspaper ; this separator being burst through by the explosion of
a mixture of nearly two cubic feet of fire-damp with the requisite pro-

 portion of air. The coal dust was placed 011 the floor of the gallery
 and upon certain shelves fixed in it.   It appeared open to question
 whether, with the employment of this apparatus, there was not a
possibility of very small quantities of fire-damp penetrating, before
the explosion, into the gallery from the explosive chamber, through
 the closing arrangement     above alluded to, and whether the results
obtained in the gallery might, consequently, be accepted as produced
solely by the effect of the concussion produced and flame promoted
by the gas explosion in the separate chamber.
     In a paper just communicated to the Eoyal Society, Mr. Galloway
argues that any amount of gas which may thus escape into the gallery
must be altogether insignificant as regards any possible influence
upon the results obtained.
     The conclusion now arrived at by Mr. Galloway, as the result of
continued experiments with this apparatus, of which he has just given
a further account, and of his examination into the effects produced by
the Penygraig explosion in December 1880, and the Risca and
Seaham explosions of that year, is confirmatory of that published
by him last year, namely, that the very decided view which he first
held, " that a mixture of air and coal-dust is not inflammable at
ordinary pressure and temperature without the presence of a small
proportion of fire-damp," has not been borne out by his further
                                                          "
experiments, as he considers that he has now shown          conclusively
that fire-damp is altogether unnecessary for the propagation of flame
with explosive effects by a mixture of coal dust and air," when the
scale on which the experiments are made is large enough, and when
the fineness and dryness of the dust are " unquestionable."
     This conclusion coincides in the main with that arrived at in 1878,
as the result of experiments by Professor Freire Marreco, conducted
in connection with the North of England Institute of Mining and
Mechanical Engineers, which Society, as well as the Chesterfield and
Derbyshire Institute of Engineers, has laboured very usefully in this
direction cotemporaneously with Mr. Galloway.         The most recent
conclusions of the latter in respect to coal dust were in fact fore-
stalled by those which the late lamented Professor Marreco in asso-
ciation with Mr. P. D. Morison communicated to the first-named
Institute in November 1878, and which were published in its Trans-
actions  of that date.
     Messrs. Marreco and Morison's experiments were carried out in
galleries or long boxes, representing mine workings, though on a
smaller scale than Mr. Galloway's later apparatus, and constructed
somewhat differently in their details.     The apparatus used by them
at Harton Colliery            with which  experiments  have since been
                       (and
continued by Messrs. Lindsay Wood and G. May), was in fact a
double gallery, so arranged that the air current which passed into
one gallery made its exit at the end of the second, alongside the
point of its first entrance.    The mode of proceeding was to fire suc-
cessively two powder shots, in different positions in the gallery box,

from small cannon, so as to represent blown-out shots in the effects
produced ; coal dust was placed upon the floor of the box, and one
shot was first fired against the air current which was passing at a
known velocity.       The dust cloud thereby raised was carried along by
the current and a second shot was fired into        it, and, in a large number
of experiments made with many different descriptions of dust, the
flame produced by the second shot was increased by that of inflamed
dust, a   comparatively clear flame being sometimes produced, while in
other instances   it  was accompanied by     a  shower of sparks. The view
taken by Vital, Marreco, and others, regarding the action of coal-
dust in propagating flame in air free from fire-damp,           is to the effect
that the first portions of dust acted upon by the inflamed gases of the
shot, liberate inflammable gas which mixes with the air, and                fired,
                                                                             is
the non-volatile part of the coal being in part consumed and in part
deposited as feeble coke. Some examination of coked deposits of dust
              a
 sent to Marreco subsequently by Mr. Galloway, confirmed the obser-
vations originally made by Faraday and Lyell, that the coal dust                 in
                                                                                  is
part   submitted   to  destructive   distillation  during  the  progress  of   the
flame through the dust-laden air. Marreco considers that, although                     a
proportion of the heat developed by the burning dust                absorbed by
                                                                   is
the gasification of the coal-constituents, the heat of combustion of
these suffices to leave    a margin for the carrying on of the action from
 one particle     of  dust  to  another, provided these be in sufficiently
 close proximity to each other.
      In the experiments made by the Chesterfield and Derbyshire
 Institute of Engineers, in     a  very long gallery, results were obtained
 very   similar to  those  of  Marreco   and Morison, and     it was also found
 thata    lengthening of   a   gas flame, which was placed in the gallery,
 could be obtained by causing the current of air to carry with               thick
                                                                             it
 clouds of some descriptions of coal dust.
      Many instances are on record in this country and others of the
 firing, with semi-explosive violence, of clouds of coal dust, produced
 either in the open air, or in localities where no fire-damp could exist,
 some portions of the mixture of dust and air having come into contact
 with a   flame or fire.    Thus Marreco and Morison mention              case of
                                                                            a
a    considerable quantity of coal dust, which had been accidentally
thrown over some screens at         a pit's mouth, flashing into flame as the
dust cloud came into contact with neighbouring fire, and burning

drift, where   it    was believed that no gas could possibly be present.
A considerable body of rock was dislodged and coal dust raised
by the firing of       a shot, the flame of which fired the air-and-dust
mixture, with very mischievous results. From 50,000 to 60,000 cubic
feet of fresh air were said to be passing through the drift per minute
when this accident occurred.
      There appear good grounds for believing that, provided coal dust
be sufficiently fine and thickly suspended in the air, and of            readily
                                                                            a
 inflammable nature, fire may travel to       a   considerable distance in the

 working of   a mine, through its agency, in the complete absence of fire-
 damp.     The effects of transmission of flame in this way would be
 decidedly different, and much inferior in violence, to those produced
 by an explosion of fire-damp and air, or of a mixture of these
 with coal dust ; the comparative           suddenness of the gas explosion
 would produce greater destruction and less burning effects than the
 comparatively gradual explosion, or the rapid burning of a dust-and-
 air-mixture.    In the latter case, the coal dust will generally be con-
 siderably in excess of the air needed for its combustion, so that,
 however finely divided, much will escape being burned, and may be
 only very partially coked, and it is conceivable that, as suggested by
 Mr. Galloway, a second rapid burning or semi- explosion may be caused
by the inrush of air, following the first explosion, into the workings,
which may be thick with heated and only partially burned dust,
some of which may still be incandescent.
     Considering that, since first Faraday and Lyell directed attention
to the dangers of coal dust in mines, its behaviour has been made the
subject of many series of experiments and published reports here and
abroad, it is remarkable that in most instances of coal-mine explosions,
until quite recently, the probable effect of coal dust in increasing their
magnitude does not appear to have received the serious attention
which it merits at the hands of mine owners and of those in authority
connected with coal mines. When the Eoyal Commission on Accidents
in Mines was appointed, it collected evidence from H.M. inspectors
of mines, from experienced colliery owners and mining engineers, and
from selected pitmen, with respect to the causes of accidents, and that
evidence included several statements regarding the possible influence
of coal dust in aggravating explosions, but the preponderance of
opinion of H.M. inspectors was against the view that explosions could
originate with, or be to any great extent propagated by coal dust in
the absence of fire-damp.         The only experiment on a practical scale
bearing upon the subject which appears to have been made until quite
recently is that of Mr. H. Hall, Mine Inspector of the N. Wales, &c,
District, who, in firing charges of 4 lb. of powder from a cannon in
an adit driven about 50 yards from the surface in a coal seam on the
dip, coal dust being sprinkled upon the floor, obtained flame extending
to distances of 30 to 60 yards, while without the dust the flame of the
shot did not extend more than 6 or 7 yards.*            Some decided opinions
were expressed that the supposed influence of coal dust in aggravating
explosions was over-rated, and that it would certainly not lead to
explosions in the absence of gas. On the other hand, Mr. Galloway
expressed a strong opinion that some of the most extensive of recent
explosions, such as those at Llan and Abercarne, were at any
rate largely contributed to by coal dust, and more recently, on the
occasion of the inquiry into the Penygraig explosion, he gave evidence
                            the air in this adit was " practically " free from gas,

to the effect that the disastrous results of this explosion were mainly
if not entirely ascribable to the action of coal dust, supporting this
opinion by the results of a minute examination into the condition of
the pit, of the sufferers, &c, after the accident.
      When the terrible calamity which occurred at Seaham Colliery in
September 1880, was officially inquired into, the suggestion was very
decidedly put forward by the miners' representatives, that the coal dust
which existed in large quantities in some parts of the mine, and
especially near the spot where it was surmised that the explosion
had originated, might have had much to do with the accident.        Indeed
the opinion was strongly entertained by some that it was entirely due
to the ignition of coal dust, in the absence of gas, by the flame from
a blown-out shot.      The lecturer was consequently requested by the
Home Secretary to make experiments with samples of dust collected
 in different parts of the mine, and the results obtained with them
led to an extension of experiments with dust from other collieries
in different parts of the kingdom.       These experiments, carried to a
 certain point for the immediate purpose of the Seaham inquiry, have
 been interrupted for some time, but the Eoyal Commission has now
 resumed them with the object of obtaining more precise data in
 connection with certain results which were elicited by the first part
 of the investigation.
      The earlier experiments were carried on at the Garswood Hall
 Colliery, where a constant and abundant supply of pit gas (a so-called
 blower) is brought to the surface, and was kindly placed at the service
 of the Commission by Messrs. Smethurst and Co., together with many
 conveniences, for the purposes of these and other important experiments
 upon which they have been engaged. The apparatus used at Garswood
 for the experiments with the Seaham and other dusts, was similar in
 character to those employed by Freire Marreco, Galloway, and others,
 great pains being taken to secure accuracy and uniformity in the
 velocity of the air currents passing through the gallery, in the pro-
 portion of pit-gas, or fire-damp, used with the air, and in the intimacy
  of the mixture. In order to raise the air current in the gallery to a
  temperature similar to that of the atmosphere in colliery workings,
  the air supply was drawn through a system of heated pipes, so that,
  when passing at as high a velocity as 1000 feet per minute, its tempera-
  ture would be raised up to 80° or 85° F. even in the very severe
  weather during which some of these experiments were made.
      The samples of coal dust experimented with were examined with
  respect to fineness, proportions of volatile matter and ash, and one or
  two other points, and they were all carefully dried before use.
      Experiments were made in the first instance with a view of
  ascertaining the smallest proportion of fire-damp which, when mixed
  with the air passing through the apparatus, would furnish an
  atmosphere capable of firing at a naked flame of a particular size,
  placed in the gallery.    It was next ascertained what quantity of gas
  below that proportion was needed to impart to the mixture of air with

 1882.]        on Some   of the Dangerous Properties of Dusts.        101
 a  large quantity of each particular coal dust the property of exploding
 throughout the gallery.        By these experiments the samples were
 classed in the order of their sensitiveness to explosion, and it was
 found that those which were very rich in pure coal, and which
 contained the highest proportion of very fine dust were the most
 sensitive, i. e. required the lowest proportions of fire-damp in air to
 bring them to explode readily when suspended in a dense cloud. But
 with the samjjles containing larger proportions of non-combustible
 matter the order of sensitiveness did not necessarily harmonise with
 the comparative richness of a sample in pure coal, nor with its com-
 parative fineness, and this was strikingly illustrated by a sample of
 dust from one of the roads in Seaham Colliery, which contained more
 than half its weight of non-combustible matter, yet ranked only third
in order of sensitiveness, while another sample, containing considerably
more coal and a somewhat larger proportion of the finer dust, ranked
fifth.
      Another point clearly established, and confirming by more accurate
data the observations of earlier experiments, was, that the proportion
 of fire-damp required in a mine to bring dust into operation as a
 readily exploding material when thickly suspended in the air is
bordering upon and even below the smallest amount which can be
detected in the atmosphere of a mine, by the most practised observer,
 with the use of the Davy lamp, the only means of searching for gas
which has until quite recently been employed in mines. The highest
proportion which can be thus detected by an experienced operator is
stated to be about 2 per cent.        Explosions were produced by dusts
suspended in air travelling at a velocity of 600 feet per minute, when
fire-damp was present in proportions ranging from to 2 to 2*75 per
cent. ; in currents of low velocity the same result was produced with a
sensitive dust in the presence of only 1*5 per cent, of fire-damp, and
ignitions which approached explosions in their nature and extended to
 considerable distances, were obtained with this dust in air containing
still smaller proportions of gas. Mixtures of fire-damp and air
bordering upon those which will ignite upon the approach of flame,
were found to be instantaneously fired by a lamp if they contained only
a few particles of dust in suspension, and in connection with this fact
the interesting observation was made that such dust particles need not
be inflammable nor combustible to produce the result named.     Mixtures
of air and gas which passed a naked flame without any symptom of
ignition, were inflamed when particles of a fine light powder, such as
calcined magnesia were suspended in them. The action of certain of
the pit dusts which contain comparatively little coal, in determining
the ignition of mixtures of air and small proportions of fire-damp, is
possibly of the same character as the behaviour of such a dust as
calcined magnesia. The power of favouring the ignition of mixtures of
fire-damp and air was not exhibited by some other powders similar in

even different samples of magnesia, differing somewhat in lightness
from each other, appeared to possess the activity in different degrees.
These facts seem to favour the view that a dust possessing par-
ticular physical characteristics exerts a contact- or catalytic action
upon gas mixtures, similar to that known to be possessed by platinum
and some other substances under particular conditions.      Thus, when
finely divided platinum, or even a clean recently heated surface
of the compact metal is brought into contact with mixtures of
hydrogen, or of a hydrocarbon gas or vapour, with oxygen or air,
oxidation of the hydrogen or hydrocarbon is at once established,
accompanied by the development of heat, whereby the temperature
of the metal is raised and chemical activity promoted, so that heat
speedily accumulates, raising the metal to a temperature sufficiently
high to bring the surrounding gas-mixture to the exploding point.
If the metal presents a very large surface, or is in a specially porous
condition, as in the form of sponge or very fine powder (platinum
black), the explosion of the gas-mixture may follow very rapidly, or
almost instantly, upon the first contact of some portion with it.*
     In many of the experiments with calcined magnesia just referred
to, it was distinctly noticed that a dark space intervened between the
gas flame used as the source of heat and the flare produced by the
ignition of the gas mixture through the influence of the dust cloud
suspended in    it,
                  which would seem to indicate that the dust particles,
immediately upon passing through the flame, established some amount
of oxidation of the fire-damp, which proceeded with increased rapidity
as the dust became more highly heated through the chemical action
developed, so that within     short distance from the point where the
                              a
heating commenced the dust became incandescent, and the ignition of
the gas-mixture followed.      Further experiments which are contem-
plated may elucidate the precise nature of this action of non-com-
bustible dust in promoting the ignition of gas-mixtures which, in the
absence of dust, are not inflammable         there appears little doubt,

     Numerous experiments similar to those of Marreco and Mori son
were made by the lecturer at Wigan with mixtures of air and coal-
dust from Seaham and other collieries, in the complete absence of

bearing special reference to the existence of explosive gas mixtures in coal mines.
The one consists in an apparatus proposed by Mr. Korner for removing, by slow
combustion, local accumulations of fire-damp   ;   the otheris   avery simple and
portable photometric apparatus, devised by Mr. G. H. Liveing, by which pro-

fire-damp,   which were passed through the apparatus at different
velocities up to 1000 feet per minute. Small cannon, specially
constructed to ensure uniformity in the volume of flame produced at
different times, were fired in them, either singly or in pairs in rapid
succession ; and exposed heaps of guncotton and of slow- and quick-
burning gunpowder were exploded in the dust-laden air. The results
occasionally confirmed to some extent those of Marreco and Morison and
the Chesterfield experiments.    At velocities of 400 feet per minute the
dust, which was either passing at the time or was raised by the con-
cussion of a first shot, did not appear to produce any increase in the
volume of flame furnished by the cannon, but a decided though incon-
siderable lengthening of the flame was several times observed at higher
velocities and with the employment of the most inflammable dusts.
Some of these, when thickly suspended in air travelling at velocities
of 500 to 1000 feet per minute, and exposed to the action of a large
flash of flame (as produced by the loose heaps of guncotton and
blasting powder), exhibited a tendency not only to burn explosively in
and close around the flame, but also to propagate flame, or cause it to
travel along some distance ; but the most decisive results of these
experiments were not of a nature to warrant the conclusion that
flame could be carried along indefinitely, or even to a very consider-
able distance, by coal dust in the complete absence of fire-damp, as
now maintained by Mr. Galloway.         There can be no question that
the scale of magnitude upon which the first ignition in the dust-laden
atmosphere is produced must greatly influence the extent to which
the propagation of flame in this way will extend, and Mr. Galloway's
experiments at Llwynpia, therefore, were likely to develop conditions
more nearly approaching those of the real state of things in a mine
than experiments in galleries of smaller dimensions, and with small
initiating volumes of flame. But the necessity for caution in de-
ducting very decided conclusions from even large-scale experiments,
appears to be illustrated by some of Mr. Galloway's results, inasmuch
as some of the great distances to which the flame extended were
observed under conditions decidedly favourable to the projection of the
flame by causes which would not come into play in the same way in
a mine-working.       The experiments made some years ago by Mr.
Hall in an adit (which have already been referred to) appear to have
a more direct bearing upon results likely to be actually produced
underground in a dust-laden atmosphere.        In those experiments, the
extreme distance to which flame was carried by dust, first ignited by
the flame from a very excessive charge of powder (4 lb.), was 180 feet.
It is of course possible that the coal used was not of the most
inflammable description, and that its fineness and density were not
most favourable to its becoming very thickly suspended in air.        On
the other hand, Mr. Hall stated, in his evidence before the Royal
                                                                        "

generally considerable, but it appears that exaggerated estimates are
entertained of the distance to which, in the absence of dust, the flame
will be projected, and it is probable that the large volumes of flame,
extending occasionally to many yards from the spot where the shot
was fired, are in a great measure due to the ignition of dust raised by
the concussion and rush of air at the instant of firing.                   Mr. Hall, in
his experiments in the adit, found that the flame from the shot of
4 lb. of powder reached to a distance of only 18 to 21 feet when
no dust was present.            A few monthfjf ago that official directed the
attention of the lecturer to the occurrence of two accidents in the
Liverpool district, each one occasioned by a shot of 1 lb. of powder
blowing out its stemming without shaking or bringing down any
coal.      In both instances the shot lighter and two pitmen had retired
about 100 feet from the seat of the shot, that is, about 30 feet in a
straight line with       it,  and 60 to 80 feet along both directions of               a
working running at right angles to the drift in the face of which the
charge was fired. In the case of one accident,                      a man was killed,
and serious injuries were sustained by the other men in both
instances.        There were signs of charring upon the props up to,
and   5     or  6   feet beyond, where the men were standing, but they
did not extend farther.            The drift and the level in which these
accidents occurred were          5    feet high and 12 feet wide.               Mr. Hall
informed the lecturer that              a   strong impression existed among
mining men on the spot that the flame of the shot, quite unaided
 by gas or coal-dust (the latter was known to be present), would
 have extended so as to produce the effects described.                   This appeared
 so at variance with Mr. Hall's experiments in an underground
 working, and with Mr. Abel's own experience in other directions,
 that the latter has endeavoured                to obtain some precise experi-
 mental data with regard to the distance to which any burning
 effect from        a blown-out charge of      1  lb. or    1
                                                            J  lb. of powder would
 extend     in  a mine-working,     in  the absence    of   dust.     With this object
 he availed himself of the friendly assistance of Major Durnford,
 E.E., Instructor in Field Fortifications at the School of Military
 Engineering, Chatham, under whose direction Lieutenant Kaban has
 carried out an instructive series of experiments in accordance with
 suggestions made by Mr. Abel as the work proceeded.
       The locality selected for the first experiments formed portion of    a
 some obsolete fortifications at Chatham, and consisted of                  a     masonry
 gallery     or Caponier, 8   feet8   inches  high   to  the  spring    of the   arch, and
8    feet wide below the arch,         to
                                        a   distance    of  28   feet  from    the  closed
 end  ;   from that point   it   tapered on one side to         feet along

 the gallery curved, being at this part                  feet   2  inches wide. The
 straight part of the gallery, from the dead wall at one end to the
 projecting pier at the other, was 34 feet long. In the wall to the
 left of the blocked end there were six narrow loop-holes up to the

curve, commencing at 18 feet from the end, and 2 feet 6 inches
apart, in the opposite wall there were four, commencing at the sama
distance and 5 feet apart ; over the wall at the blocked end of the
gallery there was an opening into the outer air, and a considerable
current of air passed through it along the gallery to the curved
end, which led into a large narrow gallery at right angles to this wide
one, and having large chambers opening into it.
     In some preliminary experiments, an iron tube was let into the
face of the wall at the blocked end of the gallery, so as to represent
a strong blast hole, and this was charged with 1J lb. of powder,
untamped in some experiments and tamped in others, some pieces of
guncotton were suspended from the roof of the gallery at a distance
of 28 feet and farther along, and observers were stationed outside
the gallery opposite the several loop-holes.       But, while the pieces
of guncotton were not inflamed, there were conflicting opinions
concerning the distances at which flame was seen, probably caused
by the general illumination of the gallery by the flash of the
explosion. It was, moreover, found that the iron tubes containing
the charges were more or less considerably torn, so that portions of
the exploding charge escaped laterally.       The following method of
experimenting    was eventually adopted.    Charges of 1^ lb. and 2 lb.
of powder, untamped and tamped, were fired from a small roughly
bored out gun-block, the bore of which was 1 foot 9 inches long and
2f inches in diameter ; the gun was raised so as to project the flame
right along the gallery at about its centre. A light woodwork frame,
5 feet square, was fitted with thirty-six cross wires 1 foot apart, so as
to furnish thirty-six points of intersection ; to each of these points a
small tuft of guncotton was attached, and the target thus fitted was
fixed vertically so as to face the charge, in the centre of which was
fixed an electric fuze.    In this way small charges of guncotton were
distributed uniformly over all parts of the target, which filled a great
part of the section of the gallery.     The distance of the target from
the charge being gradually increased in successive experiments to
20 feet, it was found that with the employment of 1J lb. and 2 lb.
charges, untamped, in three instances out of ten experiments only one,
or at most two of the tufts of guncotton were inflamed, this being
apparently the extreme distance to which flame, or matter sufficiently
hot to inflame guncotton, was projected.       At a distance of 19 feet,
        J
with 1 lb. charges, two out of three shots did not inflame any of the
guncotton tufts. With 1J lb. charges firmly tamped, one tuft only
of the thirty-six was fired, in two experiments, at a distance of 20 feet,
while in three others no guncotton was inflamed.
     It appears from these results that in a gallery or mine-working of
an area not very dissimilar to that in which the accidents just referred
to occurred, the flame or heated gases from 1J lb. and 2 lb. charges,
fired under conditions favourable to the production of the maximum
flame, and its complete projection in the direction of the discharge, only
reaches occasionally, and to a very limited extent, to a distance of

20 feet. I No doubt a powerful air current in a mine, passing in the
direction in which the shot is fired, must have a tendency to aid the
spread of the flame to a greater distance, but the difference between
20 feet and 100 feet, the flame having in the latter instance extended
to a distance of 75 feet along a gallery at right angles to the point of
ignition, is far too great to be only ascribable to the effect of an air
current in elongating the flame. As the first of the loopholes above
referred to existing in the walls of the gallery was 18 feet from the
shot, they could hardly affect the distance to which the flame was
found to reach.* It will be observed that these results correspond
with those which Mr. Hall obtained with 4 lb. charges of powder in
an adit, the dimensions of which are not specified.
     No gallery of large dimensions and free from the small lateral
openings was available for the continuance of these experiments, but
it was thought that some experiments in subterraneous passages of
much smaller dimensions (military countermines) might give instruc-
tive results. A so-called envelope gallery was therefore first selected
for the purpose.    This gallery was 5 feet 9 inches high to the crown of
the arch, and 4 feet 9 inches to the springing of the arch, and only
2 feet wide.    The part selected for the position of the gun and the
target was straight, but the portion immediately beyond was curved.
In rear of the gun, the gallery was quite open to a considerable distance.
One-and-a-half pound charges, untamped, were fired, and a frame-
target the width of the gallery and 4 feet 6 inches high, constructed
so as to give 15 points for the attachment of guncotton tufts, was
placed at gradually decreasing distances from the gun, commencing at
20 feet.   Even at a distance of only 14 feet from the charge, none of
the guncotton tufts were inflamed ; but the target was blown forward
about 12 feet and partly broken. It was evident that the fact of the
gallery being open at the rear of the charge greatly reduced the
tendency to the projection of flame to a distance in the direction of
the explosion.    The resistance opposed to the movement of the air by
the curvature of this very narrow gallery, a short distance in front of
the seat of the experiments, may have also contributed to diminish the
distance to which the flame or highly heated gases would extend.
When the experiments were continued in another gallery, of the same
dimensions, but straight and terminating in a head, like a drift in a
mine, the cannon being placed close up to the face of the drift, several
of the tufts of guncotton were inflamed at a distance of 27 feet ; one
was inflamed when the target was 30 feet off, and one also at a distance
of 32 feet, but none were ignited at a distance of 35 feet from the
charges.    Here then, in a long gallery, narrow in proportion to its
height, but in all respects representing a drift way in a mine, the
distance to which the flame of a blown-out shot of 1J lb. of powder
 extended was less than 35 feet, and therefore considerably less than
 one-half the distance from the seat of the blown-out shot of 1 lb. of
            The closing up of these was not found to affect the results.

 powder where the men were burned, in both directions in the cross
 workings, in the accident above cited. The influence of coal dust in
 increasing the distance to which the flame from a blown-out shot will
extend in mine-workings is therefore conclusively demonstrated by a
 comparison of the effects of those accidents with the foregoing experi-
mental data. On the other hand, the important circumstance noticed
 by Mr. Hall that no signs of burning on the props in the mine were
 visible at greater distances than a yard or two beyond the spots where
 the men were waiting, although there were open workings in both direc-
tions for some considerable distance, and although the flame was
sufficiently extensive at those spots to injure the men severely, proved
 conclusively that coal dust had not the power, in these two instances,
to carry on the flame to a great distance from the source of fire.      Had
there been any gas in the air of the mine the flame would doubtless
have extended much farther, and perhaps throughout the adjacent
workings.     The amount of dust raised by the blown-out shots may,
however, have been less considerable than in other similar occur-
rences, and the dust itself may not have been so highly inflammable,
 or otherwise of so suitable a character for carrying on flame, as that
existing in other mines where undoubtedly dust has played an important
part in enhancing the magnitude of explosions. At any rate these
results demonstrate the necessity for the exercise of caution in drawing
conclusions of too sweeping a nature with regard to the causes and
the extent of such coal-mine explosions as cannot be quite clearly
ascribed to fire-damp. A few experiments have been made, in the
largest gallery (Caponier) at Chatham, to test the power of coal dust
to carry on the flame from a blown-out shot.            A large quantity of
very fine and inflammable coal dust, from Seaham collieries, was
suspended in the air by employment of sufficient mechanical con-
trivances, and clouds of the same dust were also blown into the
gallery in the direction of the shot, and immediately in front of             it,
just when  it  was fired.    One of the frame-screens was placed across
the gallery where the pier jutted out (at        distance of 34 feet from
                                                     a
the shot), and pieces of guncotton were attached to nails driven in
the wall along the short narrow part of the straight gallery and to
some distance round the curve.         In every one of the experiments
tried (three) with 1J lb. of powder, fired when dust was thickly sus-
pended and carried along in the air, the flame burned              number of
                                                                     a

third,   some flame  travelled to the end  of the   straight gallery, and to
a   distance of 4  ft. 8 in. beyond the curve, but guncotton was not
 inflamed beyond that point.       In this case, therefore, flame reached
 rather more than, and in the others not quite, double the distance
 with dust thickly suspended in the air, to what          did in the absence
                                                         it

 which have been spoken of.

any explosions have occurred of which the destructive effects, so far
as burning and production of the fatal after-damp are concerned,
have not been more or less considerably increased           through tho
agency    of the coal   dust  raised  by   the explosion, and that the
latter has been in very many cases instrumental in causing the
burning effects of the explosion to spread over great areas, and to
reach to workings which, in the absence of dust, would have escaped
the visitation.  Even of late years, long since the observations of
Faraday and Lyell have been confirmed and extended, mining
engineers and others immediately connected with the working of coal-
mines have been very prone to ascribe explosions, which did not admit
of satisfactory explanation by an accidental failure of ventilation or
other evident causes, to the sudden disengagement or outbursts of fire-
damp, such as are, in fiery coal seams, of no uncommon occurrence, and
sometimes very serious in their magnitude and long continuance, and
to charge such sudden escapes of gas into some part of the mine-
workings with the whole extent of the disaster, rather than to credit
coal dust with any important share in the origination or even in the
extension of the explosion. In many instances the occurrence of such
outbursts, following upon falls of roofs or the firing of shots, or the
rapid disengagement of fire-damp from coal or goaves, consequent
upon sudden changes in atmospheric pressure, have been clearly
proved to have preceded disastrous explosions ; in others, however, the
conclusion that an explosion has been connected with the occurrence
of a sudden disengagement of gas in considerable volume, has been
based upon assumptions or conjectures, more or less admissible, or
upon evidence of doubtful nature collected after the explosion (as in
the case of the recent explosion at Seaham Collieries).       Under any
such circumstance, however, it is, to say the least, extremely difficult
to realise how sufficient gas to produce an explosive atmosphere can
be conveyed, even by the most powerful ventilating currents which
can circulate in mines, from the seat of such a sudden outburst to far
distant portions of the mine to which the actual explosion is proved
to have extended, within the period which is known, or believed, to
have intervened between the first disengagement of the gas and the
firing of the explosive atmosphere produced thereby in the vicinity of
the outburst, by the firing of a shot, by a defective lamp, or by other
means of ignition.     On the other hand, the character of the effects
which in many instances have been produced by the explosion ; the
evidences of severe burning such as could not be produced by the
rapid explosion of a gas mixture only, and the deposition of partially
burned or coked dust in very distant and distinct parts of the mine-
workings, leave no room for doubt that coal dust has played a more
or less important part in almost all the explosions which have been of
late submitted to investigation.     Further, it must be conceded that
in some instances, coal dust would indeed appear to have been the
chief instrument of destruction.
     To sum up ; it has not been difficult, as will have been seen from

              on Some  of the Dangerous   Properties of Dusts.           109

the foregoing, to demonstrate     experimentally that the existence of a
very small proportion of fire-damp in the air of a mine may determine
the propagation of flame by coal dust, ignited by the explosion of some
local accumulation of a gas mixture, or by the inflammation of gas
suddenly disengaged, or even by the flash from a blown-out shot.          It
has also been clearly established that in so-called fiery mines the air
is never likely to be actually free from fire-damp, and that as much
as 2 per cent, may exist in the return air of a very efficiently
ventilated mine of that class.     It must therefore be regarded as a
thoroughly well-grounded       conclusion   that, in many disastrous ex-
plosions, coal dust is the chief agent of destruction, and it is in-
disputable that but few explosions occur of which the effects have not
been more or less considerably extended and aggravated by the coal-
dust which is raised by the fire-damp explosion. It may also be
admitted as not improbable that in some instances, the influence of
dust may, apart from its combustibility (as described), determine the
ignition of a mixture of air and dust with a small proportion of fire-damp,
by the flame which a blown-out shot, or the accidental ignition of some
local accumulation of explosive gas mixture has produced.      Lastly, it is
conceivable, as contended by Friere Marreco, Galloway, and some
continental observers, that a mixture of an inflammable coal dust and
air, may even, in the complete absence of fire-damp, both originate and
carry on to some distance, explosions which, though much inferior in
violence to those developed through the agency of gas mixtures, will
be at least equal to them in regard to the disastrous effects on the
lives of those exposed to them.      That mixtures of coal dust and air
alone may have the power to carry on the explosion originally caused
and disseminated by a gas, air, and dust mixture, into regions where
no gas whatever exists, will now be generally admitted.         The great
disturbance of the air which must proceed in immediate advance of
the rush of flame produced by the ignition of a mixture of gas and air
charged with coal dust, will, in many mine-workings, raise a dense
cloud immediately in front of the flame, and the latter will thus be
fed as it advances.     Mr. Galloway concludes, as the final result of
his experiments with coal dust, that the presence of fire-damp is
altogether unnecessary to bring about a coal-mine explosion, but,
admitting that the result of certain experiments may seem to favour
this conclusion, its realisation necessitates the fulfilment of con-
ditions which cannot but be very exceptional, and its acceptance is
certainly unnecessary to add to the formidable character of coal dust
as a source of danger and an agent of destruction in mines.
     Whether an explosion originates with, or is chiefly caused by, the
production of a mixture of fire-damp with air in such proportions as
to be more or less rapidly and violently explosive ; whether the
originating cause be the reciprocal influence of a small proportion of
fire-damp and of coal dust (or dust of other descriptions of minerals
occurring in coal mines) co-existing in the air of a mine ; whether,
possibly, it simply originates with a mixture of very inflammable coal-

dust and air in the complete absence of fire-damp, or whether, lastly,
only the very limited concession be made that coal dust will add to
the extent, and increase the burning effect, of a fire-damp explosion ;
in any case, the existence of dust in abundance, and in a dry state, in
coal-mine workings, must be recognised as a source of danger not
greatly inferior to that caused by local accumulations, or the acci-
dental liberation, of fire-damp. The possibility of dealing with this
source of danger should therefore be as much an object of earnest
work as has been the improvement of ventilating arrangements for
mines.
    It being generally impracticable effectually to deal, by actual
removal, with the continual accumulation of dust in mine-workings,
the only available method of diminishing the dangers arising from its
constant production appears to be that of maintaining the floor in the
roads, &c, in a damp condition by efficient watering arrangements,
almost continually applied.     The high temperature of the mine, in
many instances, must often render this a difficult and costly process,
on account of the rapidity with which the water will evaporate;
hence attempts have been made to apply hygroscopic substances (such
as calcium chloride, sea-salt, or rock-salt) in conjunction with water,
or to use brine, with a view to retard its evaporation, and some
successful results appear to have recently attended their application
in several districts.   In some instances, with improved appliances
for the uniform and periodical distribution of sufficient water, the
maintenance of mine-roads in a sufficiently damp condition to prevent
dust from being raised in any considerable quantity appears to have
been accomplished with fair success ; there are, however, localities
where it is almost impracticable to maintain the floor of the roads in
a damp condition, in consequence of the great increase thereby of the
tendency to their being gradually raised by the pressure to which
they are subject.
    Apart from the effects of dust in augmenting the disastrous results
of such fire-damp explosions as may arise from the existence of a
defective, or an open safety lamp in the vicinity of an accumulation
of gas, or of a locality where a sudden outburst of gas occurs, the
blasting of coal or of rock, in those parts of a mine where fire-damp
may exist, if even only in very small quantities, constitutes the chief
source of accidents in which coal dust may have played an important
share.    There is no doubt, therefore, that the elaboration of really
safe methods of getting coal in places where blasting by powder is
now resorted to, and of removing the harder rock in the working of
drifts where fire-damp may exist, will most importantly contribute
towards the diminution of danger arising from the accumulation of
dust in mines.     The substitution of efficient coal-cutting machines
for blasting may to some extent supplant the use of powder, and the
employment of compressed air as an agent for bringing down coal or
rock has been made the subject of ingenious contrivances, which
appear, however, as yet, to labour under some disadvantages in regard

 1882.]        on Some   of the Dangerous Properties of Dusts.         Ill
 to cost, facility of use and general efficiency.     Attempts have been
 made to render    the employment of powder in the presence of fire-
 damp safe, by     using it in conjunction with water.        In the first
 instance it was    proposed by Dr. Macnab to bring the latter into
 direct operation as the cleaving or blasting agent by inserting a
 cylinder containing water into the blast hole, and connecting it with
 a very strong external vessel, in which the powder charge was fired,
 much as the powder charge is fired in the powder chamber of a gun,
the generating gas being brought to bear upon the confined column of
 water, and causing the latter to exert a rending force upon the coal by
which it was surrounded. As the results furnished by this method of
operation were not promising, the comparatively very simple expedient
 was resorted to by Dr. Macnab of employing water simply as tamping
in a charge hole, a cylinder containing the liquid and of suitable
length to fill the hole, being inserted over the charge of powder.  In the
event of a charge blowing out, the dispersion of the water in a very
finely divided condition was relied upon to effect the extinction of the
volume of flame which, under these conditions, would be projected
into the air of the mine. Some carefully conducted experiments, with
blast holes charged by this method and surrounded by an explosive
gas-mixture, showed that occasionally no ignition of the gas resulted
from the blowing out of the shot, but that in most instances, the
conditions of the experiments being the same, the gas-mixture in
front of the blast hole was exploded, when the shot blew out.         It is
possible that a careful regulation of the charge and length of tamping
may render this mode of operation a comparatively safe one, though
it may be doubtful whether absolute reliance could be placed upon the
invariable extinction of flame in the case of blown-out charges.    When
the attention of the Eoyal Commission was directed to the subject of
the dangers attending the employment of explosives in coal mines, it
occurred to Mr. Abel to attempt the application to the getting of coal
of the principle which he developed some years ago, in the course of
his researches on explosive agents, namely, the sudden transmission
in all directions of the force exerted instantaneously by a detonation,
by surrounding the detonating charge with water.         It was found in a
large   number   of  experiments  that when comparatively small charges
of guncotton or dynamite (the latter being preferable) were enclosed
in cylinders of light metal or paper filled with water, and occupying
the entire available space (or nearly so) in a blast hole, the detonation
of the charge in holes of excessive strength, when employed in proper
proportion to the amount of water by which it was surrounded,
was always accomplished without ignition of the explosive gas-mix-
ture with which the opening of the blast hole was surrounded.         The
interesting fact was moreover established, by operations carried out
in hard coal in Lancashire, that the action of the detonating charge is
modified to great advantage, by enclosing the envelope in a long
column of water.        Instead of exerting a powerfully crushing or
disintegrating action, confined within comparatively narrow limits,

whereby   a charge of guncotton or dynamite is rendered of little value
as    a means  of getting coal when used in the ordinary way, the
distribution of the explosive force in all directions by the column of
water causes it to exert a cleaving or splitting action even superior to
that exercised by ordinary blasting powder.       The farther develop-
ment of this method of applying detonating agents to blasting purposes
in coal-mine workings appears therefore well worthy of attention.
    Another method of getting coal, which, though not new in itself,
has been applied in a novel manner and with most promising results
by Messrs. Smith and Moore, has the great advantage of dispensing
entirely with the use of explosive agents, and of any but the most
simple mechanical appliances.
    It consists in applying the force which quicklime will develop if
confined, and made to combine under that condition with water,
whereby it undergoes very considerable expansion, a large amount of
heat being at the same time developed.        Messrs. Smith and Moore
convert the freshly burned and crushed quicklime into very compact
cylindrical masses, or cartridges, having a small groove on one
side, so that when the requisite number of cylinders are inserted
symmetrically into the mechanically drilled hole in the coal, which
they fit accurately, a narrow pipe, with perforations along its entire
length, enclosed in a tight-fitting stocking of open webbing, and
provided with a stopcock, may be inserted into the side of the charge,
which is afterwards tamped in the usual manner.         The proportion
of water necessary to slake the lime, plus an excess of about
one-sixth, is then forced into the hole through the pipe by means
of a simple hand syringe, and the stopcock of the pipe being
closed, the operation is complete.    In a brief space of time sounds
indicative of the cracking of the mass of coal which contains the
cartridge show that the expansion of the lime by its union with
the water, and the very considerable development of steam within the
cartridges, are performing their work, and after an interval of time
varying with the strength of the part of the seam operated upon, the
coal is detached in large blocks. The holes can be charged so rapidly
that a considerable number may be put into operation in quick suc-
cession by one or two men.*       As the action of the charge occupies
some little time (fifteen or twenty minutes), they really come into
operation together, and in this way large faces of hard coal, in long-
wall workings, are brought down with ease and certainty. Whether
these compressed lime cartridges can be applied with any success in
stone still remains to be determined, but in point of cost, simplicity,
     * In one of several operations of this kind recently witnessed by the Lecturer
at Shipley Collieries, Derby, in the "deep hard seam," which is nearly 3 ft.
thick, ten shots were fired together, bringing down a block of coal 39 ft. long by
3 ft. thick and 2 ft. 10 in. high, weighing about ten tons.       The average time
occupied in boring a hole (by mechanical drill), charging and tamping       it,and
watering the charge, was twenty minutes. The usual operation of bringing down
this very hard coal, by wedging, is  exceedingly slow and laborious.

 and above all, safety, this method of detaching coal appears to rank
 before any other yet tried.       Besides entirely avoiding the use and
 production of flame or fire in the blasting of the coal, the operation
 is conducted gradually and almost noiselessly, and the raising of dust
by the more or less violent concussions which attend the employment
of explosives in any form or manner, is avoided.
     It is insisted upon by a great majority of those most competent to
judge, that the employment of explosives cannot be dispensed with in
the profitable working of coal mines.        That the use of gunpowder in
the ordinary way, even       with strict  attention  to all practicable pre-
cautions, is a most prolific source of accident, has long been recog-
nised.     The development of safe methods of applying explosive
agents, or of simple and effective substitutes for them, is therefore
of such paramount importance in securing protection to the miner
against the dangers of fire-damp and of coal dust, that those who are
entrusted with the management of coal mines should spare no exer-
tions to test rigorously but fairly the merits of any proposals which
afford promise of success in this direction.

                     The Proper Motions of     the    Stars.
The spectacle presented by the stellar heavens           as   viewed by ordinary
 observers is characterised by two remarkable features, the absence of
 uniformity in the brightness, and the absence of uniformity in the
 distribution of the stars.     Certain of the stars soon came to be
 recognisable by their superior lustre, and certain groups of stars
 became familiarly known as so many landmarks in the stellar firma-
 ment.    The way was thus prepared for an important discovery. It
 was ascertained respecting a limited number of the stars that their
 places in the heavens relatively to the general multitude of the stars
 were continually changing.      They consequently received the appella-
 tion of planets, or wandering stars, while, on the other hand, the
 stars in general, in consequence of their always maintaining the same
 relative position, were denominated fixed stars.       Ptolemy, in his
 great work upon the astronomy of the ancients, places the earth in
 the centre of the universe, and assumes the sun, moon, and planets to
 be revolving in orbits around    it, while beyond all was the sphere of
the fixed stars, which revolved with      a  uniform motion around the
 earth, effectinga     complete revolution once in every twenty-four
 hours. No opinion    is   expressed respecting the nature of the stars,
 noris  any allusion made to the possibility of the stars being endued
with a   proper motion.
     When Copernicus propounded the true system of the universe, he
made the earth  a   planet revolving like the other planets round the
sun,   and  he explained the phenomenon of the diurnal revolution of
the starry sphere by the revolution of the earth upon        fixed axis in
                                                                     a
the opposite direction.     No opinion was expressed by him respecting
the physical nature of the celestial bodies, or their having any pro-
bable community with the earth in this respect.        Indeed,       could    it
hardly be said    that  any new   light was thrown  upon  the   physics of
astronomy by the theory of Copernicus.        As    mathematical exposi-
                                                     a

successful. Indeed,   it    wanted only the discoveries of Kepler re-
specting the elliptical movements of the planets to make           perfectit
in this respect. But   it    must be acknowledged that in the system
                                                                         i    2

 propounded by Copernicus the earth was regarded as the body of
paramount importance in the universe.
     It was the invention of the telescope and its application to the
 purposes of astronomical observation which first revealed to the
 human mind the marvellous extent of the physical universe, and
 suggested the idea that the earth might be a mere atom in comparison
 with the vastness of the material system beyond. When it was dis-
 covered that the planets are round dark bodies like the earth, shining
 only by the reflected light of the sun, and that they presented ap-
 parent diameters of sensible magnitude when viewed through the
telescope, no doubt was henceforward entertained that the planets are
 bodies comparable with the earth in magnitude, and that the earth is
merely one of a family of similar bodies, which revolve in orbits of
different magnitudes around the sun. It is worthy of remark that
 Galileo, to whom is due the telescopic discoveries which first dis-
 closed the vast extent of the material universe, has nowhere expressed
any opinion respecting the nature of the stars.       His mind was pro-
bably too much occupied with the more immediate consequences of
his discoveries to indulge in speculations leading to more remote
conclusions; and a similar remark is generally applicable to his
successors in the field of telescopic exploration, who flourished during
 the seventeenth century.    It was reserved for Huyghens to propound
the doctrine that the stars are suns.       This he did in a work on
Cosmical Astronomy, which was published in 1699, shortly after his
death.    Henceforward the stars have been regarded by astronomers
as self-luminous     bodies, comparable in magnitude and splendour
with the sun.
     While more correct ideas were being formed respecting the nature
of the stars, the method for ascertaining the exact position of an
object in the celestial sphere underwent at the same time a complete
revolution.    The telescope in its original form was not suited for
aiding the observer in fixing the precise position of a star in the
heavens, but the subsequent form of the telescope, consisting of a
combination of two convex lenses, suggested the admirable invention
of telescopic sights, which may be said to constitute the foundation
of all exact astronomy. The places of the stars were now determined
with a vastly greater degree of precision, and the way was thus pre-
pared for the consideration of the important question whether the
epithet fixed is strictly applicable to those bodies, or whether they
might be rather endued with a movement, so extremely slow as to
have hitherto eluded detection.
     To Halley is due the discovery of the important fact that some of
the stars have a proper motion.      In 1717 he communicated a paper
to the Eoyal Society, in which he showed that a comparison of the
places of Sirius, Arcturus, and Aldebaran, as determined by Hip-
parchus about the year 130 B.C., with corresponding observations of
the same stars made by himself, clearly indicated that during the
intermediate interval the stars had sensibly moved southwards with

 1882.]                 on the Proper Motions of   the Stars.                 117
 respect to the ecliptic, and lie obtained a further confirmation of this
 result by examining the account of an occultation of Aldebaran by the
 moon, observed at Athens in the year 509 a.d.
      A few years after Halley announced this important fact, Bradley
 made his famous discovery of the aberration of light, and its effect
 upon the apparent place of a star; and subsequently the same
 astronomer discovered the apparent sidereal movement depending on
 the nutation of the earth's axis.     The astronomer could now ascertain
 the true place of a star in the heavens with a precision to which tho
 results of previous efforts could offer no comparison, and it seemed
 probable that ere long the great problem of the proper motions of the
 stars might be attacked with some hope of success.
     To ascertain the proper motion of a star it is necessary to have
 two well determined places of the star separated from each other by a
 sufficiently great interval of time.     Down to the middle of the last
century no such materials may be said to have existed, if we except
a few isolated cases such as those referred to by Halley, for the pro-
bable errors in the observed places of a star far exceed in magnitude
the minute quantity which was the object of inquiry.            To Bradley is
due a great work of observational astronomy which has constituted the
basis of the more extensive investigations of the present day relating
to the proper motions of the stars.        This consisted in a series of star
observations executed by that astronomer at the Royal Observatory,
Greenwich, from 1750 to 1762, but which it was reserved for Bessel,
the great German astronomer, to reduce, and finally to publish in the
year 1818.         A comparison of those star places with the corresponding
results obtained at the Greenwich Observatory in the present century
by Sir George Airy, the late Astronomer Royal, has conducted
astronomers to important conclusions respecting the proper motions
of the stars. Materials tending to elucidate the same great question
have also been derived from the star observations of several other
astronomers of the present century.

118       Prof. B. Grant   on the Proper Motions of  the Stars.    [May  5,
    The last four proper motions have been recently detected at the
Glasgow Observatory, where a system of star observing has been pro-
secuted since the year 1860.
    It must strike every one who inspects the foregoing list that the
proper motion of a star has no relation whatever to the apparent magni-
tude of the star.     Thus Rigel, one of the most brilliant stars in the
heavens, has a proper motion of only 20" in a thousand years.           On
the  other hand,  the star 1830 Groombridge,   which   has a proper motion
of 7106" in a thousand years, is a star of only the seventh magnitude.
The same remark obviously applies to the other stars in the list.
And yet one would have thought that the brighter stars, being pre-
sumably nearer to us than the fainter stars, would for that reason
have a larger proper motion.          With respect to a Centauri and
 61 Cygni, which we know, from the researches of astronomers on
their parallax, to be the two nearest stars, it turns out conformably
to what one might expect, that they have also large proper motions ;
but what are we to think of 1830 Groombridge, which, although a star
 of only the seventh magnitude, and one which hardly indicates any
 sensible parallax, exhibits notwithstanding the largest proper motion
 of any star in the heavens ? These anomalies are doubtless attribu-
 table to differences in the absolute magnitude and intrinsic splendour
 of the stars, and furthermore to the fact that the proper motions as
 revealed by the telescope are only the motions which are resolved at
 right angles to the line of sight.
     Heretofore the proper motion of a star has been found to take
 place constantly in the same direction, and as the angular amount of
 proper motion is in all cases exceedingly small, the same result will
 probably continue to manifest itself for ages to come.          The mean
 apparent  diameter   of the sun  amounts to 1944", consequently Arcturus
 would require nearly a thousand years to describe, in virtue of his
 proper motion, an arc of a great circle of the celestial sphere, equal
 to the mean apparent diameter of the sun.
     The lecturer next adverted to the interesting spectroscopic re-
 searches of Huggins, and Christie the present Astronomer Eoyal, on
 the proper motions of the stars in the direction of the line of sight,
 and he concluded with some remarks on the great problem of the
 motion of the solar system in space.

          The Making        and       Working of a Channel         Tunnel.
Such is the title of my lecture this evening, and you will gather
from it that    Icome before you with practically an abstract proposi-
tion ; thus I  do  not ask you to consider with me whether the tunnel
should be made at all, whether, if made, it would be a pecuniary
success in the way of earning a large revenue, or whether, if made,
it would detract in any appreciable degree from the safety of our
insular position.     These are contentious matters, and these are
therefore purposely omitted from my lecture of to-night.
    We will leave for the Society of Arts the consideration of the
question, whether those men who are willing to embark their money
in such an undertaking, are wise or not, and to             it,
                                                    and to the Statistical
Society  we  will  leave  the  question, whether  persons who base their
estimates of revenue upon existing traffic, and do not allow for the
development arising from an improved mode of communication, are
as unwise as those who, in the early days of railways, opposed them
on the ground that they never could pay, because, as those persons
showed, the stage-coach       and the canal-barge transported only so
many passengers and so many tons, supplemented by the tonnage of
the road waggons, and they argued that the fares and freights to be
earned for the transportation of the whole of these passengers and tons,
so far from yielding    a dividend, must be utterly inadequate to cover
working expenses.
    We will leave these Societies jointly to consider whether, if be                    it
thought desirable to make       bridge with spans of nearly
                                  a                            third of     a                a
mile in length, and of height of 150 feet above the water, and 450
                            a
feet from the extreme top of the piers to the bottom of the foundations,
over the Firth of Forth, to connect up       population of only about
                                                  a                                          a
million north of that Firth with the country south of              and to       it,
expend two millions sterling on such           bridge,
                                                  a          desirable to
                                                                  it   is

perils and questions of the sea, between the whole of Great Britain,
with its thirty millions of population and its wondrous manufacturing
and productive power, and the continent of Europe, and through that
continent with our possessions in India and Australia.        Finally, we
will leaveit to the United Service Institution, guided in their delibcra-

tions by the Report which will,           Ipresume, soon be issued by the
Commission appointed for the purpose, to consider, whether, by the
making of two covered ravines 20 miles in length, and having each
of them a width of only 14 feet, the safety of our insular position,
diminished as that safety is in these days of rapid steam propulsion
and transportation, would be affected in any appreciable degree.
      Iam afraid, that notwithstanding my guarded utterances, you may
have gathered what my views are on those points which                   Iam not
to-night to enter upon.       If,  however, any here have not so gathered
 them,    Ican only say to those who may be interested in knowing
 what my opinion     is,that in the right places and at the right times,     I
am fully prepared to clearly state my views, and to give reasons
for the faith that  isin me concerning them.
     In the interest of Channel tunnel, what happy circumstance
                           a                               a                  it
was, that the unknown platelayer of the Stockton and Darlington
Railway, who took there the gauge he had used in the colliery
lines, had not, at about the same time, imitators in France, and in the
different countries of the Continent.        No doubt,       in these countries
                                                               if
the development of railways had been made simultaneously, by their
engineers, with the development of railways in England, we should
have had some highly scientific fraction of an imaginary section of
the earth's surface —      afraction containing probably six places of
decimals and some repeaters — acknowledging the want of absolute
accuracy in the decimal quantity — adopted as the gauge of the lines
of railway in France, another one in Germany, and                   a  third in
Italy. But luckily, when railways spread on the Continent, they
spread from England, and they spread by means of English en-
gineers, and before our Continental friends knew where they were
they found themselves employing the               feet
                                                  4          inch gauge, with
which   the  railways in  this country are, as      rule, laid.
                                                      a           Soit  is, that,
excluding the Peninsula and Russia, railway carriage may start from
                                              a
Calais and go over the whole continent of Europe              and so
                                                               ;    it  will be,
when      Channel tunnel
          a                      made, that
                                is               railway carriage may start
                                                  a
from Thurso or Wick, and passing through London, may join on to
the train from Charing Cross, traverse the tunnel, and continue
without any break of gauge, or trans-shipment of passengers, through
France, Italy, and Germany.
     Having premised this much, will at once pass to the first of the
                                      I
two divisions of my lecture — The Making             a Channel Tunnel.

     Those who have studied the subject of tunnel-making will be aware
that, as rule, tunnels either have to be carried through soils of so
          a
loose     character, that they cannot stand for
          a                                                   moment without

case, the driving forward         effected by blasting, an operation involv-
                                 is

which the blasting charges are to be put, or, in later days, involving

tunnel was driven through an all but fluid material in the bed of the
river Thames.        mean Brunei's celebrated tunnel, now used as

     In ordinary railway tunnelling, such as we meet with in England,
it   iscommonly possible to sink shafts at frequent intervals, and
in this way to multiply the number of faces, or ends, at which men
can work  ;   but in the case of the great tunnels made of late years
under high mountains, such as the Mont Cenis tunnel,             miles long,
                                                                  7

regard to the expense of the deep shafts, and the comparatively in-
accessible positions of their mouths, to accelerate the rate of progress
or to add to the ventilation by their use, and in such cases             it
becomes necessary to do the whole of the worfc from the two ends.
     Hitherto  I  have spoken of railway tunnels.         may, however, be
                                                            I
permitted    to remind   you   that the  earlier tunnels  made  in England
were those employed for canal purposes       ;   these, however, must not
be further referred to, nor will     I  delay by calling your attention to
the great canal tunnel made in France in the year 1681, or to the
still earlier tunnel, the Grotto of Posilipo at Naples.
     Besides tunnels proper, there are subterranean workings, to
which the term tunnel         not applied, but which are undoubtedly as
                             is
strictly tunnels as are those through which trains pass or along which
barges are hauled. You are of course aware that         Iam alluding to our
great underground    works   for  mining purposes.    Here, at depths below
the surface varying from        few hundred yards to half
                                 a                             mile, and. in

 some few instances extending below the bed of the sea, we have
tunnels which even in        asingle colliery have an aggregate length of
many miles, excavated by means of only two shafts, and carried
 through rock of the most varied character, and too frequently sub-
jected to the dangers arising from the firing of the gases, and from, as
 we were so well shown        a few weeks ago by Mr. Abel, the dangers
 arising from the explosion of the dust with which these galleries are
in many places covered.
    As regards stratification, obviously,    if   it  matter of choice,
                                                       were   a

cannot be left for moment without support by timbering, pending the

be chosen the rock which, although capable of standing alone,
demands    for its excavation     the   labour and cost incident to
drilling and blasting operations, and demands also the great expendi-
ture of time needed for working under these circumstances.
     The perfect material, so far as regards its excavation, would be
one, which, while    was capable of being easily cut, was also capable
                       it

maintenance of form, a material could be found which was practically
impermeable to water,       I think it must be admitted that this would
be the stratification of all others which the engineer would seek,
had he the power of selection. But in most cases of tunnelling, still
more in the case of a Channel tunnel, the engineer is bound by
conditions which, except within very narrow limits, prevent him from
selecting his stratification ; he is compelled, as a rule, to take such
 stratification as may occur.       If
                                     this be true ordinarily of a line of
railway through the country, how much more is it true in the case
of a Channel tunnel ? Looking at the map, we see the Channel,
in its extent from the Lizard to the North Foreland, ranging in width
from 100 to 60 or 50 miles, except in one place, but at that one
place, viz. for the short length between Boulogne and Calais on
the French side and Hythe and Dover on the English side, we find
the Channel reduced to a width of some 20 miles.             Obviously, all
other things being equal, it is in this part, on account of its narrow-
ness, that the tunnel should be made, and there are further reasons
why this place should be chosen. — This narrower part has been
selected from the earliest times for the crossing from side to side, and
in that way the roads first, and the railways afterwards, have on the
two sides converged towards this part, and thus there exist already the
inland communications.          I
                              As have said, everything shows the desir-
ability of having the Channel tunnel in this narrow part. Then comes
 the question, is it at this narrow part that the desirable stratification is
to be found ? Well, most fortunately we do find, as stated on the
 highest geological authority, that there             is,
                                                    on the English shore
and on the French shore, the very formation of all others which                   is
desired.
     Every one knows that on the two sides of the strait there are
 chalk cliffs, and that this formation extends inland in both countries
 for some distance.      Chalk, we are well aware,         material readily
                                                             is   a
 cut, and when not exposed to the weather,        self-supporting.

 may be said, how about the water        ?Is not the chalk the very form-

 ask you to look at the samples on the table and at the diagrams
 before you.     You will see there the white or upper chalk of which            I
 have just been speaking, seamed with flints and loaded with water,
 but you will also see depicted the lower chalk (grey chalk), or " craie
 de Rouen," and the chalk marls.

     Equally excellent with the upper chalk for facility of excavation is
this lower chalk — indeed, much more excellent, inasmuch as it is free
from the beds of flints — equally excellent with the upper chalk for
preserving its form, but in another respect infinitely superior to the
upper chalk, inasmuch as it is practically watertight — analysis shows
that the lower chalk contains much clay mingled with it so as to
enter into its composition ; it is, in fact, an unburnt natural Portland
cement ; and you will, by the sort of dirt pie      I have formed, see that
it is capable of being worked into a perfectly watertight puddle.
     Now comes the question, does this material exist right across the
Channel at the place where it is intended to make the tunnel, or does it
not ? The reasons for believing that it exists are that we find it on both
sides, and we find it under similar conditions, giving, therefore, good
ground for the opinion that there is uniformity between — an opinion
strengthened by the fact that the line of outcrop of the gault on the sea-
bottom, as determined by sample-taking soundings, is consistent with
the indications on the shores and with the uniformity between. No one
can say with absolute certainty that there is this uniformity.         It can
after all be only a matter of opinion, but the probabilities     in favour of
its existing are so great that reasonable, prudent, business men,
guided by the information they receive from scientific geologists, are
found to be willing to embark their money in making an experimental
heading which shall solve the question ; and let it be remembered
that if they are wrong the whole loss falls upon themselves, and in
addition there comes upon them that which an Englishman dreads
more than the loss of his money, i. e. ridicule, the "      I told you so's
                                                                             "
of his less adventurous friends ; but if these prudent business men
be right, then    I   think you will agree they should have a fair profit
for their venture.       But to whom will the great profit accrue ? Not
to the makers of the tunnel, but to the community at large.                 It
appears   to  me,   therefore,  that, looking  upon   these   makers   of  the
submarine railway on the one side, and the public on the other, it
will be seen that the public are engaged in that very safe game
wherein while no hurt can happen, great benefit may accrue to them,
whereas those who are undertaking the expenditure are so engaged in
the game, that while they may suffer the whole of the loss, they can
only reap a fraction of the benefit.
     Now you will see that this material — this grey chalk — is, like
the common chalk, cut with the greatest ease by means of an ordinary
pocket knife.      No blasting is needed, and no drilling of holes for
cartridges.    This    being so, how shall it be got out — by men working
pickaxes and tools of that kind, and making a somewhat irregular-
shaped hole ?       I   think it is seen at once this is not the mode,
when you bear in mind first that we can have no shafts here, multi-
plying the places for working, and that thus only the two faces
will be available ; and next that only a certain number of men can
work against a face.         Believing them as often as you will their
rate of progress must be slow, the cost considerable, and the need of

 126                            Sir Frederick Bramwell                     [May 19,
 ventilation,  and the problem of how to ventilate under such circum-
  stances, must be matters of difficulty. Everything points therefore
. to the employment of machinery ; this must however be worked at
  a distance from the original source of power.             I
                                                    say so because no
  one would suggest that a steam engine, with its boiler and furnace,
  should be used in such a position underground, and therefore we
  must take it that the source of power will be situated on the shore.
  Now in what manner is the power to be transported ? Fifty
  years ago power was transported to such places by a mode still
  perfectly practicable and feasible, namely, the making of a partial
  exhaustion at the source of power by means of air-pumps, exhaust
  mains connecting these pumps to the engine to be worked at a
 distance. With this arrangement it will be seen that the pressure
  of the atmosphere exerted on the pistons of the engines, to the ex-
 haust pipes of which the exhaust mains were connected, produced the
  requisite power.
      This then was the system of conveyance of power by exhaustion,
  and it had the merit of ventilating the place where it was being
 worked, not, it is true, by air delivered at the working face, but by
                        I
 air drawn in, if may so phrase                from the shaft, and all the way
                                               it,
 along the heading       to   the  working face to feed the engines which
 were worked by the exhaustion.
     Another mode of conveying power in these days                is  by the laying
 on of gas to work          agas motor.      It      perfectly feasible, but the
                                                     is
 result of using this mode would be, that the products of combustion
 would vitiate the atmosphere nearly as badly as             it  would be vitiated
 by the employment of coal-fires underground.                This mode therefore
is  unsatisfactory.
     Another mode would be by the conveyance of water under pressure                ;
 this has for many years been employed by Sir William Armstrong,
 and others following him, to transmit power to             a   distance. Such     a
 system  is  free from the disadvantage of vitiating the air in any way,
 but on the other hand          itdoes not contribute to the ventilation.           It
has, however, when coupled with              the   improvements      made   by Mr.
Crampton for the special purpose of tunnelling, advantages which
I  shall describe later on.
     The most modern plan of conveying power,              is its transmission by
electricity this,
              ;      like   the  hydraulic mode,      neither   detracts from the
 purity of the air, nor does        add to it.
                                     it
     There remains, however, the converse of the exhaustion system,
which   is  the one commending itself,          I think, upon many grounds as
being very applicable       to  the   transmission    of power to the end of       a
long tunnel or heading.          I    mean the mode of working by com-
pressed air.
     This    is extremely simple in its operation. Driven by              a    steam
engine    on  the  surface   there   are   compressing    pumps    which   draw    in
the atmospheric air, compress             to
                                          it the  desired  degree,   and  this  com-
pressed air        by means of pipes, carried down the shaft and along
                  is,

the tunnel   to the face where the engine is employed to make the
excavation.    The compressed air presses on the pistons of these
engines  in  the  same manner as that in which steam presses on the
piston of a steam engine, but, for the purpose we are now consider-
ing, there is this important difference, that whereas the steam engine
delivers its exhaust steam into the air, thereby filling it with un-
breathable vapour, the compressed air engines deliver the exhaust
air into the workings, and in that manner the very machine which
is doing the work is, as an accident of this work, effecting the venti-
lation.  It must not be supposed that compressed air engines are
any novelty, or that their efficient working is a matter of doubt.
They have been employed in various situations, and for underground
purposes for many years.    They were used, as you probably well
know, in the Mont Cenis tunnel, and in the St. Gothard tunnel, for
working the drills which bored the holes in which the cartridges
for the blasting of the rock were placed. In fact the mode of
construction of these engines, and the manner of their using, are as
well understood as are the mode of construction, and the manner of
use,   of the steam engine.
    There is known exactly, what would be the loss by friction of the
compressed air in passing through a given-sized pipe, a loss varying
with the velocity and with the pressure ; and upon this point        may  I
say that compressed air has been worked at from as much as 1000 lbs.
on the square inch down to as little as 30 or 40 lbs. on the square
inch, and   I may tell you that a pipe little more than 11 inches dia-
meter would deliver at 10 miles distance air which had originally
been at 50 lbs. pressure in quantities sufficient to develop 150 horse-
power at the working face, with a loss of pressure of about 25 per
cent., while if the air had been brought up to 500 lbs. pressure a pipe
a little over 4 inches diameter would enable, at the same percentage
of loss of pressure, a similar horse-power to be obtained at the end of
10 miles of such pipe.
    Having determined how the machine is to be driven, let us next
consider in what manner it shall attack a stratification capable of
being easily cut.    An obvious way would be to scoop out channels in
the face of the work, and to make these of such depth as to enable
the block contained between the channels to be broken off and taken
away as a whole ; but you will see that if this mode were adopted, the
work of cutting must be suspended while the block was being removed,
and the block must be got out past the machine, and that this would
be a matter of difficulty, especially in a small trial heading, and must
cause delay.
    On the whole, therefore, it becomes much more simple and
economical, and much more rapid — and in a case like this rapidity is
the true economy — to use such a number of cutters as will cut the
whole face of the heading to pieces, making       it,
                                                   as    were, into small

is this — that the cuttings being continuously produced, can be readily
carried away by a simple apj^aratus, a travelling chain of scoops (for
which room can be found between the machine and the sides of the
excavation), and can be poured, as produced, into waggons waiting
to convey them away.       In this manner the operation and the pro-
gression of the machine may be continuous — with one qualification
however — the machine stands upon a bed, along which bed it is
capable of forward motion proportioned to the progress made at each
revolution ; but of course the time comes when after the machine has
gone forward to the extent limited by the bed, the end of its travel
is, for the time, reached, and then it is necessary to stop the machine,
and uphold           it,

materials may have to be taken into the tunnel, for the purpose of
lining     it,
            and       suggested that this,
                      it    is                 difficulty at the outset, and
                                                           if   a
near the ends of the tunnel, will be an increasing difficulty as the
tunnel progresses, and the distance to the working face therefore
increases.
    I  will deal at once with this last state of things. Supposing that
trains of waggons may work within any stipulated distance the one
from the other, say for instance         quarter of      mile,        obvious      it   is

 that after the tunnel has attained     length of quarter of mile, you
                                                                     a              a
may then establish       second train, to be running on the rails at the
                                 a
 same time as the first one, and when the tunnel has advanced half                                  a
mile you may establish       third train, and so on that
                                      a                        to say, as you
                                                                     ;        is
 attain each successive distance, such as you have determined shall be
that which ought to be preserved between the trains, you may then
provide another train.
   Those who raise this difficulty do not appear to                           see   that     it   does

1882.]       on the   Making and Working of   a Channel   Tunnel.    129
not follow because it is ten miles from the shore to the middle
of the tunnel, that therefore the number of trains at work at the
same time on that ten miles taking materials outwards should be
limited to one. And yet no one suggests that upon the Metropolitan
and District Railways, for example, there shall only be one train on
the line all the way between Aldersgate Street and the Mansion
House.    As a fact, there are at one and the same time fifteen or
twenty trains upon that distance.     Similarly there could be any
reasonable number of trains upon the line in the tunnel as its length
increased.
    Let us see, however, what this question of the material to be
removed amounts to.        Assume that the tunnel for one permanent
line is to be 14 feet in diameter internally when finished, and assume
that it will be lined with material, about which  I
                                                  shall speak presently,
1 foot 6 inches in thickness,    that  would make a 17 feet (5f yards)
diameter excavation, equal to, not quite, 25 superficial yards. Assume
the machine to be making a progress of 2 yards in an hour, that
would amount to 50 cubic yards, or not more than a sufficient load
for one train, and this would be a rate of progress that would advance
a mile in the working days of six weeks, so that about fifteen months
would finish the ten miles.
    It may be said that this is taking too sanguine a view of the
speed at which the work would go on ; but if this be so no one can
suggest that the supposed difficulty of removing the excavated material
is being shirked by an under-estimate ; but even as thus stated, it
needs only one train an hour.       Well, it may be said, one train an
hour is easy enough on an ordinary railway with locomotives, but
how is this one train an hour to be got along underground in a close-
ended tunnel, where you won't dare to use an ordinary locomotive ?
Are you going to do it by horses ? The answer is, No ! Again the
compressed air comes to our aid, and you will find that, without the
slightest difficulty, compressed air locomotives, which are already in
use in works of this character, and, as Ishall have occasion to tell you
when     Iconsider the permanent working of the tunnel, have been in
lengthened use elsewhere, would be employed for these trains.
   I   think you must agree with me that there is no practical difficulty
about the transport of the material along the tunnel; but, then,
the question may be put, how is it to be got to the surface in sufficient
quantities ?
     Two modes are available here. One is that the land tunnel (the
incline) should be completed first, and that the material should be
got up the incline by a locomotive.     But as this waiting for the com-
pletion of the land tunnel would involve an unnecessary delay, and as
it clearly would be better that the works of the land tunnel and of
the part under the sea should go on simultaneously, the material
would be got to the surface by winding engines.        Let us see what
that amounts     to.  You  have  50  cubic yards   in an  hour for each
tunnel, that    is,100 cubic yards in an hour for the two; call the

weight of this 150 tons.          The height through which this will have
to be lifted is some 60 yards, a distance so slight that there is no
reason on the score of expense why there should not be two or three
independent shafts, or, better still, one large shaft with two or three
separate lifts in     it,so that each lift would bring up about 50 tons
an hour, or 500 tons in the 10 hours.            There are coal-pits where as
much as 770 tons in the ten hours are raised, not from                 a  depth of
60 yards, but from        adepth  of  600  yards,  or ten  times  60  yards.  This
suggested difficulty, therefore,     it   will be seen, has   no  foundation.
     But although,  I    trust,I    have made  it   abundantly clear that there
is no practical difficulty whatever in getting the excavated materials,
by the use of ordinary waggons drawn by compressed air engines,
to the base of the shaft, nor in raising by winding engines, there
is  another mode of getting rid of that material, and another system
of working, which has been suggested by Mr. Crampton,                       a mode
that well deserves consideration.              His proposition    is    to employ
hydraulic power (water under pressure) as the motive agent, to
drive either the special cutting machine which he suggests, or any
other cutting machine, at the face of the heading or tunnel, and also
to drive the pumps necessary to send this water back along the
tunnel to   a   sump at the foot of the shaft, from which              it   can be
pumped up, or to send         it  by one pumping direct to the surface.         He
shows that the water, after having worked the engines requisite to
drive the cutting machine and the pumps, would, in any given time,
be in bulk equal to from five to six times that of the chalk which
would be cut in that time. He proposes that the fine shavings of
chalk, as they are cut, should be delivered into            a    mixing machine
(of   adescription   similar   to  that which   he  has  employed   for very many
years for brick-making purposes), where the waste water from the
engines would be united with the shavings of chalk, resulting in the
production of   a  cream containing one part of chalk to six parts of
water in volume       ;   the ordinary cream of      a      brick-field being one
volume of chalk and one volume of water.                He then shows, that by
this process the whole of the material might be continuously delivered
through pipes to the surface, without needing any train accommodation
at all, or any winding apparatus.           This would leave the rails in the
 tunnel perfectly free for the trains bringing the material for the lining
 of the tunnel.  I     stated at the British Association meeting at York
last year   that  at   the  pressure ordinarily used by Sir William Arm-
strong, viz. 700 lbs. on the square inch, 300 horse-power can be con-
veyed through     a   10-inch pipe, with   a     loss in friction of only       per
                                                                                2
 cent, for each mile in length, so that in mid-channel there would be
 no greater loss than 20 per cent.            This plan, having regard to the
 extreme simplicity      of  the   mode which   it     affords of getting rid of
 the excavated material, is,       I    think, well worthy of consideration,
 but  it must be borne in mind that air pipes would still have to
 be laid down, and blowing machinery (although not compressing
 machinery) would have to be erected for the purpose of ventilation,

1882.]     on the   Making and Working   of    a Channel Tunnel.       131
 while when compressed air is used us the motive power, the ventilation
is effected hy the very spent, or exhaust, air from the machine itself.
     Next, as regards the lining of the tunnel.         It must be remem-
bered that in excavating through ordinary soil needing lining, heavy
timbering has to be put up as the work goes forward, and then the
lining has to be executed v* lib. the greatest care, following up the work
as closely as possible, to enable the timber to be removed.     In the case
of the Channel tunnel, made of a truly cylindrical form through such
a material as the grey chalk, which upholds itself so well that it is
doubtful whether there need be any lining at all, no timbering will
be required, and there will be no urgency in putting the lining in.
Moreover, the excavation being of absolutely uniform dimensions,
and of regular shape all round, it will be the simplest thing imagin-
able to make on the surface concrete blocks of just such size as to be
easily lifted by small hydraulic, or compressed air, cranes, and of the
form of the 17 feet curvature outside and the 14 feet curvature
inside ; and without any scaffolding or permanent centering of any
kind, with no more than the appropriate elevating apparatus, this
lining would be laid in the excavation, beginning at the bottom and
working upwards at the two sides, and then over the crown, where
it would be supported by travelling centering mounted upon wheels,
and moved forward as the work progresses.
    Let me ask you to compare in your own minds the condition of
things, as regards ease of excavation, economy, and ventilation which
would obtain in a tunnel thus constructed with that which obtains in a
tunnel such as the St. Gothard, or the Mont Cenis, carried through hard
rock. In the tunnel through the chalk, in lieu of men crowded close
together at the working face tending upon machines to drill holes to
receive cartridges, we have a machine needing the presence of certainly
not more than three men at the outside ; in lieu of the delays occa-
sioned by the withdrawing of the machinery to admit of the holes
being charged with dynamite, and the need of the retreat of the men
to a safe place while the dynamite is exploded, and the interference
with the ventilation caused by this explosion (coupled with the
uncertainty when the explosion has taken place that the shots will
have been satisfactory), and the further delay caused by getting out
the blasted material to put it into waggons and carry it away ; we
have continuous action of the machine, we have no blasting and there-
fore no bad atmosphere produced by       it,  and no uncertainty as to the
effect of the blasts, neither have we any delay in the work while the
material is   being removed and put into the waggons.         Moreover, we
are free from all the dangers attendant upon the use of explosives.
     Then, again, consider our condition as compared with          a tunnel
through an ordinary non-rocky material we have not the expense of
                                           :
providing the timber supports, neither do we require        a   number of
men at work to put them up, thus little ventilation will be needed
because there will be but few men present to vitiate the air, and as
 we employ compressed air locomotives to move our trains of materials
                                                                k  2

 there   will be no horses   ;  and again, when we come to another source
 of vitiation, viz. that arising from the lamps and candles ordinarily-
 used in such work, we discard such means of illumination and by the
 electric light and the incandescent lamp get rid of all that difficulty.
 The preliminary 7-foot heading is now perfectly lighted, without
 any vitiation of air whatever, by means of this electric light.
     Of course it is obvious, that both during the carrying out the
 works of the tunnel, and in the permanent tunnel itself, suitable
 enlargements can be made at intervals to enable sidings to be laid
 in, depots to be provided, and places for the plate-layers and others
 to take refuge in, and    I   should have said that the approach from the
 tunnel to the land is to be made by another tunnel having the
 perfectly workable gradient of 1 in 50.
     I  am aware it may be objected, that even assuming the geologists
are right in their suggestion — that the chalk marl, or grey chalk, does
extend from France to England, and that if excavation can be
pursued throughout in the "craie de Eouen" the case as to the
 facility of execution would be established — there is nothing to show
that this chalk may not be fissured in places, and that, as the excava-
tion is carried forward, it may not come upon one of these fissures,
and so water may flow in.
     To my mind there is the most satisfactory answer to be given
to such an objection as this.         The grey chalk we find is practically
watertight, the fresh water which is in the chalk being in the white
chalk above the grey ; this water finds its way into the sea, as we know,
at the level of the beach.         Moreover there are fissures undoubtedly
in the white chalk,    and  it  is extremely probable that through some of
such fissures the fresh water is flowing upwards into the sea, the fresh
water having come from a greater height than the sea-level, and
having therefore a preponderating force, or head, which would enable
it to flow out against the pressure of the sea, and in that way
such fissures in the white chalk would be kept open notwithstanding
they might be at the bottom of the sea, and in that way also, if
in the white chalk a well were sunk close to the sea and powerful
pumps were put down, drawing more than was supplied to them
by the fresh water coming from inland, these pumps would, in all
probability, very soon begin to draw in salt water, which would come
in the reverse direction to the fresh water, and therefore from the
sea through the fissure which had been kept open by the previously
                                    I
outgoing fresh water. But, as have said, the grey chalk is practically
watertight, and the proof of it is not only that which is seen in the
trial heading, but farther in the fact that it upholds the water in the
white chalk, and that that water goes out into the sea above the
grey chalk.     It is well known it is idle to sink a well into the grey
chalk with the object of obtaining water.          This being so, assume
that in bygone times, by some agency,        I do not know what, a fissure
had been made in the grey chalk where it is exposed in the bed of
the sea, what would happen to that fissure? no fresh water could flow

out by        for by the hypothesis, the grey chalk being impermeable,
              it,
there     isno fresh water in         to flow outwards, and no salt water could
                                          it
continue to flow through                 inwards, for there

go to.     There   must be   therefore     an   entirely stagnant      condition    within
this fissure. It      not suggested that the water of the English Channel
                         is
is   free from sedimentary matter.                 Granted this state of things,                      it
appears to me to be inevitable that in process of time such                        fissure, a
having     in     stagnant
                    it        water,    must     have   been   filled  up   with  the   de-
positable     matter  that        in isthe    sea,  and   must    thereby   have   become
closed and puddled up.               therefore look upon

the experimental heading, for when the experimental heading                            once     is
through,     then  we may    be   said    to   know    all  about    the   nature   of  the
stratification, and all uncertainty, and all danger of surprise are at an

filling it up where the trial heading is to pass through, say a fissure
4 or 5 feet wide, and     I will take it that we are so far below the sur-
face   of the sea that  the pressure amounts to 150 lbs. per square inch,
or a little under 10 tons to the square foot. The 7-foot heading
contains 38 superficial feet area, so that the pressure of the water
endways against it would be about 380 tons.             A single hydraulic
press has been made to give 1000 tons pressure ; 380 tons therefore
is an every-day load for a single hydraulic press.         One 20-inch ram
would deal with it at only a ton to the circular inch.
     I  will now ask you to look at the diagram showing the apparatus
by   which   such a fissure could be passed. You will see, fixed into the
walls of the excavation, a ring containing a stuffing-box, or it may be
a cup-leather such as that used for an hydraulic press ; through this
stuffing-box would slide, water-tight, a horizontal iron vessel, or
tube, of nearly the full diameter of the bore of the trial heading
of 50, 70, or 100 feet long, as might be needed, and provided
with cutting tools in front set to the full diameter of that bore.
This vessel or tube would be open-ended towards the fissure, but
would be close-ended towards the trial heading. It would be made
capable of slow revolution, and capable of being pushed forward
by hydraulic presses having a large margin of power. Water would
then be forced in by a pipe led from the stuffing-box to the space
between the outside of the vessel and the inside of the heading, and
this water would be pumped at a pressure somewhat greater than
that produced by the sea, say if the sea give 150 lbs., then this water
should be, pumped in at 160 lbs.           The result of this arrangement
would be that before the fissure was reached, and before the sea
pressure came upon the tube, the parts would be subjected to a
pressure greater than that of the sea, and therefore all the working
parts, instead of being exposed to any shock when the sea pressure
came on, would absolutely be thereby relieved to a slight extent.
The vessel would be slowly revolved, and by its cutting tools would
cut its way forward, the material being washed into the interior of
the vessel by the water pumped into the annular space on its outside ;
and until communication with the fissure was made, the material would
be allowed to flow out in a regulated manner just enough to preserve
a current.    It will be seen that this is nothing more than a horizontal
boring crown, such as is commonly used by the Diamond Boring
Company, with a current of water at the working-face for continuously
washing away the debris.         Under these circumstances the operation
would go on until the vessel had advanced, not only to the fissure,
but through the fissure and to the opposite side, and had cut into that
opposite side a sufficient distance.
     It may be said that when all this was accomplished there would
still be left a leakage space round about the end of the vessel as it lay
in the cavity itself had made on the opposite side of the fissure, this
space being equal to the projection of the cutters from the vessel, but  I
will show you this could be closed in the readiest manner possible.

1882.]        on the Making and Working of a Channel Tunnel.           135
In the thickness of the metal of the vessel there would be several
grooves, each containing an elastic tube ; during the passage of the
vessel these would be empty, and would lie below the line of its outer
circumference, as shown on the detailed figure, but each tube would have
a separate pipe leading through the thickness of the metal of the vessel.
When the fissure was passed, water would be pumped along these pipes,
swelling out the tubes, so as to press hard against the surface of
the excavation.      In this way a perfect joint would be ensured, and
this being obtained, the water would be let out from the inside
of the vessel, it would be ascertained that all was tight, the man-
hole doors would then be removed, the block of chalk that was
in the vessel would be cut to pieces and carried out, and the
result would be that the fissure would be bridged by an iron
cylindrical vessel water-tight in the chalk at both ends. Then the
end of the vessel would be taken away, and the trial heading would
be complete across the fissure.     I need hardly say that before these
appliances were put to work in the heading there would be a thorough
rehearsal in some chalk cliff, or other suitable place, on the surface,
provision being made to give the full water-pressure.
     If  it be objected that this, although a feasible operation with a
7-foot diameter hole, would not be a feasible one with 14 feet diameter,
the answer to it is that there is no increase in difficulty whatever ;
the area becomes four times as great, or, allowing the extra diameter
needed for the lining, not quite six times as great, and the pressure to
be resisted, instead of being about 400 tons, becomes 2400 tons ; but
such a pressure as this is, as  I have said, perfectly under control.
     Assuming, however, the grey chalk to be continuous from side to
side,  I  believe  I have been most unnecessarily occupying your time
by the details of an apparatus which will never be needed ; for   I   must
be allowed to repeat once more that     I cannot conceive an open fissure
existing in a material where there can have been no flow of water,
either out, or in, through the fissure, to keep it open.
     I  could say much more upon the construction of the tunnel did
time admit of it ; but     I must close this first branch of my subject
now, and must ask you to consider with me the second branch — The
 Working of a Channel Tunnel.
    Whatever may be the future of the ordinary locomotive, whether
it be destined to be improved and to continue, or whether it be destined
to be superseded by electricity, or by some new motor utilising the
energy stored up in the fuel directly and without the intervention of
water, no one can doubt that those who at the present time are re-
sponsible for the working of railways would prefer to retain for use
in the Channel tunnel the ordinary well-known locomotive, if for no
other reason than this — that the existing stock of the railway com-
panies on the two sides of the tunnel would suffice for the haulage of
 the trains, and that no special preparation need be made.     But in the

ordinary locomotive, for moving the trains.
    Not excluding the ordinary locomotive from the list, we find these
modes are as follows —                     :
       Ordinary Locomotives.

      With respect  to No.   the ordinary locomotive, this, as you know,
                                                 1,
is  the mode of traction adopted in the Mont Genis, and in the
St. Gothard tunnels.      The Channel tunnel, provided with two roads,
one for the  trains  going one way, and the other for the trains going
in the reverse direction, would have the advantage over the Mont
Cenis and the St. Gothard, that currents uniformly flowing in one
and the same direction could be maintained in each roadway, and
calculations have been made by Mr. Low showing that with the full
allowance for the quantity of coke burnt per mile      would be possible               it
to effectually ventilate this tunnel, which after all         only three                    is
times as long as the Mont Cenis and           little more than twice as a
long as the St. Gothard, and         possible, that having regard to the
                                                        it   is
extreme convenience of using in the tunnel the same type of engine
as will be employed on either side of       the ordinary locomotive will
                                                                      it,
be adopted.       have been through the Mont Cenis tunnel many times
                               I
and have never felt the slightest inconvenience.
     But however desirable       may be on various grounds that the
                                                       it
ordinary locomotive should be used, and however much one         justified                        is
in that use by the example of the Mont Cenis and the St. Gothard,
where (unlike the plan proposed for the Channel tunnel) there         only                             is
one opening for the trains running in both directions, and the currents
of air are thereby baffled,   appears to me we shall do well to consider
                                                  it
the other modes of train traction that     have enumerated.       I

 1882.]     on the   Making and Working of a Gliannel Tunnel.                137
      The first of these is the fireless locomotive ; which, as you pro-
  bably are aware, is driven by the stored-up energy in the very
  highly heated water, under considerable pressure, with which a
  vessel representing a boiler is charged.         These locomotives have
  been used to a slight extent upon tramways, but none yet constructed
  contain an adequate store of energy for the passage of a Channel
  tunnel.
      As improved by Dr. Siemens, however, it is not by any means
  clear that they could not suffice for that purpose — his proposition
  being, that in addition to the energy stored up in the heated water,
  there should be another store in the form of heated fire-brick disposed
 as in the regenerator for one of his furnaces, and that, in this way,
 heat should be communicated to the water during the whole passage
 of the train.
    I    am by no means prepared to say that an engine thus fitted
 could not successfully make the passage of the tunnel, and if it could,
 the only way in which it would affect the air in it would be, that the
 escape steam from the engine would issue into the atmosphere of
 the tunnel, and by its condensation would keep that air moist. It
 is true this objection might be got over by carrying a considerable
 weight of cold water in the train to condense the steam, or by a
 surface condenser cooled by currents of air.
      The next mode of moving the trains      I   have suggested is that of
ropes.     These, as you know, were worked on the Blackwall Railway
 for very many years and with a certain amount of success, but if
there were separate ropes to each roadway, as there were to the
Blackwall Railway, stopping and starting for each train, it would not
be possible to have more than one train in each roadway at a time,
     I
and trust the Channel tunnel traffic will be far larger than would
be consistent with that state of things.       And if on the other hand an
endless rope were used, up the one roadway and down the other (each
rope of course might be divided into sections driven from engines at
each end), then although any number of trains could be running at any
one time in each roadway, the whole traffic of the tunnel would be
stopped on both roads if one of these ropes were to break.               I am
inclined, therefore, to think this system, although free from sinning
against the purity of the air, should not be accepted.
    I   now come to the electric mode of moving trains.         Such a mode
is free from any objection as regards vitiating the air.           It neither
consumes   it,  nor does  it  generate carbonic acid, or carbonic oxide, nor
doesit    deliver steam.     Looking at the advance that has been made in
the applications of electricity to industry, and among these applica-
tions to the instances wherein electricity has been employed for the
propulsion of tramcars and railway trains, he would be         a    bold man
who ventured to predict that in the course of the next two or three
years electricity may not be thoroughly well established as          a   pro-
pelling agent    for trains.
     Indeed, there   is this Session before Parliament   a   Bill, which has,
I   believe, passed the House of Commons, for the establishment of

138                      Sir      FredericJc   Bramwell              [May 19,
an electric railway between Charing Cross and the Waterloo Station ;
and it is therefore by no means improbable that by the
                                                       (I trust) very
few years within which the Channel tunnel will be ready for the
reception and working of its trains, electric propulsion may have
been so far developed as to render its employment in that tunnel
judicious.
     The next system I   adverted to was the pneumatic, that wherein a
train is driven along by a very slight differential air-pressure exerted
over the area of a piston loosely fitting the tunnel. This mode of pro-
pulsion is one that ensures the most ample ventilation, in fact not
merely ample but even unnecessary, that it is to say, it involves the
changing of the whole of the air in the tunnel at the passage of every
train.    It will be fo*und, however, that although admirable for
working the traffic of a subterranean Metropolitan line with stations
at frequent intervals and with very numerous trains, it would not be
a very economical mode of working trains through a tunnel 20 miles
long ; the skin resistance to the passage of the air even at moderate
velocities being so great as to involve the consumption of a large
amount of horse -power.
     The last of the modes of propulsion that             I
                                                     enumerated, is that
wherein there is the employment of compressed air, and, setting
aside the electrical mode which, as            I
                                         have said, may, by the time the
tunnel is ready for traffic, be so far developed as to be the most
advantageous of all, compressed air is the one that commends itself
most to my mind.     This system of propulsion is now by no means an
experiment.    In carrying it out, as probably you are aware, there are
employed in the train reservoirs of air compressed to any desired
extent by means of compressing engines, and this air, on being
allowed to escape from these reservoirs through engines practically
of the nature of the ordinary steam engines, drives them, and by
them draws the train.
     Several modes of employing compressed air have been proposed
and have been put to work, among others one by Colonel Beaumont,
but the mode with which       I
                             am best acquainted, and about which there-
fore  I am the most competent to speak to you, is that which has been
in practical work every day for now nearly three years at Nantes. In
that town there is a service of tramcars starting every ten minutes
from each end of the line, which is 3f miles long, and traversing the
very heart of the town and the busiest part of                 it,
                                                          running for      a
considerable distance along the quay, which          one of the leading
                                                          is

     In this system the air     compressed to only 30 atmospheres, and
                                  is
is  allowed to escape by ingenious, but simple, means at regulated
pressures to drive the engine, but prior to passing into the engine        it
is heated by traversing   avessel containing hot water and steam under
 pressure, which are charged into the vessel before leaving the depot.
 The bulk of the cars employed contain their own reservoirs and their
own engines, but on holidays, and on busy days, cars in the nature of

1882.]          on the   Making and Working of a Channel Tunnel.                        139
locomotives are used, drawing a train behind them, and such cars as
these make the outward and homeward journey, or 7^ miles in all,
without requiring any replenishment with air. No doubt the reservoirs,
to contain a sufficient store of air to propel the train through the whole
length of the tunnel, would be heavy, but they would be but little, if
at all, heavier than the weight of the tender with its load of water
and coals, added to the weight of the boiler with its charge of water,
both of which are needed in the working of an ordinary locomotive,
but are not wanted when compressed air engines are used.                   But
there    is,
           however, no occasion whatever to carry the whole charge of
air needed for the entire journey through the tunnel                there will
                                                                       ;
remain in the completed tunnel the air-pipe that was laid down to
drive the perforating machinery.           This air-pipe can be always kept
charged     with air.   Valves  will  be  provided at frequent intervals, and
thus it  will be perfectly possible to re-charge the reservoirs, habitually
at an intermediate station, or indeed anywhere (say within an eighth
of  a
       mile) on the line, should such re-charging from any accidental
cause be needed.       The great advantage of compressed-air propulsion,
under such circumstances as those which prevail in                  tunnel 20
                                                                       a
miles long,        that every train which goes through, instead of using
                   is
and vitiating the air,       in its very progression the cause of thorough
                            is
and efficient ventilation.
     As have said, working by compressed air

                     a
use for several years in France      ; and
                                         I    trust that before many months
are over   it will be seen in equally successful daily use in London, and,
subject to the development of electrical propulsion, and subject to the
great temptation to use the ordinary locomotive,               appears to me,
                                                                  it

I     have said, that compressed air       is  that one of all the modes by
which    a train can be moved which commends itself to one's judgment

may be prevented, and       I will illustrate my meaning by showing how

140                             Sir Frederick Bramwell                         [May 19,
    No doubt most of you are aware of the way in which points, and
switch-locks, and gates at level crossings, are interlocked with the
signal apparatus. You know that arrangements are made by which it
is impossible, for example, that a signal can be given to invite a train
to approach until the gate of a level crossing, which should be closed
against the common road, is closed ; and conversely, when that gate
is closed to the common road and is open to the railway, the same
arrangements prevent the moving of the gate during the time there
is exhibited a signal inviting the train to approach — in the first case
the signal must remain at danger, in the second case the gate must
remain closed to the common road.                 I
                                        presume most of you are aware,
as I  have said, that such an arrangement as this exists.    propose to    I
apply it for the stopping of my smugglers, and to do so by the follow-
ing means.
   Let me ask you to imagine that there is to be at the outlet of the
tunnel, on the surface, a building of great strength, to prevent the
possibility of hardy smugglers escaping from                it,
                                                   and with station accom-
modation of such length as to contain the longest train ever known.
In this building the custom house should be situated. At the outer
end there would be strong iron grating, so that while that was closed
                       a
no smuggler could jump out of the train and run out into the open
country, and at the hinder end of             it,
                                          towards the tunnel, there would
be a   similar strong iron grating, which would prevent any smuggler
jumping out of the train and endeavouring to run back through the
 tunnel to France.     These strong iron gratings would be connected by
 the interlocking machinery, which would be concealed deep down in
 the rock, and would be of such      character that although both gratings
                                         a
 might be shut at one time, by no possibility could one grating be
 opened until the other one was fully closed, and this machinery would
 be worked, not from within the station at all, but from place exteriora
 to   it,
        the person working      having
                                    it   view through the grating of what
                                              a
 was going on. The result of such an arrangement would be this, that
 on train arriving from the Continent and pulling up at the custom
   a
 house, having in      smugglers, and
                      it                will take an extreme case, and say
                                              I
 even full  of  smugglers, that train would find    closed grating in front
                                                             a
 of it. The custom-house officers make their examination while they        ;
 are doing so, persons outside the station by the apparatus close the
  grating in the rear of the train; the train            now between two
                                                                  is
 gratings, and we will assume that the officials inside the station find
 out that the train       full of smugglers, and that thereupon
                           is                                        differ-   a
 ence of opinion arises between the smugglers and the custom-house
 officers, and    may be that the passengers being desperate characters
                 it
 intent on smuggling, overpower the custom-house officers.         But even
  when they had done that            appears to me they would be, as
                                         it
                     " in    very parlous case," for the persons outside
  Shakspeare says,              a
  who have the command of the apparatus which works the gates,
  seeing what    isgoing on, do not use               it,
                                               but they go to the nearest
  police station and bring down the police, or, in the assumed case of

1882.]        on the    Making and Working of a Cliannel Tunnel.               141
the train being full of smugglers, it may be they go to the nearest
fortress and bring down a regiment or two of soldiers ; but in any
event it seems to me that the smugglers would be very badly off, and
if there had been a still more numerous body of smugglers needing
a second train, that second train when it arrived near the mouth of
the tunnel would find itself barred by the inner gate, and the occu-
pants of it could not afford much aid to their comrades who were
already caged in the custom house.
    I  have said    I
                    undertook not to enter into any contentious matter,
but nobody    has  suggested that there is any danger of smuggling, and
I  have thought therefore nobody could be offended at my proposal
of a means of putting a stop to        it,
                                        should any one hereafter suggest,
that among the dangers arising from          Channel tunnel
                                             a                 that of the
                                                                 is
surreptitious  introduction   of goods.
     Such an arrangement as       I have described would,    seems to me,
                                                             it
be free from any one of the three objections urged against other
plans for stopping the advent of undesirable persons.          It will be
seen that as the apparatus must be worked at the passage of every
train,   itwould escape objection No.         which
                                             1,        is,
                                                         that any special
arrangement to be employed only on an emergency would be of no
service when that emergency arose, because from want of use,        would it
be sure to be out of order.      Further, from the circumstance of this
habitual use   it would escape objection No.      which is, that when the
                                                  2,
special arrangement     was  needed  on an  emergency, even if    were not
                                                                     it
out of order,    itwould be practically useless, because the men, not
being in the habit of working it, would lose their presence of mind,
and would fail to do the right thing at the right time         and lastly,
                                                                 ;
this same habitual employment of the apparatus to every train would
get over the third objection, for     would prevent the suggestion being
                                      it
made that any one train was treated with suspicion, while previous
trains had been allowed to pass unchallenged, as by the plan                   I
propose all trains would be treated alike and no invidious distinctions
would be made.
    Moreover, there would be no loss of time, as there would be no
delay beyond that which must occur somewhere for custom house
purposes.
    Bear with me for another minute while         Idescribe to you    very a
simple   but effectual  arrangement   which  might be used as an adjunct
to the double-grated station.      Let there be made at the end of the
tunnel, just before     reached the bottom of the shaft,
                        it                                  turntable, say
                                                             a
100 feet in diameter and 10 or 20 feet below the level of the tunnel             ;
on this turntable place       acylindrical block of concrete, say 35 to
40 feet high, and cased all round in armour plate, and line the tunnel
at each side of this circular block with armour-plate.       Through the
concrete block and its armour-plate let the tunnel be carried, so that,
when the turntable with its block of armour-cased concrete stood in
one position, the tunnel would be continuous, straight through the
concrete block, but, when the turntable was revolved one quarter of             a

142               Sir F. Bramwell   on the  Channel Tunnel.       [May 19,
turn, the opening through it would be transverse to the line of the
tunnel, which would at that time be therefore effectually stopped by
the armour-plated case of the block.
    I  know you will say " Why this is nothing more than a stop-
cock !
       "
          I  agree that is all that it is, but it would be a very effectual
one, and as it would be turned hydraulically, it could be worked from
Dover Castle, if it were thought desirable ; and         I  fancy that any
soldiers — 1 beg pardon,   I should have said smugglers — who came along
the tunnel and found the end closed with a smooth curved wall of
armour-plate that could not be moved and, short of battering by a
hundred-ton gun, could not be injured, would begin to sorrowfully
retrace their steps.
    In conclusion, let me thank you for the kind attention with
which you have honoured me to night, and let me express my hope,
and  I trust your hope, that no idle apprehension of increased facilities
for smuggling to be afforded by a Channel tunnel, nor, as at this last
moment of my lecture      I  am all but tempted to say, any equally idle
fear of invasion, will stop, or even delay, the execution of one of the
most useful works that even this nineteeth century, prolific as it has
been in works of great utility, has seen proposed.

                        Sacred Laws       of  the  Hindus.
The speaker began by referring to the introduction of the study of
Sanscrit, by Sir William Jones, who, on becoming an Indian Judge,
found it needful to consult the Hindu law in the original.                 The law-
books of Manu, which he translated, were by him dated about 1200 B.C.,
and believed to be the work of one man; it is now considered by Sanscrit
scholars to be a modern portion of a long-continued series, and it has
even been dated as late as about 1300 a.d.             They are in verse. Much
more ancient books,     the   earliest  in  the   form    of aphorisms, have been
discovered, the work of schools of learned Brahmins during many ages.
They are essentially religious and liturgical, teaching what men ought
to know and do from life to death — theology and morals.                  There is a
perfect continuity   of  life  which    runs   in  a  stream,   returning in itself,
and the doctrine    of  the   transmigration       of  souls   pervades the whole
system ; the soul of a vicious man enters the body of one of the
lowest animals ; that of a holy person may be at once united to God.
Punishment for sins was also separately effected in twenty-two hells or
purgatories; and men were exhorted to torment themselves in this
world, to escape worse hereafter.          As time went on, the king, whose
office in early times was chiefly to enforce penances, became a judge,
the chief of a tribunal, and eventually a code of civil law was con-
stituted. The inheritance of property was intimately connected with
ancestor worship.     When a Brahmin became old he became a hermit,
and his property was divided amongst his sons, whose bounden duty
it was at his death to appease his spirit by sacrifices.               The earnest
desire for sons led often to extraordinary forms of artificial sonship,
of which Adoption was only one. The authority of the Brahmins was
exorbitant ; they enjoyed immunity from the sanctions of the criminal
laws, and were believed even to have a certain degree of power over
the gods.    They were priests, legislators, and rulers. On a full ex-
amination, their influence is considered to be rather evil than good ;
and to this may be attributed the many misfortunes of India.                    The
Hindoo mind now is turning towards Western culture and civilisation,
and the future government of India, which has to respect both
Western and Eastern principles, is a very delicate problem.

                           The Excitability of Plants.*
                        Part I. Animal Excitability.
The subject which       I  have to bring before you this evening may be
best   defined  as relating to one of the essential endowments of proto-
plasm, i. e. of the living material out of which the forms of animal
and plant life are moulded.         It is one which -we associate rather with
the nature of animals than with that of plants, though it is common
to both. In every kind of living matter we are able to observe an
alternation between quiescence and activity ; and that the transi-
tion from the former to the latter is determined by external influences,
in other words, excited by stimuli.          But in general we confine the
term excitability to those cases in which the transition is sudden and
obvious, and particularly to those in which it is attended or followed
by visible changes of form of the excited parts.
     When, in 1874, 1 had the honour of giving an address on a subject
included in the present,        I  had to announce what was then a new
discovery, namely,      that a  phenomenon    which had been long known to
be characteristic    of  the transition  from  rest to action in animal proto-
plasm also manifested itself in the plant. In all animal structures
which are excitable or irritable, i.e. which possess the property of
being suddenly called into action when excited, it is found that the
waking up — the transition from rest to action — is attended by an
electrical disturbance which is of short duration, precedes action, and
follows excitation.
     It is well known that there    "—
                                        are parts of plants which show the
same    kind  of " wakeableness         which  pass suddenly from quiescence
into motion when stimulated ; but until 1873 the question had not
been asked whether, here also, the going into action is attended with
electrical change ?

morning in that year, that if such were found to be the case it would
afford strong confirmation of the view to which he had been led by
entirely different considerations, of the close relation which subsists
between the essential vital processes of plants and animals,     I under-
took at once to examine into the subject.     It was the rough result of
that inquiry that   I brought before you in 1874.     What we expected
to observe was observed.     It was found that in the leaf of Dioncea
rnuscipnla, which was selected as the example of plant-excitability
best adapted for the purpose, the touching of the sensitive hairs was
immediately followed by an electrical disturbance, which preceded
the visible motion of the leaf.   As the electrical phenomena observed
strikingly resembled those which present themselves under similar
conditions in animals, there seemed no room for doubt that the analogy
which had suggested the discovery was a true one. But in 1876,
Professor Munk, of Berlin, an animal physiologist of the highest
reputation, published an elaborate paper on Dionssa, in which, while
he admitted that the facts which had been recorded were in the main
true, and that a real relation existed between the electrical disturbance
which follows excitation in Dionaea and the so-called " negative
           "
variation     of animal physiology, he charged me with having entirely
misinterpreted and misunderstood that relation ; and in 1877 another
still more important research was published by Dr. Kunkel, in which
the question was approached       from the side of plant-physiology.
Professor Kunkel's experiments related not to Dionsea but to Mimosa.
His conclusions were as directly opposed to those of Dr. Munk as
they were to mine ; for his main position was that all electromotive
phenomena observed in the organs of plants, are dependent on changes
in the distribution of water in their tissues, and consequently have
nothing whatever in common with the electromotive phenomena of
muscle and nerve.      Even had there not been other good reasons for
resuming the investigation of the subject, this contradiction of opinion
would have rendered it necessary.
     Every one who contemplates the behaviour of the sensitive plant,
or of the Flytrap, is led to exclaim :   If it had but nerves we could
understand it !     Let us for a moment inquire what there is in nerve
which these animal-plants seem to require. The question is easily
answered.      Nerve is the channel by which, in the animal body, the
influence of any change which takes place in one part of the organism
is conveyed to other parts at a distance, independently of the trans-
mission of any sensible motion.         Haller, who is well called the
father of physiology, sought to explain the propagation of influence
in nerve, from the organ of the will to the muscles which it governs,
by the transmission of motion of liquid contained in a tube (as in
this little apparatus in which my hand represents the will, the long
flexible tube the nerve, and the indicator at its farther end the
muscle).     It is more than a century since Haller made this com-
parison, but even then he was behind his time, for a greater than he
— Newton — had clearly recognised that the process by which the

brain becomes cognisant of what goes on at the surface of the body
cannot be attributed to the communication of any visible or sensible
motion. Newton, although at that time no one had ever seen nerve-
fibres as we now see them under the microscope, yet described
them with perfect truth as " pellucid and uniform hair-like fila-
ments," in which vibratory motion could be propagated.* This con-
ception Haller, who was certainly not wanting in imagination,
rejected. Failing to understand that the thrills which Newton con-
templated were of an order far more subtile than those of sound, he
argued that, if the function of nerve were dependent on the propaga-
tion of vibratory motion, these would so interfere one with another,
that all distinctness of impression and of action would be lost, &c.
Haller's doctrine of the nerve-fluid held undisputed sway for a
century ; we have still traces of it in the language used by medical
writers.    But the notions which we now entertain on nerve-function
are much more allied to those of Newton — so like, indeed, that they
might be clothed in his language.
     The transmission of an impression, i. e. of a state of excitation in
a nerve, has been justly compared to the propagation of a mechanical
disturbance along a row of card houses, so arranged that the collapse
of any one of them necessarily determines that of its neighbours.
Such a structure exhibits the properties assigned by Newton to the
pellucid capillamenta of nerves, its card houses corresponding to the
particles of which the pellucid substance was conceived by him to be
made up.     In the one case, as in the other, a disturbance (excitation)
which originates at any point is propagated in either direction, reaching
its goal in a time which is proportional to the distance travelled.
     A still better illustration is furnished by the propagation of an ex-
plosion. Here, for example, is a train of gun-cotton. "f When excite    I
the end of the nerve with a match, a blaze runs along to the opposite
end, of which you can easily trace the progress, and      in repeating the

midway by       aweight, you see plainly enough that propagation               is
retarded at the obstacle.
     The main ground for the statement          have made to you, that the

pagation of an explosion, lies in the proof first given by Helmholtz,
that time  is lost in the transmission of excitatory effects along nerves,
and that the time       is proportional to the distance.     This     will
                                                                       I

  t    Mr. Abel, with the greatest kindness, enabled me to illustrate this part of
the lecture by experiments, showing how, according to the nature of the ex-
plosive substance, the velocity of propagation  isvery different, though the mode
of propagation  is the same.

pinching, descriptive anatomy teaches me that these approach the
surface sufficiently closely to be within reach of induction currents
led through at the skin, at two places, namely, above the collar-bone
and at the bend of the elbow.                                 I
                                       If, by the means have indicated,             I
excite    the  nerve  at  either  of  these   points, the hand involuntarily
pinches, but if    I  measure the time which elapses in the two cases
between the excitation and the muscular response,                I   find it to be
different — the difference being the measure of the time occupied by
the excitatory change, from the clavicle to the bend of the arm.*
     The experiment you have seen not only serves to illustrate the
resemblance between the propagation of the excitatory state and that
of an explosion, but also to exhibit the contrast between them.                 It is
common to all excitable structures, whether of plant or animal, that,
provided the intervals are not too short, the excitations can be repeated
any number of times without losing their effect, a fact which can only
be explained on the hypothesis that in such structures provision
exists for the immediate recuperation of lost energy ; or, in other words,
that the machinulaB which take part in the propagation of the excita-
tory disturbance are endowed with the faculty of quickly recovering
their original condition, so as to be ready for another excitation.f
     In bringing before you these elementary facts relating to animal
excitability, my object is to use them in the comparison we shall
shortly have to make between animals and plants in respect of this
property.      From the last experiment we have learnt, in addition to
the fact which it was specially intended to illustrate, that the sudden
change of form of a muscle which we call its contraction is of such a
nature that the structure shortens in one direction only, and that it
gains in thickness in the same proportion that it diminishes in
length.      The experiment further illustrates the fact that a muscle
does not contract of itself, but that it undergoes this change only
when it is directly or mediately excited.               Bearing these facts in
mind,    I would ask your attention to some further characteristics of
    * The measurement is effected by recording the muscular action
                                                                                 on a
blackened glass plate, which is so fixed to a pendulum that its surface is parallel
with the plane of oscillation. The pendulum is allowed to make a single
swing from right to left, and in doing so strikes a trigger, the effect of which is to
excite the nerve by an induction shock at one or other of the points indicated.
Two experiments were made at the lecture in immediate succession, in one of
which the nerve was excited at the more distant, in the other at the nearer point.
The difference of time between the two records, calculated from the distance
from each other of the two tracings, was about T ^ of a second.       As the distance
was about 13 inches, this gives about 66 metres per second as the rate of trans-
mission.    This result was probably not far from the truth, but the reader will
understand that a measurement made under the conditions of a lecture experi-
ment could not be relied on.
    t The extreme shortness of the interval of time between successive excitations
of muscle was illustrated by an experiment in which the rheoscopic limb of a
frog was kept in repeated spasmodic action by the voice of the lecturer acting on
a telephone of which the wires were in contact with the nerve.

our purpose.
    The first of these               is,
                              that in every such process the visible

molecular changes must be in progress.      With suitable appliances                      it

are of the same nature as in common muscle, the interval between
excitation and response, amounting to about        sixth of    second,

 For this purpose we have arranged the ventricle of the heart of                           a

the electrodes being applied one at the base the other at the apex.
 The galvanometer        so arranged that the image

to the apex, the image shoots off in direction which indicates that

acquainted with the mechanism by which the excitable motions of
plants are brought about,          I   will confine myself to a very few
examples, selecting, of course, those which have been most carefully
investigated.
    Every one is acquainted with the general aspect of the sensitive
plant.   Probably, also, most persons have observed the way in which
the leaves behave when one of them is touched, namely, that the leaf,
instead of being directed upwards, suddenly falls, as if it had lost its

from the side-stalks fold together upwards (Fig. 1). But perhaps
every one has not observed exactly how this motion is accomplished,
namely, that by means of little cylindrical organs the leaflets are

 jointed on to side-stalks, the side-stalk on to the principal stalk, and
  the principal stalk on to the stem.              In those little cylinders, the
 powers of motion of the leaf have their seat. They may, therefore, be
  called the motor organs of Mimosa.               I  would ask your attention to
  their structure.
       In my description         I will confine myself to the relatively large
 joint at the base of the principal leaf-stalk.              If you make a section
 through it in the direction of its length, you find that it consists of
 the following parts. In the axis of the cylinder is a fibro-vascular
 bundle ; above it are numerous layers of roundish cells with thick
 walls, and between these there exist everywhere intercellular spaces,
 which in the resting — that is the excitable — state of the organ, are
 filled with air. The surface is covered by epidermis. Below the axial
 bundle there are equally numerous layers of cells, but they differ from
 the others in this respect, that their walls are more delicate (Fig. 2).
 And now let us study the mechanism of the motion. The literature

     vessels, surrounded by a layer (annular in section) of elongated cells.  The paren-
     chyma is thicker below than above the vascular bundle.         The section fails to
     show that the cells of the upper half have thicker walls.

knowledge we possess to two observers — E. Briicke,* who studied it
in 1848, and Pfeffer,| whose work appeared in 1873.                   I  must content
myself     with    the most   rapid summary.
      Let me begin by noticing that Mimosa, in common with many
other excitable plants, exhibits that remarkable phenomenon which

excitation, the two effects are not identical.       The state of sleep differs

in the state of sleep, but are still excitable, for when they are
touched they sink to an even lower position than that of sleep, and at
the same time become limp.               Hence you have, as the result of
excitation, two changes, namely (1) the change of position, only to be
observed     when the plant           awake, and (2) the loss of stiffness,
                                              is

motor organ at the base of its stalk, requires no experiment. We see
that the leaf descends, the joint bends, while the stalk remains rigid,

We begin by taking away the upper half, leaving the axial bundle
and the lower half, and find that the leaf assumes              higher position a
than before. When touched,            falls.  The function of the upper part,

in the unexcited state      capable of bearing the weight of the leaf. When

do this    ?We will proceed to remove the axial bundle.            The cellular
cushion expands and lengthens, showing that                  elastic, and has
                                                                      it   is                            a
tendency to spring out when liberated. We have seen that this

 resistent cushion consists of cells, that is, of little bladders, each of
  which is distended with liquid ; and its tendency to expand as a
  whole is due to the tendency to expand of the innumerable cells of
  which it is made up.           In the unmutilated state, these are squeezed
  into a smaller space than that which they would assume if they were
 left to themselves ; and, consequently, as their expansion is prevented,
 or curbed on one side, it acts on the opposite side, so as to bend the
 cylinder in the direction of the restraint.
       All of this we can, perhaps, better understand by a model ; and it
 is possible to make one which, not only in form, but in principle,
 corresponds to the living mechanism it is intended to illustrate.                In
 the model the axial bundle is represented by a strip of leather, the
  innumerable cells of the excitable cushion by an india-rubber bag.
  By a pump we are able to fill this cell or cushion more or less with
  fluid, and thus to vary its tension, and you see that if we increase the
 tension, the stem rises.         By diminution it suddenly falls, just as the
 Mimosa leaf does when irritated.
       We have come then to this point — that the reason why the leaf
 suddenly sinks on excitation is that the cells undergo a sudden
 diminution of tension or expansion.                But our inquiry is not yet
 terminated.        We have still to ask — How is this loss of tension
 effected ?     The answer     is,  by discharge of water.      In the unexcited
 state all these cells are distended or charged with liquid.             Suddenly,
 when the structure      is    excited, they let out or discharge that liquid,
 and it    finds its way first into the inter-cellular air spaces, and secondly,
 out of the motor organ altogether.            This we know to be fact by an a
experiment of Pfeffer's, which must be regarded as one of the most
 important relating to the mechanism of plants that was ever made.
 He observed that   if      the leaf-stalk      cut off from the motor organ,
                                                is                                 a
 drop of fluid appears at the cut surface at the moment that the latter
bends downwards on excitation, and that in the experiment described
just now, in which the upper part of the motor organ                  cut off, there
                                                                        is
is   also,  so to  speak,a    sweating   of liquid from  the cut  surface.
      We are, therefore, certain that liquid escapes, but why does               it
escape    ?    That
                 I       shall explain farther on, and will now proceed to
two other examples.             One   is   aplant which        great favourite in

a   very transitory purpose, the property itself              transitory.
                                                               is             When
 the cells of the stigmatic surface are touched they discharge their
 liquid contents, and consequently become limp. The outer layer of
 the lip  is   elastic, and tends to bend inwards.        Consequently when the
 inner cells lose their elastic resilience           it  able to act, and the lip
                                                          is
 bends inwards.           In another allied plant, Goldfussia anisophylla
 (Fig. 3),      which    was     described forty years ago by the Belgian
 naturalist Morren, we have the same mechanism.                  In this plant, as

    the style is in the unexcited state, and is curved upwards, so that the stigmatic
    surface looks towards the mouth of the corolla.          On excitation it suddenly
    assumes the position shown in the second figure, the stigma looking towards the
    roots of the collecting hairs.

    on each side, and partly conceals the fifth lobe or labellum.

 shown in the drawing, the style is not lipped but awl-shaped. It
reaches    to the mouth of the showy, orange-coloured corolla, to the
 inside of which it is united by its under surface.                 It has a smooth
 side, the epidermis        of which    is  made    up    of  numerous      small pris-
 matic cells and is very elastic, and, in the unexcited state, concave,
 and a papillated side beset with the nipple-like ends of cylindrical
 cells, which, when unexcited, are distended with liquid.                         These
cylindrical    cells  are  continuous     with   those    of  the   conducting tissue
of the style. When          an insect  enters   the   flower,   it does   two things :
it charges the fringe of hairs on the inside of the corolla with pollen,
and touches the style, which, in consequence, bends suddenly in the
opposite direction to that in which it was bent before, so as to plunge
its stigmatic surface into the fringe.              In this motion the epidermis
acts as a spring simply.         So  long   as the   stigmatic tissue is turgid it
cannot act.     The moment its cells lose their tension, off it goes.*
     Another plant investigated by Morren is one of very different
organisation, but is one in which the existence of excitability has an
equally plain teleological interpretation.               Long ago Kobert Brown,
to whom plant-lore owes so much, when exploring the flora of Botany
 Bay, became acquainted with the now well-known Australian plant
called Stylidium.f [A specimen from the Boyal Gardens at Kew was
exhibited.]     Here is the plant (Fig. 4). The flower is too small to
be easily    seen,   but the diagram will enable you to understand the
mechanism. It has again to do with insects and fertilisation.                        In
Stylidium the anthers and stigma are united together at the summit
of a cylindrical stem which may be compared with the motor organ
of Mimulus. You might naturally suppose that they were arranged
so in order that the pollen from these anthers should be at once
received by the adjoining stigmatic surface.                   That it is not so is
evident from the order of development of the flower, for you find that
at the moment that the anthers burst, the stigma is not yet mature.
Consequently the pollen is not intended for               it, but for flowers which
have come to maturity         earlier, and   the  mechanism which now interests
us fulfils this purpose.        The figure shows the singular form of this
strange flower..      You observe that the column, as           it   is called,
                                                                              is   bent
down over the corolla so as to be in contact with the odd-looking
labellum, which here takes the place of one of the petals.                       At the
moment      that the      anthers   burst    the   column       attains its greatest
sensitiveness. The slightest touch causes             it   to spring up, straighten
itself suddenly, and then bend over to the opposite side. The
mechanism resembles that of Mimosa and of Mimulus.                          There  is   a
spring,  the  action    of  which   is  restrained      by   the   resilience   of cells
distended with liquid. Suddenly these cells discharge their contents,
and the spring acts.

    And now let me pass to another group of plants which may serve
as a contrast to Stylidium.       Stylidium may be called an out-of-the-
way plant.     It has an organisation which is not represented in the
European flora.     The family of thistles, and their allies the knap-
weeds (represented in our gardens by the ladies' blue-bottle), all of
which are common wayside plants, exhibit excitable movements
which, although of a very different kind from those we have just
described, have, like them, to do with the visits of insects for the
purpose of fertilisation.     We will now throw on the screen a single
fertile floret of Centaurea Cyanus (Fig. 5). The large diagram shows
the same floret deprived of its corolla.       Its axis is occupied by the
style, surrounded by its tube of anthers.      Below, the anther-filaments
expand    into  a kind  of  cage,  and  again approach one another, when
they are united    with  the  tube of the corolla.     At the moment that
the anthers arrive at maturity these filaments are very excitable.
When one of them is touched, it contracts and draws the style towards
itself.   Immediately afterwards the excitatory effect spreads to the
others, all five arches becoming straight and applying themselves
closely to the style. A similar effect is produced by an induction
shock. [The structure described was projected on the screen; on
passing an induction current through               it,
                                               the mode of contraction of
the  filaments  was  seen.]
     The mechanism of Centaurea has been studied by many plant
physiologists, particularly by Professor Ferdinand Cohn of Breslau,
and more recently with great completeness by Professor Pfeffer.           It
has in this respect   greater
                          a    interest  than any other —  that the shorten-
ing of these filaments in response to excitation strikingly resembles
muscular contraction.    You have here        structure in the form of
                                                   a                              a
flattened cylinder which resembles many muscles in form, the length
of which    isdiminished by about       sixth on excitation.
                                              a                 This super-
ficial resemblance  between   the  two  actions makes    .the more
                                                                 it  easy to
appreciate the differences.
    Let me draw your attention to the diagram of an experiment
made last year, which was intended to illustrate the nature of muscular
contraction, and particularly to show that when        muscle contracts,
                                                             a                    it
does not diminish in volume.       The first  difference between muscle
and plant    is   difference in the degree of shortening.
                  a                                             A muscle
shortens by something like      third of its length, the anther filament
                                     a
only by a  sixth. But          much more important to notice that in
                              it    is
contracting, the filaments  do not retain their volume. In shortening,
they broaden, but the broadening       scarcely measurable hence they
                                              is                      ;
must necessarily diminish in bulk, and this shrinkage takes place, as
Pfeffer has shown, exactly in the same manner as that in which the
excitable cushion of Mimosa shrinks, namely, by the discharge of
liquid from its cells.
    We are now in position to study more closely the question to
                          a
which I  referred   few minutes ago — How do the cells discharge their
                      a
contents?     The structure of the filament of Centaurea, from its

 1882.]                 on the   Excitability of Plants.                159
 extreme simplicity, is a better subject of investigation with reference
 to this question, than any other.  Each filament is a ribbon consisting
 of (1)   a   single fibro-vascular bundle, (2) delicate cells of regular
   cylindrical form, (3) an epidermis of somewhat thick-walled cells.
   [Microscopical preparations were shown.] In Mimosa we saw that
   the epidermis and vascular bundle took only a passive part in the
  production of the motion. Here, the part they play is even less
  important.      Everything depends on the parenchyma, which, when
  excited, shrinks by discharging its water.        Pfeffer proved this by
  cutting off the anther tube from the filaments, and then observing
  that on excitation a drop collected on the cut surface, which was
  reabsorbed as the filament again became arched.        It is obvious that
  if the whole parenchyma discharges its liquid, each cell must do the
  same, for it is made up entirely of cells.     To understand how each
  cell acts, we have only to consider its structure. Each consists of
  two parts — an external sac or vesicle, which is of cellulose, and, so
  long as the cell is in the natural or unexcited state, over-distended,
  so that, by virtue of its elasticity, it presses on the contents with
 considerable force ; and secondly, of an internal more actively living
 membrane of protoplasm, of which the mechanical function is, so long
 as it is in its active condition, to charge itself fuller and fuller with
 liquid — the limit to further distension being the elastic envelope in
 which it is enclosed.      In this way the two (the elastic envelope and
 the protoplasmic lining) are constantly in antagonism, the tendency
 of the former being towards discharge, that of the latter towards
 charge.     This being so, our explanation of the effect of excitation on
 the individual cell amounts to this — that the envelope undergoes no
 change whatever, but that the protoplasm lining suddenly loses its
 water-absorbing power, so that the elastic force of the envelope at
 once comes into play and squeezes out the cell-contents.               Con-
 sequently, although here, as everywhere, the protoplasm is the seat of
 the primary change, the mechanical agent of the motion is not the
 protoplasm, but the elastic envelope in which it is enclosed.
       The complete knowledge we have gained, from our study of the
 anther filaments of Centaurea, of the mechanism of the excitable plant-
 cell, can be applied to every other known example of irrito-contrac-
 tility in the organs of plants, and particularly to that most remark-
 able of all such structures, the leaf of Dionoea muscipula.      Although
I    described   the structure of the leaf just eight years ago in this
 room,    I  will occupy a moment in repeating the description. The
blade of the leaf is united on to the stalk by a little cylindrical
joint. Here are two models, in one of which the leaf is represented
in its closed state, in the other in which it is in its unexcited or open
 state.     The leaf is everywhere contractile — that      is, excitable by
transmission, but not everywhere susceptible of direct excitation — or,
in common language, sensitive. It       is  provided with special organs,
of which we do not find the counterpart in any of the plants to
which reference has been made, for the reception of external impres-

160                      Br. J. Burdon- Sanderson               [June 9,
sions — organs which, from their structure and position, can have no
other function.
    The action of the leaf to which the plant owes its name and by
which it seizes its prey, is, in its general character, too well known
to require description.      In the shortest possible terms, it is the
sudden change of the outer surface of each lobe of the leaf from
convex to concave, and at the same time the crossing of the two series
of marginal hairs, as the fingers cross when the hands are clasped.
        I
What desire to show with respect to it is, that here also the agents
are individual cells — that is, that the individual elements out of
which the whole structure is built are the immediate agents in the
production of the movement.
    A cross-section of the leaf shows the following facts :        If the
section be made in the direction of the parallel fibro-vascular bundles
which run out from the mid-rib nearly at right angles, and happen to
include one of these bundles, it is seen that it consists of three parts,
viz. of the fibro-vascular bundle in the middle and equidistant from
both borders ; of the cylindrical cells of the parenchyma on either side,
and of an external and internal epidermis.       The external epidermis
is smooth and glistening, and its cells possess thicker walls than those
on the opposite surface.
    The most remarkable feature of the internal surface is, that it
possesses the excitable hairs, three on each side, which in Dionasa are
the starting-points of the excitatory process whenever it is stimulated
by touch, as is normally the case when the leaf is visited by insects ;
for experiment shows that although the whole of the leaf can be
excited either by pressure or by the passage of an induction current,
the hairs exclusively are excited by touch. It is therefore of great
interest to know their structure and their relation to the excitable
cells of the parenchyma, with which they are in so remarkable a
relation physiologically.     In sections such as that which we will now
project on the screen (Fig. 6), it is seen that each hair springs from
a cushion which consists of minute nucleated cells inclosed by
epidermis ; and that if we follow this structure into the depth of the
leaf, its central cells gradually become larger, until they are in-
distinguishable from those of the ordinary parenchyma of the leaf.
By these cells it must be admitted that the endowment of excitability
is possessed in a higher degree than by the ordinary cells of the
parenchyma, so that for a moment one is tempted to assign to them
functions corresponding to those of motor centres in animal structures
 (particularly in the heart). There is, however, no reason for attri-
buting to them endowments which differ in kind from those we have
already assigned to the excitable plant-cell.
     The fact that the excitable organs are exclusively on the internal
surface of the lobe, suggests that although the parenchyma of the
inside has apparently the same structure, it has not the same function
as that of the outside — that is, that although the cells of the outer
layers are just like those of the inner, they arc either not excitable

at all, or are so in a much less degree.               In this way only can we
account for the bending inwards of the lobe.               In the unexcited state
both layers are equally turgid; as the effect of excitation the
internal layers become limp, the external remaining tense and dis-
tended.
     I  will now endeavour to illustrate the motions of the leaf by
projecting them on the screen.           Here are several leaves which have
been prepared by attaching one of the lobes to a cork support ; the
other is free, but a very small concave mirror has been attached to
                                            Fig.  6.

its external surface near the margin.              The image of the light which
falls on the mirror is reflected on the wall behind me. In this way
the slightest movement of the lobe is displayed.                By this contrivance
I   wish to show you two things — first, that a very appreciable time
elapses between        the excitation and the mechanical effect ; and
secondly,    that when    the leaf is subjected to a series of very gentle
excitations, the effects accumulate until the leaf closes.                   This we
hope to show by bringing down a camel-hair pencil several times in
succession on a sensitive hair, doing it so deftly that at the first touch
 the lobe will scarcely move at all.           At each successive touch it will
 bend   more  than  at  the  preceding one, until you see the lever suddenly
 rise, indicating that the leaf has closed.           The purpose which         I have
 in view is to demonstrate the contrast between the motion of the
 leaf and muscular contraction.           A muscle in contracting acts as one

organ — at once. The motion of the leaf is the result of the action of
many hundred independent cells, all of which may act together, but
may not.      In either case they take a great deal longer to think
about it ; for during a period after excitation, which amounts at
ordinary summer temperature to about a second, the leaf remains
absolutely motionless.
     And now we have to inquire what happens during this period of
delay. There are two things which we may assume as certain without
further proof, namely, first that something happens — for when          I see
a certain movement followed after a time invariably by another,         I am
quite sure that the chain between cause and effect is a continuous
one, although the links may be invisible ; and secondly, that this
invisible change has its seat in the protoplasm of each of the excitable
cells.
     We have already seen that in muscle this latent state of excita-
tion is not without its concomitant sign — the excitatory electrical
disturbance ; and   I    have now to show you that this, which is the
sole physical characteristic of the excitatory process in animal tissues,
manifests itself with equal constancy and under the same conditions
in plants.
     It will be unnecessary for my present purpose to enter into any
details as to the nature of the electrical change ; it will be sufficient
to demonstrate with respect to          it,
                                          first, that when observed under
normal physiological conditions, its phenomena are always conform-
able to certain easily defined characters secondly, that

rapidity from one lobe of the leaf to the opposite. Of these three
propositions, it   will be convenient to begin with the second. On the
left-hand screen   is   projected the mercurial column of the capillary
electrometer of Lippmann.           The instrument which we use this
 evening is  one of great sensibility, given me by my friend Professor
 Loven, of Stockholm. The capillary electrometer possesses property
                                                                  a
 which for our purpose      is   invaluable — that of responding instan-
 taneously to electrical changes of extremely short duration.            We
 cannot better illustrate this than by connecting the wires of the
 telephone with its terminals.          If
                                         I    press in the telephone-plate
I   produce  an   instantaneous   difference  between the terminals in one
 direction, and in the opposite when     I  remove the pressure.     You see
 how beautifully the mercurial column responds.
     We now proceed to connect the terminals with the opposite sides
 of leaf, so that by means of the mirror we can observe the moment
    a
 at which the leaf begins to close and the first movement of the
 mercurial column, both being projected on the same screen.               We
 shall see that the mercurial column responds (so to speak) long before
 the mirror.    The difference of time will be about second. a
      We  now   take   another leaf, which, with the plants of which          it

excitations, the effect of which would of course be to determine its
closure, we prevent this by placing a little beam of dry wood

that the left lobe is excited.           The experiment consists in this : By
the electrodes near r, an induction shock passes through the right
lobe. Apparently at the same moment the electrometer, which is in
relation with the opposite lobe, responds.                I  say apparently, because
in reality we know that the response does not begin until about T ^
of a second later. We prove this by a mode of experimentation
which is of too delicate a nature to be repeated here.                  I  will explain
the mode of action of the instrument used, by a diagram (Fig. 9)

In each, the diphasic character is distinct, and you see that the first,
or negative phase lasts less than a second, but that the positive, of
which the extent is much less, is so prolonged that before it has had
time to subside it is cut off by another excitation.
    It would have been gratifying to me, had it been possible, to
exhibit to you other interesting facts relating to the excitatory process
                     I
in our leaf. It has, trust, been made clear to you that the mechanism
of plant motion is entirely different from that of animal motion.
But obvious and well marked as this difference is, it is nevertheless
not essential, for it depends not on difference of quality between the
fundamental chemical processes of plant and animal protoplasm, but
merely on difference of rate or intensity.    Both in the plant and in
the animal, work springs out of the chemical transformation of
material, but in the plant the process is relatively so slow that it
must necessarily store up energy, not in the form of chemical com-
pounds capable of producing work by their disintegration, but in the
mechanical tension of elastic membranes.        The plant-cell uses its
material continually in tightening springs which it has the power of
letting off at any required moment by virtue of that wonderful
property of excitability which we have been studying this evening.
Animal contractile protoplasm, and particularly that of muscle, does
work only when required, and in doing so, uses its material directly.
That this difference, great as it         is,
                                           not essential, we may learn
                                                is
further from the consideration that in those slow motions of the
growing parts of plants which form the subject of Mr. Darwin's
book, On the Movements of Plants,' there is no such storage of
      '
energy in tension of elastic membrane, there being plenty of time
for the immediate transformation of chemical into mechanical work.
 I      have now concluded all that     have to say about the way in
                                          I
which plants and animals respond to external influences. In this
evening's lecture you have seen exemplified the general fact, applicable
alike to the physiology of plant and animal, that whatever knowledge
we possess has been gained by experiment.      In speaking of Mimosa,
I  might have entertained you with the ingenious conjectures which
were formed as to its mechanism at      time when
                                            a          was thought that
                                                         it
we could arrive at knowledge by reasoning backwards — that         is,by
inferring from the structure of living mechanism what its function
                                      a
is  likely to be. In certain branches of physiology something has
been learnt by this plan, but, as regards our present investigation,
almost nothing, nor indeed could anything have been learnt.      Every-
where we find that nature's means are adapted to her ends, and the
more perfectly the better we know them.       But, with rare exceptions,
knowledge   is  got only by actually seeing her at work, for which
purpose,  if, as constantly happens,  she uses concealment,    we must
tear off the veil, as you have seen this evening, by force. Have we
the right to assume this aggressive attitude       Ought we not rather

               The Conversion     of Radiant Heat     into Sound.
 The Royal Society has done me the honour of publishing a long
series of memoirs on the interaction of radiant heat and gaseous
matter.      These memoirs did not escape criticism.            Distinguished
men, among whom the late Professor Magnus and the late Professor
 Buff may be more specially mentioned, examined my experiments, and
arrived at results different from mine. Living workers of merit have
also taken up the question, the latest of whom,* while justly recog-
nising the extreme difficulty of the subject, and while verifying, so
far  as their experiments reach, what       I  had published regarding dry
gases,  find        I
              that have fallen into what they consider grave errors in
my treatment of vapours.
     None of these investigators appear to me to have realised the
true strength of my position in its relation to the objects            I  had in
view. Occupied for the most part with details, they have failed to
recognise the stringency of my work as a whole, and have not taken
into account the independent support rendered by the various parts of
the investigation to each other.        They thus ignore verifications, both
general   and  special,  which   are to  me of conclusive force.     Neverthe-
less, thinking   it  due to them and me to submit the questions at issue
to a fresh examination,     I  resumed some time ago the threads of the
inquiry. The results shall in due time be communicated to the
Royal Society ; but meanwhile        I  would ask permission to bring to the
notice of the Fellows a novel mode of testing the relations of radiant
heat to gaseous matter, whereby singularly instructive effects have
been obtained.
     Last year   I   became acquainted with the ingenious and original
experiments of Mr. Graham Bell, wherein musical sounds are obtained
through the action of an intermittent beam of light upon solid
bodies.                      I
           From the first entertained the opinion that these singular
sounds were caused by rapid changes of temperature,                  producing
corresponding changes of shape and volume in the bodies impinged

upon by the beam.    But if this be the case, and if gases and vapours
really absorb radiant heat, they ought to produce sounds more intense
than those obtainable from solids.                I
                                      pictured every stroke of the beam
responded   to by  a sudden expansion of the absorbent gas, and con-
cluded that when the pulses thus excited followed each other with
sufficient rapidity, a musical note must be the result.      It seemed
plain, moreover, that by this new method many of my previous results
might be brought to an independent test.        Highly diathermanous
             I
bodies, reasoned, would produce faint sounds, while highly adiather-
manous bodies would produce loud sounds ; the strength of the sound
being, in a sense, a measure of the absorption. The first experiment
made with a view of testing this idea, was executed in the presence of
Mr. Graham Bell ; * and the result was in exact accordance with what
I had   foreseen.
    The inquiry has been recently extended so as to embrace most of
the gases and vapours employed in my former researches.     My first
source of rays was a Siemens' lamp connected with a dynamo-machine,
worked by a gas-engine. A glass lens was used to concentrate the
rays, and afterwards two lenses.    By the first the rays were rendered
parallel, while the second  caused  them   to converge to a point about
seven inches distant from the lens.     A circle of sheet zinc provided
first with radial slits and afterwards with teeth and interspaces cut
through      it,
            was mounted vertically on      whirling table, and caused to
                                                       a
rotate rapidly across the beam near the focus.       The passage of the
slits produced the desired intermittence,f   while   flask containing the
                                                                     a
gas or vapour to be examined received the shocks of the beam imme-
diately behind the rotating disk. From the flask     tube of indiarubber,
                                                                     a
ending in    tapering
                 a     one of ivory  or boxwood,   led  to the ear, which
was thus rendered keenly sensitive to any sound generated within the
flask. Compared with the beautiful apparatus of Mr. Graham Bell,
the arrangement here described             rude       is   however, very
                                                                 :   it   is,
effective.
    With this arrangement the number of sounding gases and vapours
was rapidly increased.  But    was soon made aware that the glass
                                          I
lenses withdrew from the beam its most effectual rays. The silvered
mirrors employed in my previous researches were therefore invoked                               ;
and with them, acting sometimes singly and sometimes as conjugate

  t    When the disk rotates the individual slits disappear, forming hazy zone     a
through which objects are visible. Throwing by the clean hand, or better still by
white paper, the beam back upon the disk,         appears to stand still, the slits
                                                        it

definite velocity of recurrence, subjective colours of extraordinary gorgeousness
are produced.    With slower or quicker rates of rotation the colours disappear.
The flashes also produce      giddiness sometimes intense enough to cause me to

  1881.]        on the Conversion of Radiant Heat into Sound.            177
 mirrors, the curious and striking results which    I have now the honour
 to submit to the Members were obtained.
      Sulphuric ether, formic ether, and acetic ether being placed in
 bulbous flasks, their vapours were soon diffused in the air above the
 liquid. On placing these flasks, whose bottoms only were covered by
 the liquid, behind the rotating disk, so that the intermittent beam
 passed through the vapour, loud musical tones were in each case
 obtained. These are known to be the most highly absorbent vapours
 which my experiments revealed.           Chloroform and bisulphide of
 carbon, on the other hand, are known to be the least absorbent, the
 latter standing near the head of diathermanous vapours. The sounds
 extracted from these two substances were usually weak and some-
 times barely audible, being more feeble with the bisulphide than
 with the chloroform.      With regard to the vapours of amylene, iodide
 of ethyl, iodide of methyl and benzol, other things being equal, their
 power to produce musical tones appeared to be accurately expressed
 by their ability to absorb radiant heat.
      It is the vapour, and not the liquid, that is effective in producing
 the sounds.     Taking, for example, the bottles in which my volatile
 substances are habitually kept,    I permitted the intermittent beam to
 impinge upon the liquid in each of them.           No sound was in any
 case produced, while the moment the vapour-laden space above an
 active liquid was traversed by the beam, musical tones made them-
 selves audible.
     A rock-salt cell filled entirely with a volatile liquid and subjected
to the intermittent beam produced no sound.          This cell was circular
 and closed at the top.    Once, while operating with a highly adiather-
manous substance, a distinct musical note was heard.         On examining
the cell, however, a small bubble was found at its top.        The bubble
was less than a quarter of an inch in diameter, but still sufficient to
produce audible sounds.        When the cell was completely filled the
sounds disappeared.
     It is hardly necessary to state that the pitch of the note obtained
in each case is determined by the velocity of rotation.      It is the same
as that produced by blowing against the rotating disk and allowing
its slits to act like the perforations of a syren.
     Thus, as regards vapours, prevision has been justified by experi-
ment.      I now turn to gases. A small flask, after having been heated
in the spirit-lamp so as to detach all moisture from its sides, was
carefully filled with dried air. Placed in the intermittent beam it
yielded a note so feeble as to be heard only with attention.            Dry
oxygen and hydrogen behaved like dry air.            This agrees with my
former experiments, which assigned a hardly sensible absorption to
these gases.     When the dry air was displaced by carbonic acid, the
sound was far louder than that obtained from any of the elementary
gases.     When the carbonic acid was displaced by nitrous oxide the
sound was much more forcible still, and when the nitrous oxide was
displaced by olefiant gas it gave birth to a musical note which, when
                                                                 n 2

the beam was in good condition and the bulb well chosen, seemed as
loud as that of an ordinary organ-pipe. We have here the exact order
in which my former experiments proved these gases to stand as
absorbers of radiant heat.       The amount of the absorption and the
intensity of the sound go hand in hand.
                 I
      In 1859 proved gaseous ammonia to be extremely impervious
to radiant heat. My interest in its deportment when subjected to this
 novel test was therefore great.      Placing a small quantity of liquid
 ammonia in one of the flasks, and warming the liquid slightly, the
 intermittent beam was sent through the space above the liquid. A
 loud musical note was immediately produced.
       In this relation the vapour of water interested me most, and as     I
 could not hope that at ordinary temperatures it existed in sufficient
 amount to produce audible tones,    I   heated a small quantity of water
 in a flask almost up to its boiling-point. Placed in the intermittent
 beam,  I     heard —I    avow with delight — a powerful musical sound
 produced by     the  aqueous vapour.
       Small wreaths of haze, produced by the partial condensation of the
  vapour in the upper and cooler air of the flask, were however visible
  in this experiment; and it was necessary to prove that this haze
  was not the cause of the sound.         The flask was therefore heated
  by a spirit-flame beyond the temperature of boiling water. The
  closest scrutiny by a condensed beam then revealed no trace of
  cloudiness above the liquid. From the perfectly invisible vapour
  however the musical sound issued, if anything, more forcible than
  before.    I  placed the flask in cold water until its temperature was
  reduced from about 90° to 10° C, fully expecting that the sound would
  vanish at this temperature; but notwithstanding the tenuity of the
  vapour, the sound extracted from it was not only distinct but loud.
        Three empty flasks filled with ordinary air were placed in a
   freezing mixture for a quarter of an hour. On being rapidly trans-
   ferred to the intermittent beam, sounds much louder than those
   obtainable from dry air were produced.
        Warming these flasks in the flame of a spirit-lamp until all
   visible humidity had been removed, and afterwards urging dried air
   through them, on being placed in the intermittent beam the sound
   in each case was found to have fallen almost to silence.
        Sending, by means of a glass tube, a puff of breath from the lungs
   into a dried flask, the power of emitting sound was immediately
 restored.
     When, instead of breathing into a dry flask, the common air of the
 laboratory was urged through        it,   the sounds became immediately
 intensified.    I  was by no means prepared for the extraordinary
 delicacy of this new method of testing the adiathermancy and diather-
 mancy of gases and vapours, and     it     cannot be otherwise than satis-
 factory  to  me to  find that particular vapour, whose alleged deportment
 towards radiant    heat  has  been  most strenuously denied, affirming thus
 audibly its true character.

  1881.]        on the Conversion    of Radiant Heat into Sound.               179
       After what has been stated regarding aqueous vapour we are
 prepared for the fact that an exceedingly small percentage of any
 highly adiathermanous gas diffused in air suffices to exalt the sounds.
 An accidental observation will illustrate this point. A flask was
 filled with coal gas and held bottom upwards in the intermittent
 beam.     The sounds produced were of a force corresponding to the
 known absorptive energy of coal-gas.             The flask was then placed
 upright, with its mouth open upon a table, and permitted to remain
 there for nearly an hour. On being restored to the beam, the sounds
 produced were far louder than those which could be obtained from
 common air.*
      Transferring a small flask or a test tube from a cold place to the
 intermittent beam it is sometimes found to be practically silent for a
 moment, after which the sounds become distinctly audible.                This   I
 take to be due to the vaporisation by the calorific beam of the thin
 film of moisture adherent to the glass.
      My previous experiments having satisfied me of the generality of
 the rule that volatile liquids and their vapours absorb the same rays,
 I  thought it probable that the introduction of a thin layer of its liquid,
 even in the case of a most energetic vapour, would detach the effective
 rays, and thus quench the sounds.              The experiment was made
 and the conclusion verified.        A layer of water, liquid formic ether,
 sulphuric ether, or acetic ether one-eighth of an inch in thickness
 rendered the transmitted beam powerless to produce any musical
 sound in the vapours.       These liquids being transparent to light, the
 efficient rays which they intercepted must have been those of obscure
 heat.
      A layer of bisulphide of carbon about ten times the thickness of
the transparent layers just referred to, and rendered opaque to light
by dissolved iodine, was interposed in the path of the intermittent
beam.      It produced hardly any diminution of the sounds of the more
active vapours — a further proof that it is the invisible heat rays, to
which the solution of iodine is so eminently transparent, that are here
effectual.
      Converting one of the small flasks used in the foregoing experi-
ments into a thermometer bulb, and filling it with various gases in
succession, it was found that with those gases which yielded a feeble
sound, the displacement of a thermometric column associated with the
bulb was slow and feeble, while with those gases which yielded loud
sounds the displacement was prompt and forcible.
      On January 4    I chose for my source of rays a powerful lime-light,
which, when sufficient care is taken to prevent the pitting of the
cylinder, works with admirable steadiness and without any noise.                 I
also changed my mirror for one of shorter focus, which permitted a

extremely small quantities of fire-damp in mines.

 nearer approach to the source of rays. Tested with this new reflector
 the stronger vapours rose remarkably in sounding power.
     Improved manipulation was,      I considered, sure to extract sounds
 from rays of much more moderate intensity than those of the lime-
 light. For this light, therefore, a common candle flame was substi-
 tuted.   Received and thrown back by the mirror, the radiant heat of
 the candle produced audible tones in all the stronger vapours.
     Abandoning the mirror and bringing the candle close to the
 rotating disk, its direct rays produced audible sounds.
     A red-hot coal, taken from the fire and held close to the rotating
 disk, produced forcible sounds in a flask at the other side.
     A red-hot poker, placed in the position previously occupied by
 the coal, produced strong sounds.
     The temperature of the iron was then lowered till its heat just
 ceased to be visible. The intermittent invisible rays produced audible
 sounds.
     The temperature was gradually lowered, being accompanied by a
 gradual and continuous diminution of the sound.        When it ceased to
 be audible the temperature of the poker was found to be below that of
boiling water.
     As might be expected from the foregoing experiments an incan-
descent platinum spiral, with or without the mirror, produced musical
sounds.    When the battery power was reduced from ten cells to three
the sounds, though enfeebled, were distinct.
     My neglect of aqueous vapour had led me for a time astray in
 1859, but before publishing my results       I had discovered the error.
 On the present occasion this omnipresent substance had also to be
reckoned with.      Fourteen flasks of various sizes, with their bottoms
covered with a little sulphuric acid, were closed with ordinary corks
and permitted to remain in the laboratory from December 23 to
January 4. Tested on the latter day with the intermittent beam,
half of them emitted feeble sounds, but half were silent.               The
sounds were undoubtedly due, not to dry air, but to traces of aqueous
vapour.
     An ordinary      bottle containing   sulphuric   acid   for laboratory
purposes, being connected with the ear and placed in the intermittent
beam, emitted a faint, but distinct, musical sound.         This bottle had
been opened    two   or three times   during  the  day,  its  dryness being
thus vitiated by the mixture of a small quantity of common air. A
second similar bottle, in which sulphuric acid had stood undisturbed
for some days, was placed in the beam : the dry air above the liquid
proved absolutely silent.
     On the evening of January 7, Professor Dewar handed me four
flasks treated in the following manner : — Into one was poured a small
quantity of strong sulphuric acid ; into another a small quantity of
Nordhausen sulphuric acid ; in a third were placed some fragments
of fused chloride of calcium ; while the fourth contained a small
quantity of phosphoric anhydride.         They were closed with well-

 1881.]       on the Conversion    of Badiant Heat into Sound.          181
 fitting indiarubber stoppers, and permitted to remain undisturbed
 throughout the night.       Tested after twelve hours, each of them
 emitted a feeble sound, the flask last mentioned being the strongest.
 Tested again six hours later, the sound had disappeared from three of
 the flasks, that containing the phosphoric anhydride alone remaining
musical.
      Breathing into a flask partially filled with sulphuric acid instantly
restores the sounding power, which continues for a considerable
time.    The wetting of the interior surface of the flask with the
sulphuric acid always enfeebles, and sometimes destroys, the sound.
      A bulb less than a cubic inch in volume, and containing a little
water lowered to the temperature of melting ice, produces very
distinct sounds. Warming the water in the flame of a spirit-lamp,
the sound becomes greatly augmented in strength.             At the boiling
                                                       * is of extraordinary
temperature the sound emitted by this small bulb
intensity.
      These results are in accord with those obtained by me nearly
nineteen years ago, both in reference to air and to aqueous vapour.
They are in utter disaccord with those obtained by other experi-
menters, who have ascribed a high absorption to air and none
to aqueous vapour.
    The action of aqueous vapour being thus revealed, the necessity
of thoroughly drying the flasks when testing other substances
becomes obvious.    The following plan has been found effective: —
Each flask is first heated in the flame of a spirit-lamp till every
 visible trace of internal moisture has disappeared, and it is afterwards
raised to a temperature of about 400° G. While the glass is still hot
a glass tube is introduced into      and air freed from carbonic acid by
                                    it,
caustic potash, and from aqueous vapour by sulphuric acid,        isurged
through the flask until  it   iscool. Connected with the ear-tube, and
exposed immediately to the intermittent beam, the attention of the
ear,   if
       I   may use the term,  is  converged upon the flask. When tho
experiment   is   carefully made, dry air proves as incompetent to
produce sound as to absorb radiant heat.
 I     also tried to extract sounds from perfumes, which   I  had proved
in 1861 to be absorbers of radiant heat.    I   limit myself here to the
vapours of pachouli and cassia, the former exercising         a measured
absorption of 30, and the latter an absorption of 109. Placed in dried
flasks, and slightly warmed, sounds were obtained from both these
substances, but the sound of cassia was much louder than that of
pachouli.
     Many years ago   I     had proved tetrachloride of carbon to be
highly diathermanous.        Its sounding power     is as feeble as its
absorbent power.
     In relation to colliery explosions, the deportment of marsh-gas
   *  In such bulbs even bisulphide of carbon vapour may be so nursed as to
produce sounds of considerable strength.

182                          Professor Tyndall                                 [April     8,
was of special interest. Professor Dewar was good enough to furnish
me with a pure sample of this gas.      The sounds produced by                            it,
when exposed to the intermittent beam, were very powerful.
    Chloride of methyl,     liquid which boils at the ordinary tem-
                            a
perature of the  air, was poured into   small flask, and permitted to
                                                    a
displace the air within it. Exposed to the intermittent beam, its
sound exceeded in power that of marsh-gas.
    The specific gravity of marsh-gas being about half that of air,                       it
might be expected that the flask containing       when left open and
                                                              it,
erect, would soon get rid of its contents.   This, however,    not the        is
case.   After  aconsiderable interval the film of this gas clinging to
the interior surface of the flask was able to produce sounds of great
intensity.
     A small quantity of liquid bromine being poured into               well-     a
dried flask, the brown vapour rapidly diffused itself in the air above
the liquid. Placed in the intermittent beam,             somewhat forcible
                                                                  a
sound was produced. This might seem to militate against my former
experiments, which assigned very low absorptive power to bromine
                                  a
vapour. But my former experiments were conducted with obscure
heat  ; whereas in the present instance        had to deal with the radia-

the sounds might be due.
     Between the flask containing the bromine and the rotating disk                       I
therefore placed an empty glass cell the sounds continued.
                                                :                        then     I
filled the cell with transparent bisulphide of carbon the sounds          :
still continued.       For the transparent bisulphide      then substituted
                                                                    I
the same liquid saturated with dissolved iodine.          This solution cut
off the light, while allowing the rays of heat free transmission           the        :
sounds were immediately stilled.
     Iodine vaporised by heat in small flask yielded
                                      a                      forcible sound,

which was not sensibly affected by the interposition of transparent
bisulphide of carbon, but which was completely quelled by the iodine
solution.    It might indeed have been foreseen that the rays trans-
mitted by the iodine as       a    liquid would also be transmitted by its
vapour,   and  thus   fail to be converted into sound.*
                                        —
     To complete the argument: While the flask containing the
bromine vapour was sounding in the intermittent beam,                  strong a
solution of alum was interposed between             and the rotating disk.

There was no sensible abatement of the sounds with either bromine
or iodine vapour.
     In these experiments the rays from the lime-light were converged
toa   pointa   little beyond the rotating disk. In the next experiment
they were rendered parallel by the mirror, and afterwards rendered

 were extracted from both bromine and iodine vapour.                Sounds were
 also produced after the beam had been sent through the alum solution

       Several vapours other than those mentioned in this abstract have
 been examined, and sounds obtained from all of them.               The vapours
 of all compound liquids will,          I doubt not, be found sonorous in the
 intermittent beam. And, as            I  question whether there is an abso-
 lutely   diathermanous      substance    in nature, I  think it probable that
even the vapours of elementary bodies, including the elementary
gases, when more strictly examined, will be found capable of pro-
ducing sounds.

This Discourse      was    an introduction to a short course of lectures
            '
entitled Episodes       in  the Life of Lord Lawrence.' *
      John Lawrence was born in the north of Ireland, March 4, 1811,
his family being of Scoto-Irish origin.          His father, Alexander, was an
ill-requited Indian officer ; his mother, a Knox.          Among his school-
fellows at Foyle College were his brother Henry and Robert Mont-
gomery, his future colleagues in the Punjaub.
      Not too well educated, he reluctantly entered the Indian Civil
Service in 1829, going to Delhi, his appointment being eventually in
Paniput, inhabited by Sikhs and other tribes of a more powerful
character than the ordinary Hindoos.
      The duties of a collector of the revenue were exceedingly multi-
farious, embracing the charge of law and police, agriculture, health,
roads, bridges, &c.      In discharging these duties John Lawrence acted
as a wise, just, humane, beneficent despot, throwing himself heartily
into his work, deeply sympathising with the people, trusting greatly
to his own eyes and hands, and subjecting himself to severe self-
discipline.     In fact, during the years he acted as revenue collector in
     * Mr. R. Bosworth Smith's     *

Paniput, he was in a course of training for his important future work,
which so greatly conduced to the preservation of the Indian empire
during the mutiny.
     In the latter part of the discourse, the speaker related a number of
interesting anecdotes illustrative of John Lawrence's physical strength,
method of working, escape from imminent death, acuteness in the
detection of crime, remembrance of help given to him, tenderness to
sufferers, and other characteristic qualities.
     After a severe illness, he returned to England in 1840, on
furlough.

                              The Size of Atoms.
Four lines of argument founded           on observation have led to the con-
clusion that atoms or molecules are not inconceivably, not immeasur-
ably small.     I  use the words
                                   " inconceivably " and "immeasurably"
advisedly.     That which is measurable is not inconceivable, and
therefore the two words put together constitute a tautology.                 Wo
leave inconceivableness in fact to metaphysicians.                 Nothing that
we can measure is inconceivably large or inconceivably small in
physical science.       It may be difficult to understand the numbers
expressing   the   magnitude, but whether it be very large or very small
there is nothing inconceivable in the nature of the thing because of
its greatness or smallness, or in our views and appreciation and
numerical expression of the magnitude. The general result of the
four lines of reasoning to which        I have referred, founded respectively
on the undulatory theory          of  light, on the phenomena of contact
electricity, on capillary attraction, and on the kinetic theory of gases,
agrees in showing that the atoms or molecules of ordinary matter
must be something like the 1-1 0,000,000th, or from the l-10,000,000th
to the l-100,000,000th of a centimetre in diameter.           I  speak somewhat
vaguely, and     I  do so, not inadvertently, when       I speak of atoms and
molecules.     I  must ask the chemists to forgive me if        I even abuse the
words and apply a misnomer occasionally.                 The chemists do not
know what is to be the atom ; for instance, whether hydrogen gas
is to consist of two pieces of matter in union constituting one molecule,
and these molecules flying about ; or whether single molecules each
indivisible, or at all events undivided in chemical action, constitute
the structure.      I shall not go into any such questions at all, but
merely   take  the  broad  view that matter, although we may conceive it
to be infinitely divisible, is not infinitely divisible without decompo-
sition.   Just as a building of brick may be divided into parts, into a
part containing 1000 bricks, and another part containing 2500 bricks,
and those parts viewed largely may be said to be similar or homo-
geneous ; but if you divide the matter of a brick building into spaces
of nine inches thick, and then think of subdividing it farther, you
find you have come to something which is atomic, that is, indivisible
without destroying the elements of the structure.               The question of

the molecular structure of a building does not necessarily involve the
question, Can a brick be divided into parts ? and can those parts be
divided into much smaller parts? and so on.         It used to be a favourite
subject  for  metaphysical argument amongst the schoolmen whether
matter is infinitely divisible, or whether space is infinitely divisible,
which some maintained, whilst others maintained only that matter is
not infinitely divisible, and demonstrated that there is nothing in-
conceivable in the infinite subdivision of space.       Why, even time was
divided into moments (time-atoms          and the idea of continuity of
                                                       !),

There      in sober earnest this very important thing to be attended to,
          is
however, that in chronometry, as in geometry, we have absolute con-
tinuity, and       simply an inconceivable absurdity to suppose a limit
                   it   is
to smallness whether of time or of space.         But on the other hand,

and   a question which   we are quite disposed   to  enter upon.
 I     wish in the beginning to beg you not to run away from the
subject by thinking of the exceeding smallness of atoms.          Atoms are
not so exceedingly small after all. The four lines of argument have                    I
referred to make      perfectly certain that the molecules which consti-

adhere however to one simple system, for                it is only    because we are
in England that the yard and inch are put before you at all, among
the metres and centimetres.          You see on the diagram then the metre,
the centimetre, the millimetre, with circles of the same diameter.
Somebody tells me the millimetre is not there.                I  cannot see it, but it
certainly is there, and a circle whose diameter is a millimetre, both
accurately painted in black.           I  say there is a millimetre, and you
cannot see it.   And now imagine there is l-10th of a millimetre, and
there l-100th of a millimetre and 1-1 000th of a millimetre, and there
is a round atom of oxygen 1-1,000,000 th of a millimetre in diameter.
You see them all.
     Now we must have a practical means of measuring, and optics
supply us with it for thousandths of a millimetre.                        One of our
temporary    standards     of  measurement          shall  be    the  wave-length of
light ; but the wave-length is a very indefinite measurement, because
there are wave-lengths for different colours of light, visible and in-
visible, in the ratio of 1 to 16. We have, as it were — borrowing an
 analogy from sound — four octaves of light that we know of. How far
the range in reality extends above and below the range hitherto
 measured, we cannot even guess in the present state of science.                  The
table before you (Table I.) gives you an idea of magnitudes of length,

                                              I will now show you what is meant
   by a " wave-length ;         it is not length along the crest, such as we
   sometimes see well marked in a breaking wave of the sea, on a long
   straight beach ; it is distance from crest to crest of the waves.             [This
   was illustrated by a large number of horizontal rods of wood con-
   nected together and suspended bifilarly by two threads in the centre
   hanging from the ceiling ; * on moving the lowermost rod, a wave
   was propagated up the series.]            Imagine the ends of those rods to
   represent particles.       The rods themselves let us suppose to be in-
   visible, and merely their ends visible, to represent the particles acting
   upon one another mutually with elastic force, as if of indiarubber
   bands, or steel spiral springs, or jelly, or elastic material of some
   kind.    They do act on one another in this model through the central
   mounting.      Here again is another model illustrating waves (Fig. 2).f
   The white circles on the wooden rods represent pieces of matter —                   I
   will not say molecules at present, though we shall deal with them as
  molecules afterwards. Light consists of vibrations transverse to the
  line of propagation, just as in the models before you.
      * The details of this bifilar suspension need not be minutely described, as the
  new form, with a single steel pianoforte wire to give the required mutual forces,
  described below and represented in Fig. 2, is better and more easily made.
      f This apparatus, which is represented in the woodcut, Fig. 2, is of the follow-
  ing dimensions and description.      The series of equal and similar bars (B) of
  which the ends represent molecules of the medium, and the pendulum bar (P),
  which performs the part of exciter of vibrations, or of kinetic store of vibrational
 energy, are pieces of wood each 50 centimetres long, 3 centimetres broad, and 1 ¦5
 centimetres thick.    The suspending wire is steel pianoforte wire No. 22 B. W. G.
 (•07 of a cm. diameter), and the bars are secured to it in the following manner.
 Three brass pins of about *4 of a centimetre diameter are fitted loosely in each
 bar in the position as indicated; i.e. forming the corners of an isosceles triangular
 figure, with its base parallel to the line of the suspending wire, and about 1 mm.
 to one side of it. The suspending wire, which is laid in grooves cut in the pins,
 is passed under the upper pin, outside the pin at the apex of the triangle, over the
 upper side of the lower pin, and thence down to the next bar. The upper end of
this wire is secured by being taken through a hole in the supporting beam and
several turns of it put round a pin placed on one side of the hole, as indicated in
the diagram.      To each end of the pendulum bar is made fast a steel spiral spring
as shown ; the upper ends of these springs being secured to short cords which pass
up through holes in the supporting beam, and are fastened by two or three turns
taken round the pins.     These steel springs serve as potential stores of vibrational
energy alternating in each vibration with the kinetic store constituted by the
pendulum bar. The ends of the vibrating bars (B) are loaded with masses of
lead attached to them.      The much larger masses of lead seen on the pendulum
bar, which are adjustable to different positions on the bar, are, in the diagram,
shown at the smallest distance apart.      The lowermost bar carries two vanes of tin
projecting downwards, which dip into viscous liquid (treacle diluted with water)
contained in the vessel (c).     A heavy weight resting on the bottom of this vessel,
and connected to the lower end of the suspending wire by a stretched indiarubber
band, serves to keep the lower end of the apparatus in position.       The period of
vibration of the pendulum bar is adjustable to any desired magnitude by shifting
in or out the attached weights, or by tightening or relaxing the cords which pull
the upper ends of the spiral springs.

       Now in that beautiful experiment well known as Newton's rings
  we have at once a measure of length in the distance between two
  pieces of glass to give any particular tint of colour.             The wave-length
  you see,   in  the distance   from   crest  to  crest  of the  waves   travelling up
  the long model when      I   commence giving a simple harmonic oscilla-

                                                                             press the

  the phenomenon       will  be  shown    to you   on  the  screen   by  means   of  the
  electric light reflected from the space of air between the two pieces of
  glass.    This phenomenon was first observed by Sir Isaac Newton, and
  was first explained by the undulatory theory of light.                    [Newton's
  rings are now shown on the screen before you by reflected electric
  light.]     If I press the glasses together, you see a dark spot in the
  centre ; the rings appear round                 it,
                                                and there        is dark centre with
                                                                      a
  irregularities.     Pressure      isrequired to produce that spot.             Why ?
  The answer generally given is, because glass repels glass at distance         a
  of two or three wave-lengths of light say at          ;       distance of l-5000th
                                                                 a
 of centimetre.
     a                I    do not believe      that  for    moment.
                                                             a           The seeming
  repulsion comes from shreds or particles of dust between them.                    The
 black spot in the centre      is   aplace where the distance between them           is
 less than    a quarter of wave-length.
                           a                      Now the wave-length for yellow
 light   is about l-17,000th of      a  centimetre. The quarter of l-17,000th
is   about 1-70, 000th.     The place where you see the middle of that black
 circle corresponds to air at            distance of less than l-70,000th of
                                         a                                           a
 centimetre. Passing from this black spot to the first ring of maxi-
 mum light, add half       a   wave-length to the distance, and we can tell
 what the distance between the two pieces of glass                     at this place
                                                                           is         ;
 add another half wave-length, and we come to the next maximum of
 light again but the colour prevents us speaking very definitely
                  ;
 because we have       a   number of different wave-lengths concerned.              I
 will simplify that by reducing             all to one colour, red, by interposing
                                             it
a    red glass.    You have now one        colour,  but much less light altogether,
 because this glass only lets through homogeneous red light, or not
 much besides.        Now look at what you see on the screen, and you
 have unmistakable evidence of fulcrums of dust between the glass
 surfaces.      When  I   put on the screw,         whiten the central black spot
                                                    I

 little fulcrums constituted by the molecules of dust and the pieces       ;
 of glass are pressed not against one another, but against these fulcrums.
 There are innumerable — say thousands — of little particles of dust
jammed between the glass, some of them of perhaps l-3000th of                        a
 centimetre in diameter, say        5 or wave-lengths.

  raise the temperature of the material by 62°. This is barely, if
  at all, admissible, according to our present knowledge, or, rather,
  want of knowledge, regarding the heat of combination of zinc and
  copper.    But suppose the metal plates and intervening spaces to
  be made yet four times thinner, that is to say, the thickness of each
 to be l-400,000,000th of a centimetre.          The work and its heat
  equivalent will be increased sixteenfold. It would therefore be 990
  times as much as that required to warm the mass by one degree
  Centigrade, which is very much more than can possibly be produced
 by zinc and copper in entering into molecular combination.          Were
 there in reality anything like so much heat of combination as this, a
 mixture of zinc and copper powders would, if melted in any one spot,
 run together, generating more than heat enough to melt each through-
 out ; just as a large quantity of gunpowder if ignited in any one spot
 burns throughout without fresh application of heat. Hence plates of
 zinc and copper of l-300,000,000th of a centimetre thick, placed close
 together alternately, form a near approximation to a chemical combina-
 tion, if indeed such thin plates could be made without splitting atoms."
      In making brass, if we mix zinc and copper together we find no
 very manifest signs of chemical affinity at all ; there is not a great
 deal of heat developed ; the mixture does not become warm, it does not
 explode.    Hence we can infer certainly that contact-electricity action
 ceases, or does not go on increasing according to the same law, when
 the metals are subdivided to something like l-100,000,000th of a
 centimetre.    Now this is an exceedingly important argument.     I have
 more decided data as to the actual magnitude of atoms or molecules
 to bring before you presently, but      I have nothing more decided in
 giving for certain a limit to supposable smallness. We cannot reduce
zinc and copper beyond a certain thickness without putting them into
a condition in which they lose their properties as wholes, and in
which, if put together, we should not find the same attraction as we
 should calculate upon from the thicker plates.       I  think it is im-
possible, consistently with the knowledge we have of chemical affinities
and of the effect of melting zinc and copper together, to admit that
a piece of copper or zinc could be divided to a thinness of much less,
if at all less, than 1-100, 000,000th of a centimetre without sepa-
rating the atoms or dividing the molecules, or doing away with the
composition which constitutes as a whole the solid metal.        In short,
the structure as it were of bricks, or molecules, or atoms, of which
copper and zinc are built up, cannot be much, if at all, less than
l-100,000,000th of a centimetre in diameter, and maybe considerably
greater.
    Similar conclusions result from that curious and most interesting
phenomenon, the soap-bubble.       Philosophers old and young, who
occupy  themselves  with soap-bubbles, have one of the most interesting
subjects of physical science to admire.   Blow a soap-bubble and look
at   — you may study all your life perhaps, and still learn lessons in

the film filling that ring, and focused on the screen.  It will show,
as you see, colours analogous to those of Newton's rings.    As you
see the image it is upside down.     The liquid streams down (up in
the image), and thins away from the highest point of the film.    First
we see that brilliant green colour.        It will become thinner and
thinner there, and will pass through beautiful gradations of colour
till you see, as now, a deep red, then much lighter, till it becomes a
dusky, yellowish-white, then green, and blue, and deep violet, and
lastly black, but after you see the black spot it very soon bursts.
The film itself seems to begin to lose its tension, when it gets
considerably less than a quarter of the wave-length of yellow light,
which is the thickness for the dusky white, preceding the final black.
When you are washing your hands, you may make and deliberately
observe a film like this, in a ring formed by the forefingers and
thumbs of two hands, and watch the colours. Whenever you begin
to see a black spot or several black spots, the film soon after breaks.
The film retains its strength until we come to the black spot, where
the thickness is clearly much less than 1-60, 000th of a centimetre,
which is the thickness of the dusky white.*

     Newton, in the following passage in his ' Optics (pp. 187 and 191

which continually dilated itself till it became sometimes more than
one-half or three-quarters of an inch in breadth before the bubble

water in that place, but observing it more curiously                  I
                                                           saw within it

than the rest, whereby knew that there was some reflection at the
other places which were not so dark as those spots. And by farther
trial I  found that     I  could see the images of some things (as of a
candle or the sun) very faintly reflected, not only from the great
black spot, but also from the little darker spots which were within it.
    " Obs. 18. —   If the water was not very tenacious, the black spots
would break    forth   in the white without any sensible intervention of
the blue.   And sometimes they would break forth within the pre-
cedent yellow, or red, or perhaps within the blue of the second order,
before the intermediate colours had time to display themselves."
    Now    Ihave a reason, an irrefragable reason, for saying that the
film cannot keep up its tensile strength to 1-1 00,000,000th of a
centimetre, and that        is,
                             that the work which would be required to
stretch the film   a little more than that would be enough to drive                           it
into vapour.
     The theory of capillary attraction shows that when          bubble — a                   a
soap-bubble, for instance   —     blown larger
                                      is         and  larger, work     done         is
by the stretching of      film which resists extension as

force is  to be reckoned as     certain number of units of force per unit
                                    a
of breadth.     Observation of the ascent of water in capillary tubes
shows that the contractile force of        thin film of water

done in stretching      water film to any degree of thinness, reckoned
                        a
in millimetre-milligrammes,         equal to sixteen times the number of

tractile force.   In an article " On the Thermal Effect of Drawing out
a Film of Liquid," published in the Proceedings' of the Royal Society

Centigrade (0*57°) of elevation of temperature of the substance.       The
thickness to which the film is reduced on this supposition is very
approximately 1-1 0,000th of a millimetre.      The commonest observa-
tion on the soap-bubble shows that there is no sensible diminution
of contractile force by reduction of the thickness to l-10,000th of a
millimetre ; inasmuch as the thickness which gives the first maximum
brightness, round the black spot seen where the bubble is thinnest, is
only about l-8000th of a millimetre.
     The very moderate amount of work shown in the preceding esti-
mates is quite consistent with this deduction.          But suppose now
the film to be farther stretched until its thickness is reduced to
l-10,000,000th of a millimetre (l-100,000,000th of a centimetre).
The work spent in doing this is two thousand times more than that
which we have just calculated. The heat equivalent is 280 times the
quantity required to raise the temperature of the liquid by 1° Centi-
grade.    This is far more than we can admit as a possible amount of
work done in the extension of a liquid film.     It is more than half the
amount of work which, if spent on the liquid, would convert it into
vapour at ordinary atmospheric pressure.         The conclusion is un-
avoidable, that a water-film falls off greatly in its contractile force
before it is reduced to a thickness of l-10,000,000th of a millimetre.
 It is scarcely possible, upon any conceivable molecular theory, that
there can be any considerable falling off in the contractile force as
long as there are several molecules in the thickness.       It is therefore
probable that there      are  not several  molecules   in  a  thickness of
 l-10,000,000th of a millimetre of water.
      Now when we are considering the subdivision of matter, look at
 those beautiful colours which you see in this little casket, left,       I
 believe, by Professor Brande to the Royal Institution. It contains
polished steel bars, coloured by having been raised to different degrees
 of heat, as in the process of annealing hard-tempered steel. These
 colours, produced by heat on other polished metals besides steel, are
 due to thin films of transparent oxide, and their tints, as those of
 the soap-bubble and of the thin space of air in "Newton's rings,"
 depend on the thickness of the film, which, in the case of oxidisable
 metals, forms, by combination with the oxygen of the air under the
 influence of heat, a true surface-burning.
      You are all familiar with the brilliant and beautifully distributed
 fringes of heat-colours on polished steel grates and fire-irons escaping
 that unhappy rule of domestic aesthetics which too often keeps those
 articles glittering and cold and useless, instead of letting them show
 the exquisite play of warm colouring naturally and inevitably brought
 out when they are used in the work which is their reason for exist-
 ence.    The thickness of the film of oxide which gives the first
 perceptible colour, a very pale orange or buff tint, due to the en-
 feeblement or extinction of violet light and enfeeblement of blue, and
 less enfeeblement of the other colours in order, by interference of the
 reflections from the two surfaces of the film, is about l-100,000th of

1883.]                           on the Size   of Atoms.                        195
a centimetre,      being something less than a quarter wave-length of
violet light in the oxide.
      The exceedingly searching and detective efficacy of electricity
conies to our aid here, and by the force, as it were, spread through
such a film, proves to us the existence of the film when it is consider-
ably thinner than that l-100,000th of a centimetre, when in fact it is
so very thin as to produce absolutely no perceptible effect on the
reflected light, that is to say, so thin as to be absolutely invisible.
If in the apparatus for measuring contact electricity, of which the
drawing is before you ('Nature,' vol. xxiii. p. 567), two plates of
freshly polished copper be placed in the Volta condenser, a very
perfect zero of effect is obtained.      If, then, one of the plates be
taken out, heated slightly by laying it on a piece of hot iron, and
then allowed to cool again and replaced in the Volta condenser, it is
found that negative electricity becomes condensed on the surface thus
treated, and positive electricity on the bright copper surface facing
it, when the two are in metallic connection. If the same process be
repeated with somewhat higher temperatures,          or somewhat longer
times of exposure to it, the electrical difference         is
                                                      augmented.    These
effects are very sensible before any perceptible tint appears on the
copper surface as modified by heat.        The effect goes on increasing
with higher and higher temperatures of the heating influence, until

through   a ruddier colour to dark-blue slate colour, when no farther
                                    a
heating seems to augment the effect. The greatest contact-electricity
effect which  I thus obtained between      bright freshly polished copper
                                               a
surface and an opposing face of copper, rendered almost black by
oxidation, was such as to require for the neutralising potential in my
mode of experimenting * about one-half of the potential of       Daniell'sa
cell.
      Some not hitherto published experiments with polished silver
plates, which I   made fifteen years ago, showed me very startlingly
an electric influence from a quite infinitesimal whiff of iodine vapour.
The effect on the contact-electricity quality of the surface seems to
go on continuously from the first lodgment, to all other tests quite
imperceptible, of few atoms or molecules of the attacking substance

electric action we are enabled as it were to sound the depth of the
ocean of molecules attracted to the metallic surface by the vapour or
gas entering into combination with it.
     When we come to thicknesses of considerably less than a wave-
length we find solid metals becoming transparent.           Through the
kindness of Prof. Dewar       I  am able to show you some exceedingly
thin films of measured thicknesses of platinum, gold, and silver,
placed on glass plates.     The platinum is of 1*9 x 10 -5 cm. thickness,
and is quite opaque; but here is a gold film of about the same
thickness, which is transparent to the electric light, as you see, and
 transmits the beautiful green colour which you see on the screen.
 The thickness of this gold (1*9, or nearly 2) is just half the wave-
length of violet light in air. This transparent gold, transmitting
green light to the screen as you see, at the same time reflects yellow
light to the ceiling.   Now
                       -5 of
                               I will show you the silver. It is thinner,
being only 1*5 x 10           a centimetre thick, or fths of the air- wave-
 length of violet light. It is quite opaque to the electric light so far
 as our eyes allow us to judge, and reflects all the light up to the
ceiling.    It is not wonderful that it should be opaque ; we might
 wonder if it were otherwise ; but there is an invisible ultra-violet
light of a small range of wave-lengths, including a zinc line of air
 wave-length 3*4 X 10~ 5, which this silver film transmits.      For that
                                                5
 particular light the silver film of 1 • 5 x 10~ thickness is transparent.
 The image which you now see on the screen is a magic lantern repre-
 sentation of the self-photographed spectrum of light that actually
 came through that silver.       You see the zinc line very clear across
 it near its middle. Here then we have gold and silver transparent.
 The silver is opaque for all except that very definite light of wave-
 lengths from about 3*07 to 3*32.
     The different refrangibility of different colours is a result of
 observation of vital importance in the question of the size of atoms.
 You now see on the screen before you a prismatic spectrum, a well-
 known phenomenon produced by the differences of the refractions of
 the different colours in traversing the prism.     The explanation of it
in the undulatory theory of light has taxed the powers of mathe-
maticians to the utmost.        Look first, however, to what is easy and
made clear by that diagram (Fig. 3) before you, and you will easily
 understand that refraction depends on difference of velocity of propa-
gation of light in the two transparent mediums concerned. The
angles in the diagram are approximately correct, for refraction at an
interface between air or vacuum and flint glass ; and you see that in
this case the velocity of propagation is less in the denser medium.
The more refractive medium (not always the denser) of the two has
the less velocity for light transmitted through it.       The " refractive
       "
index of any transparent medium is the ratio of the velocity of pro-
pagation in the ether to the velocity of propagation in the transparent
substance.
     Now that the velocity of the propagation of light should      be  dif-

ferent in different mediums, and should in most cases be smaller in
the denser than in the less dense medium, is quite what we should,
according to dynamical principles, expect from any conceivable consti-
tution of the luniimferous ether and of palpable transparent substance.
But that the velocity of propagation in any one transparent substance
 should be different for light of different colours, that is to say, of
different periods of vibration, is not what we should expect, and could
not possibly be the fact if the medium is homogeneous, without any
limit as to the smallness of the parts of which the qualities are com-
pared.    The fact that the velocity of propagation does depend on the
                    I
period, gives what believe to be irrefragable proof that the substance

of palpable transparent matter, such as water, or glass, or the bisul-
phuret of carbon of this prism, whose spectrum is before you, is not
infinitely homogeneous ; but that, on the contrary, if contiguous por-
tions of any such medium, any medium in fact which can give the
prismatic colours, be examined at intervals not incomparably small in
comparison with the wave-lengths, utterly heterogeneous quality will
be discovered ; such heterogeneousness as that which we understand,
in palpable matter, as the difference between solid and fluid ; or
between substances differing enormously in density ; or such hetero-
geneousness as differences of velocity and direction of motion, in
different positions of a vortex ring in an homogeneous liquid; or
such differences of material occupying the space examined, as we
find in a great mass of brick building when we pass from brick to
brick through mortar (or through void, as we too often find in Scotch-
built domestic brick chimneys).

   Cauchy was,     I believe, the first of mathematicians or naturalists
to allow himself   to be driven to the conclusion that the refractive
dispersion of light can only be accounted for by a finite degree of
molecular coarse-grainedness in the structure of the transparent
refracting matter ; and as, however we view the question, and how-
ever much we may feel compelled to differ from the details of mole-
cular structure and molecular inter-action assumed by Cauchy, we
remain more and more surely fortified in his conclusion, that finite
grainedness of transparent palpable matter is the cause of the dif-
ference of the velocity of different colours of light propagated through
it, we must regard Cauchy as the discoverer of the dynamical theory
of the prismatic colours.
     But now we come to the grand difficulty of Cauchy's theory.*

(Figs. 4 and 5) illustrate a wave in which there are twelve molecules
in the wave-length   ;  this one   (Fig. 4) showing (by   the length and

position of the arrows) the magnitude and direction of velocity of
each molecule at the instant when one of the molecules is on the crest
of the wave, or has reached its maximum displacement ; that one
(Fig. 5) showing the magnitude and direction of the velocities after
the wave has advanced such a distance as (in this case equal to l-24th
of the wave-length) to bring the crest of the wave to midway between
two molecules.    This pair of diagrams (Figs. 6 and 7) shows the
same for waves having four molecules in the wave-length, and this
pair (Figs. 8 and 9) for a wave having two molecules in the wave-
length.
    The more nearly this critical case is approached, that is to say,
the shorter the wave-length down to the limit of twice the distance
from molecule to molecule, the less becomes the difference between
the two configurations of motion constituted by waves travelling in
opposite directions.  In the extreme or critical case the difference is
annulled, and the motion is not a wave motion, but a case of what is
often called " standing vibration."  Before     I
                                              conclude this evening      I
hope to explain in detail the kind of motion which we find instead of
wave-motion (become mathematically imaginary), when the vibrational
period of the exciter is anything less than the critical value, because
this case is of extreme importance and interest in physical optics,
according to Stokes's hitherto unpublished explanation of phospho-
rescence.
     This supposition of each molecule acting with direct force only
on  its nearest neighbour is not exactly the postulate on which Cauchy
works. He supposes each molecule to act on all around        it,according
to some law of rapid decrease as the distance increases  ;  but this must
make the influence of coarse-grainedness on the velocity of propaga-
tion smaller than   it   ison the simple assumption realised in the
models and diagrams before you, which therefore represents the
extreme limit of the efficacy of Cauchy's unmodified theory to
explain dispersion.
     Now, by looking at the little table (Table II.) of calculated
results, you will see that, with as few as 20 molecules in the wave-
length, the velocity of propagation     99 per cent, of what
                                       is   J                       would
                                                                   it
be with an infinite number of molecules     hence the extreme difference
                                            ;
of propagational velocity, accountable for by Cauchy's unmodified
theory in its idealised extreme of mutual action limited to nearest
neighbours, amounts to l-200th. Now look at this table (Table III.)
of refractive indices, and you see that the difference of velocity of
red light A, and of violet light H, amounts in carbon disulphide to
l-17th in dense flint glass to nearly l-30th in hard crown glass
          ;                                         ;
to l-73rd     and in water and alcohol to rather more than l-100th.
              ;
Hence, none of these substances can have so many as 20 molecules in
the wave-length, if dispersion    is to be accounted for by Cauchy's
unmodified theory,   and by looking back to the little table of calculated
results (Table II.), you will see that there could not be more than
12 molecules in the wave-length of violet light in water or alcohol       ;

 phide actually not more                than 4 molecules             in the wave-length, if we
are to depend          upon Cauchy's unmodified theory for the explanation
of dispersion. So large coarse-grainedness of ordinary transparent
bodies, solid or fluid, is quite untenable.                        Before   I  conclude,   I  intend
to show you, from the kinetic theory of gases, a superior limit to the
size of molecules, according to which, in glass or in water, there is
probably something like 600 molecules to the wave-length, and
almost certainly not fewer than 2, or 3, or 400.                               But even without
any    such   definite     estimate      of   a  superior     limit   to  the   size of molecules,
there are many reasons against                    the  admission         that    it is probable or
possible there can be only four, or five, or six, to the wave-length.
The very drawing, by Nobert, of 4000 lines on a breadth of a milli-
metre, or at the rate of 40,000 to the centimetre, or about two to the
ether wave-length of blue (F) light,* seems quite to negative the idea
of any such possibility of only five or six molecules to the wave-length,
even if we were not to declare against it from theory and observation
of the reflection of light from polished surfaces.
      We must then find another explanation of dispersion.                               I   believe
there is another explanation.                   I believe that, while giving up Cauchy's
unmodified theory of dispersion, we shall find that the same general
principle is applicable, and that by imagining each molecule to be
loaded in a certain definite way by elastic connection with heavier
matter — each molecule of the ether to have, in palpable transparent
matter, a small fringe so to speak of particles, larger and larger in

 It is not seventeen hours since saw the possibility of this explana-
 tion.    I  think    I  now see it perfectly, but you will excuse my not
 going    into  the    theory  more fully under the circumstances.*            The
 difficulty    of  Cauchy's theory has weighed heavily upon me when
 thinking of bringing this subject before you.            I could not bring it
 before you and say there are only four particles in the wave-length,
       I
 and could not bring it before you without saying there is some other
 explanation.       I  believe another explanation is distinctly to be had in
 the manner      I have slightly indicated.
      Now look at those beautiful distributions of colour on the screen
 before you. They are diffraction spectrums from a piece of glass
 ruled with 2000 lines to the inch. And again look, and you see one
 diffraction spectrum by reflection from one of Eutherford's gratings,
 in which there are 17,000 lines to the inch on polished speculum-

 metal. The explanation by " interference            is substantially the same
 as that which the undulatory theory gives for Newton's rings of light
 reflected from the two surfaces, which you have already seen. Where
 light-waves from the apertures between the successive bars of the
 grating reach the screen in the same phase, they produce light;
 there, again, where they are in opposite phases, they produce darkness.
      The beautiful colours which are produced depend on the places
 of conspiring and opposing vibrations on the screen, being different
 for light-waves of different wave-lengths ; and it is by the measure-
 ments of the dimensions of a diffraction spectrum such as the first
 set you saw (or of finer spectrums from coarser gratings) that Fraun-
 hofer first determined the wave-lengths of the different colours.

                                "
 empty glass tube — it is optically void."          A beam of electric light
 passes through it now, and you see nothing. Now the light is stopped,
and we admit vapour of carbon disulphide into the tube.                  There is
now introduced some of this vapour to about 3 inches pressure, and
there is also introduced, to the amount of 15 inches pressure, air
impregnated with a little nitric acid, making in all rather less than
the atmospheric pressure.           What is to be illustrated here is the
presence of molecules of substances produced by the decomposition
of carbon disulphide by the light. At present you see nothing in the
tube ; it still continues to be, as before the admission of the vapours,

Nicol's prism, and by looking through it find the azure light coming
from the vapours in any direction perpendicular to the exciting beam
of light to be very completely polarised in the plane through my eye
and the exciting beam.           It consists of light-vibrations in one definite
direction, and that, as finally demonstrated by Professor Stokes, it
seems to me beyond all doubt, through reasoning on this phenomenon
of polarisation,* which he had observed in various experimental ar-
rangements giving minute solid or liquid particles scattered through
a transparent medium, must be the direction perpendicular to the
plane of polarisation.
      What you are now about to see, and what tell you     I             I have seen
through     the   Nicol's    prism,  is due   to what   I  may   call  secondary or
derived waves of light diverging from very minute liquid spherules,
condensed in consequence             of the chemical decomposing influence
exerted by the beam of light on the matter in the tube, which was all
gaseous when the light was first admitted.
      To understand these derived waves, first you must regard them as
due to motion of the ether round each spherule ; the spherule being
almost absolutely fixed, because its density is enormously greater than
     * Extract from Professor Stokes's paper " On the Change of Refrangibility of
Light," read before the Royal Society, May 27th, 1852, and published in the

  Transactions' for that date: —
    "§ 183. Now this result appears to me to have no remote bearing on the
question of the directions of the vibration in polarised light.     So long as the sus-
pended particles are large compared with the waves of light, reflection takes place
as it would from a portion of the surface of a large solid immersed in the fluid,
and no conclusion can be drawn either way. But if the diameters of the particles
be small compared with the length of a wave of light, it seems plain that the
vibrations in a reflected ray cannot be perpendicular to the vibrations in the inci-
dent ray.    Let us suppose for the present, that in the case of the beams actually
observed, the suspended particles were small compared with the length of a wave
of light. Observation showed that the reflected ray was polarised.         Now all the
appearances presented by a plane polarised ray are symmetrical with respect to
the plane of polarisation. Hence we have two directions to choose between for
the direction of the vibrations in the reflected ray, namely, that of the incident
ray, and a direction perpendicular      to both the incident and the reflected rays.
The former would be necessarily perpendicular to the directions of vibration in
the incident ray, and therefore we are obliged to choose the latter, and conse-
quently to suppose that the vibrations of plane polarised light are perpendicular
to the plane of polarisation, since experiment shows that the plane of polarisation
of the reflected ray is the plane of reflection.      According to this theory, if we
resolve the vibrations in the [horizontal] incident ray horizontally and vertically,
the resolved parts will correspond to the two rays, polarised respectively in and
perpendicularly to the plane of reflection, into which the incident ray may be
conceived to be divided, and of these the former alone is capable of furnishing
a            ray reflected vertically upwards [to be seen by an eye above the line of
the incident ray, and looking vertically downwards].        And, in fact, observation
shows that, in order to quench the dispersed beam, it is sufficient, instead of
analysing the reflected light, to polarise the incident light in a plane perpendicular
to the plane of reflection."

that of the ether surrounding it. The motion that the ether had in
virtue of the exciting beam of light alone, before the spherules came
into existence, may be regarded as being compounded with the motion
of the ether relatively to each spherule, to produce the whole resultant
motion experienced by the ether when the beam of light passes along
the tube, and azure light is seen proceeding from it laterally.      Now
this second component motion is clearly the same as the whole motion
of the ether would be, if the exciting light were annulled and each
spherule kept vibrating in the opposite direction, to and fro through
the same range as that which the ether in its place had, in virtue of
the exciting light, when the spherule was not there.

you see will consist of vibrations parallel to that line.      But if you
place you eye in the line of the vibration of a spherule, situated about
the middle of the tube, you will see no light in that direction ; but
keeping your eye in the same position, if you look obliquely towards
either end of the tube, you will see light fading into darkness, as you

all the vibrations are parallel to one line — and if you look at the tube
in the direction perpendicular to this line and to the length of the
tube, you will see light of which the vibrations will be parallel to
that same line. But if you look at the tube in any direction parallel
to this line, you will see no light ; and the line along which you see
no light is the direction of the vibrations in the exciting beam ; and

 The principle is mechanically represented by this model (described
above with reference      to Fig. 2).    A simple harmonic motion is,
as you now see, sustained by my hand in the uppermost bar, in
a period of about four seconds.         You see that a regular wave-
motion travels down the line of molecules represented by these
circular disks on the ends of the bars, and the energy continually
given to the top bar, by my hand, is continually consumed in heating
the basin of treacle and water at the foot.        I
                                               now remove my hand and
leave the whole system to itself.        The very considerable sum of
kinetic and potential energies of the large masses and spiral springs,
attached to the top bar, is gradually spent in sending the diminishing
series of waves down the line, and is ultimately converted into heat
in the treacle and water.    You see that about half of the amplitude
of vibration, and therefore three-fourths of the energy, is lost in half
a minute.
     You will see on quickening the oscillation how very different the
result will be. The quick oscillations which            I
                                                    now give to the top
bar (the period having been reduced to about one and a half seconds),
is incapable of sending waves along the line of molecules ; and it is
that rapid oscillation of the particles which, according to Stokes, con-
stitutes latent or stored-up light.    Remark now that when          I
                                                                  remove
my hand from the top bar, as no waves travel down the line, no energy
is spent in the treacle ; and the vibration goes on for ever (or, to be
more exact, say for one minute) as you see, with no loss (or, to be quite
in accordance with what we see, let me say scarcely any sensible loss).
This is a mechanical model correctly illustrating the dynamical
principle of Stokes's explanation of phosphorescence or stored-up
light, stored as in the now well-known luminous paint, of which you
see the action in this specimen, and in the phosphorescent sulphides of
lime in these glass tubes kindly lent by Mr. De La Rue. (Experi-
ment shown.)
   Now   I   will show you Stokes's phenomenon   of fluorescence in a
piece of uranium glass.       I
                          hold it in the beam from the electric lamp
dispersed by the prism as you see. You see the uranium glass now
visible by being illuminated by invisible rays. The rays by which it
is illuminated even before it comes into the visible rays are manifestly
invisible so far as the screen receiving the spectrum is a test of
visibility ; because the uranium glass, and my hands holding         it,
                                                                   throw
no shadow on the screen.       Also you see the uranium glass which        I
hold in my hand in the ultra-violet light, while you do not see my
hand. I     now bring    it nearer the place where you see the air (or
rather the dust in it)  illuminated by the violet light still no shadow

brilliantly with its green light of very mixed constitution, consisting
of waves of longer periods than that of the ultra-violet, which tho
incident light, of shorter period than that of violet light, causes the
particles of the uranium glass to emit. This light        altogether un-

                                                                 p   2

210                            Sir William Thomson                         [Feb. 2,
its periods being all less than those of the exciting light, that led
Stokes to distinguish this illumination, which you see in the uranium
 glass,* from the mere molecular illumination (always polarised
partially if not completely, and always of the same period as that of
the exciting light) which we were looking at previously in Dr.
 Tyndall's experiment.
     Stokes gave the name of fluorescence to the glowing with light of
larger period than the exciting light, because it is observed in fluor
spar, and he wished to avoid all hypothesis in his choice of a name.
He pointed out a strong resemblance between it and the old known
phenomenon of phosphorescence ; but he found some seeming contrasts
between the two, which prevented him from concluding fluorescence
to be in reality a case of phosphorescence.
     In the course of a comparison between the two phenomena (sec-
tions 221 to 225 of his 1852 paper), the following statement is
given: — "But by far the most striking point of contrast between the
two phenomena consists in the apparently instantaneous commence-
ment and cessation of the illumination, in the case of internal
dispersion when the active light is admitted and cut off. There is
nothing to create the least suspicion of any appreciable duration in
the effect.     When internal dispersion is exhibited by means of an
electric spark, it appears no less momentary than the illumination of
a landscape by a flash of lightning.          I  have not attempted to determine
whether any appreciable duration could be made out by means of a
revolving mirror."          The investigation here suggested has been
actually made by Edmund Becquerel, and the question — Is there any
appreciable duration in the glow of fluorescence ? — has been answered
affirmatively by this beautiful and simple little machine before you,
which he invented for the purpose.                   The experiment giving the
answer is most interesting, and             I   am sure you will see it with
pleasure. It consists of a flat circular box, with two holes facing one
another in the flat sides near the circumference ; inside are two disks,
carried by a rapidly revolving shaft, by which the holes are alter-
    * The same phenomenon is to be seen splendidly in sulphate of quinine. An
interesting experiment may be made by writing on a white paper screen, with a
finger or a brush dipped in a solution of sulphate of quinine. The marking is
quite imperceptible   in ordinary light ; but if a prismatic spectrum be thrown on
the screen, with the ultra-violet invisible light on the part which had been written
on with the sulphate of quinine, the writing is seen glowing brilliantly with a
bluish light, and darkness all round.     The phenomenon presented by sulphate of
quinine and many other vegetable solutions, and some minerals, as, for instance,
fluor spar, and various ornamental glasses, as a yellow Bohemian glass, called in
                          "
commerce " canary glass (giving a dispersed greenish light), had been discovered
oy Sir David Brewster (' Transactions,' Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1833, and
British Association, Newcastle, 1838), and had been investigated also by Sir
John Herschel, and by him called " epipolic dispersion " (' Phil. Trans.,' 1845). A
complete experimental analysis of the phenomenon, showing precisely what it was
that the previous observers had seen, and explaining many singularly mysterious
things which they had noticed, was made by Stokes, and described in his paper,

 nately shut and opened ; one open when the other is closed, and vice
 versa.    A little piece of uranium glass is fixed inside the box between
  the two holes, and a beam of light from the electric lamp falls upon
 one of the holes.      You look at the other.
                    I
      Now when turn the shaft slowly you see nothing. At this instant
 the light falls on the uranium glass through the open hole far from
 you, but you see nothing, because the hole next you is shut. Now the
 hole next you is open, but you see nothing, because the hole next the
 light is shut, and the uranium glass shows no perceptible after-glow as
 arising from its previous illumination. This agrees exactly with what
 you saw when      I  held the large slab of uranium glass in the ultra-violet

 there you saw it glowing ; the moment            I

                                                    took it out of the invisible
 light it ceased to glow. The " moment              of which we were then cog-
 nisant may have been the tenth of a second.            If the uranium glass had
continued to glow sensibly for the twentieth or the fiftieth of a second,
 it would have seemed to our slow-going sense of vision to cease the
 moment it was taken out.          Now   I  turn the wheel at such a rate that
 the hole next you is open about a fiftieth of a second after the uranium
 glass was bathed in light ; still you see nothing.           I turn it faster and
 faster, and it now begins to glow, when the hole next you is open about
the two-hundredth of a second after the immediately preceding admis-
sion of light by the other hole.            I turn it faster and faster, and it
glows    more  and    more  brightly,  till  now  it is glowing like a red coal ;
further augmentation of the speed shows, as you see, but little
difference in the glow.
      Thus it seems that fluorescence is essentially the same as phos-
phorescence ; and we may expect that substances                     will be found
continuously bridging over the difference of quality between this
uranium glass, which glows only for a few thousandths of a second,
and the luminous sulphides which glow for hours or days or weeks
after the cessation of the exciting light.
      The most decisive and discriminating method of estimating the
size of atoms     I  have left until my allotted hour is gone — that founded
on the kinetic theory of gases. Here is a diagram (Fig. 11) of a
crowd of atoms or molecules showing, on a scale of 1,000,000 to 1, all
the molecules of air, of which the centres may at any instant be in a
space of a square of 1-10, 000th of a centimetre side and 1-1 00,000,000th
of a centimetre thick.        The side of the square you see in the diagram
is a metre, and represents 1-10, 000th of a centimetre.                The diagram
shows just 100 molecules, being 1- 10,000th of the whole number of
particles (10°) in the cube of 1-1 0,000th centimetre, or all the mole-
cules in a slice of l-10,000th of the thickness of that cube.              Think of
a cube filled with particles, like these glass balls,* scattered at random
     * The piece of apparatus bow exhibited, illustrated tlie collisions taking place
between   the molecules of gaseous matter and the diffusion of one gas into
another.   It consisted of a board of about one metre square, perforated with

through a space equal to 1000 times the sum of their volumes.                Such
a crowd may be condensed (just as air may be condensed) to 1-lOOOth
of its volume, but this condensation brings the molecules into contact.
Something comparable with this may be imagined to be the condition
of common air of ordinary density, as in our atmosphere.                      The
diagram with size of each molecule, which, if shown in it to scale,

100 holes in ten rows of ten holes each.    From each hole was suspended a cord
five metres long.   To the lower end of each cord, in five contiguous rows, there
was secured a blue coloured glass ball of four centimetres diameter ; and similarly
to each cord of the other five rows, a red coloured ball of the same size. A ball
from one of the outer rows was pulled aside, and, being set free, it plunged in
amongst the others, causing collisions throughout the whole plane in which the
suspended balls were situated.

 an actual diameter l-10,000,000th of a centimetre, represents a gas in
 which a condensation of 1 to 10 linear, or 1 to 1000 in bulk, would
 bring the molecules close together.
      Now you are to imagine the particles moving in all directions,
 each in a straight line until it collides with another.                The average
 length of free path is 10 centimetres in our diagram, representing
 l-100,000th of a centimetre in reality.               And to suit the case of atmo-
 spheric air of ordinary density and at ordinary pressure you must
 suppose the actual velocity of each particle to be 50,000 centimetres
 per second, which will make the average time from collision to collision
 l-5,000,000,000th of a second.
                                                  I
      The time is so far advanced that cannot speak of the details of
 this exquisite kinetic theory, but            I  will just say that three points
 investigated by     Maxwell     and   Clausius, viz. the viscosity or want of
 perfect fluidity of gases, the diffusion of gases into one another, and
 the diffusion of heat through gases — all these put together give an
 estimate for the average length of the free path of a molecule.               Then
 a beautiful theory of Clausius enables us, from the average length of
 the free path, to calculate the magnitude of the atom.                That is what
 Loschmidt has done,* and I, unconsciously following in his wake,
 have come to the same conclusion ; that is, we have arrived at the
absolute certainty that the dimensions of a molecule of air are something
                     I
like that which have stated.
                                                  I
     The four lines of argument which have now indicated lead all to
substantially the same estimate of the dimensions of molecular
structure. Jointly they establish, with what we cannot but regard as
a very high degree of probability,                  the conclusion that, in any
ordinary     liquid,   transparent      solid,   or   seemingly opaque solid, the
mean distance between the centres of contiguous molecules is less than
the l-5,000,000th, and greater than the l-l,000,000,000th of a centi-
metre.
     To form some conception of the degree of coarse-grainedness
indicated by this conclusion, imagine a globe of water or glass, as
large as a football,! to be magnified up to the size of the earth, each
constituent molecule being magnified in the same proportion.                    The
magnified structure would be more coarse-grained than a heap of
small shot, but probably less coarse-grained than a heap of footballs.

  1883.]   Mr. Conway   on "Emerson and his Views of Nature."         217
                   WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                        Friday, February   9, 1883.
             Henry Pollock, Esq. Manager, in the Chair.
                   Moncure D. Conway, Esq. M.A.
                " Emerson    and   his Views  of Nature."
 When the statue of Carlyle was unveiled, the speaker on that occa-
 sion (Dr. Tyndall) expressed the hope that some day a memorial of
 Ralph Waldo Emerson might be placed beside it.         The long friend-
 ship between those men, which defied dissimilarities and differences
 to sunder their hearts, was due to their profound moral relationship.
 They were children of the Human Age of Literature.         Indeed Lite-
rature is hardly a large enough word to describe the works of men
 whose words were
                      " half-battles " and victories. The artist of the
Carlyle memorial has significantly piled Carlyle's books beneath his
chair.   For Emerson, however, the intellectual and poetic life and
work were precisely those which circumstances made the most prac-
tical and humane.        Although, by moral and humane aims, the
descendant of the Puritans and the descendant of the Covenanters
were brothers, the chief influence on the intellect of Emerson was
rather that of Wordsworth, whose poetry raised in him the vision of
a loving life with nature.     When Emerson visited Eydal Mount in
1833, Wordsworth       warmly advised him against too much intel-
lectual culture.    He may have recognised the fact that Emerson
was at that   time  chiefly interested in the discussions which had
followed the controversy between Geofiroy St. Hilaire and Cuvier.
Of all that literature which prepared the way for Charles Darwin's
great generalisation, in French, German, and English, Emerson
was an assiduous student.      Perhaps his first lecture was one given
in the Winter of 1833-34, on 1 The Relation of Man to the Globe.'
It has not been published or reported, but Dr. Emerson has explored
it for me, and it contains passages showing elation at meeting the
dawn of a great truth. " By the study of the globe in very recent
times we have become acquainted with a fact the most surprising —
I  may say, the most sublime — to wit, that man, who stands in the
globe so proud and powerful, is no upstart in the creation, but has been
prophesied in nature for a thousand, thousand ages before he appeared ;
that from times incalculably remote there has been a progressive

218                          Mr. Conway                            [Feb. 9,
preparation for him, an effort (as physiologists say,) to produce him :
the meaner    creatures, the primeval sauri, containing the elements of
his structure and pointing at it on every side, whilst the world was at
the same time preparing to be habitable by him.          He was not made
sooner because his house was not ready." "Man is made, the
creature who seems a refinement on the form of all who went before
him, and more perfect in the image of his Maker by the gift of moral
nature ; but his limbs are only a more exquisite organization, — say,
rather, the finish of the rudimental forms that have been already
sweeping the sea and creeping in the mud: the brother of his
hand is even now cleaving the Arctic sea in the fin of the whale,
and innumerable ages since was pawing the marsh in the flipper of
the saurus."      It is in a sense studying the law of evolution itself to
study the impression it made upon the mind of Emerson, as a law of
which he was absolutely convinced in the beginning of his career.
His first book Nature (1836) is a Vedas of the scientific age, in which
instead of man's ancient worship of sun, cloud, star, these glorious
objects unite in celebration of Man.       The development of man is the
spiritualization of nature. The course of man's culture turns nature
to a kingdom of Use, translates its laws into ethics, its aspects into
language, its facts and phenomena into science, builds its sublimities
into a temple.      Man is what nature means.       The only break in the
radiant optimism of the book is a complaint that Science had not ex-
plained the relationship of man to the forms around him, the unity
of things ; and almost at the very moment when that book appeared
(Sept., 1836) young Charles Darwin landed from the Beagle with tidings
of the new intellectual world for which the new world thinker was call-
ing.    It was to be twenty-two years yet before Darwin was prepared to
announce his theory, but meanwhile Emerson had gained some farther
light in that direction. It came to him while exploring an unpro-
mising region, — the works of John Hunter.          In an essay he speaks
of an " electric word " of Hunter's on development.        I  can find but
one reference to development in Hunter's works.          Palmer's Hunter
appeared in 1835, while Emerson was writing his Nature, and its
reference to development is in Vol.    I.,   afootnote to p. 265 — "
                                                               :       Ifwe
were capable of following the progress of increase of number of the
parts of the most perfect animal, as they formed in succession, from the
very first to its state of full perfection, we should probably be able to
compare    it  to some of the incomplete animals themselves of every
 order of animals in the creation, being at no stage different from some
of those inferior orders or in other words,
                        ;                        ifwe were to take a series
of animals, from the more imperfect to the perfect, we should probably
 find an imperfect animal corresponding with some stage of the most
perfect."
      The fact that each animal passes in the course of its development
 through stages comparable to those of adult animals of lower organiza-
 tion is now explained by evolution; to Emerson       itwas itself partial
                                                                   a
 explanation, bringing order into phenomena which traditional theories

1883.]              on  "Emerson and his Views of Nature."               219
left chaotic.    His second essay on Nature (1844) shows him realising
how vast may be the function of a small agency working in boundless
time and boundless space.        Geology, he says, has taught us to disuse
our dame-school measures.          " We knew nothing rightly for want of
perspective.      Now we learn what patient periods must round them-
selves before the rock is formed, then before the rock is broken, and
the first lichen race has disintegrated the thinnest external plate into
soil, and opened the door for the remote flora, Ceres and Pomona, to
come in.      How far off yet is trilobite ! how far the quadruped ! how
inconceivably remote is man !         All duly arrive, and then race after
race of men.       It is a long way from granite to oyster ; farther yet to
Plato and the preaching of the immortality of the soul. Yet all must
come as surely as the atom has two sides."         Simultaneously with the
                                                                            '
appearance     of   this  essay in  America, the   4
                                                     Vestiges of Creation
appeared in England.        Agassiz sought to persuade Emerson that these
relations and degrees of forms were only ideal ; but Emerson's ideal-
ism was too wide to admit of any dualism in nature.          In the order of
thought he read the order of nature, before it was proved. " Develop-
ment" was the religion of Emerson before it was the discovery of
science.    It was the vision of his poetic genius, the affirmation of his
moral enthusiasm, the hope of his humanity.          He founded his life and
work upon it long before Darwin proved that he had founded on a
rock. Whenever he touched the theme he broke forth into song.
In his poem " Musketaquid " his view of natural evolution is exquis-
itely humanised.
      The charm which Emerson's writings have for scientific men is
partly due to the nature in them ; but also to the fact that in them is
foreshadowed the kind of character, sentiment, religion, legitimately
related to the scientific generalisations which have alarmed many
worthy people, not unnaturally solicitous for the spiritual beauty of
life.   When      others were alarmed at this or that new statement,
Emerson said: "Fear not the new generalisation.              Does the fact
look crass and material, threatening to degrade thy theory of Spirit ?
Resist it not ; it goes to refine thy theory of matter just as much."
This is from his ' First Series of Essays,' a volume which closes with
this pregnant sentence: — "When Science is learned in love, and its
powers are wielded by love, they will appear the supplements and
continuations of the material creation."          Whatever his audience,
Emerson always did his best ; he never put out his talent to work
for him, reserving his genius. In America Emerson's life and spirit
were always the strongest argument on the progressive side.            When
his house was burned down, in 1872, persons of different parties and
beliefs insisted, despite his deprecations, on rebuilding what had been
a home for many minds.

 George Busk, Esq. F.E.S. Treasurer and Vice-President,           in the Chair.
             Professor William C. Williamson, LL.D, F.R.S.
      On  some Anomalous    Oolitic and Palceozoic forms     of Vegetation.
In   the course of lectures which     I  have delivered in this hall during
the last few weeks      I  have tried to show the kind and amount of
support which the study of fossil vegetation renders to the Darwinian
doctrine of Evolution. With such an aim, attention was necessarily
limited to plants whose true botanical affinities appeared to me to be
virtually indisputable.     This limitation was indispensable, since such
plants alone could be admitted as evidence when the question of the
pedigree of the vegetable kingdom was in question. Plants whose
organisation was obscure, and whose external forms might indicate,
with equal probability, relationship to more than one amongst the very
different types which appeared during the later developments of the
vegetable kingdom, could not be relied upon as witnesses testifying
to the facts which actually occurred a* ages rolled by.
     Unfortunately the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic strata have furnished a
considerable number of such undetermined plants. The history of the
study of many of these is but too humiliating to scientific men. A
considerable number of objects which, beyond doubt, were not vege-
tables have had places assigned to them in the history of the plant race ;
whilst other very similar, but equally indeterminable forms, may not
only have been plants, but as such may have played a very important
part in the genetic chain of vegetable life.              Such objects must
have had an ancestry, and may have had important descendants.               Yet,
owing   to  their obscure indications,   we   can  assign to them  no  position
in the story of vegetable ontogeny. It is to a few striking examples
of these doubtful objects that         I   propose calling your attention
to-night.
     In Plate II. Fig.   6, and Plate    III.  Fig. 7, of Young and Bird's
'
  Geological Survey of the Yorkshire Coast,' published in 1822, two
specimens of fossil plants are represented. The former of these speci-
mens was regarded by the authors as the fruit of a Cycadean plant,
the leaves of which occur in the stratum in which the specimen was
found, in great abundance.       This stratum is a ferruginous sandstone,
one of the subdivisions of the Inferior oolite seen at Runswiok Bay
and other parts of the sea-coast of north Yorkshire.                I obtained
numerous specimens of the same objects in 1832 and subsequent
              I
years, and had the opportunity of examining others in the museums

published until 1868.* The conclusions at which then arrived were
that the two very different objects on the table before us were possibly
the male and female reproductive organs of some Dioecious plant ;
and from their apparently constant association in the Oolitic sand-
stone of Salt wick and Hawsker with the fronds and stems of the
Cycad, Zamia gigas,       I
                         said " the inference that they are parts of one
plant, though incapable of proof, is forcibly suggested,"
                                                            " at all events

immediate result has been the limitation of the genus Williamsonia
to these reproductive organisms, and the restoration of the name
Zamia gigas to the stems and fronds to which it was originally
applied, and respecting the Cycadean character of which there is no
doubt.
     What, then, are Williamsonia gigas and its allies ? Dr. Nathorst of
Stockholm has published a memoir,* in which he suggests that it has
belonged to the curious fungoid-looking order of the Balanophorae.
This suggestion         I
                     am unable to adopt. An inspection of the shapeless
and shrivelled Balanophoraa, seen in any herbarium, will suffice to
show the improbability of their having ever been fossilized into the
elegant and sharply denned forms of the Williamsonia gigas.          The
Marquis of Saporta      is inclined to believe that it has been the in-
florescence of a spadicifloral Monocotyledon.    This supposition seems
to me quite as devoid of probability as that of M. Nathorst.         The
texture of its foliar organs still appears to me suggestive of an
abundant supply of the sclerenchyma, which produces the firmness,
almost rigidity, so characteristic of the foliage of the Cycads ; and            I
am far from certain that even yet its nearest relatives will not be
found in that group. Anyhow, for the present we can only conclude
that, whilst Williamsonia represents an undetermined form of vegeta-
tion, the importance of the genus is alike evident from its morpho-
logical peculiarities and its wide geographical diffusion.
      Ihave long possessed this specimen of a curious stem from the
beds in which Williamsonia gigas occurs, and which has been briefly
described by Sir Charles Bun bury under the name of Calamites
Beanii.^ The occurrence of a true Calamite in the Oolitic rocks
would be a palseontological fact of considerable importance ; but                I
cannot admit the Calamitean character of the plant so designated.
Indeed Sir Charles Bunbury kindly informs me that he has no strong
convictions about its Calamitean nature.       So far as external appear-
ances are concerned, it more closely resembles the stem of one of the
arborescent Graminese.      But such appearances have very little Tax-
onomic value.      Nevertheless, the plant stands out in prominent
distinctiveness from amongst the Ferns, Cycads, and Conifers that grew
around          it,
             forcibly suggesting the idea of an arborescent Monocoty-

     Though we have no great difficulty in determining what are and
what are not ferns, the difficulty     often insuperable when we try to

reduced, by the non-developinent of the cellular parenchyma, to little

outline of a  transverse section of a young branch less than an inch in
diameter.    We have a cellular pith, a, enclosed within a vascular zone.
The latter consists of detached clusters of vessels at b, surrounded by
a regular exogenous cylinder, c, composed of thin, radiating, vascular
laminae, separated by large medullary rays. This zone was surrounded
by a cambium layer, through which it obtained additions to its
periphery until it became a large, exogenously-developed tree. Exter-
nally to the vascular zone was a thick bark, chiefly composed of two
layers g, h. Two other facts of morphological importance may be
                                      Fig. 7.

 noticed. Four or five pairs of isolated vascular bundles, e, pass verti-
 cally through the inner bark, close to the periphery of the vascular
 zone, each pair of which eventually moves obliquely outwards to some
 unknown, but most probably foliar, appendage.             Upon the nature of
 these appendages ten years of diligent search has failed to throw any
 light.
     The second fact is connected with the vascular zone, c, when in its
 very young state. The vascular bundles, b, the vessels of which were not
 arranged in radiating order, then constituted an almost, if not absolutely
 unbroken ring, and were surrounded by the equally uninterrupted
 exogenous zone, c.    But the general growth of the latter and of the
 pith was not accompanied by any corresponding growth of this inter-
 mediate vascular zone, b ; hence this became broken up into the
 detached portions (Fig. 7 b) already mentioned.               So long as the
 exogenous cylinder, c, retained its integrity, it was surrounded by an
 equally uninterrupted zone of cambium, the instrument of its exoge-

  nous growth.      But these regular conditions have frequently been
  disturbed ; first by the cambium ring extending itself partially or
  wholly around one or both of the free paired bundles, e, leading
  either to a one-sided development of exogenous vascular laminae on
  their external sides, as at Fig. 7, e\ or sometimes, as in /, entirely sur-
  rounding a bundle with a complete cylinder of radiating laminae.
  But further irregular developments have sometimes taken place.
  Some of the cellular medullary rays separating the vascular laminaB
  of the zone c have undergone great enlargement, breaking up the
  zone into several segments of a circle ; and in one such example in
  my cabinet, the cambium has extended itself centripetally round the two
 converging sides of each vascular segment, and formed a boundary line
 between its inner angle b and the pith a.     The consequence of this has
  been the unwonted development of new vascular laminaB, which pro-
 ject centripetally into the pith from the cluster of non-radial vessels b.
       This tendency to a multiplication of independent centres of
 exogenous growth within the area of an enclosing bark, inevitably
 reminds the botanist of the not wholly dissimilar conditions charac-
 teristic of some Sapindaceae, such as Paullinia and Sejania. Only
 what is a variable feature in the Lyginodendron, is in these latter
 plants a regular and normal one ; but the strong tendency to such
 peculiar variations in an archaic type may easily be conceived to have
 led to the ultimate production of more constant differentiated forms.
      A second remarkable and anomalous stem from Burntisland, in
 Fifeshire, is described in the same memoir as the Lyginodendron,
 under the name of Heterangium Grievii.        This plant must have been
 sufficiently abundant to have formed a conspicuous object in the Car-
 boniferous forests of that portion of the primaeval world ; yet we are
as ignorant about its foliage, fructification, and botanical relationships
as we are of those of the Lyginodendron.
      In the ' Philosophical Transactions ' for 1878    I  described, under
the generic name of Asteromyelon, the central portions of the stem and
branches of a plant that was very common in the carboniferous area
of west Yorkshire, eastern Lancashire, and the intermediate Pennine
Hills. The discovery of its curious bark two years ago was made the
occasion by Messrs. Cash and Hicks of giving to this plant the
specific name of Williamsonia. In the general plan of its organisa-
tion this plant has many features in common with that of the living
Marsileaa.     This is especially the case with the bark ; but it exhibits
extraordinary variability in the structure of its central axis.        Some-
times the actual centre is occupied by a vascular bundle from which
cellular elements are almost, if not wholly, excluded. In other cases
this centre is occupied by a very large and beautiful pith, transverse
sections of which present the exquisite stellate form that led me to
give to the object its generic name of Asteromyelon.          We have here
another example of an organism exhibiting great variations of struc-
ture, due partly, no doubt, to differences of function, but partly to
difference of surroundings.

     Another group of anomalous objects has been found in the coal-
measures, to which     I  have given the provisional name of Sporocarpon.
These are small, spherical, hollow, cellular structures, often filled
with free-cells, reminding us of many of the reproductive structures
of the Khizocarpous plants.          I have little doubt that these are truly-
reproductive structures, but we have as yet wholly failed to discover
to what known fossil plants they belong, or to what order they must
be assigned.      Yet, as in the case of some other objects to which have    I
already referred, they are so far from being rare, and their individuality
of form is so marked, that they cannot have been unimportant morpho-
logical members of the Palaeozoic Vegetable Kingdom. They represent
links in the scale of life — but we know not what.
     The multiplicity of these indeterminable structures is great, and
consequently apt to discourage the investigator ; at the same time he
has his encouragements,          since some that have long been equally
obscure have at length rewarded persevering research by yielding up
their secrets. Two instances may be quoted as examples of forms
with which we have long been familiar, but whose true nature has
been ascertained but recently.          In the first of these our success has
been but partial.       I  long ago discovered numerous small spherical
objects, especially in the lower Carboniferous beds at Halifax, to which
I  assigned the name of Zygosporites (Fig. 8) : similar objects appear
                            to have been met with in France, and were
          Fig. 8.           believed by one French naturalist to be Zygo-
                            spores of the well-known aquatic living group
                            of the Desmidese.        I saw no sufficient reason
                            for recognising the existence of Desmids during
                            the Carboniferous age.        The problem has been
                            solved by the recent discovery of these objects
                            in the interior of a true Sporangium, proving
                            them to be the spores of some Cryptogamic
                            plant very different from a Desmid. Thus much
                            is finally settled. But we may venture further
and say that they are the spores of a Strobilus, which               I  some time
ago described under the name of Volhmannia Dawsoni.                  We have yet
to learn with certainty to what plant this Strobilus has belonged.
The probabilities are that it was Asterophyllitean.
     My second instance is still more important in its bearing upon
Palseontological Darwinism.            Some years ago a very remarkable
specimen was discovered in the lower coal-measures at Granton, near
Edinburgh, to which the name of Pothosites Grantoni was given, and
which has been quoted by Sir Charles Lyell and others * as a flower-
ing plant. Lyell says,
                              " The fossil has been referred to the Aroidise,
and there is every probability that it is a true member of this order.
There can at least be no doubt as to the high grade of its organisation,

                                                       long ago expressed
my strong doubts as to the correctness of this assertion.*             On a
 recent visit to the Museum of the Glasgow University, my friend,
Mr. John Young, showed me one impression of a newly discovered
specimen of the same plant which fully justified my scepticism as to
its Phanerogamous nature. The opposite and more perfect impression
was in the hands of Mr. Eobert Kidson, who has since described this
and other examples in a paper now passing through the press, but
who has not only provided me with impressions of the yet unpublished
plates, but has kindly allowed me to copy his figure of the Glasgow
specimen in the woodcut (Fig. 9). The fossil is evidently the fructifi-
cation of a plant of the Asterophyllitean type, having a jointed stem,
a, giving off verticils of short leaves, not only at the nodes of the nude
stem (b), but at those (&', b') of the spore-bearing part of the branch.")"
Unfortunately none of the specimens of Pothosites hitherto dis-
covered retain any traces of the internal organisation of their stems.
But there is not much difficulty in determining the general features
of this organism. The constrictions,        are obviously nodes like those

internodes c.      Now none of these Asterophyllitean plants give off
 organs of fructification from the internodes.        They always spring
directly or indirectly from the nodes. Each joint,      of Fig.

                                                                          9   is
of longitudinal lines of Sporangia which can have no organic union with
the stem which they invest, save at the node immediately below each
joint. In the hitherto known forms, the Sporangia spring directly or
mediately from the axils of separate leaves but they are frequently
                                                     ;
supported on separate small branches, which spring in verticils from
the node of some larger stem.        I  surmise that such      typically the
                                                                     is
 case in the Pothosites   ;only instead of each secondary branch consti-
 tuting   a distinct, free strobilus, as in Volkmannia and other allied
 forms, these strobili have here coalesced laterally, forming          cylin-      a
 drical investment of each internode of the axis — as the free anthers
 of an ordinary flower have, in the Compositse, coalesced into                              a
 cylinder enclosing the pistil. This explanation seems to me to indicate
 the true place of the Pothosites amongst the Verticillate-leaved plants
 of the coal-measures. At any rate we learn how great would have been
 the mistake of any framer of floral genealogies who, trusting to the
 authority of text-books, made the Monocotyledons originate with

    f  Mr. Kidson thinks that the plant  is the fructification of the genus Bornea.
I am not, however, sure that  it  can yet be identified with that obscure genus.
At present the entire group of these verticillate-leaved Carboniferous plants     in   is
a  state of hopeless confusion, from which    I   fear we shall be long in escaping,
Bince knowledge of the internal structure alone will enable us to determine the
types of stem to which they severally belong.       At present we are only familiar
with those of Calamites, Asterophyllites, and Sphenophyllum, and cannot even
identify the leaves of the first two of these genera when detached from such
parent stems as retain their internal structures.

 Pothosites during the Carboniferous age. It has followed the genus
 Palmacites, now proved to be a Fern, and no other known trace of any
 Angiosperm remains associated with the Palaeozoic rocks.
     I have already referred briefly to one more difficulty that interferes
 with all attempts to demonstrate in detail the evolution of the vegetable
 kingdom :   I allude to the numerous objects that have been named
 and classified as Algae : Of the Algoid character of some, possibly of
 many, of these forms there can be no doubt, but unfortunately the un-
 questionable examples are the more recent ones, which have little or
no bearing upon the Darwinian problem.          That some form of marine
vegetation must have existed prior to the advent of the Phytophagous
 molluscs and other animals whose remains abound in the Cambrian
rocks, is too obvious to require further proof than that which is supplied
by the existence of such animals. Hence when we find in these Palaeozoic
rocks objects that look like Fucoids, there is an a priori probability in
favour of their being so.     But the detailed construction of a demon-
stration like that just referred to demands more than this. In assign-
ing to each object its actual place in the ontological history we must
have a fair approximation to certainty as to the organisation and
Taxonomic position of such objects.       But this is exactly what we fail
to obtain in the case of these so-called Palaeozoic Fucoids.            Dr.
Nathorst has recently advanced strong evidence supporting his con-
clusion that many of these objects are merely inorganic casts of the
tracks of various animals that have crawled over the plastic sea-bed.
On the other hand, many have already been identified as imperfectly
preserved branches of plants of comparatively high organisation.
Hence we must regard with extreme caution, all attempts to press
these dubious fragments into the service of evolution.       But the temp-
tation for the evolutionist to do so is a strong one, since the doctrine
demands the prevalence, during primaeval times, of such lower forms
of plant life.
    At present we have one fact of the needed kind which seems to be
correctly interpreted, viz. that a true Fungus of a low order existed
during the middle period of the Carboniferous age. The Perono-
sporites aniiquius, from the lower coal-measures of Halifax, seems to
be an indisputable Fungus.
    The general conclusions at which our present knowledge justifies
our arrival seem to be these: — The Palaeozoic rocks have hitherto
furnished no traces of plants of a higher organisation than that of the
Gymnosperms, and even these latter are not of the most developed
types ; the vast mass of the coaeval vegetation is Cryptogamic.
The advent of true Phanerogams is at present only proved to have
taken place during the Oolitic period.        So far, these general pheno-
mena are such as the evolutionist would demand.          But, receding into
the remoter past, we obtain no further information.         These Gymno-
sperms existed not only during the Carboniferous period, but were as
highly organised during the Devonian age as when the coal-beds were
accumulated. Here we again stop.           We may ask, what were the

232          Professor Williamson    on Palceozoic  Vegetation.     [Feb. 16,
ancestors of these ancient Dadoxylons, and the Cycadean plants that
grew by their side, along with Ferns, Lepidodendra, Calamites, and
other Palaeozoic forms of vegetation ? The scanty fragments obtained
from the Silurian rocks give us no trustworthy answer to this ques-
tion — scarcely an ignis fatuus glimmers before our eyes.
    It is further obvious that the numerous plants of uncertain affinities,
some of which have formed the special subjects of this lecture, must
have played an important part in the Ontogeny of the Palaeozoic flora.
Though as      I  have shown, we already know much of the internal
organisation of these plants, we cannot at present assign to them their
true botanical positions.      How much less can we assign that position
to plants of which we only know obscure external forms, which rarely
can be implicitly relied upon, apart from organisation.          Yet a philo-
sophic constructor of a genealogical tree of the vegetable kingdom
cannot ignore all these objects.      The time has not yet arrived for the
appointment     of a botanical King-at-arms   and constructor of pedigrees.
    Whilst    so   many problems    connected    with the Palaeozoic flora
remain unsolved, one fact may be regarded as established indisputably.
The forest scenery of the Carboniferous and Devonian ages must have
been monotonous and gloomy.         The woodland expanse may have dis-
played many       varied  and  graceful forms. The uplifted stems and
feathery foliage of the Calamitean plants may have been projected
against the rounded outlines and drooping branches of the giant
Lepidodendra.       The lowland forests may have been bounded by groups
of pine-like Dadoxylons flourishing upon the higher and drier hills ;
but hill and dale would equally lack the gorgeous colouring supplied
by the floral world.       Viewed from a distance, the scene may have
resembled a tropical landscape of the present time, seen under similar
conditions.     Though the traveller, penetrating the shady recesses of
a tropical forest, occasionally comes upon some small oasis gay with
flowers, such displays are too few and too isolated to relieve the
monotonous green of the outspread landscape.           The tropics have no
lines of fragrant hawthorns, whose masses of snowy blossom give light
and beauty to the scene.        Summer there weaves no carpet clothing
meadow and pasture with yellow buttercups and " wee crimson tipped"
flowers. Autumn makes no upland slopes reflect back the golden hues
of the furze, shining in richest yet most harmonious contrast with the
heather's purple bloom.        Such widespread glories, absent from the
equatorial zone, now belong to our own more favoured climes. In
Palaeozoic times, they were lacking from every portion of the primaeval
world.

                  WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                       Friday, February 23, 1883.
   Sir Frederick Pollock, Bart. M.A. Vice-President,        in the Chair.
                  Walter Herries Pollock,       Esq. M.A.
                            Sir Francis Drake.
The speaker, in a brief biographical sketch, included a defence and
eulogium of Sir Francis Drake, based upon authentic evidence, manu-
script and printed, from which many extracts were given. Mr. Pollock
confuted the erroneous opinion that Drake was of mean parentage in
the modern sense, a notion due, as Dr. Drake has shown, to Camden's
                          "                                         "
Latin word " mediocris being then rightly translated " mean — i. e.
middling.     Drake was proved to be not a mere freebooter, but a man
who loved his country, and who hated Spain with the Protestant hatred
of the time, as well as for his own private wrongs. His first voyage
was with Hawkins, in 1568, when he shared in the defeat in the Bay
of Mexico. Of his great voyage, known as " the World Encompassed,'
                                                                            '
begun in November, 1577, many interesting details were given.          The
conspiracy   and punishment    of Thomas    Doughty,  one  of  the captains,
was dwelt on at some length on account of its most important relation
to Drake's moral character, and because it has served as a convenient
handle for those who are disposed to dismiss Drake and his compeers
with the words " Pirates all." The evidence, when considered on all
sides, led to the inevitable conclusion that the execution was an act of
stern but necessary justice.    Doughty confessed his crime, and imme-
diately before his death took the sacrament with Drake and his other
judges. Among many interesting facts respecting Drake, Mr. Pollock
referred to his great engineering skill in supplying Plymouth with
 an abundance of fresh water by a channel locally called
                                                               " The Leat,"
 brought from the confines of Dartmoor, a distance of twenty-four
 miles. This was an incalculable benefit to the town and to the fleet.

 Remarks were made on Drake's " singeing the King of Spain's beard
 at Cadiz, and on the defeat and dispersion of the Spanish Armada.
 Mr. Pollock quoted as a specimen of Drake's character, as expressed
 by his style in writing his answer to the false reports as to the
 Armada, set about by the Spaniards.         " They were not ashamed to
 publish in sundry languages in print great victories in words, which
 they pretended to have obtained against this realm, and spread the
 same in a most false sort over all parts of France, Italy, and elsewhere ;

 nations how their navy, which they termed invincible, consisting of

Her Majesty's own ships of war and a few of our merchants, by the
wise, valiant, and advantageous conduct of the Lord Charles Howard,
High Admiral of England, beaten and shuffled together, even from
the Lizard in Cornwall, first to Portland, where they shamefully left
Don Pedro de Valdez with his mighty ship ; from Portland to Calais,
where they lost Hugh de Moncado with the galleys of which he was
captain ; and from Calais, driven with squibs from their anchors, were
cliased out of the sight of England, some about Scotland and Ireland,
where for the sympathy of their religion, hoping to find succour and
assistance, a great part of them were crushed against the rocks, and
those other that landed, being very many in number, were, notwith-
standing, broken, slain, and taken ; and so sent from village to village
coupled in halters, to be shipped into England, where Her Majesty, of
her princely and invincible disposition, disdaining to put them to death,
and scorning either to retain or entertain them, they were all sent
back again to their countries, to witness and recount the achievement
of their invincible and dreadful navy. Of which the number of soldiers,
the fearful burthen of their ships, the commanders' names of every
squadron, with all other magazines of provisions, were put in print as
an army and navy irresistible and disdaining prevention, with all which
their great terrible ostentation they did not in all their sailing round
about England so much as sink or take one ship, bark, pinnace, or
 cockboat of ours, or even burn so much as one sheepcote on this land."
 Drake sailed, with Sir John Hawkins, on a last and disastrous voyage
 to South America, which closed the careers of both the Commanders.
 Hawkins died on Nov. 12, 1595 ; and Drake died of a dysentery — it
 is said also of a broken heart — on Jan. 28, 1596.        The discourse
 concluded with an eloquent summary of the fine qualities of our great
 naval hero.

    William Bowman, Esq. LL.D. F.E.S. Honorary Secretary                           and
                              Vice-President,       in the Chair.

                         Meters        for Power    and Electricity.
The subject of this evening's discourse: — "Meters for Power and
Electricity," is unfortunately, from a lecturer's point of view, one of
extreme difficulty ; for it is impossible to fully describe any single
instrument of the class without diving into technical and mathematical
niceties which this audience might well consider more scientific than
entertaining.       If then, in my endeavour to explain these instruments
and the purposes which they are intended to fulfil, in language as
simple and as untechnical as possible,                  I
                                                   am not as successful as you
have  a  right  to expect,     mustI  ask  you    to  lay some of the blame on
my subject and      not  all on  myself.
    I  shall at once explain what               I
                                           mean by the term " meter," and                  I
shall take the flow of water in a trough as an illustration of my
meaning.       If we hang in a trough a weighted board, then, when the
water   flows  past      the board will be pushed back when the current
                        it,                                         :
of water       strong, the board will be pushed back
              is                                                long way when
                                                                       a           :
the current         less
                   is         will not be pushed so far: when the water
                              it
runs the other way the board will be pushed the other way. So by
observing the position of the board, we can tell how strong the current
of water      isat any time.      Now suppose we wish to know, not how
strong the current of water           at this time or at that, but how much
                                          is
water altogether has passed through the trough during any time, as
for instance, one hour. Then,             we have no better instrument than
                                               if
the weighted      board,     will
                              it   be  necessary    to observe its position con-
tinuously, to keep     an  exact  record  of  the  corresponding rates at which
the water     ispassing, every minute, or better every second, and to add
up all the values obtained.         This would, of course, be very trouble-a
some process. There           another kind of instrument which may be used
                               is
 to measure the flow of the water: — paddle-wheel or screw.
                                                    a                      When
the water     isflowing rapidly    the  wheel   will  turn rapidly, when slowly,
the wheel will turn slowly, and when the water flows the other way,
the wheel will turn the other way, so that,              we observe how fast the
                                                            if
wheel    isturning we can tell how fast the water              flowing.
                                                                    is       now,  If
we wish     to know   how    much   water  altogether    has passed through the
 trough, the number of turns of the wheel, which may be shown by
a  counter, will at once tell us. There are therefore, in the case of
 water, two kinds of instruments, one which measures at                 time, and
                                                                               a

which shows by the position of a magnet how strong a current of
electricity is at a time, and the other, which shows how much
electricity has passed during any time. Of the first, which are well
understood,     Ishall say nothing ; the second, the new electric meters
and the corresponding meters for power, are what             I
                                                            have to speak of
to-night.
      It is hardly necessary for me to mention the object of making
electric meters.     Every one who has had to pay his gas bill once a
quarter probably quite appreciates what the electric meters are going
to do, and why they are at the present time attracting so much
attention. So soon as you have electricity laid on in your houses, as
gas and water is laid on now, so soon will a meter of some sort be
necessary in order that the companies which supply the electricity
may be able to make out their quarterly bills, and refer complaining
customers to the faithful indications of their extravagance in the
mysterious cupboard in which the meter is placed.
      The urgent necessity for a good meter has called such a host of
inventors into the field, that a complete account of their labours is
more than any one could hope to give in an hour. Since                I
                                                                    am one of
this host, I  hardly like to pick out    those  inventions  which         I
                                                                     consider
of value.   I  cannot describe all,      I
                                        cannot act as a judge and say these
only are worthy of your attention, and          I do not think        I
                                                                   should be
acting fairly if    I  were to describe my own instruments only and
                                                       I
ignore those of every one else. The only way see out of the difficulty
 is to speak more particularly about my own work in this direction,
and to speak generally on the work of others.
      I must now ask you to give your attention for a few minutes to a
 little abstract geometry.    We may represent any changing quantity,
                                         as for instance the strength of an
                Fig. 1.                  electrical current, by a crooked
                                         line.   For this purpose we must
                                   s !   draw a straight line to represent
             —                           time, and make the distance of

                                         above the straight line a measure

                                   «§l   *^e corresponding time.     The size
                                         of the figure will then measure
                                         the quantity of electricity that
 has passed, for the stronger the current               the taller the figure
                                                       is,
 will be, and the longer       lasts the longer the figure will be, either
                                  it
 cause makes both the quantity of electricity and the size of the
 figure greater and in the same proportion       : so the one    is
                                                                  ameasure of
 the other.    Now      it not an easy thing to measure the size of
                             is                                                      a

figure, the distance round it tells nothing ; there is, however, a geo-
 metrical method by which its size may be found. Draw another line,
 with a great steepness where the figure is tall, and with a less
 steepness where the height is less, and with no steepness or horizontal
 where the figure has no height.        If  this is done accurately, the height
 to which the new line reaches will measure the size of the figure
first drawn : for the taller the figure is, the steeper the hill will be :
 the longer the figure, the longer the hill : either cause makes both the
 size of the figure and the height of the hill greater, and in the same
proportion : so the one is a measure of the other : and so, moreover,
 is the height of the hill, which can be measured by a scale, a measure
 of the quantity of electricity that has passed.
     The first instrument that       I made, which     I  have called a " cart
                                                                               "
 integrator, is a machine which, if the lower figure is traced out, will
 describe the upper.       I will trace a circle, the instrument follows the
curious bracket-shaped line that          I   have already made sufficiently
black to be seen at a distance, the height of the new
 line measures the size of the circle, the instrument                Fig. 2.
has squared the circle.        This machine is a thing of
mainly theoretical interest, my only object in show-
ing it is to explain the means by which                I   have
developed    a  practical    and  automatic     instrument     of
         I
which shall speak presently. The guiding principle
in the cart integrator is a little three-wheeled cart,
 whose front wheel is controlled by the machine. This,
of course, is invisible at a distance, and therefore            I
have here a large front wheel alone.           On moving this
along the table, any twisting of its direction in-
 stantly causes it to deviate from its straight path ;
now suppose     I  do not let it deviate, but compel it to
go straight,   then   at once a great strain is put upon the table which
is urged the other way.          If the table can move it will instantly do
so.    A table on rollers is inconvenient as an instrument, let us there-
fore roll it round into a roller,
then on moving the wheel along
it the roller will turn and the
amount by which it turns will
correspond to the height of the
second figure drawn by the cart
integrator.       If, therefore, the
wheel is inclined by a magnet
under the influence of an electric
current, or by any other cause,
the whole amount of which we
wish to know, then the number
of turns of the roller will tell us this amount ; or to go back to our
water analogy, if we had the weighted board to show current strength,
and had not the paddle-wheel to show total quantity, we might use the

 238                          Mr. C. Vernon Boys                [March 2,
 board to incline a disc in contact with a roller, and then drag the
 roller steadily along by clockwork.       The number of turns of the
 roller would give the quantity of water. Instruments that will thus
 add up continuously indications at a time, and so find amounts during
 a time, are called integrators.
      The most important application that     I have made at present of
                                     I
 the integrator described, is what have called an engine-power meter.
 The instrument is on the table, but as it is far too small to be seen
 at a distance,  I have arranged a large model to illustrate its action.
                     The object of this machine is to measure how much
                     work an engine has done during any time, and
                     show the result on a dial, so that a workman may
                     read it off at once without having to make any
                     calculations.
                                 I
                         Before can explain how work is measured, per-
                     haps   I  had better say a few words about the
                     meaning of the word " work." Work is done when
                     pressure overcomes resistance, producing motion.
                     Neither motion nor pressure alone is work.       The
                     two factors, pressure and motion, must occur to-
                     gether. The work done is found by multiplying
                     the pressure by the distance moved.    In an engine,
steam pushes the piston first one way then the other, overcomes resist-
ance, and does work. To find this, we must multiply the pressure by
the motion at every instant and add all the products together.       This
is what the engine-power meter does, and it shows the continuously
growing result on a dial.          When the piston moves it drags the
cylinder along, where the steam presses the wheel is inclined. Neither
action alone causes the cylinder to turn, but when they occur together
the cylinder turns, and the number of turns registered on a dial shows
with mathematical accuracy how much work has been done.
     In the steam-engine work is done in an alternating manner, and
it so happens that this alternating action exactly suits the integrator.
 Suppose, however, that the action whatever it may be, which we wish
 to estimate is of a continuous kind, such for instance as the continuous
passage of an electric current.       Then, if by means of any device,
we can suitably incline the wheel, so long as we keep pushing the
cylinder along, so long will its rotation measure and indicate the
result ; but there must come a time when the end of the cylinder is
reached.    If then we drag it back again, instead of going on adding
up, it will begin to take off from the result, and the hands on the dial
will go backwards, which is clearly wrong. So long as the current
continues so long must the hands on the dial turn in one direction.
This effect is obtained in the instrument now on the table, the electric
energy meter, in this way. Clockwork causes the cylinder to travel
backwards and forwards by means of what is called a mangle motion,
but instead of moving always in contact with one wheel, the cylinder
goes forward in contact with one and back in contact with another

 on its opposite side.   In this instrument, the inclination of the wheels
 is effected by an arrangement of coils of wire, the main current passing
 through two fixed concentric solenoids, and a shunt current through
 a great length of fine wire on a movable solenoid, hanging in the
 space between the others.         The movable portion has an equal
 number of turns in opposite directions, and is therefore unaffected by-
 magnets held near it. The effect of this arrangement is that the
 energy of the current, that is, the quantity multiplied by the force
 driving it, or the electrical equivalent of mechanical power, is
 measured by the slope of the wheels, and the amount of work done
  by the current during any time, by the number of turns of the cylinder,
 which is registered on        a dial.   Professors Ayrton and Perry have
  devised an instrument which is intended to show the same thing.
  They make use of a clock, and cause it to go too fast or too slow by
  the action of the main on the shunt current, the amount of wrong-
  ness of the clock, and not the time shown, is said to measure the work
  done by the current.       This method of measuring the electricity by
  the work it has done, is one which has been proposed to enable the
  electrical companies to make out their bills.
      The other method is to measure the amount of electricity that has
  passed without regard to the work done.           There are three lines on
  which inventors have worked for this purpose. The first, which has
 been used in every laboratory ever since electricity has been under-
 stood, is the chemical method.         When electricity passes through a
 salt solution, it carries metal with        it,
                                             and deposits     on the plate by
                                                                       it
 which the electricity leaves the liquid. The amount of metal deposited
is   a measure of the quantity of electricity.         Mr. Sprague and Mr.
 Edison    have  adopted    this method    ;but  as      impossible to allow
                                                          it      is
 the whole of     astrong current to pass through       liquid, the current
                                                                  a                        is
 divided, a   small proportion only         allowed to pass through.
                                           is                             Pro-
 vided that the proportion does not vary, and that the metal never has
 any motions on its own account, the increase in the weight of one of
 the metal plates measures the quantity of electricity.
      The next method depends on the use of some sort of integrating
 machine, and this being the most obvious method, has been attempted
by large number of inventors. Any machine of this kind
     a                                                                 sure to        is
go,   and is  sure  to  indicate  something,    which will  be more   nearly               a
measure of the electricity, as the skill of the inventor         greater.   is
      Meters for electricity of the third class are dynamical in their
action, and   I believe that what   I  have called the vibrating meter was
the first of its class.    It well known that current passing round
                              is                              a
iron makes     it  magnetic. The force which such           magnet exerts
                                                                       a                   is
greater when the current      is greater, but       not simply proportional
                                                    it   is                                 ;
if  the current   istwice or three times as strong, the force      four times    is
or nine times as great, or generally, the force           proportional to the
                                                                  is
square of the current.       Again, when      body vibrates under the influ-

gravity, four times as much force       isnecessary to make     vibrate twice

as fast, and nine times to make it vibrate three times as fast; or
generally, the square of the number measures the force.              I will illus-
trate this by a model. Here are two sticks nicely balanced on points,
and drawn into a middle position by pieces of tape to which weights
may be hung.      They are identical in every respect.         I  will now hang
a 1 lb. weight to each tape, and let the pieces of wood swing.              They
keep time together absolutely.       I   will now put 2 lbs. on one tape. It
is clear that the corresponding stick is going faster, but certainly not
twice as fast.  I  will now hang on 4 lbs. One stick is going at exactly
twice the pace of the other. To make one go three times as fast,
it is obviously useless to put on 3 lbs., for it takes four to make it go
twice as fast.  I  will hang on 9 lbs. One now goes exactly three times
as fast as the other.     I will now put 4 lbs. on the first, and leave the
9  lbs. on the second   ; the first goes twice while the second goes three
                                                  times.  If instead of a weight
                                                  we use electro - magnetic
                                                  force to control the vibra-

                                                  the current produces four
                                                  times the force, four times
                                                  the force produces twice the
                                                  rate : three times the cur-
                                                  rent produces nine times the
                                                  force, nine times the force
                                                  produces three times the
                                                  rate, and so on : or the rate
                                                  is directly proportional to
                                                  the current strength. There
                                                  is on the table a working
                                                  meter made on this principle.
                                                  I  allow the current that
                                                  passes through to pass also
 through a galvanometer of special construction, so that you can tell
 by the position of a spot of light on a scale the strength of the current.
At the present time there is no current ; the light is on the zero of
 the scale, the meter is at rest.      I now allow a current to pass from a
 battery of the new Faure-Sellon-Volckmar cells which the Storage
 Company have kindly lent me for this occasion.                The light moves
 through   one division   on the  scale,  and  the  meter  has   started.   I  will
 ask you to observe its rate of vibration.             I  will now double the
 current ; this is indicated by the light moving to the end of the
 second division on the scale : the meter vibrates twice as fast.             Now
 the current is three times as strong, now four times, and so on.              You
 will observe that the position of the spot of light and the rate of
 vibration always correspond. Every vibration of the meter corre-
 sponds to a definite quantity of electricity, and causes a hand on a
 dial to move on one step. By looking at the dial, we can see how
 many vibrations there have been, and therefore how much electricity

1883.]               on Meters  for Power      and Electricity.               241
has passed.      Just as the vibrating sticks in the model in time come
to rest, so the vibrating part of the meter would in time do the same,
if it were not kept going by an impulse automatically given to it
when required.        Also, just as the vibrating sticks can be timed to
one another by sliding weights along them, so the vibrating electric
meters can be regulated to one another so that all shall indicate the
same value for the same current, by changing the position or weight
of the bobs attached to the vibrating arm.
     The other meter of this class, Dr. Hopkinson's, depends on the fact
that centrifugal force is proportional to the square of the angular
velocity.    He therefore allows a little motor to drive a shaft faster
and faster, until centrifugal force overcomes electro-magnetic attrac-
tion, when the action of the motor ceases. The number of turns of
the motor is a measure of the quantity of electricity that has passed.
     I will now pass on to the measurement of power transmitted by
belting.    The transmission of power by a strap is familiar to every
one  in  a treadle   sewing-machine or an ordinary lathe. The driving
force depends on the difference in the tightness of the two sides of the
belt, and the power transmitted is equal to this difference multiplied
by the speed ; a power-meter must, therefore, solve this problem — it
must subtract the tightness of one side from the tightness of the other
side, multiply the difference by the speed at every instant, and add all
the products together, continuously representing the growing amount
on a dial.    I  shall now show for the first time an instrument that            I
have devised, that will do all this in the simplest possible manner.             I
have here two wheels connected by a driving band of indiarubber,
round which     I have tied every few inches a piece of white silk ribbon.
I  shall turn one a little way, and hold the other. The driving force
is indicated by a difference of stretching, the pieces of silk are much
further apart on the tight side than they are on the loose.                I shall
                                      Fig.  6.
now turn the handle, and cause the wheels to revolve ; the motion of
the band is visible to all. The indiarubber is travelling faster on the
tight side than on the loose side, nearly twice as fast ; this must be so,
for as there is less material on the tight side than on the loose, there
would be a gradual accumulation of the indiarubber round the driven
pulley, if they travelled at the same speed ; since there is no accumu-
lation, the tight side must travel the fastest.           Now it may be shown
mathematically     that  the  difference   in  the  speeds   is proportional both
to the actual speed and to the driving        strain ; it is  therefore a measure

of the power or work being transmitted, and the difference in the
distance travelled is a measure of the work done.                     I
                                                                   have here a
working machine which shows directly on a dial the amount of work
done ; this     I  will show in action directly. Instead of indiarubber,
elastic  steel  is used.    Since the driving pulley has the velocity of the
tight side, and the driven of the loose side of the belt, the difference in
the number of their turns, if they are of equal size, will measure the
work. This difference        Imeasure by differential gearing which actuates
a hand on a dial.        I  may turn the handle as fast as                I
                                                                    please ; the
index does not move, for no work is being done.                   I

wheel, and produce a great driving strain ; again the index remains at
rest, for no work is being done.             I
                                           now turn the handle quickly, and
lightly   touch   the  driven   wheel  with my finger. The resistance, small

or the number of turns, measures the work done.               That this     so     is   I
will show by an experiment.            I will wind up in front of        scale a

to this invention which      I   cannot now describe.
     There    is one other class of instruments which      I have developed of
which time will let me say very little. The object of this class of
instruments         to divide the speed with which two registrations are
                    is
being effected, and continuously record the quotient. In the instru-
ment on the table two iron cones are caused to rotate in time with the
registrations;       amagnetized steel reel hangs on below. This reel
turns about, and runs up or down the cones until                finds
                                                               it       place at

which    it can roll at ease.     Its position at once indicates the ratio of
the speeds which will be efficiency, horse-power per hour, or one thing
in terms of another. Just as the integrators are derived from the
steering of an ordinary bicycle, so this instrument           derived from the

                The Ultra-Violet Spectra of        the Elements.
It seems probable that the range of our vision as regards colour is
closely connected with the intensity of that part of the solar radiation
 which reaches us on the earth, for Langley's observations on the in-
tensity of the sun's rays in different parts of the spectrum bring out
the fact that the region of greatest intensity falls nearly in the middle
of the visible spectrum, and includes those colours to which our eyes
are most sensitive.    The ultra-violet rays, those which lie beyond the
violet on the more refrangible side, are not, however, absolutely
invisible, for, by carefully excluding light of lower refrangibility,
Herschel found that he could see some distance beyond the Fraun-
hofer line H, into what he called the lavender-grey ; and Helmholtz
has succeeded in seeing nearly all the strong lines in the solar spec-
trum almost or quite up to its limit. Still these rays may fairly be
said to be beyond ordinary vision ; and from their power of chemical
                                                      "
action they used to be distinguished as " actinic       rays.   We know
now that they have no monopoly of chemical activity, and we recognise
no difference between luminous and actinic rays, the visible and the
ultra-violet, except in their oscillation frequencies; that        in the
                                                                       is,
rate at which the successive pulsations of the ray succeed one another,
and in the colour and refrangibility which are directly dependent on
that rate. That the ultra-violet part of the solar spectrum extended
at least as far above the line H as      F    below
                                              is           it,
                                                        has been known
since the time of Wollaston, who observed its effect in blackening
silver salts; but it   is  only about twenty years since Stokes made
known to us the great length and intensity of the ultra-violet
spectrum of the electric spark. Stokes used his own invention,                  a
fluorescent screen, for observing the rays; and at the very time
when Stokes published his discovery, W. A. Miller published photo-
graphs of the spectra of sparks taken between various metallic
electrodes.   Both these methods, that of fluorescent screens and that
of photography, have been used by Professor Dewar and me in our
researches.    For the method of fluorescence we have used modifica-
                                                                   a
tion of Soret's eye-piece, substituting for the uranium glass-plate             a
wedge-shaped     vessel full of    asolution of aesculine, placed with
its edge horizontal so that we look down on the fluorescent liquid.
The wedge form of the vessel has the advantage of refracting out of
the line of vision all the rays except those which produce fluorescence,

a   matter of no small importance when faint light is to be observed
(see     Fig.   1).
     Now, although the intensity of the sun's rays falls away rapidly
 beyond the Fraunhofer line H, and comes to nothing about as far
 above H as       F below
                      is       it,   far otherwise with the radiation of

which exhibit the greatest variety in their chemical relations, and
produce combinations of the greatest number of types, and the most
complicated spectra, are also those which produce the most highly-
coloured compounds.          In marked contrast to the thick-set ranks of
iron, manganese, and chromium lines, are the few scattered rays
exhibited by those metals which form their combinations each chiefly
on a single type, such as aluminium, and the alkali and alkaline earth
metals.     These spectra are probably even simpler than at first sight
they   seem    to be. That of lithium is the simplest (Plate II. fig. 3) :
a series of single lines succeeding one another at decreasing intervals,
and with diminishing intensity, closely resembling in these respects
the spectrum of hydrogen.            In the case of hydrogen, we know that
the oscillation frequencies of some of its rays are related in a simple
harmonic ratio. We are not able to say that the relation is so simple
in the case of lithium ; but still the whole series are probably over-
tones of a fundamental vibration, not so simply related as the harmo-
nics of a uniform stretched string, but, like the overtones of a string
which is not of uniform thickness, or is loaded at different points,
similarly related in origin, though not exact harmonics. That the
different rays are in many cases so related as overtones of a fundamental
vibration appears more plainly, perhaps, when not single lines but
groups of two, three, or four lines recur. Potassium shows a series of
pairs to which the well-known violet pair, and perhaps that in the red
also, belong.       Calcium, magnesium, and zinc, each show a series of
triplets, which are alternately sharply defined and diffuse (see photo-
graphs 4 and 5 and Plate II. figs. 5 and           6).     In other cases the same
characters may be traced, though less readily, because there               is  some-
times more than one such         series  of lines  or  groups.    The alkali metals
have each one such series in the visible spectrum, and another in the
ultra-violet.     It may happen in other cases that two or more such
series overlap, and      it  may then be very difficult to distinguish and
separate them.
     In some cases elements show at lower temperature far more
                                             a                         a
 complicated spectrum than they do at higher temperatures further
removed from their points of liquefaction.                 This has been observed
 by  Roscoe   and   Schuster   in the   case  of the  alkali   metals potassium and
 sodium, which give      at  temperatures only     a    little  above their boiling-
 points absorption spectra which consist of closely-set fine lines, pro-
 ducing an appearance of shaded bands quite unlike their emission
 spectra at higher temperatures.           In some few cases we have observed
          "          "
                       or   " Venetian blind "
 similar     fluted                                  spectra, as they have been
 called, in the ultra-violet, as,         for   example, one produced by tin;
 but in general the temperature of the arc, which we have chiefly
 used in our observations          on metals,     is   high enough to carry the
 metals beyond the stage in which their vibrations are constrained by
 the state approaching to liquefaction.
     But though metals do not often show spectra of this class at
 the high temperature of the arc,       it   is   otherwise with metalloids and

248                    Professor George D. Liming                 [March  9,
with compounds.      Nitrogen gives in the arc as well as in the spark
a channelled spectrum of singular beauty, extending with but short
breaks almost to the extremity of the ultra-violet region which we have
examined. (See photograph 7.) These multitudinous lines of nitrogen
constantly present in the arc taken in air, help to make the problem
of unravelling the spectrum of the arc, and assigning each line to its
proper source, far more difficult than it might at first sight be supposed.
Carbon, which in the arc frequently gives a channelled spectrum in
the visible region, gives only a limited number of lines in the ultra-
violet; but cyanogen gives one set of flutings near the line L, and
another near N, which are so brilliant in the arc as to obscure the
metallic lines in their neighbourhood (photograph 4). To the same
class we may refer the spectrum of water, of which the most brilliant
portion is given in photograph 6.
     The series of lines produced by the same element, which have    I
spoken of as overtones of a fundamental vibration, have been likened
to these channellings, but in reality they are very different.       In the
series, which  I have supposed to have a sort of harmonic relation, the
successive lines or groups of lines invariably become nearer to one
another as the wave-lengths become shorter, and at the same time
they diminish in strength and sharpness ; whereas in the channelled
spectra the strongest lines are at the end where they are most closely
set, and they generally diminish in strength as they get further apart.
Also increase of distance between the lines of channelled spectra is
sometimes towards the less, sometimes towards the more, refrangible
end of the spectrum.
     I have before observed that a great part of the ultra-violet spectra
of the elements which we have observed lies entirely beyond the limit
of the solar spectrum ; that limit is the line U at wave-length 2947.
But though this is the limit of the solar radiation which reaches us
on the earth, we can hardly suppose that the sun itself, or the photo-
sphere, emits no radiation of shorter wave-length.          We know that
there is plenty of iron and magnesium in the sun, and the strongest
radiations at high temperatures of these elements are of shorter
wave-length than TJ. Moreover, the continuous spectra of incan-
descent solids in many cases extend far beyond U.          The continuous
spectrum of burning magnesium reaches quite up to the wave-length
2380, that of the flame of carbon disulphide mixed with hydrogen
and fed with oxygen reaches even further, that of lime heated with
an oxyhydrogen blowpipe, though feeble beyond the limit of the
solar spectrum, extends up to wave-length 2680.              The tempera-
ture of the sun cannot be less than that of any of these sources
of heat, so that we are forced to suppose that the radiation, more
refrangible than U, which leaves the body of the sun, is stopped
somewhere either in our atmosphere, or in planetary space, or in
the atmosphere of the sun himself.         Now Cornu has found that
when the thickness of our atmosphere traversed by the sun's rays
is diminished as much as possible by taking the sun at its greatest

 altitude, and making the observation from an elevated station (the
 Riffelberg), the solar spectrum only reaches to wave-length 2932,
that is, only a very trifle beyond U.               We must therefore suppose that
the absorbent substance, whatever it be, is not in our atmosphere.
 The same reason will lead us to reject the notion that the absorption
can be due to matter in planetary space, for it is not easy to suppose
that the gases which pervade that space in extreme tenuity can differ
much from those in our atmosphere, because the earth in its annual

course    must pick them up whatever they are, and they must then
diffuse into our atmosphere, and we must in time have them in a more
condensed state in our atmosphere than in planetary space.                            The
absorbent is therefore probably neither in our atmosphere nor in
planetary space, and we must look for it in the solar atmosphere.
 When we notice how much of the radiation of our terrestrial elements
 is of shorter wave-length than the solar line U, we might almost fancy
 that the blotting out of the sun's light beyond that point is simply
 due to an increase in the number and breadth of the Fraunhofer lines.
 Indeed we have frequently observed the strong magnesium line, wave-
 length 2852, expanded so that the dark absorption band in its middle
 reached quite up to U on one side (see photograph No. 1) and equally
 far on the other side, and this, together with such expansion of the
 strong iron lines beyond as we have occasionally observed, would go a
 long way towards completely hiding all light above U. But such expan-
 sions of iron and magnesium lines, high in the scale of refrangibility,
 do not occur without a considerable expansion of the lines of the same
 elements lower in the scale, expansions far exceeding what we actually
 observe in the Fraunhofer lines. Moreover the Fraunhofer lines, though

250                    Professor George D. Liveing              [March   9,
dark by comparison with the brightness of the photosphere, are them-
selves luminous, even bright, when there is no other still brighter light
wherewith to contrast them, so that if there were no other absorbent
action the solar spectrum would be continued by the emitted rays of
the metallic vapours which produce these lines.        Probably then the
absorbent is something at a lower temperature, higher in the solar
atmosphere.     A change of temperature may, and in some cases certainly
does imply such a change of state that there may be a corresponding
change in the particular vibrations which can be most easily taken up.
    The metals in the liquid and solid states are so very opaque that
we should hardly be able to discern their absorption spectra ; never-
theless in very thin films they are translucent in different degrees.
Gold leaf, as is well-known, transmits a green light, and we have
found that a thin film of gold chemically deposited on a plate of quartz
is fairly transparent for all the ultra-violet rays, so that its selective
absorption is almost wholly of the less refrangible rays. Silver de-
posited in a similar way produces a very different effect. It is almost
wholly opaque, except for one rather narrow band which begins a little
below the solar line P and extends with diminishing transparency to
about S. Cornu has before noticed this property of silver, but placed
the transparent band at wave-length 270 instead of 330.         Dr. W. A.
Miller had observed that the light reflected by gold is equally dis-
tributed all through the ultra-violet, but feebler than that reflected
by other metals ; while that reflected by silver is characterised by
giving a sudden cessation of the photographic image for a certain
distance. These characters of the reflected rays he attributed to
absorption by the metal.
     When we examine the absorption produced by the haloid elements,
we find that chlorine absorbs a wide band in the ultra-violet with its
centre near the solar line P, extending, when the chlorine is in small
quantity, from N to T, increasing in width on both sides when the
quantity of chlorine is increased, but still leaving the rays above wave-
length 2550 unabsorbed.
    Bromine vapour shows an absorption band which begins in the
visible spectrum, and extends, when the bromine is in small quantity,
up to L, and when the bromine is in greater quantity up to P. From
that point, up to about wave-length 2500, the vapour is transparent,
but beyond it is again absorbent, the absorption increasing gradually
with the refrangibility of the rays.
    Iodine vapour, when thin, is transparent for ultra-violet rays, but
produces strong absorption in the violet region. With thicker vapour
this absorption extends nearly to H, but the vapour is still transparent
for rays more refrangible than H.
    Lecoq de Boisbaudran has observed that in the spectra of similar
elements we may trace a shifting of similar lines, or groups of lines,
towards the less refrangible side as the atomic weight is increased.
Thus the violet pair of lines given by potassium is represented by an
indigo pair in the case of rubidium, and a blue pair in the case of

1883.]          on the  Ultra-Violet Spectra of the Elements.              251
caesium  ;  and the indigo line of calcium is represented by a blue line
in the spectrum    of  strontium, and by a green line in the spectrum of
barium.
     We may observe something of the same kind in regard to the
haloid elements : the absorption band which in the case of the element
of lowest atomic weight, namely chlorine, is altogether ultra-violet, is
shifted towards the less refrangible side in the case of bromine, and
lies altogether in the visible region in the case of iodine, the element
of highest atomic weight.

     It is remarkable that bromine in the liquid state and iodine in
 solution show absorptions quite different from those of their vapours.
 A thin film of liquid bromine between two quartz plates is transparent
 for a band which ends just where the transparency of the vapour
 begins, while the film is opaque for rays both above and below this
 band.    Iodine dissolved in carbon disulphide is also transparent for a
 certain distance, but the band is shifted to a less refrangible region
 lying between G and H.
      Compound gases and vapours show, as might be expected, various
 absorptions of ultra-violet rays. The absorbent action of coal-gas
 begins at about the wave-length 2680, and above 2580 it is nearly
 complete. Sulphurous acid has an absorption band extending from
 about R (3179) to rays of wave-length 2630, with a weaker absorption
  extending some way beyond these limits on both sides.           Sulphuretted
  hydrogen produces a pretty complete obliteration of all rays above
  wave-length 2580. Vapour of carbon disulphide in very small quantity
  produces an absorption extending from P to T, shading away at each
  end.   With more vapour this band widens, and a second absorption
  band begins at about the wave-length 2580.            Chlorine peroxide gives

  M and S, while in the highest regions of the spectrum it seems to be
  quite transparent.
        I  mentioned at the outset the probable connection between the
   intensity of the solar radiation and the sensitiveness of our eyes to
  rays of different colours.         The consideration of ultra-violet absorption
  spectra leads to the mention of another fact connected with vision, or
  rather with the construction of the eyes of the higher animals. Soret
  has investigated, and recently Chardonnet has more fully examined,
  the limits of transparency of the crystalline, cornea, and vitreous
  humour of the eyes of various animals and man, and found them all
  more or less transparent for ultra-violet rays.                The limit of trans-
  parency      in   many   cases approaches,   but   never  exceeds, the limit of the
  solar spectrum.          Chardonnet places the limit of transparency of the
  crystalline of the human eye as low as M, which is not consistent
  with the observations of Herschel and Helmholtz before mentioned,
  but this inconsistency is probably due to alterations which had taken
  place after death in the eyes experimented on by Chardonnet.                    That
  the transparency of the materials of the eye does not extend beyond
  the solar line U, Chardonnet regards as a provision of nature to
  protect the retina from the extreme radiations of artificial lights ; but
  I  venture to offer a different explanation, which is, that the selection
  of the materials of the eye has been determined not by what they
  will absorb but by what they will transmit.                    If  the materials in
  question       were   in  any  great degree    opaque    to  the  ultra-violet  solar
  rays, these rays       must   be absorbed   and  must   either   be  used in  heating
  the absorbent or do work upon it in some form, perhaps alter it
  chemically, and so impair its efficiency as part of an optical instru-
  ment.       I   see, then, in the selection of these materials for our eyes
  an instance, one amongst many, of the marvellous adaptation of our

                            DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES.
       In  the photographic plate : —
       No. 1 shows rn expansion of the magnesium line at wave-length 2852, while
  it is also so strong y reversed as to produce a complete obliteration of all the lines
  above U within tne range of the photograph, while its bright wing reverses the
  iron lines near T.
       No. 2 shows the same line at b much less expanded but still self-reversing.
  The lines at a are also magnesium lines, wave-lengths 2795 and 2801.           Most of
  the lines between 6 and S are chromium lines.
       No. 3 shows iron lines reversed by putting iron wire into the arc.
       No. 4 shows calcium lines in recurring triplets ; also the cyanogen bands
  between K and M and at N.
       No. 5 shows three of the zinc triplets.
       No. 6 is the brightest part of the ultra violet spectrum of water.
       No. 7 shows part of the channelled spectrum of nitrogen in the ultra violet.
       The lithographic plate gives the position of the ultra violet lines of several
  metals to a soale of wave lengths.

1883.J        Professor Tyndall    on Thoughts on    Radiation.           253
                 WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                         Friday, March 16, 1883.
     William Bowman, Esq. LL.D. F.R.S. Honorary Secretary              and
                      Vice-President,    in the Chair.
              Professor Tyndall, D.C.L. F.R.S. M.B.L
            Thoughts on Radiation, TJieoretical and Practical.
Scientific discoveries are not distributed uniformly in time. They
appear rather in periodic groups.       Thus, in the two first years of this
century, among other gifts presented by men of science to the world,
we have the Voltaic pile; the principle of Interference, which is
the basis of the undulatory theory of light ; and the discovery by
William Herschel of the dark rays of the sun.
     Directly or indirectly, this latter discovery heralded a period of
active research on the subject of radiation.       Leslie's celebrated work
on the Nature of    Heat  was  published     in 1804, but he informs us, in
the preface, that the leading facts which gave rise to the publication
presented themselves in the spring of 1801.          An interesting but not
uncommon psychological experience is glanced at in this preface.
The inconvenience of what we call ecstacy, or exaltation, is that it is
usually attended by undesirable compensations.          Its action resembles
that of a tidal river, sometimes advancing and filling the shores of
life, but afterwards retreating and leaving unlovely banks behind.
Leslie, when he began his work, describes himself as " transported at
the prospect of a new world emerging to view."           But further on the
note changes, and before the preface ends he warns the reader that he
may expect variety of tone, and perhaps defect of unity in his disqui-
sition.   The execution of the work, he says, proceeded with extreme
tardiness ; and as the charm of novelty wore off, he began to look
upon his production with a coolness not usual in authors.
     The ebb of the tide, however, was but transient ; and to Leslie's
ardour, industry, and experimental skill, we are indebted for a large
body of knowledge in regard to the phenomena of radiation.             In the
prosecution  of his researches  he  had  to rely upon himself.    He  devised
his own apparatus, and applied it in his own way.               To produce
radiating surfaces, he employed metallic cubes, which to the present
hour are known as Leslie's cubes.        The different faces of these cubes
he coated with different substances, and filling the cubes with boiling

  254                           Professor Tyndall                [March 16,
  water, he determined the emissive powers of the substances thus
  heated.    These he found to differ greatly from each other.    Thus, the
 radiation from a coating of lampblack being called 100, that from the
  uncoated metallic surface of his cube was only 12.         He pointed out
 the reciprocity existing between radiation and absorption, proving
 that those substances which emit heat copiously absorb it greedily.
 His thermoscopic instrument was the well-known differential-ther-
 mometer invented by himself.         In experiment Leslie was very strong,
 but in theory he was not so strong.        His notions as to the nature of
 the agent whose phenomena he investigated with so much ability are
 confused and incorrect.        Indeed, he could hardly have formed any
 clear  notion  of the   physical meaning of radiation before the undula-
 tory theory of light, which was then on its trial, had been established.
      A figure still more remarkable than Leslie occupied the scientific
 stage at the same time, namely, the vigorous, original, and practical
 Benjamin Thompson, better known as Count Kumford, the originator
 of the Eoyal Institution. Rumford traversed a great portion of the
 ground occupied by Leslie, and obtained many of his results. As
 regards priority of publication, he was obviously discontented with
 the course which things had taken, and he endeavoured to place both
 himself and Leslie in what he supposed to be their right relation to
 the subject of radiant heat. The two investigators were unknown to each
 other personally, and their differences never rose to scientific strife.
 There can hardly,     I think, be a doubt that each of them worked inde-
 pendently of the other, and that where their labours overlap, the
 honour of discovery belongs equally to both.
     The results of Leslie and Rumford were obtained in the laboratory ;
but the walls of a laboratory do not constitute the boundary of its
results. Nature's hand specimens are always fair samples, and if
the experiments of the laboratory be only true, they will be ratified
throughout the universe. The results of Leslie and Rumford were in
due time carried from the cabinet of the experimenter to the open sky
by Dr. Wells, a practising London physician.            And here let it be
gratefully acknowledged that vast services to physics have been
rendered by physicians.          The penetration of Wells is signalised
among other things by the fact recorded by the late Mr. Darwin, that
                                                   '
forty-five years before the publication of the Origin of Species,' the
London doctor had distinctly recognised the principle of Natural
Selection, and that he was the first to recognise it. But Wells is
principally known to us through his * Theory of Dew,' which,
prompted by the experiments of Leslie and Rumford, and worked
out by the most refined and conclusive observations on the part
of Wells himself, first revealed the cause of this beautiful phe-
nomenon.        Wells knew that through the body of our atmosphere
invisible aqueous vapour is everywhere diffused.           He proved that
grasses   and  other bodies   on  which  dew was  deposited were powerful
emitters of radiant heat ; that when nothing existed in the air to stop

their radiation, they became self-chilled ; and that while thus chilled
they condensed into dew the aqueous vapour of the air around them.                   I
do not suppose that any theory of importance ever escaped the ordeal
of assault on its first enunciation. The theory of Wells was thus
assailed ; but it has proved immovable, and will continue so to the
end of time.
     The interaction of scientific workers causes the growth of science
to resemble that of an organism.               From Faraday's tiny magneto-
electric spark,    shown    in  this  theatre  half a century ago, has sprung
the enormous practical development of electricity at the present time.
Thomas Seebeck in 1822 discovered thermo-electricity, and eight
years subsequently bars of bismuth and antimony were first soldered
together by Nobili so as to form a thermo-electric pile. In the self-
same year Melloni perfected the instrument and proved its applica-
bility to the investigation of radiant heat. The instrumental appli-
ances of science have been well described as extensions of the senses
of man.      Thus the invention of the thermopile vastly augmented our
powers    over  the phenomena of radiation. Melloni added immensely to
our knowledge of the transmission of radiant heat through liquids and
solids. His results appeared at first so novel and unexpected that
they excited scepticism.         He waited long in vain for a favourable
Report    from   the  Academicians     of Paris ; and finally, in despair of
obtaining   it,   he  published    his  results in the Annales de Chimie.
Here they came to the knowledge of Faraday, who, struck by their
originality, brought them under the notice of the Eoyal Society, and
obtained for Melloni the Rumford medal. The medal was accom-
panied by sum of money from the Eumford fund and this, at the time,
           a                                                ;
was of the utmost importance to the young political exile, reduced as
he was to penury in Paris.           From that time until his death, Melloni
was ranked as the foremost investigator in the domain of radiant heat.
     As regards the philosophy of the thermopile, and its relation to
the great doctrine of the conservation of energy, now everywhere
accepted, a    step of singular significance was taken by Peltier in 1834.
Up to that time     it  had been taken for granted that the action of an
electric current upon conductor through which
                         a                              it passed, was always to
generate    heat.    Peltier,  however,   proved   that, under   certain circum-
 stances,  the  electric  current    generated   cold.   He  soldered  together     a
bar of antimony and      a   bar of bismuth, end to end, thus forming of
the two metals one continuous bar.              Sending a  current through this
bar, he found that when       it passed from antimony to bismuth across the
junction, heat was always there developed, whereas when the direction
of the current was from bismuth to antimony, there was development     a
of cold.     By placing drop of chilled water upon the junction of the
                         a
two metals, Lenz subsequently congealed the water to ice by the
passage of the current.
     The source of power in the thermopile            is  here revealed, and a
relation    of  the  utmost   importance     is  established between heat and
    Vol. X.       (No. 76.)                                                   s

electricity.   Heat is shown to be the nutriment of the electric
current.     When one face of a thermopile is warmed, the current pro-
duced, which is always from bismuth to antimony, is simply heat
consumed and transmuted into electricity.
   Long before the death of Melloni, what the Germans call " Die
Identities Frage," that is to say, the question of the identity of light
and radiant heat, agitated men's minds and spurred their inquiries.
In the world of science people differ from each other in wisdom and
penetration, and a new theoretic truth has always at first the minority
on its side.  But time, holding incessantly up to the gaze of inquirers
the unalterable pattern of nature, gradually stamps that pattern on
the human mind. For twenty years Henry Brougham was able to
quench the light of Thomas Young, and to retard, in like proportion,
the diffusion of correct notions regarding the nature and propagation
of radiant heat.    But such opposing forces are, in the end, driven
in, and the undulatory theory of light being once established, soon
made room for the undulatory theory of radiant heat.             It was
shown by degrees that every purely physical effect manifested
by light was equally manifested by the invisible form of radiation.
Reflection, refraction, double refraction, polarization, magnetization,
were all proved true of radiant heat, just as certainly as they had
been proved true of light.      It was at length clearly realised that
radiant heat, like light, was propagated in waves through that
wondrous luminiferous medium which fills all space, the only real
difference between them being a difference in the length and frequency
of the ethereal waves. Light, as a sensation, was seen to be produced
by a particular kind of radiant heat, which possessed the power of
exciting the retina.
     And now we approach a deeper and more subtle portion of our
subject. What, we have to ask, is the origin of the ether waves,
some of which constitute light, and all of which constitute radiant
heat ? The answer to this question is that the waves have their origin
in the vibrations of the ultimate particles of bodies.      But we must
 be more strict in      our definition of ultimate particles.        The
 ultimate particle of water, for example, is a molecule.      If  you go
 beyond this molecule and decompose     it,the resultis  no longer water,
 but the discrete atoms of oxygen and hydrogen. The molecule of
 water consists of three such atoms tightly held together, but still
 capable of individual vibration.   The question now arises Is:    it the
 molecules vibrating as wholes, or the shivering atoms of the mole-
 cules that are to be considered as the real sources of the ether waves  ?
 As long as we were confined to the experiments of Leslie, Eumford,
 and Melloni,  it was difficult to answer this question.     But when   it
 was discovered that gases and vapours possessed   —  in some cases to an
 astonishing extent — the power both of absorbing and radiating heat,    a
 new light was thrown upon the question.

 1883.]      on Thoughts on  Radiation,   Theoretical and Practical.    257
     You know that the theory of gases and vapours,         now generally-
accepted,   is that they consist of molecular or atomic projectiles
darting to and fro, clashing and recoiling, endowed, in short, with
a motion not of vibration but of translation.         When two molecules
clash,  or  when  a single  molecule   strikes against its boundary, the
first effect is to deform the molecule, by moving its atoms out of
their places.    But gifted as they are with enormous resiliency, the
atoms immediately recover their positions, and continue to quiver in
consequence of the shock.      Held tightly by the force of affinity, they
resemble a string stretched to almost infinite tension, and therefore
 capable of generating tremors of almost infinite rapidity.           What
we call the heat of a gas is made up of these two motions — the
flight of the molecules through space, and the quivering of their
constituent atoms.      Thus does the eye of science pierce to what
Newton called " the more secret and noble works of Nature," and
make us at home amid the mysteries of a world lying in all pro-
bability vastly further beyond the range of the microscope than
the range of the microscojje, at its maximum, lies beyond that of
the unaided eye.
     The great principle of radiation, which affirms that all bodies
absorb the same rays that they emit, is now a familiar one.          When,
for example, a beam of white light is sent through a yellow sodium
flame, produced by a copious supply of sodium vapour, the yellow
constituent of the white beam is stopped by the yellow flame, and if
the beam be subsequently analysed by a prism, a black band is found
in the place of the intercepted yellow band of jtie spectrum.           We
have been led, as you know, to our present theoretic knowledge of light
by a close study of the phenomena of sound, which in the present
instance will help us to a conception of the action of the sodium flame.
The atoms of sodium vapour synchronize in their vibrations with
the particular waves of ether which produce the sensation of yellow
light. The vapour, therefore, can take up or absorb the motion of
those waves, as a stretched piano-string takes up or absorbs the pulses
of a voice pitched to the note of the string.    I will now show you the
action of sodium vapour, in a way and with a result which startled
and perplexed me on first making the experiment, more than twenty
years ago.     You know that the spectra of incandescent metallic
vapours are not continuous, but formed of brilliant bands.       I  wished,
in 1861, to obtain the brilliant yellow band produced by incandescent
6odium vapour.     To tbis end,  I placed a bit of sodium in a carbon
crucible, and volatilized it by a powerful voltaic current. A feeble
spectrum overspread the screen, from which         I thought the sodium
band would stand out with dominant brilliancy. To my surprise, at
the very point where    I expected this brilliant band to appear, a band
of darkness took its place. By humouring the voltaic arc a little, the
darkness vanished, and in the end      I obtained the bright band which
I  had sought at the beginning.     On reflection the cause was manifest
                                                                s 2

The first ignition of the sodium was accompanied by the development
of a large amount of sodium vapour, which spread outwards and sur-
rounded, as a cool envelope, the core of intensely heated vapour
inside.   By the cool vapour the rays from the hot were inter-
cepted, but on lengthening the arc the outer vapour in great part was
dispersed, and the rays passed to the screen.     This relation as to
temperature was necessary to the production of the black band ; for
were the outside vapour as hot as the inside, it would, by its own
radiation, make good the light absorbed.
     An extremely beautiful experiment of this kind was made here last
week by Professor Liveing, with rays which, under ordinary cir-
cumstances, are entirely invisible.         Professor Dewar and Professor
Liveing have been long working           with conspicuous success at the
                                                            I
ultra-violet spectrum, and with Professor Dewar's aid will now show
you this spectrum, as it was shown last week by Professor Liveing.
Using prisms and lenses of a certain kind, and a powerful dynamo
machine to volatilize our metals, we cast a spectrum upon the screen.
You notice the terminal violet of this spectrum.           Far beyond that
violet, waves are now impinging upon the screen, which have no
sensible effect upon the organ of vision ; they constitute what we call
the ultra-violet spectrum.       Professor Stokes has taught us how to
render this invisible spectrum visible, and it is by a skilful applica-
tion of Stokes' discovery that Liveing and Dewar bring the hidden
spectrum out with wondrous strength and beauty.
     You notice here a small second screen, which can be moved into the
ultra-violet region. Felt by the hand, the surface of this screen re-
sembles sandpaper, being covered with powdered uranium glass, a
highly fluorescent body. Pushing the moveable screen towards the
visible spectrum, at a distance of three or four feet beyond
the violet, light begins to appear.         On pushing in the screen, the
whole ultra-violet spectrum falls upon
                                              is it,
                                                    andis   rendered visible
from beginning to end. The spectrum                not continuous, but com-
posed for the most part of luminous bands derived from the white-
hot crucible in which the metals are to be converted into vapour.
I  beg of you to direct your attention on one of these bands in par-
ticular.    Hereit   is,of fair luminous intensity. My object now          to
                                                                           is
show you the reversal, as     it   is  called, of that band which belongs
to the vapour of magnesium, exactly as       I       showed you     moment
                                                                     a
ago the reversal of the sodium band.          An assistant will throw     bit
                                                                          a
of magnesium into the crucible, and you are to observe what first
takes place.     The action  is   rapid, so that you will have to fix your
eyes upon    this  particular  strip  of light. On throwing in the mag-
nesium, the luminous band belonging to its vapour               iscut away,
and you have, for    a  second or so,   a dark band in its place.     Irepeat
the experiment three or four times in succession, with the same
 unfailing result. Here, as in the case of the sodium, the mag-
nesium surrounded itself for      a  moment by   a  cool envelope of its own

  1883.]      on Thoughts on Radiation, TJieoretical and Practical.  259
  vapour, which cut off the radiation from within, and thus produced
  the darkness.
      And now let us pass on to an apparently different, but to a really
  similar result. Here is a feebly luminous flame, which you know to
  be that of hydrogen, the product of combustion being water vapour.
  Here is another flame of a rich blue colour, which the chemists
 present know to be the flame of carbonic oxide, the product of com-
 bustion being carbonic acid.   Let the hydrogen flame radiate through
 a column of ordinary carbonic acid — the gas proves highly transparent
 to the radiation. Send the rays from the carbonic oxide flame through
 the same column of carbonic acid — the gas proves powerfully opaque.
 Why is this ? Simply because the radiant, in the case of the carbonic
 oxide flame, is hot carbonic acid, the rays from which are quenched
 by the cold acid exactly as the rays from the intensely heated sodium
 vapour were quenched a moment ago by the cooler envelope which
 surrounded it. Bear in mind the case is always one of synchronism.
 It is because the atoms of the cold acid vibrate with the same fre-
 quency as the atoms of the hot, that the pulses sent forth from the
 latter are absorbed.
     Newton, though probably not with our present precision, had formed
 a conception similar to that of molecules and their constituent atoms.
 The former he called corpuscles, which, as Sir John Herschel says,
 he regarded " as divisible groups of atoms of yet more delicate kind."
 The molecules he thought might be seen if microscopes could be
 caused to magnify three or four thousand times.      But with regard to
the atoms, he made the remark already alluded to : — " It seems im-
 possible to see the more secret and nobler works of nature within the
 corpuscles, by reason of their transparency."
     I  have now to ask your attention to an illustration intended to
show how radiant heat may be made to play to the mind's eye the part
of the microscope, in revealing to us something of the more secret and
noble works of atomic nature.       Chemists are ever on the alert to
notice analogies and resemblances in the atomic structures of different
bodies. They long ago pointed out that a resemblance exists between
that evil-smelling liquid, bisulphide of carbon, and carbonic acid. In
the latter substance, we have one atom of carbon united to two of
oxygen, while in the former we have one atom of carbon united to two
of sulphur. Attempts have been made to push the analogy still
further by the discovery of a compound of carbon and sulphur which
should be analogous to carbonic oxide, where the proportions, instead
of one to two, are one to one, but hitherto, I believe, without success.
Let us now see whether a little physical light cannot reveal an
analogy between carbonic acid and bisulphide of carbon more occult
than any hitherto pointed out. For all ordinary sources of radiant
heat the bisulphide, both in the liquid and vaporous form, is the most
transparent, or diathermanous, of bodies.    It transmits, for example,
90 per cent, of the radiation from our hydrogen flame, 10 per cent.

only being absorbed.        But when we make the carbonic oxide flame
our source of rays, the bisulphide shows itself to be a body of extreme
opacity. The transmissive power falls from 90 to about 25 per cent.,
75 per cent, of the radiation being absorbed.            To the radiation from
the carbonic oxide flame the bisulphide behaves like the carbonic acid.
In other words, the group of atoms constituting the molecule of the
bisulphide vibrate in the same periods as those of the atoms which
constitute the molecule of the carbonic acid. And thus we have
established a new, subtle, but most certain resemblance between these
two substances.       The time may come when chemists will make more
use than they have hitherto done of radiant heat as an explorer of
molecular condition.

     The term " theoretical radiation        introduced into the title of this
               I
discourse is, hope, thus justified. The conception of these quivering
atoms is a theoretic conception, but it is one which gives us a powerful
grasp of the facts, and enables us to realise mentally, the mechanism
on which radiation and absorption depend.            We will turn in a moment
to what    I  have called practical  " radiation."     It is pretty well known
that for a long series of years       I
                                    conducted an amicable controversy with
one of the most eminent experimenters of our time, as regards the
action of the earth's atmosphere on solar and terrestrial radiation. My
contention was that the great body of our atmosphere — its oxygen and
nitrogen — had but little effect upon either the rays of the sun coming
to us, or the rays of the earth darting away from us into space, but
that mixed with the body of our air there was an attenuated and
apparently trivial constituent which exercised a most momentous
influence. That body, as many of you know, is aqueous vapour, the
 amount of which does not exceed 1 per cent, of the whole atmosphere.
Minute, however, as its quantity is, the life of our planet depends upon
that vapour. Without        it,in the first place, the clouds could drop no
 fatness.    In this sense the necessity for its presence         obvious to all.
 But  it  acts in another sense as     preserver. Without
                                          a                  it isas a covering,
 the earth would soon be reduced to the frigidity of death.           Observers
were, and are, slow to take in this fact, which nevertheless             is fact,
                                                                              a
however improbable     it  may at first sight appear. The action of aqueous
 vapour upon radiant heat has been established by irrefragable experi-
 ments in the laboratory    ; and these experiments, though not unopposed,
 have been substantiated by some of the most accomplished meteoro-
 logists of our day.
  I     wished much to instruct myself        alittle by actual observation on
 this subject, under the open sky, and my first object was, to catch,              if
 possible, states of the weather which would enable me to bring my
 views to  a   practical test. Thanks to an individual who devotes her
 life to taking care of mine, little iron hut, embracing single room,

 has been placed for my benefit, upon the wild moorland of
 Hind Head. From the plateau on which the hut stands, there                     a is
 free outlook in all directions.        Here, amid the heather,      I  had two

 stout poles fixed firmly in the ground eight feet asunder, and a stout
 cord  stretched from one to the other.        From the centre of this
 cord a thermometer is suspended with its bulb four feet above the
 ground. On the ground is placed a pad of cotton wool, and on this
cotton wool a second thermometer, the object of the arrangement
 being to determine the difference of temperature between the two
thermometers, which are only four feet vertically apart.
     Permit me at the outset to deal with the subject in a perfectly
elementary way.        In comparison with the cold of space, the earth
must be regarded as a hot body, sending its rays, should nothing
intercept them, across the atmosphere into space. The cotton wool
is chosen because it is a powerful, though not the most powerful,
radiator. It pours its heat freely into the atmosphere, and by reason
of its flocculence, which renders it a non-conductor, it is unable to
derive from the earth heat which might atone for its loss.         Imagine
the cotton wool thus self-chilled.      The air in immediate contact with
it shares its chill, and the thermometer lying upon it partakes of the
refrigeration.    In calm weather the chilled air, because of its greater
density,   remains    close to the earth's surface, and in this way we
sometimes     obtain upon that surface a temperature          considerably
lower than that of the air a few feet above it. The experiments of
Wilson, Six, and Wells have made us familiar with this result.
On the other hand, the earth's surface during the day receives
from the sun more heat than it loses by its own radiation, so that
when the sun is active, the temperature of the surface exceeds that of
the air.
     These points will be best illustrated by describing the course of
temperature for a day, beginning at sunrise and ending at 10 . 20 p.m.
on March 4. The observations are recorded in the annexed table, at
the head of which is named the place of observation, its elevation
above the sea, and the state of the weather.       The first column in the
Table contains the times at which the two thermometers were read.
The column under u Air " gives the temperatures of the air, the column
under " Wool
                "
                   gives the temperatures of the wool, while the fourth
column gives the differences between the two temperatures.            It is
seen at a glance that from sunrise to 9.20 a.m. the cotton wool is
colder than the air ; at 9.30 the temperatures are alike. • This is the
hour of " intersection," which is immediately followed by " inversion."
Throughout the day and up to 4 p.m. the wool is warmer than the air.
At 4.5 p.m. the temperatures are again alike ; while from that
point downwards the loss by terrestrial radiation is in excess of
the gain derived from all other sources, the refrigeration reaching a
maximum at 7.30 p.m., when the difference between the two thermo-
meters amounted to 10° Fahr.         When the observations are continued
throughout the night, the greater cold of the surface is found to be
maintained until sunrise, and for some hours beyond it. Had the air
been perfectly still during the observations, the nocturnal chilling of

 the surface would have been in this case greater ; for you can readily
 understand that even a light wind sweeping over the surface, and
 mixing the chilled with the warmer air, must seriously interfere with
 the refrigeration.

     Various circumstances may contribute to lessen, or even abolish,
the difference between the two thermometers.                 Haze, fog, cloud, rain,

to the outflow of heat from the earth ; but my position for some time
has been that a very powerful obstacle to that outflow exists which
is entirely invisible.       The pure vapour of water, for example, is a
gas as invisible as the air itself.          It is everywhere diffused through
the air ; but, unlike the oxygen and nitrogen of the atmosphere, it is
not constant in quantity.         We have now to examine whether ineteoro-

      With a view to this examination, will choose a series of observa-
tions made during the afternoon and evening of a day of extraordinary
calmness and serenity. The visible condition of the atmosphere at the
time was that which has hitherto been considered most favourable to
the outflow of terrestrial heat, and therefore best calculated to establish
a large difference between the air and wool thermometers.                    The 16th
of last January was a day of this kind, when the observations recorded
in the annexed table were made.

      During these observations there was no visible impediment to
terrestrial radiation.      The sky was extremely pure, the moon was
shining ; Orion, the Pleiades, Charles's Wain, including the small
companion star at the bend of the shaft, the North Star, and numbers
of others, were clearly visible. After the last observation, my note-
book contains the remark, " Atmosphere exquisitely clear ; from zenith
to horizon cloudless all round."
      A moment's attention bestowed on the column of differences in
the foregoing table will repay us.           Why should the difference at 6 p.m.
be fully 5°   less   than  at  5  p.m.  ; and again 5° less than          at 8 and at
 8 . 30 respectively ?    There was absolutely nothing in the aspect of
the atmosphere to account for the approach of the two thermometers
at 6 o'clock — nothing to account for their preceding and subsequent
divergence from each other. Anomalies of this kind have been
observed by the hundred, but they have never been accounted for, and
they did not admit of explanation until it had been proved that the

intrusion of a perfectly invisible vapour was competent to check the
radiation, while its passing away re-opened a doorway into space.
     It is well to bear in mind that the difference between the two
thermometers on the evening here referred to varied from 4° to 9°, tho
latter being the maximum.
     Such observations might be multiplied, but, with a view to
saving space,    I   will limit the record. On the evening of January
 30th, the atmosphere was very serene ; there was no moon, but tho
firmament was powdered with stars.             At 7.15 p.m. the difference
 between the two thermometers was 6° ; while at 9 . 30 p.m. it was 4°,
 the wool thermometer being in both cases the colder of the two.           On
 February    3rd   observations  were   made    under similar    conditions of
 weather, and with a similar result.           At 7.15 p.m. the difference
 between the thermometers was 6° ; while at 8.25 p.m. it was 4°.           On
 both these evenings the sky was cloudless, the stars were bright, while
 the movement of the air was light, from the south-west.
      In all these cases the air passing over the plateau of Hind Head
 had previously grazed the comparatively warm surface of the Atlantic
 Ocean, where it had charged itself with aqueous vapour to a degree
 corresponding to its temperature. Let us contrast its action with
 that of air coming to Hind Head from a quarter less competent to
 charge it with aqueous vapour. We were visited by such air on the
 10th of last December, when the movement of the wind was light
 from the north-east, the temperature at the time, moreover, was very
 low, and hence calculated to lessen the quantity of atmospheric
 vapour. Snow a foot deep covered the heather. At 8 . 5 a.m. the two
 thermometers were taken from the hut, having a common temperature
 of 35°. The one was rapidly suspended in the air, and the other laid
 upon the wool.      I  was not prepared for the result. A single minute's
 exposure sufficed to establish a difference of 5° between the ther-
 mometers ; an exposure of five minutes produced a difference of 13° ;
 while after ten minutes' exposure the difference was found to be no
  less than 17°. Here follow some of the observations.

       During these observations, a dense bank of cloud on the opposite
  ridge of Blackdown, virtually retarded the rising of the sun. It had,

 1883.]     on Tltoughts on  Radiation, TJieorctical and Practical.    265
however,   cleared the bank during the last two observations, and,
touching the air thermometer with its warmth, raised its temperature
from 26° to 27° and 29°. The very large difference of 18° is in part
to be ascribed to this raising of the temperature of the air ther-
mometer.     I  will limit myself to citing one other case of a similar
 kind.   On the evening of the 31st of March, though the surface
 temperature was far below the dew point, very little dew was
 deposited. The air was obviously a dry air. The sky was perfectly
cloudless, while the barely perceptible movement of the air was from
the north-east.     At 10 p.m. the temperature of the air thermometer
 was 37°, that of the wool thermometer was 20°, a refrigeration of
 17° being therefore observed on this occasion.
     From the behaviour of a smooth ball when urged in succession over
short grass, over a gravel walk, over a boarded floor, and over ice, it
has been inferred that, were friction entirely withdrawn, we should have
no retardation. In a similar way, under atmospheric conditions
visibly the same, we observe that the refrigeration of the earth's
surface at night markedly increases with the dryness of the atmo-
sphere : we may infer what would occur if the invisible atmospheric
vapour were entirely withdrawn.        I  am far from saying that the
body of the atmosphere exerts no action whatever upon the waves of
terrestrial heat ; but only that its action is so small that, when due
precautions are taken to have the air pure and dry, laboratory experi-
ments fail to reveal any action.      Without its vaporous screen, our
solid earth would practically be in the presence of stellar space ; and
with that space, so long as a difference existed between them, the
earth would continue to exchange temperatures.         The final result of
such a process may be surmised.        If  carried far enough, it would
infallibly extinguish the life of our planet.

                        The Canons   of the Far   West.
The drainage lines of a country are among the most permanent
features in its topography.     Where a river has once fastened its grasp
upon the surface, there it for the most part remains, and nothing short
of some colossal upheaval can turn it into a new course. The rivers
 of Europe have served as types of fluviatile action in geology. Yet
an examination of the conditions under which they work shows that
they have been impeded by influences of various kinds. Except in
their mountain tributaries, they flow over comparatively low land.
 Their gentle declivity prevents them from attaining any great erosive
power, and, as one result of this characteristic, they have cut com-
paratively few deep narrow winding gorges.          The geological structure
of this continent is moreover so complicated, that hard and soft rocks
are thrown together in rapid alternation, and little scope is afforded
for the excavation of continuous ravines.          The climate, too, being
comparatively    moist,  much  general disintegration of the surface takes
place, and the detritus washed off by rain loads the rivers nearly to
the maximum of their transporting power.             Where, therefore, as is
usually the case, the rivers flow in open valleys with gently sloping
sides, the rate of atmospheric denudation has been at least as great as,
or greater than, that of river erosion. Where, on the other hand,
they flow in narrow precipitous ravines, they have been able to
erode faster than the atmospheric agents have worn down the sur-
rounding surface.      The influence of vegetation has likewise affected
the general disintegration of the surface.            But perhaps the most
important factor has been the glaciation of the Ice-Age. A large
part of the area was under ice at that period. The minor pre-glacial
contours were then in great measure obliterated, either by being
ground down by the movement of the ice-sheets, or by being buried
under the masses of clay, earth, and stones spread out over the lower
grounds and valleys on the retreat of the ice.           The river-channels
would especially suffer.      The valleys that existed before the advent
of the ice generally remained valleys after the ice had gone, but the
actual channels of the post-glacial drainage would only occasionally

1883.]                  on the Canons    of the  Far West.                269
coincide with those of older date. Hence the present river-channels
in the glaciated regions of Europe cannot have a higher antiquity
than the later part of the Glacial period.              The European rivers
therefore do     not offer illustrations   of  river action in its most active
phase.
      Probably the region of the earth's surface, where the erosive action
of rivers can be witnessed on the grandest scale is the basin of the
Colorado river between southern Wyoming and the desert plateaux of
Arizona. Throughout that region the strata are generally so slightly
inclined that to the eye they appear to be horizontal.             They form
vast plains and elevated plateaux, the higher portions being densely
clothed with pine-forests, while the lower tracts are in large measure
 barren desert. The strangest feature in this strange region is the way
 in which the surface has been trenched by running water into a
 system of profound gorges or canons.          Through the main canons flows
 the rushing turbid Colorado river, but save where its few tributaries
join, the side canons have no permanent streams, and are only occa-
 sionally the beds of torrents when a heavy rain-shower falls.         Nearly
 the whole of the water of the Colorado comes from distant high
 grounds, and the canon region through which the river winds is in
 great part dry and desert.         The Grand Canon of the Colorado, ac-
 cording to the recent measurements of Captain Dutton, is 220 miles
 long, and in places about 6000 feet deep. There are really two
 canons — a \ride outer valley five or six miles broad, with precipitous
 sides descending 2000 or 3000 feet to a platform through which winds
 the inner gorge 3000 feet deep and from 3500 to 4000 feet from crest
 to crest.    These colossal excavations are entirely the work of running
  water.    No trace of any fracture has been found to account for them ;
 on the contrary, they have been eroded across the line of large folds
 and dislocations of the rocks.
       River-erosion is here at its maximum rate. This appears to depend
 partly on the high altitude of the region and the consequent great
 declivity and rapidity of the rivers, partly on the aridity of the
 climate, which permits the rivers to erode their beds unimpeded by
 the various causes that hinder them in Europe ; and partly on the
  large amount of detritus washed down into the rivers by the occa-
   sional heavy rain-showers.
       But there has likewise been simultaneously an enormous denuda-
  tion of the surface of the plains and plateaux through which the Colo-
  rado flows.     In the Grand Canon district a mass of strata not less
  than 10,000 feet thick is computed to have been removed.           From the
  broad fold of the Uinta Mountains the amount of rock swept away is
  estimated at 3-i- miles in vertical thickness.     This vast denudation has
  been entirely the work of sub -aerial agents, and appears to have been
  in progress ever since the floor of the Cretaceous sea was gently raised
  into land in early Eocene times.
       There may have been variations in the meteorological conditions
  of the past, so that the rate of denudation has possibly been

accelerated   or diminished from time to time.          At present, part of
the disintegration is due to the superficial strain upon the surfaces of
rock from the rapid expansion and contraction caused by the great
daily range of temperature. The surface of the bare rocky wastes
crumbles down. The wind brushes off the lighter particles, and makes
use of them as a kind of sand-blast to wear down the rocks and stones
over which they are driven.        Rain, though infrequent, falls in occa-
sional heavy showers,       which,  sweeping off the loosened materials,
rush in torrents of mud and sand down the side canons into the main
gorge.
     Much that is most       characteristic in the scenery of the canon
region arises  from   the horizontality of the strata.      The same beds of
rock, with the same forms of weathering and the same peculiar colours,
may be traced from cliff to cliff for many miles.        A strangely regular
and almost architectural symmetry thus arises, and is traceable even
through the most rugged and broken parts of the scenery.                   The
array of spires, towers, buttresses, alcoves, pediments, mouldings,
cornices, along the escarpment of any stratum or group of strata is in
continual decay and renewal. Slice after slice is cut away from the
face of a cliff by the disintegration and removal of the softer beds
underneath, and thus the escarpments are creeping backward across
the plateaux.     Old valleys now devoid of any living stream are no
longer deepened, but the sapping of their boundary walls continues,
so that they are becoming slowly wider.         There are traces of an older
system of drainage     on the plateaux,   but the channels are now dry and
are even in some instances truncated by the walls of the main canon.
These deserted channels probably indicate a former period of greater
moisture. The glacial period undoubtedly filled up the basin of the
Great Salt Lake nearly a thousand feet above its present level, until,
as a sheet of fresh water, it sent its drainage northwards into the Snake
river, and thence into the Pacific Ocean.         The author had searched
in vain for evidence that the glaciers of the mountains to the west,
north, and east of the canon region had advanced into the plains, but
they probably supplied a larger volume of water to the rivers of that
region than these now possess.
     The history of the erosion of the canons, as shown by Powell and
Dutton, throws light on the slow rate at which some of the grander
movements of the earth's crust may take place.          The Green river, as
 the northern part of the Colorado is called, instead of turning round
the flank of the Uinta Mountains, strikes boldly into them, and has
cut a series of deep canons across the end of the chain.                It can
be shown that     this   operation  cannot    have  been   effected  after  the
uplift but must have been contemporaneous           with  it.   The upheaval
of the vast fold of these mountains, from which some 24,000 feet of
rock have been removed, must have been so slow as not to dislodge the
river from the winding channel it had previously selected           As fast as
the mountains rose, the river sawed     its way down  through    them.   In the
 Grand Canon region, faults of sometimes 6000 feet in displacement

1883.]                on the Canons    of the Far West.                 271
have occurred across the pathway of the river, but without      in any way
deflecting it.
     The influence of subterranean movements is shown in successive
terraces with intervening platforms, as in other rivers.      The terraces,
however,   do  not consist  of alluvium   but of escarpments of solid rock.
     In forecasting the future history of the canons, we find that the
Grand Canon has somewhere about 1000 feet to remove from the
bottom of its channel before its slope becomes so slight that its
erosive power will nearly cease.         It is conceivable that should no
geological   revolution    occur in the region, the caiion may be still
deepened to that amount.          There are indications, however, that a
limit may be set to the possible depth of the chasm. Like the creep of
a coal mine, where the floor is squeezed upwards by the pressure of
the enormous superincumbent weight on either side, the bottom of
the canon, relieved from the weight of the overlying column of rock,
may be forced upwards by the pressure of the walls on either side.
In that case, the channel might rise as fast as the river cut it down,
so long as nothing occurred at the surface to materially diminish the
height of the walls.

              The Influence     of Athletic Games upon Greek Art*
If we were     to  tell an uneducated        workman or a thoughtless young
lady in society that the reasons why they consider certain people
good-looking and certain things pleasing and well-proportioned are
based upon the canons of proportion which the ancient Greeks esta-
blished for the human form and for the objects manufactured by them,
they would find it difficult to realise the truth of such a state-
ment.      Yet so it is. We can all readily realise that our taste differs
from the taste of savages who, as Professor Flower told you three
years ago, flatten their skulls, run bones through their noses, and
stretch and thicken their lips and ears by means of weights. Yet the
fundamental principles underlying our taste, in contradistinction to
that of these savages, are identically the same as those laid down by
the artists of ancient Hellas.             Nay, the difference in taste which
separates    us from   the   types  of  Byzantine-Christian      and early German
 art is the same as that         which   separates  these    pre-renaissance types
 from those of ancient Greece.              We are fundamentally still Greek
 in taste. Now, when we consider how much further than the Byzan-
 tines and early Germans the ancient Greeks are removed from
 us in time, space, race, and religion, the question as to the causes of
 this singular persistency of the influence of Greek art must necessarily
 present itself to the inquiring mind.
       The first and most obvious answer to this question is a purely
 historical one. It would consist in pointing to the events of the
 Italian renaissance, where, as a matter of fact, Greek art and Greek
 letters were brought back to light and revived among the people. Yet
 this is really no answer.         For the question must further be asked :
 why    should  a  few  statues    unearthed,   coming from an age remote in
 antiquity, commend themselves            so strongly to the taste of a later age

  canons ? and why should such an " ancient innovation            not die as a
  passing fashion, but prevail and persist in its influence for centuries ?
       The reasons for this are not to be found in historical accident;
 bat must be sought in the essential nature of Greek art itself, in those
 elements inherent in the art which give it the power of persisting and
 of retaining its validity for all ages and countries.
      Two words, the weight of which         I  cannot hope to convey in this
 short address, contain in their combination the essential and dis-
 tinctive characteristics of Greek art.       It is the combination of Nature
 and the Ideal.
      Greek art has persisted in its influence down to our time, because
 the artist clung to nature and followed her as a kind mother, and
 nature practically remains the same throughout all ages. Byzantine,
 not to speak of Egyptian and early Oriental, art have not done this.
 The types of Byzantine art are conventional abstractions from nature ;
 a work of Greek art, however ideal, is instinct with nature.
      But the persistent influence of Greek art is not wholly due to the
 fact that it was naturalistic ; it is due above all to another qu xlity
 of primary importance, namely, that it was ideal, that it idealised
 nature.    The ideal in art is the highest generalisation of form. In
 Greek art it was the highest generalisation of the forms in nature.
 The works of Greek art are therefore not dependent for appreciation
 upon the individual spectator or one special mood of the individual,
 but are valid for all sane men, all men of a certain physiological con-
 stitution of their senses, surrounded by man and nature relatively the
same.     The works of the early Flemish and German masters, and
even of some of the Kranachs and of Albert Diirer, are replete with
nature, yet are often wanting in the ideal elements which raise the
artist above the individual model into the realms of the most perfect
ideal types.
      Neither Nature alone nor the Ideal alone can make art lasting in
its influence over different peoples and ages ; it is only in the com-
bination of the two, in nature idealised, that this persistent quality of
art can be found. Yet Greek art was not always characterised by
the combination of these two elements.
      We naturally incline to forget the early elementary stages of
things great and perfect.       Nay, we are inclined to believe that they
never were humble and lowly, never grew from the smaller and lower
to the great and high.       Thus the early childhood of Greek art is not
widely known.       Still, there was a period when Greek art was not
possessed of nature.       We may further generalise and say, that art
never is possessed of nature in its earliest stages.            It has often
been stated    that  the   origin  of art  is  to be  found in  the  imitative
instinct of man.      This experience shows to be utterly untrue. It is
really to be found in man's active nature, in his creative instinct,
which often drives him to seek for what is opposed to nature as she
presents herself to him day by day, for rhyme as opposed to prose, for
                                                                   t  2

harmony of tones as opposed to confusion of sound, for composition of
thoughts, things and forms as opposed to haphazard collocation of
things.   Children, when set to draw a real house, will not imitate
what they see before them, but will return to the well-known schematic
form which we have all drawn, and which children in all countries
have drawn and will draw.        It is at a far later stage that man learns
to render exactly what he sees before him and to follow and imitate
nature.
     The childhood of Greek art shows the same characteristics which
mark the early artistic attempts of children.         The works belonging
to what is called the Archaic period (roughly speaking, the works
previous to the fifth century before our era) all exhibit a conventional
treatment which, when compared with the treatment of the works
of the fifth and subsequent centuries, betokens a complete inability
to render freely and accurately the forms of nature.          How then was
the step from this imperfection to the highest perfection made ?
     The causes which brought about this advance are numerous.           In
studying the history of early Greek art we can discern the following
moving powers which account for the course it took and its slow or
rapid progress. As a primum movens there was the creative instinct
of man just alluded to.      If  this were the only moving power, un-
affected by surrounding circumstances, unmodified in its course and
progress by other active currents, the attempts of the later genera-
tions who start with the results attained by their predecessors before
them and the experience gained by much struggle transmitted to
them would show a constant advance upon the work of their fathers.
But life does not present so simple a progression. There are other
currents which either retard or accelerate progress.          Among those
we notice as a retarding side-current the law of inertia, which applies
to man as it does to nature.       In this case it means the force of habit
and custom which leads men more or less voluntarily to resist the
acceptance of new forms differing from those which they have learnt
to admire, and which they associate with things highly esteemed.
This conservatism extends not only to the appreciation of form but
also to the older traditions of handling the material which we often
see survive in cases where a new material suggested and required a new
handling.
     As a side current which accelerated the progress of Greek art
towards freedom in the rendering of nature we notice among others,
that certain changes in the political life of the ancients favoured the
free development of art.        Such were the accession to power of
splendour-loving princes like Polykrates of Samos, Hieron of Syra-
cuse, and, above all, Peisistratos and the Peisistratidae of Athens. The
most important political event was the Persian war and the wealth
and glory it brought to the Greeks.               We must further notice
the important influence which technical inventions exercised upon
the development of art, as the invention of the sawing of marble
by Melas of Chios and his school, which freed the early wood-carver

 1883.]      or the Influence of Athletic Games upon Greek Art.       275
 from the restrictions of a round stem of a tree narrowly circumscribed
 in its dimensions. The art of soldering iron, discovered by Glaukos
 of Chios, which gave similar freedom to the metal-worker, and, above
 all, the invention of the casting of bronze by Rhoikos and Theodoros,
 which enabled the sculptor to bring his finished statue closer to his
own clay model, reacted upon the art of modelling and did much to
free art from its conventional trammels.
      Again, the influence of kindred arts upon one another advanced
each one in turn.       So architecture advanced sculpture in forcing the
sculptor to give freedom of movement and variedness of attitude to
his figures, prescribing to him a limited space which he had to fill
with his figures.       A triangular pediment, high in the middle and
low at the angles, was filled in the earliest art by quaint figures
that grew smaller and smaller in dimension as they approached the
angles.     In order to avoid this absurdity, the sculptor, while placing
figures erect in the centre, was forced to vary the attitudes from a
slight inclination down to a completely reclining posture in the
angles, and thus learned to represent figures with freedom of move-
ment.      The influence of sculpture upon painting and of painting upon
sculpture furnishes us with reflexions which could hardly be dealt
with thoroughly in only one address.
     But of all causes which led the conventional early artist to nature,
by far the most effective was the influence of the athletic games and
the palsestra, which forms the subject of this address.
     We shall see then, first, how the palaestra led Greek artists to
nature, and secondly, how it led them away from nature to the ideal,
or rather, through nature to the ideal.
     It has often been said that a question clearly put is half the
answer. In the present case to appreciate the influence of the palaestra
upon the development of Greek art we must resolve the question
into three definite ones, which will all tend to explain the influence
exercised by the athletic games.       At the same time these questions,
if answered, will account for the peculiar rapidity of the advance
made during a relatively short period of Greek art from conventional
archaism to free naturalism and idealism, a fact, which, it appears to
me, has heretofore not been satisfactorily explained.
      1st. If  we study the Homeric poems so far as they are concerned
with plastic art, we must feel that they manifest the highest feeling
for nature and freedom of execution in the rendering of the human
form. This has already been felt with regard to the descriptions of
the works of art the poet saw in his mind's eye and described as if
really existing. But it appears to me that the most important side of
the artistic feeling in the Homeric poems is to be found in the de-
scription of gods and heroes, and, more especially, in the sensuous
description of the warriors in action and the careful study of the
anatomy of the human figure as shown by the account of the wounded
and falling heroes.       In Homer's picture of a spear-hurling warrior,
we have before our mind's eye the perfect statue of a spear- thrower ;

276                       Dr. Charles Waldstein                 [April 13,
when the hero seizes a rock, we have before us a diskobolos ; when
with "loosened knees" the wounded combatant sinks to the ground,
we see a figure from the iEgina pediment or a dying Lapith or Gaul.
Now, with such feeling for form, such definite conception of what is
sculpturesque, so clear a notion of the parts of the human body, the
step to the actual execution in the sculptor's material is but a small
one.     People possessed of such sense for plastic composition cannot
remain content with mere symbolical natureless art, and the technical
 means of expressing their inner wants are a matter attained with
comparative ease.     Yet the fact remains that even for centuries after
Homer thus manifested his sense for what is sculpturesque in nature
the extant statues are stiff and conventional and do not manifest even
approximately the feeling for nature which we find in these early
poems.
     2nd.   If  we examine    the earliest monuments which we may
attribute to the eighth century, and compare them with those belong-
ing to the middle of the sixth century, we find that they are com-
paratively on the same level of imperfection as regards their want of
freedom and nature, and we must be struck by the relatively small
advance made in two centuries.
     3rd. Now, with this hardly noticeable decrease in stiffness and
conventionality during centuries, we must be struck by the singular
phenomenon that the advance from the imperfect and unnaturalistic
to the most perfect freedom in the rendering of the forms of nature
takes place within a period of fifty years, from about 510 B.C. to 460 b.o.
Within this short span of time the gulf which separates some of
the stiff statues like the Apollo of Tenea from the Diskobolos of
Myron, some of the lifeless seated figures of the Branchidae from the
 early works of Pheidias, is overleapt. How could fifty years create
 so great a change as is shown by the comparison of the Apollo of
 Tenea, devoid of nature, with the Diskobolos of Myron, who is breath-
ing with life ? Other works of Myron are described by ancient authors
 as true to nature even to deception.      The statue of the runner Ladas
 is called breathing with life (2/xurovs) ; the runner seemed, it is said,
 with his last breath, to jump from his pedestal to grasp the victor's
 wreath. Centuries after Homer had in his written descriptions mani-
 fested such a keen sense for nature in the rendering of the human
 form, works as conventional as the Apollo of Tenea were produced,
 differing but slightly in their lack of naturalism from the Apollos
 of 160 years before. Fifty years sufficed to produce all the freedom
 and nature in conception and execution of sculpture, which we can
 estimate when comparing the Diskobolos of Myron with the Apollo
                                                   "
 of Tenea. " How can this be accounted for ? is the question to be
 answered.
     The explanation which has until now been given, is that the
 Persian wars and the Greek victories produced a favourable change
in the life of the whole Greek people, political, religious, and intel-
lectual, and also freed art from its conventional trammels. Now,

1883.]         on the   Influence of Athletic Games upon Greek Art.        277
there    can be no doubt as to the important influence which the
Persian victories had upon the development of Greek art. Yet       haveI
always felt that while it to a great extent explained the loftiness
and greatness of character which marks the art of the age of
Pericles, it does not sufficiently explain the definite advance made in
art from more abstract conventionality down to nature.       Moreover it
took some time before the great spirit bred by the heroic efforts of
the Persian wars had so far transfused the whole nature of the people
as to impress its spirit upon so special a manifestation of the human
mind as art. And so it is not until the great works of Pheidias
which group round the year 450 B.C. that this spirit is exhibited in
art ; while the actual advance from conventional archaism to freedom
and nature takes place in the years immediately preceding and
following the Persian wars.         The really efficient cause of this
rapid development    can   therefore not be found in the influence of
the Persian wars, but lies in* the growth of athletic games and the
systematic development of the palaestra, especially when these are
brought into an immediate relation to art.
    Why Greek art should not have advanced more rapidly towards
nature during the centuries preceding the " period of transition," is
explained by one simple fact, namely, that before this time the
statues were almost exclusively religious.    The early wooden statues,
the $6ava, were statues of gods forming an important part of religious
 worship. The tendency of religious worship is naturally conservative.
 The very earliest images of the iconic period * were necessarily rude.
 The more remote the age of such an image, the greater the mystery
attached to     it,
                 the gi*eater its religious weight.   The earliest statues
were considered by the Greeks to have fallen from heaven (ho-n-eT^).
The more       statue was like these holy early images, the greater its
               a
sanctity, and thus there would be         anatural tendency to repeat the
earlier types.    Nay, even later, when freedom and nature had gained
their sway over art, the gods, when grouped with heroes, are more
conventional in treatment than the less divine beings.           The same
holds good in all periods of art.          I need but remind you of the
solemnity, bordering on severity, of the religious pictures of Bellini
as compared with the perfect freedom of conception and execution
manifested in his small pictures with classical subjects in the
Academy at Venice.       So long as the sculptor's art      entirely in the
                                                            is
service of religious worship, there       small chance of its forcing itself
                                         is
from conventional imperfections.         To be brought down to nature the
sculptor must be brought down from the gods, face to face with
man, and then he may reconstruct his gods out of the ideal combina-
tion of the most perfect forms which he has studied in man, but has
never found together in one man.
    In the first place the palaestra led the Greek artist down to man.
  *   There was an aniconic period of Greek religion in which gods were wor-
shipped, not in actual images, but in objects and localities of nature, and in
symbolical structures suggesting human form.

278                        Dr. Charles Waldstein                   [April  13,
It was here that the Greek people and the Greek artist had their
feeling for the human form, its manifestations of strength and perfect
proportion, aroused and developed.       In the athletic games, to which a
moral, nay even a religious importance was attached, victory, which
brought glory to the victor and was the pride of his community, was
based upon the perfection of the human body, the force and normal
development of all the organs, flexibility and dexterity of movement,
which the early artist failed to render in his statues, and with
regard to which the sense of the public at large seemed compara-
tively blunt. It was here, with hundreds of nude youths, not only
wrestling, jumping, and running, but endeavouring by systematic
practice to remedy any defect or abnormality in any one limb or
organ, that the artist day by day studied his anatomy of the human
figure without the need of entering the dissecting-room or calling in
the help of the anatomist.        And when once the artist was called
upon to commemorate by means of his art the outward form of the
athlete whose perfect development gained him the glory of victory
and monumental fame, we can then see how the sculptor was led
away from the conventional archaic types of gods down to nature in
living, active, and well-formed man.
     All this more or less a priori reasoning makes it most probable
 that the palasstra was the most important agent in bringing Greek
art down to nature in the fifty years marking the " period of trans-
 ition." An actual examination of the facts and a careful study of
 Greek art with this question before the mind, give the most conclusive
 evidence of the supreme influence exercised by the games and the
 palaestra.   I cannot hope in this short address to place before you all
 the instances bearing upon this subject which     I have collected for the
 last four years, and which have shown me conclusively that we must
 ascribe to the palasstra the chief influence in freeing Greek art from
 its conventional trammels. On the other hand           I   do not mean to
 appeal to your faith in my personal statement ; but      I  believe that the
 instances which     I am able to place before you in diagrams and casts
                                                                 I
 will suffice to illustrate and support the points to which shall draw
 your attention. Still    I feel bound to inform you that the choice of
 these special instances has often been guided by mere convenience
 and readiness of access, and that in many cases, as with some of the
 vases, the diagrams were made for other purposes ; and thus it cannot
 be said that   I  have chosen but a few instances happening to prove
 my generalisations.
     From the most general point of view, we must be struck by the
 fact that the Greeks, the one people in antiquity whose art is possessed
 of nature, were also the one people with whom athletic games were
 a national institution, wide spread and part of daily life.          I   have
 endeavoured to show elsewhere how this fact as well as the plastic
 predisposition of the Greek race was a necessary outcome of the
 fundamental characteristics of the race and their physical and social
 surroundings, and to point out that Oriental nations and those living

   1883.]    on the Influence of Athletic Games upon    Greelc Art.     279
  in a tropical or northern climate could not develop the same charac-
  teristics. We must at least note the fact that the two distinctive
  elements of Greek life, a high development of athletic institutions and
  of naturalism in plastic art, are found together.
      But what tends more directly to show the immediate influence
  of the athletic games and to solve the main question we have placed
  before us, is the fact that the fifty years which mark the transition
  from conventionality to freedom and nature in art are also the years
  in which the athletic games became really elevated to the important
  position which they occupy in our mind, and which they did not
  always hold ; that in this period the palaestraB or athletic schools
 became real national institutions, thoroughly organised all over
 Greece.
      As with art and most higher manifestations of human thought and
 culture, the early stages are almost always essentially religious in
 character, so the athletic games in earlier times were either asso-
 ciated with some worship of god or hero or were part of the funeral
 ceremony,    thus partaking of an essentially religious character.
 Towards the close of the sixth century the great games, such as
 those of Olympia, partake more and more of a national and political
 character. They become the central point of peaceful union for all
 Greek states.     The increase of their national importance sprang
 from the growth of the feeling of Panhellenic unity which pre-
 ceded the Persian wars ; yet they no doubt reacted strongly upon
this feeling, and served to bring together the people of the various
states, and to make them feel the common bands which bound them
together.    The political importance of the great games, especially those
of Olympia, can hardly be over-estimated.        This political importance
was,   no  doubt, felt by Peisistratos, who, along with Pericles, was the
greatest of Athenian statesmen.        He appears to me to have foreseen
the greatness of the future of Greece, and above all, of Athens. On the
model of the Olympian games he revived the Athenian games, and as
there he traced the growth of Panhellenic feeling, so here he wished
to create a real Panathenaic feeling.        He added new games to the
old ones, gave greater splendour to them, and, as the Olympic games
recurred at periods of four years, determining the computation of time
for the whole of Greece, so he introduced the Greater Panathenaic,
 recurring every four years and determining the computation of time for
Athens. It is a noteworthy fact that every great political leader in
Athens marked his political activity by some addition to the Panathenaic
festival.    After Peisistratos, with the Peisi^tratidaa and with Pericles,
the games were further enriched and obtained still greater influence.
Furthermore, we must attach the greatest importance to the develop-
ment of the palsestrsB or athletic schools during this period.          By
degrees these institutions are established or rendered more systematic
in their organisation throughout the whole of Greece, and become the
schools for the physical training of the Greek youth destined to
provide strong and active warriors to defend their native country.

280                         Dr. Charles Waldsteia               [April   13,
Nay, they become the home for general education, where even in-
tellectual training is carried on, and the philosophers form their
circles of eager learners. As     I have said before, it is here that tho
artists studied the human form in rest and action. It is here that
the systematic training of each organ of the human body brought
home to them the plastic anatomy of man, and that in the o-Kta/xa^ta, in
which the various stages of each game were gone through, the sculptor
had impressed upon his eye in living statues the typical attitudes of
each game.
     A still more direct proof is to be found in the fact that in this
period the custom arose of commemorating athletic victories by
statues.    And now, as     I have said above, the sculptor is brought
face to face with man, and must bend his art and craft to the service
of actual nature.    According to Pausanias the first statues set up to
athletic victors were those of Praxidamas and of Ehexibios, who were
victors in the fifty-ninth and sixty-first Olympiads, that is, about
530 b.c. They were of wood, and, according to his description of the
one to Arrhachion, were very similar to the statue of the Apollo of
Tenea. The influence of the paleestra and the introduction of the
custom of erecting statues to victors did not take immediate effect, or
at once convert imperfect art to a state of perfection, but it was inch
by inch that conventionality strove to maintain its ground, and step
by step that art advanced towards nature within this comparatively
short period of fifty years.    So we can see in the extant statues the
gradual growth of freedom and the falling away of the archaic
fetters.    In these three instances we have the chief stages of this
progress.     In the Apollo of Tenea at Munich, in attitude, in
the composition of the parts of the body and in the modelling of
the surface, we have hardness and woodenness far removed from
the actual appearance of the living organism.           In the so-called
" Strangford Apollo," in the British Museum, in whom             I  see an
 athlete belonging to the school of iEgina, we have a great advance
 in the direction of nature.    Though the attitude is still conventional,
the feet placed one before the other, the arms pinned to the sides, the
 head straight forward at right angles to the chest, the limbs seem
joined more organically to the body, and, above all, the surface is
modelled so as to present a continuous rise and fall, not an abrupt
 succession of ridges put together, and to suggest the various organs
 which it covers.     Still, though the growing feeling and desire for
 rendering nature    is  manifest in this work, we notice a struggle in
 overcoming the difficulties presented by the material.      The traces of
conventionality are but very slight in this third statue, the Choiseul-
 Gouffier Pugilist, formerly known as an Apollo. This work is most
probably the work of Pythagoras of Rhegion, a sculptor who stood
on the very border line between dying archaism and the vigorous life of
fierce naturalistic art.   Here freedom is given to the attitude (a tyjDical
one in a certain stage of boxing) : the athlete rests upon one leg more
 than upon the other, the arms are freely extended, and, above all, the

1883.]     on the Influence of Athletic Games upon Greek Art.         281
surface is modelled with a perfection which presents most vividly the
flexibility of the human skin and the change of surface as it covers
organs of different form and texture.      Finally, in the Diskobolos of
Myron we have fullest freedom of attitude in the indication of active
life and in the modelling of the surface.     The artists had to exercise
their power of rendering the life of nature in many an athlete statue
before they gained the full benefit of the growing influence of the
palestra.    It was chiefly in the schools of JEgina and Argos that
this training was undergone. If we but bear in mind that, before
the year 530, statues were only of gods and there existed none of
athletes, and compare the enormous preponderance of athlete statues
over those of divinities with the sculptors of Argos like Ageladas, of
iEgina like Kallon and Onatas, of Athens like Myron, we can realise
the actual influence which the growth of athletic institutions had
upon art.    I would beg you to connect in mind with what we shall
learn concerning the ideal period which followed this step down to
nature the fact that after this period of transition, especially with the
great artists of the Attic schools, there was no such preponderance of
athlete statues over those representing mythological subjects.
     Finally, in carefully studying the extant ancient monuments, we
realise the great and direct influence of athletic games, while at the
same time we explain a fact in the early Greek which has often been
noticed, and never, to my knowledge, satisfactorily explained. It is
the fact that, down to the time of Pheidias, the treatment of the nude
male figure far surpasses in perfection the rendering of the head,
which is hard, lifeless, and conventional.     This shows that the body
engrossed the artistic interest and attention of the sculptors, that this
appreciation of the human body is to be attributed to the engrossing
interest of the athletic games, and that the palaestra was the real
school for the sculptor. Look at the feeling for nature in the body
of this " Strangford Apollo," and compare with it the lifelessness of
the head.    You must be struck by the exceedingly careful rendering
of the human structure — limbs, muscles, sinews, and surface — in the
figures from this pediment of the temple of Athene at iEgina ; then
compare with it the lifeless conventionality of the heads.        In the
same way it is the influence of the palaestra, which, arousing the
interest in the male human figure, and giving the sculptor the
power of rendering it with truth to nature, accounts for the inability
freely to render the female figure, as compared with the great skill
with which the male figure is represented during this period. Com-
pare the nude warriors from this same pediment with the Athene in
its centre, and the difference will be most manifest. And, thirdly,
this supreme influence which the athletic games exercised upon
artistic feeling and upon artistic creation is shown by the fact that,
while during this period the modelling of the nude male figure is so
perfect, the modelling of drapery is still in its elementary stages ; so
that even in the works attributed to Kalamis, the older contemporary
of Pheidias, the modelling of the drapery is comparatively hard and

conventional.        Still, it was the palaestra that led the artist down to
nature, and    if   it naturally be above all in the nude male figure, the
central task is still accomplished, and the extension of this attainment
                          "
to other " unathletic       objects is a necessary sequence.       For it is a
well-known truth,      felt by  all  artists, that whoever has the power of
drawing or modelling accurately and with truth to nature a nude
male figure, can render with the same correctness whatever he sees
before him, provided it engrosses his interest and occupies his atten-
tion and practice for some short time.
     We have now seen how the first great task in the development of
Greek art has been accomplished chiefly through the agency and
influence of athletic games.        The artist has been brought from con-
ventionality    and   the  abstract   symbols of gods down to nature and
man.     The next great task, as we have before put         it,    to lead the
                                                                  is
artist away from nature, through nature to the ideal. There really
was some danger that Greek art would not rise higher than the mere
accurate rendering of nature, which would lead to extreme realism,
and, through the final stage of overdone technical skill, to           aspeedy
degeneration.       In Myron there            evidence of this danger.
                                              is                           His
statues, such as that of the famous cow, were praised for their extreme
realism almost leading to deception and in the excessive movement
                                               ;
which he put into some of his statues, such as that of the Diskobolos,
even according to the testimony of the ancients, there was an element
of sensationalism which,        if    had swayed Greek art, would have led
                                     it
toa    rapid decline. In order that Greek art should ever reach the
height which         actually did, and which, as
                    it                                  pointed out to you at

the beginning,       the cause of its persistency of influence even down
                    is
to our own times,         must add the ideal to nature gained —establish
                         it
the natural ideal of the human form.
     There can be no doubt that in the fulfilment of this second great
purpose the heroic spirit of the past Persian wars and the enlighten-
ment and culture of the Periclean age were most effective.              It pre-
 disposed the people towards the appreciation and accomplishment of
 great works, raised them above the sphere of mere individual interest
into that of great common purposes and aspirations, gave them that
 characteristic feeling for width and grandeur, the real and most
 eloquent expression of which         isto be found in the art of Pheidias.
 Yet in    a  more direct and immediate way the palaestra was again
 instrumental in leading art to make this great step.
      If  the artist has been led to appreciate and study nature and to
 endeavour to render      itaccurately in his works, this may lead him at
 last to imitate most minutely what at the time he sees before him.
 This may be excellent practice but       ;       will never create great art.

 For the individual man          is imperfect, and the rendering of those
 imperfect forms will not satisfy the feeling for law, order, harmony,
 or design inherent in the human mind, the primary impulse to all
 artistic creation.
      The palaestra was the real school for the Greek artist here he   :

1883.1     on the Influence  of Athletic Games upon Greek Art         283
spent his time and studied the human form ; but not only in indi-
viduals.   Constantly from his earliest youth, day by day, he had
before his eye numbers of well-built youths in all attitudes and all
actions, and these series of individual forms impressed themselves
upon his mind until they became an intrinsic part of his visual
memory and imagination, forming, as it were, an alphabet with which
he could create at will things of great and new meaning.          Just as
letters, words, and grammar have become to us elements and units of
thought which lie ready to be composed, without effort, as far as they
are concerned, into phrases, sentences, periods, books, poems and
orations with great and new meaning and perfect form, so the ex-
isting human bodies and their changes in various attitudes and actions
became such elements to the visual and imaginative mind of the
ancient Greek artist. They did not require conscious attention, but
became the parts of a great and new composition, with a meaning
and spirit as a whole, lofty and high, yet ever intelligible, because
composed of these elements familiar to man from the daily suggestion
of nature.
    It is therefore that the human forms which they present are so
perfect. Turn to an entirely different period of art and you will
notice a similar phenomenon having similar causes.               Northern
renaissance    painting and sculpture, which possess so many great
characteristics of their own, widely differ from Italian renaissance
art in that their renderings of the nude human figure are devoid of
the grace and harmony which those of the Italians possess : they are
to a greater extent the portraits of individuals whose bodies were not
perfect in all parts.    This is chiefly to be attributed to the fact that
in the southern districts partial nudity is more common, and from an
early age the Italian has more than the German or the Fleming to
some degree reduced the individual human forms to an alphabet, and
has created more ideal individuals of art. Most of the nude subjects in
modern works of art are really studies, and not pictures or statues.
The modern artist depends upon his one model, and if the figure be
more or less perfect we are rather inclined to praise him for his
skill or luck in choosing a good model than for his artistic
imagination.
     This feeling for perfection of form which the Greek artist
gained through the study of so many individual instances in the
palaestra soon became conscious,      and the attempt was soon made to
find the most normal proportions of the human figure as suggested by
the palaestra.    The generalisation from the individuals to the ideal
type   was  bridged over in the palaestra itself by certain classes or
groups of individuals forming types of their own.         As the palaestra
became thoroughly organised in this period, so the games were classi-
fied and systematised, all joining in the one great end of producing
healthy and strong youths serviceable to the state. Thus the games
were subdivided into light and heavy, Kovfas and fiapvs, having their
particular type and fullest representatives in certain classes of men.

 284                          Dr. Charles Waldstein                  [April  13,
 Kunning, jumping, and throwing the spear were typically light games ;
 boxing and the pankration were typically heavy.               The pentathlon
 stood between both, and, uniting several kinds of games, had for its
aim the production of a normally built agile man.            Other subdivisions
might thus be pointed out ; but they tended in themselves to drive
 the artist towards the establishment of normal types for each part
of the body and for the proportions of the parts.             Thus even in the
early period     at the  beginning   of the  fifth century, Ageladas of Argos,
the teacher of Myron, Pheidias, and Polykleitos, wrote a treatise on
the proportions of the human figure.                Polykleitos of Argos and
Lysippos established a canon of the human figure of which we hear
that the one was square and massive, the other slimmer and lighter
with smaller head. We must not lose sight of the fact that these
canons of perfect human proportions were not at once represented in
an Apollo or a Hermes, but that the Doryphoros and the Apoxyomenos
are athletic statues.        Those canons have been identified in these two
extant statues,     a marble   copy of the Doryphoros of Polykleitos in the
National Museum at Naples, and a copy of the Apoxyomenos of
Lysippos in the Braccio Nuovo of the Vatican. They both have the
 characteristics ascribed to these canons by ancient authors.
     In such canons and ideal types we are raised above the individual
to beings higher than man.            Having been led by the palaestra down
to man, the artist can now rise up to the gods with a new ideal of
divine form, for the human form that is above existing man in its
perfection and still is possessed of human qualities brings the artist
face to face with the figures of Greek mythology.
     This influence which Greek athletic art, when once it was esta-
blished in all its truth to nature and ideal breadth, exerted upon
mythological art, is most clearly shown in extant monuments.
     It is really only after the period of transition that the types of
the various Greek gods as we know them become fixed and developed
in art, and for a long time we can then trace the immediate influence
of the palaestra in these statues of heroes and gods.
     After Polykleitos had established his athletic canon, in all the
works attributed to him and his school, whether athletes or gods, nay,
even in female figures, we can see the characteristic proportions of
the Doryphoros repeated.           In later times, in the works of artists
that  are  not  the   direct offshoots  of his school we can often notice the
influence of the athletic type of Polykleitos retained or even revived
in the figure of some god or hero. No doubt some gods and some
heroes are more adapted by their character to assume the form of
such a canon.         So it is especially gods like Ares and heroes like
Herakles that from their nature are square and massive, and are thus
properly represented in the form of the "quadrata signa" of Polykleitos.
In the numerous mythological figures manifesting the Polykleitan
canon that have come to my notice, there have been instances in
which    I at first thought they were athletes, and then found they were
mythological figures ; and some in which, for example,           I thought the

 1883.]      on the Influence   of Athletic Games upon Greek Art.              285
 statue was a Herakles with the apple of the Hesperides strongly-
representative of the Polyklcitan type, and then found that it was
                                                     I
really an athlete with an oil-flask. This mention merely to show
 you how through the establishment of these athletic canons the repre-
 sentation of mythological subjects was influenced.              The same must
be said of the influence of the Lysippean canon which can be traced in
 so many works, not only those immediately of his own school.                   As
the Polykleitan canon, from the nature of its proportions, was best
 suited to the heavier and more muscular gods and heroes, so the
 Lysippean canon corresponded more to the lighter and fleeter gods.
Nay, even as late as the last half of the first century B.C., in the
 school of Pasiteles, we can notice the influence of athletic art upon
mythological art in the new eclectic canon which that artist and his
school established, represented most fully in the statue of an athlete
in the Villa Albani by Stephanos, the pupil of Pasiteles, and traceable
in all the mythological statues of that school.
     It is, however, not only in statues that this influence of athletic
art upon mythological art becomes manifest.              By far the most curious
and interesting instances of this influence are to be found in the minor
arts, especially in vases.        I  have collected a large number of such
instances on vases with athletic scenes. We find there how, following
the normal course of the Greek mind not only in art but also in
religion and literature, the Greeks construct their mythical and heroic
conception upon the basis of real life.           Thus their representations of
real contests    in the palaestra   form   the groundwork for the representa-
tions of similar scenes in the mythical and heroic world, as their
religious idealism drove them to establish the ideal prototype for all
actions of real life. When Pindar commemorates in an ode the victory
of some living athlete, he generally begins or ends with some typical
contest from the heroic world related to it. In the same way the vase-
painter, when painting a prize vase or one decorated with athletic
scenes * places a scene from the actual palaestra on the one side, and
on the other some similar mythical scene, a religious type of the
game.      Prominent among such types are Theseus and the Minotaur,
Herakles and Antaios, Herakles and the Nemean Lion or the Lernean
Hydra, Peleus and Atalanta, contests of Trojan heroes, and many
others. Now the form given to these mythical contests, to which                   I
shall have occasion to draw your special attention, is the same as that
in which the real scene is put, or rather presented itself to the artist
while studying his art in the palaestra. So constant did               I  find this
arrangement to be that it almost partook of the nature of a law and
gave the observer the greatest gain of science, the power of prophecy.f
    * Except in the cases of Panathenaic prize vases, where one side
                                                                        always con-
tains the conventional figure of Athene, like the Athenian coat-of-arms.
    t It appears to me th>it the study of the destination of a vase is often of the
greatest use for the interpretation 'of the vase painting. Thus a sepulchral vase,

with mythological scenes appropriate to its original purpose ; and often a typical

  I  cannot resist relating to you an instance illustrative of this result.
  While studying the vases in the Louvre with the question of the
  Influence of the Palaestra before me,        I mentioned to one of the officers
  who kindly assisted me in my work this result of my observation of
  athletic vases. " Do you mean to say," he inquired, " that, seeing the
  athletic side of  a vase, you can tell what class of mythological scene
  will  be on the other, or what class of mythological scene on the
  one will have an athletic subject on the other ?
                                                            "
                                                               I  answered that     I
  believed  I  could tell what scenes would probably have such correla-
  tives. " Let us see," he said.                                    I
                                       We proceeded to a room had not yet
 examined, and, passing a glass case by the window which contained
 paterae and kvXlkcs,    I noticed a kv\l£, a drinking cup with the shape of
 a flattened bowl, so placed that the convex outside, ornamented               by a
 broad border with numerous figures, was uppermost. The subjects
 represented on this border were scenes from the contests of Theseus
 and Herakles.      "  If  there is any representation in the inside of this
 vase,"   I said, " it is most probably an athletic scene or figure." The
 case was unlocked, the vase taken out, and, when turned round, the
 centre contained a round medallion of yellow ground within the black
 patina of the vase, and, there being only room for one figure, it dis-
 played a youthful athlete with halteres in his hand and a discus by
 his side, evidently a victor in the pentathlon.
      So direct was the process by which the vase-painter transferred the
 scenes he actually saw and studied in the palaestra, that we can trace
 even in the details of the figures composing such a mythical scene
 their athletic origin.
      The simplest and earliest form of an athletic scene is that shown
 in this diagram, copied from an archaic black-figured vase. In the
centre we have the two combatants ; on the one side we see a nude
athlete in a peculiar attitude, with arms drawn up, recurring in almost
all representations of this kind, the odd man in the game, the Ephedros,
waiting his turn. On the other side there is an older bearded figure,
draped with a mantle, and with a long staff in one hand, the
Paidotribes or Agonothetes, the teacher or umpire.                  Now, in the
mythical scenes       the   vase-painter places       his heroic or   divine com-
batants in the same way in the centre, and on either side he places
divinities as judges, spectators, or protectors.                The vase-painter
takes the Paidotribes, draped and with long staff, simply alters the
head of the bearded man to a female head, the staff to a spear,
and sometimes adds indications of the Gorgoneion on the breast,
and we have Athene.           On the other side he retains the nude youth
only, placing in one of his up-drawn hands a short caduceus, and
we have Hermes.           To revert once more to sculpture, we find that
the central figure in the iEgina pediment, presiding, as it were, over
the contest for the body of the fallen Patroklos, is the same Paido-
scene of mythology was modified to suit the character of the        vase.   See the
paper by the present writer, on "Pythagoras of Rhegion," &c,        Journal of  the
Hellenic Society, vol. i. pp. 184-5 (footnote), 1880.

 1883.]     on the  Influence of Athletic Games upon Greek Art.           287
tribes-Athene    that we meet with on these archaic vases.        The habit
 of building up the scenes of mythical contests upon the actual scenes
 of the palaestra was so strong that sometimes the vase-painter forgets
and betrays himself in mixing up in the same mythical scene athletic
and mythical     elements.    This archaic vase-picture from an unpub-
lished small Lekythos in the Louvre is an instance.            The mythical
combatants are here Theseus and the Minotaur ; yet the vase-painter,
 unconscious of the absurdity, places on either side two real nude
 athletes in the attitude of ephedroi, as if awaiting their turn to enter
 a boxing match with the monster whose head is being cut off by
 Theseus. Peaceful contests are directly translated into armed struggles.
 The metopes of the Parthenon and Theseion, the frieze of Phigalia,
show innumerable instances in which Theseus and Herakles struggling
with monsters, Lapiths slaying Centaurs and Amazons, are repre-
 sented in the typical attitudes and actions belonging to the palaestra
and studied there by the artist.
     These observations are not restricted to statues and vases, but
apply equally to the minor arts, such as that of the die-sinker and
gem-engraver. Coins manifest, far more,          I  believe, than has until
now been recognised, this immediate influence of the athletic games.
Mr. C. T. Newton and Mr. E. S. Poole have shown how in the coins
of Syracuse and Camarina even individual victories are recorded.             I
shall merely point to one instance.          This first coin of Selinus in
Sicily, the date of which is about the first half of the fifth century B.C.,
represents the river-god Hypsas as a nude youth with a patera in the
one hand and a short branch in the other.            As   I have once before
endeavoured to show, the type of this figure, though reduced on a
small coin, corresponds in proportions, modelling, and attitude to the
Choiseul-Goufiier Pugilist whom      I attribute to Pythagoras of Ehegion.
About 430 b.c. (observe that the Polykleitan canon had come in) the
same coin with the same river-god changes.         As you see, the type, the
proportion of the figure becomes squarer and more thick-set, the one
leg is drawn back, the weight resting almost entirely upon the other
(uno crure ut insisterent is the characteristic attitude ascribed by Pliny
to the statues of Polykleitos), the branch is elongated and carried
more like a spear — in short, the figure approaches most manifestly the
type of the Doryphoros drawn on this diagram from the Naples
statue.
     If  time permitted,   I could bring before your notice instances to
show in the same manner the influence of the athletic games upon the
works of the other minor arts, such as gems and terra-cottas. Yet if
we have shown it in the greater arts, this also demonstrates it for the
lesser ones. For the minor arts of Greece, as has become evident
from so many instances, took their types and models from the great
works; often one and the same artist created both, and thus the
influence detected in the one applies by implication to the other.
     I hope that  I  have made you realise the important part played by
the athletic games in the development of Greek art. It must,       I believe,

be recognised that those qualities which distinguish Greek art at its
height, the combination of Nature and the Ideal, were given to it
chiefly through the influence which the athletic institutions and their
growth and development had upon the people at large and the artistic
world in particular.   In all branches of science it has been found that
while certain broad currents of influence in the formation and develop-
ment of a growing organism could be perceived and traced during the
earlier and similar phases of its existence, or rather growth, this is
more difficult, indeed hardly possible, when once the body, genus, or
institution has reached the more complex and variegated forms of
full organisation. All the conscientious observer can then do, is to
record the parallelism and concomitance of the development in the
two forms which before held the relation of influencing force and the
thing influenced, showing a certain relation that exists between them
or which they have in common to some other force, and, in many cases,
leaving the question open which is the cause and which the effect.
     So in the present case, after having found that the paleestra was
efficient in bringing Greek art to its full development, we still have
evidence of an intimate relation existing between art and athletics.
Yet we cannot always say where exactly the influence lies, which is
the institution influenced, and which is the one influencing.        All we
are bound to do is to record the parallelism in their development.
     The broad lines which mark the development of athletic institu-
tions are the same that characterise the development of Greek political
and social life, Greek literature, religion, and art.      In political and
social life we have the undeveloped earlier forms of small communities
leading in the great age to the Panhellenic unity in which all Greek
states felt the common ties that united them and in so far submerged
their own individuality. More and more this great and broad con-
ception of state which animated the Greeks gives way to the growing
assertion of the interests of individual states clashing with one another.
Further, in the same state even party feeling asserts itself in opposi-
tion to the state, and within the party again, the individual seeks
his own good to the detriment of the party. Gradually, step by
step, with here and there a short flickering up of the great spirit
in a different form, the dissolution of Greek unity leads to the final
destruction of Greek independence.        With the decline of political
grandeur, strength and virtue die in the social life of the Greeks.
The old simplicity and greatness of character decay, and dissoluteness
and vice more and more take root and undermine the moral strength
of the people ; for in no time and in no country were political and
social ethics so dependent upon one another.       In literature, especially
in the history of the drama, we can notice the same step from the
more conventional forms, traces of which are still to be noticed in
iEschylus, to the more minute individualisation in Sophocles and
Euripides, sensationalism already beginning in the latter. Art was so
complete an expression of Greek religion that in studying the develop-
ment of art we can follow the course taken by religion.       From the first

 1883.]        on the   Influence of Athletic (lames   upon Greek   Art.       289
   stage, the conventional archaic art, we arrive through the period of
   transition to the great art of the Panhellenic period. The spirit of
   the religious art of this period is to be found not only in the character
   of the work, the style of the artistic schools, but also in the subjects
  represented.     The great gods Zeus, Hera, Athene, Demeter, are the
  subjects most commonly represented by the artists, and when they do
  represent the other divinities they give them a severe, large, and
  noble character.      Such is the case with the severe conception of
  Aphrodite, Apollo, Artemis, and Dionysos.                After the great age, as
  in politics so in art,     the  step   is  made   from the ideal down to the
  individual again, from god to man, from the type to the portrait of
  living individuals.     At the same time in religious art, the great gods
  no longer form the chief subjects rejn-esented by the sculptor and
  painter ; minor deities, nay, mythical personifications of lower nature,
  such as fauns, satyrs, maenads, are now represented by preference.
  In the gods again the most human side is emphasised ; in Aphrodite
  and in Apollo, who is made younger and younger, the more sensuous
  and less divine side of their beauty is made prominent, until in
  Kephisodotos the younger, when the fourth century laps over into the
  third, sensuousness merges into sensuality. The grave and noble
  simplicity of the ancient religious art expires with the decline of
  religious faith in the gods and the dissolution of national greatness,
  and in the school of Pergamos and Ehodes the dramatic and sensa-
  tional phase of sculpture prevails. In this period we pass from genre
  sculpture to the comic, the grotesque, and the brutal.
       The palaestra follows the same course.            In the first and earliest
 stages   of the palaestra  the  athletic   games  are  not  completely organised ;
 they   have  not yet established     a character    of their  own, but are a class
 of religious institutions      without     the  human    life and interest which
 they gain when once they are brought down from gods to man.                  From
 having been religious, they must, in the great period of their develop-
 ment, which coincides with the great period of political and intel-
 lectual life, become a national institution.           This step is made during
 the period called in the history         of  Greek art the period of transition.
 In the highest period of the palaestra this institution has a real national
 aim, to provide and encourage perfect physical education for the youth,
 and men who are to form the strength of the nation.             It is a noble aim,
 and, throughout, the character of the great games and of the palaestra
 is of the wide and lofty nature which stamps itself upon its artistic
productions, and thus affects the spirit of art. The statues in honour of
athletic victors are broad, large and monumental in character, in sub-
ject, and in execution.       An individual victory is not commemorated        b;j
the portrait-statue    of  the  victor, but by a    perfect type of that class ol
athlete and that game. It           is  that which lasts when the individual
passes away, just as in the representation of gods during this period
all that  is  ephemeral and individual in mortal life was avoided.               So
too, in the execution of the works, the transient and sensational              is
shunned.       The attitudes are restful, however great the life and the
                                                                      u    2

suggestions of active vitality may be ; there are no sensational
momentary poses ; the modelling is broad and large, without any of
the tricks of craft and the display of technical skill which distinguish
the later works.
     In the next period, marked in art by the growth of individualism
and the gradual spread of sensuality, the paltestra is marked by the
most pronounced individualism and the introduction and spread of
professional athleticism.      As the palaestra grows in importance, and
as the rivalry between the various states grows hotter, the interest
in the individual victor and his importance grow, and thus in the
age of Alexander the Great and of the sculptor Lysippos, when in
other spheres the feeling for personality ran higher, the custom is for
the first time introduced of erecting portrait statues in honour of
athletes who vanquished three times.        Before this, it was considered
sacrilege to place the portrait of living persons on public monuments,
as is evident from the charge brought against Pheidias for having
given his own likeness and that of Pericles to two Lapiths in the
Amazon battle represented on the shield of the Athene Parthenos.
When once this innovation is introduced, towards the close of the
fourth century B.C., the public character of such monuments makes
these portraits a bridge over into more ideal arts.      It will readily be
seen what influence this custom of athletic art must have had upon
the arts of portrait-painting      and portrait-sculpture, and how this
directed the course of art towards realism.
     This greater realism is also to be noticed in the attitudes and
poses given to athlete statues, more momentary and less monumental
than they were in the great age. The same causes which led to the
growth of individualism effected the great change in the spirit of
athletic institutions.    While before they were a means to a great
political and social end, they now become ends in themselves to which
all other considerations become subservient. While before athletic
exercise was a part of the daily occupation of the Greek youth, which
was meant to contribute its share to the great end of making him a
sound and normal being, harmoniously developed both in mind and
body, and thus a serviceable citizen to his state, it now, step by step,
becomes itself the great aim to which time, life, and aspirations of the
youth are devoted, and to which they are made subservient. It is the
step recurring in the history of athletic games in all times, the step
from the gentleman athlete to the professional athlete. In art we see
the signs of the loss of proportion in such works, which increase in
the next period.    We hear from ancient authorities how pugilists and
pancratiasts  were  fattened  up and made bulky, how muscular develop-
ment was exaggerated even to ugliness.         In the mythical figure most
immediately influenced by athletic art, in Herakles, we see this in
later instances, where the muscular development is abnormal and
repulsive.    The germs of the rapid decline of this great institution
are to be found in the fungus growth of its own importance, growing
till it obscured the great aim which gave it life and characterised its

 highest development.       It leads to degeneration or, as the pathologist
 would more accurately term       it,  to hypertrophy.     Let me only bring
 before you one interesting instance to illustrate this step towards
 professional athleticism.      This coin of Amyntas           III. of Macedon,
 who reigned from 389 to 369 B.C., representing           horse with its rider,
                                                           a
is   typical in one respect of all similar representations            before the
middle of the fourth century B.C., uamely, in respect of the relation of
 rider and horse and of the corresponding importance of both in the
 minds of the people of that time.        Like all representations of riders
 down to the middle of the fourth century, the rider             is here large in
 comparison with the horse.       If  now we turn to this     coin,  of Philip of
Macedon, there      is  striking difference in this respect, the horse being
                         a
disproportionately large, while the rider has dwindled down to an
undergrown jockey. The whole matter          is explained by the fact that this
coin of Philip represents his racer, whom he sent to Olympia, and who
there came out the winner.         Now, in the previous periods           was for
                                                                          it
the rider's sake that horse-racing existed,        was to show and encourage
                                                  it
his skill in horsemanship, and he got the glory; there existed no
jockeys. In the time of Philip the horse became the great centre of
interest, and the gentleman rider and warrior of the Parthenon frieze
is  no longer to be found at Olympia.          In the course of this natural
or unnatural selection, the horse too has altered its form, merely to
excel in fleetness.    It curious to consider how similar the action of
                             is
               "
these " laws has been in ancient and in modern times.                   Thus not
only with the human form but even with animals the course taken by
the athletic games in the later periods tended to destroy the ideal of
form established, during the great age of Greek culture, by art
through the earlier influence of the same institution.
     In the last phases of the history of the palaestra we can distin-
guish three manifestations of the decline. Corresponding, first, to the
dramatic stage in the history of Greek sculpture, which led to the
groups of Pergamene and Ehodian schools, we have sensationalism
in the games, encouraging wonderful feats of abnormal strength or
skill, and in athlete statues, dramatic attitudes, boxers with arms
upraised, wrestlers leaning forward with arms extended, and                   de-
                                                                               a
velopment of muscles that remind us more of the dissecting-room than
of the artist's studio.     Secondly, the brutality, the germs of which we
noticed   in the  previous period, now manifests itself fully.         Instead of
the noble grandeur of        aDoryphoros    ora  Choiseul-Gouffier Pugilist,
we have fleshy monsters who would be comic if they were not repul-
sive. The drawing of this figure        is from    aterra-cotta in the posses-
sion of M. Camille Lecuyer at Paris, and represents             a pugilist with
arms upraised,     whose  bull-head   reminds   us so  much   of the Minotaur
that we may fairly doubt whether        it does not represent        bull-headed
                                                                      a
athlete or the Minotaur turned pugilist. Another telling instance of
this class isa   bronze in the Cabinet des Medailles of the Bibliotheque
Nationale of the same city. It represents              apancratiast thick and
fleshy, with swollen face, arms upraised, in the act of kicking with

292                         Dr. Charles Waldstein                [April  13,
his right heel. Such representations are inconceivable in the time of
Pheidias.
      The history of the Greek boxing-gloves, the I/acxj/tcs, typifies and
illustrates the three chief phases in the history of the palaestra, from
its height to its decline. The earliest form were the /aciAixcu, which
were to soften the blow to the striker and the one struck, and were
thus subservient to the exercise.      The second form was the l/xds o£vs,
a leather thong wound round the hand, protecting the hand of the
striker, but increasing the severity of the blow ; this belongs to the
period when professional athleticism was beginning to be introduced.
The third form, marking the period of decline, the Graeco-Roman and
Koman age, was the brutal csestus, garnished with leaden balls,
which produced disfiguring blows, sometimes leading to death.
      As in the decline of Greek religious art, when practically the faith
in the great gods was shaken, we have the introduction of genre and
comic elements, such as putti or little cupids carrying the attributes
of the gods, the thunderbolts of Zeus, the trident of Poseidon, or the
 club of Herakles, so in the last stages of the palaestra, when its
 dignity had vanished along with that of the gods, we see the sacred
 games robbed of all solemnity and transposed into the comic genre,
 in the form of little cupids, undergoing athletic hardships in quaint
 mock solemnity and exertion. The diagram before you shows one out
 of a large number of late reliefs, with chubby children hurling the
 discus, boxing, wrestling, running, jumping, racing in chariots and on
 horseback. Here is one led away after a defeat in the pygme ; here
 another miniature Diadumenos fixes the victor's wreath to its brow ;
 here are chariots colliding and crashing asunder, horse and driver over-
 thrown, and so on — all scenes of the great palaestra made quaint and
 comical. Surely all solemn or religious associations must have left
 the games when once they could be represented in this form.           Such
 representations, too, are utterly inconceivable in the age of Pheidias.
  The real death of all great institutions has set in when once the ridi-
 culous side is brought out.      The most notable instance of this is the
 final death-blow administered to chivalry by Cervantes in 'Don
  Quixote.' When once the Greek games are made the subjects of
 these comic scenes their end is reached, and they die with the extinc-
  tion of Greek political freedom and the fall of Greek literature and art.
      I  have brought before you the influence of the Greek athletic
  institutions upon art in the effect they produced, leading the Greek
  artist to nature and the ideal in the representation of man.          This
  applies chiefly to the single figures in sculpture.    There is one more
  great achievement of Greek art, in which it has supplied all ages with
  an artistic principle as fundamental as the ideal of the human form ;
  and this again, I hold, is chiefly due to the influence which the athletic
  games had upon the development of Greek art.
      The masterpieces of Greek painting have all been destroyed, and
  our information concerning them is derived from the numerous accounts
  of ancient authors, and from their feeble reflexion in the works of the

  1883.]    on the   Influence of Athletic Games upon Greek Art.         293
   minor arts, such as mural and vase painting. Thus the common error
   is widespread that Greek painting was comparatively on a quite dif-
   ferent scale of excellence to Greek sculpture.       I have reason to hold
   that this is not so, and that, with the exception of landscape painting,
   the standard of Greek painting was comparatively as high as was that
   of their sculpture. However this may be, one fact remains, that they
   are the first to have established the fundamental principle of pictorial
   art, and that this was first done in athletic art.
        This fundamental principle of pictorial art is expressed by the
   word composition. What constitutes a picture a work of art is the
   artistic organisation which the artist gives to the elements which he
   copies from nature.      It is not merely a tree and a house and a man
  that make up a picture, but it is the combination of these elements
  into unity and harmony suggested and demanded by the feeling for
  and need of design inherent in the human mind.            In our most com-
  plicated pictures we can distinguish the following elements of com-
  position. First, linear composition, in which this unity is given by
  means of an outline to the whole drawing which meets in some
  central point ; second, perspective composition, in which the repre-
  sentation of distance from the point of vision enables the artist to
  indicate the foreground and background with regard to the centre of
  interest ; and in the third place composition is given to a picture by
  light and shade, the gradation of values of colours and of tone which
  give the same artistic unity within variety. But all these forms have
  this in common, that they impress upon the eye of the spectator a
 central point of design and interest, and that the other parts of the
 work lead up to     it,making of the whole an artistic organisation with
  unity or harmony of design.
       In the paintings of the East and of Egypt we have long successions
 of figures tier above tier relating in an imperfect language scene a
 as we should relate       in succession of sounds called words. In fact
                           it    a
it   is picture-writing which must be translated into  a     form of thought
 corresponding to words before       it   brings
                                               a   real picture before the
 mind's eye. This     issymbolical art in which the artistic representation
isa     mere sign appealing to and stimulating the constructive imagina-
 tion of the spectator to fashion an inner picture of his own making.
 It not yet work of real art which has its life and unity in itself
     is       a
 and attracts and holds the eye of the spectator at its most living
 point of interest.
      This principle of composition was first carried out by the
 Greeks, when they left the sphere of symbolical picture-writing, and
presented scenes with       a real centre of interest and design. In the
earliest works of Greek art, such as the Chest of Kypselos and the
Francois vase, we have the oriental arrangement of tier upon tier of
successive figures.     It      in athletic vase-paintings like this black-
                                is
figured archaic one that we have the first instances of composition.
In the centre are the two boxers engaged, to the right and left are
the Ephedros and the Paidotribes, facing the centre.               By their

294                        Dr. Charles Waldstein                  [April   13,
attitude as well as their action these two figures give a completeness
to the scene, separate it from the outside, and drive the eye towards
the real centre of action and interest.      Unity, life, and variety are at
once given to the whole scene.        Unity in that the scene has a local-
ised centre of interest towards which the other parts tend and lead ;
life in that each part contributes to the unity of the whole ; variety
in that there is a gradation of interest as we approach or leave the
centre.    In this simple and conventional form of work we have in
embryo all the germs of the highest variety of composition.              The
attendant figures on either side represent the foreground and back-
ground to the central combatants, and we need but reach the perfection
of technique in the acquisition of the laws of perspective, the power
of shading, and the gradation of tones of colours, to carry this funda-
mental principle to its highest variety and expressive power.
     It was in the palaestra that the early painter had the centre of
artistic interest impressed upon him by the combatants whose struggle
engrossed the attention of all spectators, it was here that he had this
rudimentary form of composition impressed upon his eye by the ever-
recurring figures of the Ephedros and the Paidotribes standing on
either side.
     Yet not only by a priori probability is this statement supported.
 The monuments themselves, if carefully studied, give the weightiest
evidence.     In the first place, the earliest works of art do not give us
this form of composition, it comes in with the athletic vases. Further-
more, if we analyse the later vases, even those representing subjects
                     " and
most " unathletic           of late complex forms, we can always trace
this simple schematic form here given in the pugilists, the Ephedros
and the Paidotribes.      I have chosen these diagrams, serving to illus-
trate quite different lectures, at random.        Here you have a scene
representing    the birth  of Athene,  here  another  relating to a tradition
 of Athene Ergane, and in all you have the two chief figures in the
centre with standing figures on either side facing them.          Sometimes
the side figures are doubled, sometimes there is but one central figure
in the middle, but the scheme remains the same. Here you have late
vase-paintings with numerous figures, free and bold in composition and
 execution, representing an Amazonomachia and a Gigantomachia, and
 all this large group resolves itself into smaller groups of the form of
 this early athletic vase. However complicated and perfect the com-
 position of a late vase, the traces of this simplest form of pictorial
 composition will always be noticed, the fundamental principle of
 pictorial art which was impressed upon the eye of the artist through
 the athletic games of the Greeks.
     What we owe to the Greek artist constitutes the principle of art
 even in our time ; it is the combination of nature and the ideal in the
 human figure, and the principle of composition in pictorial art, both of
 which were developed in him chiefly through the influence of the
 athletic games, and this fact     I hope to have made clear to you this
evening.

    From the nature of the subject dealt with in this address we have
necessarily only noticed Greek art in its expression of the physical
side of human life, leaving unobserved the spiritual side of their
great works.     There is an erroneous notion abroad, started by those
who have but a superficial acquaintance with Greek art, that though
the Greeks represented with perfection the physical side of beauty,
they failed to render due justice to the spirit and the soul.            If
sufficient time were at my disposal,     I  believe that I could show you
how erroneous is this notion. It is true the Greeks avoided the ex-
pression of physical emotion in their statues when it led to grimace,
yet their great statues are replete with the true soul of art. The
soul of art does not depend upon the immediate expression of emotion
in facial changes, any more than goodness with man depends upon the
immediate act of charity in the most restricted sense. It may be a
truer and greater act of charity to teach our pupils mathematics when
pleasure calls us away, or to conform to the laws of good-breeding
when our inclination and comfort drive us the other way, than to
distribute a small share of our ready money to some beggar. The
soul of art is not to be found in the immediate attempts at repre-
senting what *we believe to be the outer manifestation of human
souls ; but in the unity and harmony of organisation given to a work
through the design inherent in the creative artist's mind, the share of
soul which the creating artist transfers from himself to the work of
his hands, and above all in the complete and inseparable harmony
that obtains between the subject represented and the material which
embodies the idea.      A marble angel of death bearing heavenwards in
his arms a dead infant, with marble tears trickling down his cheek,
suspended from the ceiling of a drawing-room by a silver cord, has
less artistic soul than this Choiseul-Goumer Pugilist ; because in the
athlete there is complete and inseparable harmony between the man
represented and the artistic stuff that he is made of.

                                       "
The expression " our road to India is one familiar to all inhabitants
of Britain. It immediately brings to the mind's eye that long line of
communication, commencing with Gibraltar on the west, and reaching
through Malta, Cyprus, the Suez Canal, to Perim and Aden, by
which intercourse with our vast Eastern Empire is maintained.            But
on that line of communication there lies in the Indian Ocean a large
island, which, long before Britain had a road to India, — for India was
not her possession — was the object of ambition to the rival nations
struggling for supremacy in the East, but which in recent times,
though sighted by all vessels passing by the Eed Sea route to India or
to regions east from Aden, has remained a veritable          terra incognita
on the threshold of civilisation.
    This island of Socotra lies off the N.E. corner of Africa in lat.
12° 19' to 12° 42', and long. 53° 20' to 54° 30'. Its extreme length from
east to west is about 72 miles, and its breadth about 22 miles.
    From Cape Guardafui 140 miles, it is a little more distant from
the Arabian Coast (about 500 miles from Aden), and still further
away from the Indian Peninsula.
     It is the most easterly elevation of land on a coral bank lying to
the N.E. of Africa, upon which, between it and Cape Guardafui,
other islands (Abd-al-Kuri, Kal Farun, Sambeh and Darzi — known
commonly as The Brothers — and Saboynea) of smaller size occur.
On no part of this bank is the depth of water over 200 fathoms, but
between it and the African coast is a channel reaching 500 fathoms.
Around Socotra is a narrow coral reef.
    Perhaps no island of like extent, and lying, as one may say, on
the threshold of civilisation, has remained in later times so generally
unknown as Socotra. Situated on the highway of traffic to the East
by way of Suez and the Eed Sea, it is almost invariably sighted by
steamers making for or from the Gulf of Aden, and thus to those who
nave passed along this route, its locality, or at least its name, will be
known.      To the scientific world it has been familiar as the country
of a kind of aloes, the designation of which as Socotrine, has by
some been traced to the name of the island.         But to the majority of

1883.]        on the   Island of Socotra and its Becent Revelations.                  297
people its existence and its name are alike unknown, or at most it is
associated in a vague sort of way with the East Indies.
     The causes for this are not difficult to discover. As the extreme
outlying land in this region of the Indian Ocean, the island is exposed
to the full blast of the monsoons, however they blow, and possessing no
harbour in which a ship can at all times ride safely at anchor, it offers
no inducements to ships seeking shelter.             Then the currents which
sweep past its shores run with considerable force into the Gulf of Aden,

its importance has been recognised, and certainly its present back-
ward condition can hardly be ascribed to want of attempts to settle or
to colonise it.
     The early history of Socotra         is   of considerable interest. The island
seems to have been known to Europeans at an early period under
the name of Dioscoris or Dioscorida, — name traced by some to
                                                       a                               a

a  desolate island inhabited by    a   mixed population of Arabs, Indians,
and Greeks, all speaking Greek, who had come thither in search of
grain, and carried on    a  trade with the West Coast of India and with
Mokha. The island         is   frequently mentioned by the early Arab
geographers, who account for the Greek population by the story,
which Colonel Yule considers        a    myth, that Alexander the Great,
acting   on  the  advice  of  Aristotle, settled an Ionian colony there, in
order to cultivate the aloe. They further state that the Greeks and
other inhabitants were converted to Christianity, and that clergy
from Persia regularly visited the island.          The population at this
time, few centuries after the Christian era,
      a                                            is   put down by some at
as much as 10,000, the majority of whom are described as Nestorian
Christians and pirates.
     In the time of Marco Polo, towards the end of the thirteenth
century, the island was      a metropolitan see of the Nestorian Church.
Many ships visited the island, all vessels for Aden touching there,
and the trade was mainly in ambergris, cotton stuffs, and salt fish.
The people had the reputation of being enchanters, and of being
able at will to raise the wind, to bring back ships, and to produce
storms and disasters.
     Although so mixed population lived on the island, yet from the
                          a
earliest times  it   appears to have been under the rule of the Mahra
tribe, dwelling on the opposite coast of Arabia, whose sultan or
sheikh lived at Keshin.
     In 1503 Fernandez Pereira discovered         it  for the Portuguese, at
which time an Arab sheikh lived in fort at Zoko (modern Suk), then
                                        a
the capital of the island      ; but
                                   it   was not until 1507 that Tristan da
Cunha and Albuqerque captured the island for the Portuguese.
After four years' occupancy the Portuguese retired from the island,
leaving abundant traces of their presence.         The remains of fort on
                                                                   a
Hadibu plain, and at various places on the S. and S.W. sides of the
island, are most substantial ruins.       Besides in these, their influence     is
possibly seen    in such  names   of places as Derafonta and in Feraigey,
the name of one of the ruined forts, which may be Feringee.               And
indeed the dialect of Socotra may,      it   isthought by some, owe part of
its peculiarity to   a Portuguese basis.      Moreover, at the present time,
a  large  section   of the  inhabitants   of  the hill-region of the island

1883.]     on the Island of Socotra and its Recent Revelations.      299
claim direct descent from the Portuguese.          About this date the
character of the Christianity had somewhat changed, and the doctrines
of the Jacobite sect were professed.
     The evacuation of the island by the Portuguese allowed a return
of the Sultan of Keshin, and in his hands it has ever since remained,
with the exception of a short occupancy on three several occasions by
a foreign race — in 1538 by the Turks, in 1800 by the Wahabbees,
and by the British from 1834 to 1839.
     Although the ships of the East Indian Company frequently called
at the island during the seventeenth century, some meeting with a
friendly reception, others finding the reverse, and carried on a small
trade in aloes and dragon's-blood (the stormy weather seems always
to have been a source of dread), it was not until the year 1800 that
affairs in the East directed the attention of the British Government to
Socotra as a desirable possession, and the commander of the naval
station in that region was directed to seize it. This was not done,
and it was not until 1834 that the necessity for a coaling station
induced the Indian Government to survey the island. This was
accomplished by Captain Haines and Lieutenant Wellsted, and the
result of the survey being satisfactory, the Government attempted to
buy the island, but failing to do so it was seized in 1835 by Indian
troops. Aden having been taken in 1839, and being more suitable
as a coaling depot, Socotra was abandoned.
     The exploration of the island by Wellsted supplied us with the
first, and indeed until now only detailed account of the island, its
people, and productions.     The only available chart at present is the
one made during this exploration, and it is most imperfect.
     After the abandonment by the British in 1839 there is but scant
record of Europeans visiting the island. In 1847 the French ex-
ploring brig, Duconadic, under Captain Guillain, and with the cele-
brated French collector Boivin on board, touched at the island for a
few days ; but except for an occasional shipwreck bringing it into
notice one reads nothing about the island until 1876, when a prospect
of its being occupied by another power caused the British Govern-
ment to turn attention to Socotra, with the result that in that year a
treaty was concluded with the Sultan, by which he binds himself, and
his heirs and successors, " amongst other things, to protect any vessel,
 foreign or British, with the crew, passengers, and cargo, that may be
 wrecked on the island of Socotra or its dependencies, and he receives
an annual stipend of 360 dollars for this."     The " other things," it is
understood, include a promise never to cede Socotra to a foreign
power, or to allow a settlement on it without consent of the British
 Government. Thus the Sultan becomes a feudatory of Britain.
     The attention of naturalists had long been directed to Socotra as
a field for investigation whence rich results might be obtained, and
 Captain Hunter, who had visited the island in connection with the
concluding of the treaty just mentioned, having brought back most

 300                     Professor Bayley Balfour                  [April 20,
  encouraging accounts, Dr. Sclater in 1878 brought the matter pro-
 minently before the British Association for the Advancement of
  Science, and the Committee of the Government Fund for Scientific
  Research, with the result that a certain sum of money was obtained,
 and a committee appointed to take steps for the exploration of the
 Natural History of the island.
      Various causes delayed the sending out of the expedition, and it
 was not until January 1880, that     I left this country, returning again
 in April, having spent, with two companions — Lieutenant Cockburn,
 6th Royals, whose regiment was at Aden, and Alexander Scott, a
 gardener from the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh, who accom-
 panied me from England — nearly seven weeks on the island.
 Although so long a period elapsed between the evacuation of the
 island by the British and the date of our expedition, yet we were
 followed in the succeeding year by the German traveller and botanist
 Dr. Schweinfurth, who with three companions — MM. Riebeck, Rosset,
 and Mantay — spent five weeks on Socotra.          Thus, after an interval
 of forty years, the island has been explored in two successive years.
      Such is a brief historical account of the island up to the present
time. And      I may now give a short account of the government and
people.
      The government of the island is in the hands of the Sultan of
 Keshin and Socotra. At present two brothers are joint Sultans, and
one lives at Keshin, the other resides in Socotra.       They are nephews
 of the one who, in 1834, refused to sell the island to the British.
The Sultan has complete sway in Socotra.           He has a residence on
Gharriah plain, at the base of the Haggier hills, and has also a
palace in Tamarida, where he dispenses justice.        Under him, each of
the large villages has its sheikh or head, and the island is divided into
four sections, each of which is in charge of a ranger. The Sultan
alone has power to inflict punishment.         In each section the land is
let out to the various tribes of Bedouins, both for pasture and for
the collection of gum, payment therefore being made in ghi.             The
Sultan reserves    for himself  one  portion  of land  for the collection of
dragon's-blood.
     The trade of the island at present is small, ghi being the chief
export. It is carried on by buggalows from the Arabian coast.
" These arrive in the first months of the year with coffee, rice, and
other articles, which they exchange for ghi, aloes, orchella, weed, &c,
which they take to Zanzibar, and, on their return, they bring coco-
nut, bombe, and American piece-goods.         They dispose of as many of
these as possible, and take outwards ghi, aloes, dragon's-blood,
blankets, &c, and return to Arabia.       Pearl-fishers from the Persian
Gulf at times visit the island and dispose of their pearls. The Sultan
takes tithe of all exports.      From ghi his revenue is about 500$,
aloes bring him 250$, edah gives 80$, and other sources bring it up
to 1000$ a year, which, with his stipend of 360$ from the British,
makes him a comparatively rich man in this region."

 1883.]      on the  Island of Socotra and its Recent Revelations.         301
     The extent of the population it is impossible to estimate, as so
many people live in caves, and one only occasionally comes across the
wandering inhabitants of the hill region. The number has been set
down    as low  as 4000 and as      high as 10,000.
     In speaking of     the people, the dwellers on the shore must be dis-
tinguished from those on the hills. The former, who are a mixed
population of Arabs, Indians, and Africans of various tribes, live in
small towns.        Of these the chief one is Tamarida, on the extensive
Hadibu plain at the base of the Haggier range of hills. It is the
capital of the island, and consists of a number of stone and lime
houses, of the ordinary construction seen in Arabia, all plastered
outside of a dazzling white, and surrounding a large one, which is
the Sultan's palace.       Around the town is a dense date-grove.       There
is a mosque and well-filled graveyard in the centre of the town. The
number of inhabitants is set down at about 400.             Kadhab is another
village, lying    on  a  sandy spit   east from  Tamarida.    The houses here
are of the same character as at Tamarida, and there is a mosque.
Gollonsir, at the west end, is a penal settlement, and has but few
houses.     Formerly, the capital of the island was Suk, at the east edge
of the Hadibu plain, but it was destroyed.           There are numerous small
villages   all along   the  coast line, but  the three mentioned are the chief
towns.
     The occupation of the residents in these villages is mainly fishing.
They cultivate small tracts of ground near their houses, but are, as a
rule, idle.    The population too is somewhat changing, many going
off in trading buggalows to Zanzibar or the Arabian coast.
     The inhabitants of the hills, " Bedouins," as they are called, are
very different people.        They are regarded as the aborigines of the
island, and alone possess any great interest ethnologically.             They
are mostly troglodytes, but here and there live in small huts, with
stone and lime walls and roofed with date-palm leaves.             They are a
most peaceable race of people, and are divided into numerous families
belonging to a few principal tribes. A study of these tribes would
well repay the time and trouble spent upon it. Captain Hunter says :
" The ' Karshin,' who inhabit the western end of the island, claim to
be descendants from the Portuguese.            The ' Momi,' who reside in the
eastern end of the island, are said to trace descent from the aborigines
and the Abyssinians ; whilst the ' Camahane,' who live in Haggier
and the hills above the Hadibu plain, claim to arise from the inter-
marriage of the aborigines with the Mahri Arabs from the opposite
coast.    Whatever be their origin, certain is it that the hill people
have a very distinct appearance.            Many of them are tall and finely
made, the men with broad shoulders, lean flanks, and stout legs,
reminding one very forcibly of the European build.                Thin-lipped
and straight-featured, they have straight black hair.            The women
are many of them very good-looking, somewhat resembling gipsies,
but they have rather large hands and feet."
     The men wear a loin-cloth, one end of which is commonly thrown

302                      Professor Bayley Balfour               [April  20,
over the shoulder, usually with a knife stuck in the waist, and they
invariably carry a stick. The women have the ordinary Arab blue
skirt, in most cases kilted at the knees and continued round the waist
by a girdle.    In some cases, however, they improvise a petticoat of
the coarse blankets they themselves weave, and wear on the upper
part of the body a loose tunic with short sleeves.     They go unveiled.
The women wear the hair done up in two plaits which hang down
their back, but in front the hair is cut to form a short fringe on the
forehead. Their ornaments are few.         The men often wear an armlet
of silver. The women have necklets of amber, glass beads, dragon's-
blood tears, or in some cases rupees, and have also the ordinary Arab
silver armlet and ear-rings.
     The occupation of these people is chiefly pastoral. Their herds
and flocks are extensive.    From the milk they make quantities of ghi
by a simple process of churning — merely continuous jerking of the
skin mussocks — and they sell it to the Arabs of the coast, or exchange
it for rice, dates, or other necessaries.     They collect also dragon's-
blood and aloes, but the latter only in great amount when pasturage
fails them. The women spin a coarse thread from the sheep's wool,
which they weave into blankets.
     Old voyagers speak of horses being used, but there are none now.
 The cattle are small and have no hump. Immense herds are found
at the eastern end of the island.     The sheep are all fleeced, but there
are none of the Berbera kind.         Of goats there are some in a wild
condition.    The camels are much smaller than those at Aden and
 elsewhere in Arabia, and are able to climb like goats ; many are kept
for milking. Asses roam wild in herds all over the island.
     Of plants cultivated on the island the most important is the date-
palm. Every stream on the island is lined by groves of them, and
 the fruit is used, both ripe and unripe.      Melons are grown, as also
 small onions. Little   cereal  culture is indulged in. Here and there,
 on the hills beside a stream, a small enclosure of " bombe
                                                                 "
                                                                   (jowari)
 may be seen, but the inhabitants are too lazy to cultivate to any
 extent, the watering requiring too much labour.        Only in one spot
 was there observed an attempt at irrigation.
     These hill people live very miserably.         Milk forms a large
 portion of their diet. Bombe is used when grown.         Rice is obtained
from the coast Arabs.     Date is a staple of food.    On great occasions
a sheep or a kid is killed.
     The furnishing of their dwellings is very meagre. Blankets are
their couches.     Goat-skin mussocks are used for water and milk.
They have also earthenware pots, moulded by the hand out of the
clays and lime of adjacent rocks.
     Their language is peculiar. Captain Hunter says of it :      "I  could
trace no affinity to any of the languages of the neighbouring coasts.
It sounds a little like Kis Swahili, but not so soft. It is not Mahri,
for the Sultan said it in no way resembled it. The sound is not so
guttural as Arabic, and seems to require less effort in enunciation."

Somalis do not understand it. Wellsted says the people of the
opposite Arabian coast understand            it, but that  is  not the case.
Perhaps Portuguese may have         had   something to do with it. Others
trace in  it

prostration they will turn round and join in the conversation, and
again continue their devotions until the requisite outward observances
have been completed."
     The fact that the Wahabbees visited the island accounts probably
for the absence of the many churches, or traces of them, said to exist
in ancient times on the island. Wellsted observed some ruins,
believed to be of     a  church. There are, however, still evident the
ruined forts of the Portuguese.        The largest of these      at Feraigey.

rocks being visible.      None of these were seen by us. But on the
Kadhab plain there occurs       abroad pavement of limestone, 50 yards
long by 25 to 30 yards broad, whereon numerous hieroglyphics are
cut.   The figures are not in line, and do not give the idea of any
continuous sentence, and they lie at all angles to one another and
at varying distances.     Some resemble foot-imprints, others distinctly
represent  a  camel, others are like St. Andrew's cross, others are of
most irregular form.
     The physical features of the island may now be noticed.
     The surface features of Socotra at the present time are those of
an island mountainous in the extreme.          The shore line on its southern
aspect is, as the map shows,    a  tolerably continuous one, unbroken by
deep inlets or bays.     On the northern side occur    a    few shallow bays
at the mouths of the streams, which afford the only anchorage to be
obtained around the island, but no one of them       is   safe at all seasons
of the year. On all sides the      hills rise  with  considerable  abruptness
over a  wide area, forming bold perpendicular cliffs of several hundred
feet in height, whose base          washed by the waters of the Indian
                                    is
Ocean ;  but at other places leaving plains varying in breadth up to
as much as five miles between their base and the shore.                On the
south side of the island   is the largest   of these shore plains —  Nogad —
which, extending nearly the whole length of the island,             for miles
                                                                     is
covered with dunes of blown sand.         On the north these plains occur
chiefly at the mouths of the streams, and are the sites of the only
places which may be called towns.
     The internal hilly part of the island may be roughly and shortly
described as   a wide undulating and intersected limestone plateau of
an altitude averaging 1000 feet, which flanks on the west, south, and
east a  nucleus of granitic peaks over 4000 feet high. The whole
of this hilly region      is deeply cut into by ravines and valleys.
These in the rainy season are occupied by roaring torrents, but the
majority of them remain empty during the dry season.               There are,

however,     many perennial streams on the island, especially in the
central granitic region, where amongst the hills the most charming
bubbling burns dashing over boulders in a series of cascades, or
purling gently over a pebbly shingle, make it hard to believe that
one is in such proximity to the desert region of Arabia.          Few of the
perennial     streams   reach  the shore   in the dry season — most  of them
are fiumaras.
       The eastern end of the island is most destitute of water. Here
 in the dry season are no rivers, and, springs being rare, it is the most
arid region.
       The geology of the island is not very complex.            The funda-
 mental rocks are gneisses, both hornblendic and granitoid, belonging,
 like those of north-west Scotland and of north-east America, to the
 earliest Archaean age. These crop out on the hill slopes and in the
 valleys, but do not as a rule form the exposed higher parts of the
 island.     Through this fundamental mass cut felspathic granites of
 varying texture, and containing little besides quartz and felspar, which
  form the central nucleus of fantastic peaks, the highest part of the
  island.    Cutting through both the forementioned series we have other
  granitic rocks, such as minette, felsite, rhyolite, and also basalt and
  diorites, in many places forming large dykes, and in others extensive
  lava flows.     The centres of ejection of these rocks it is impossible
  now    to determine,  and possibly many of them, as in the case of the
   Tertiary volcanic rocks of East Hindostan, have been discharged, not
  from cones, but as outflows from fissures.         Towards the south-east
   end of the island we find them in greatest abundance, and exhibiting
   a very fluidal character.     The date of the eruption of these rocks was
   certainly pre-miocene.      An  indurated shale (argillite) is found in
   some localities, notably on Hadibu plain, and with it a little sand-
   stone of uncertain date, but probably representing the well-known
   Nubian sandstone of carboniferous age. Over all comes a capping of
   limestone, forming plateaux over wide areas, rising in abrupt cliffs two
   or three hundred feet high.      It is generally of a yellowish or whitish
   colour, compact, and sometimes slightly dolomitised.            It contains
   numerous foraminifera, which prove it to be probably of Middle
   Tertiary age, or rather later than that of Sinai and the Arabian shores
    of the Ked Sea. The surface of the limestone over extensive districts
    is rotted and broken into a jagged surface, over which progression
    is by no means easy, whilst at other spots it forms broad smooth
    slabs.   Subsequent to the laying down of the limestone there occurred
    further volcanic disturbance, and the limestone is cut through by
    dykes of basalt and compact trachyte of late Tertiary age.
         The soil resulting from such petrological conditions is corre-
     spondingly varied, correlated with which is a varying character in
    vegetation and scenery.
         In the valleys on the banks of the stream, especially in the granitic
     region, a deep rich red soil is found, and where there is water
     perennially it is covered by a luxuriant growth. As the limestone

             on the Island of Socotra and its Recent Revelations.      305
1883.]
composes the greater part of its superficies the plateau appears barren.
Where, however, tho limestone has rotted, a series of nooks and
crevices     occur, in which, where a soil has collected, an Aloe,
Kalanchoe, or other succulent finds a congenial habitat.      But upon the
limestone plateau, especially at the eastern and western ends of tho
island, occur depressions varying in width from some hundred yards
up to a mile or more, girt on every side by a cavernous limestone
cliff, with perhaps a narrow outlet through it at one or more points.
These, which have all the appearance of lagoons, or at least of
enclosed water-basins, are floored now by a rich red soil on which a
crop of coarse grass, small herbs, and low trees vegetates.         On the
shore plains the soil is light and sandy.
      In its climate Socotra contrasts favourably with the adjacent shores
of Arabia and Africa.
      During the N.E. monsoon, from October to April, it is cool.
 January and February are the most pleasant months.             But during
 the rest of the year it is exceedingly disagreeable.      Eain falls twice
in the year, at the changes of the monsoons, at which time the stream-
 courses are filled with mighty torrents. The temperature of course
 varies much with the altitude, and one may pass in the course of a
 few hours from the tropical heat of the shore plains to the cool
 temperate air of the mountain ranges.        The average temperature on
 the plains in January is said to be about 70°, but in the hotter
 months is as much as 86°. But on the plateaux the temperature at
 nights often goes down to 52°. The higher peaks are, at least in the
 cold season, frequently enshrouded in mists, and at night very heavy
 dews fall.      The climate on the hills is very healthy; but on the
 plains, especially at the changes of monsoons, fever is prevalent.
       Of zoological features one of the most striking is the paucity of
 indigenous mammals.         The antelopes and rodents of the adjacent
 continents are absent from Socotra, and there are but two mammals
 indigenous:      a bat — of which, unfortunately, we did not obtain a
  specimen — and a civet cat.     This latter is a type widely dispersed in
  South Asia and tropical Africa. Rats and mice occur in the villages,
  but are probably introduced. Birds are plentiful, so are lizards,
  and there are some snakes.        The rivers are stocked with fish, and
  in them crabs are also found in abundance.          Land mollusca are, as
  might be expected, frequent, and the whole island teems with insect
  life.
        Considerable interest attached to an investigation of the avifauna
  of Socotra.     It is well known that in several Indian Ocean islands
  large so-called wingless birds formerly existed, several of which have
  become extinct within recent historical time.      The Epiornis of Mada-
  gascar,    the  Dodo   of  Mauritius,  the  Solitaire  of Rodriguez are
  examples.      Vague rumours credited Socotra with the possession of a
  didine bird of like character ; Wellsted in his account of the island
   speaks of it as a Cassowari. Of such a bird no traces exist at present,
  nor could any legendary reference to suoh a bird be discovered.
                                                                  x 2

306                      Professor Bayley Balfour              [April 20,
     As at present known, the avifauna includes forty-three species.
On the shores we find gulls and herons, on the streams wild-duck and
plovers, the date-groves are tenanted by doves and pigeons, whilst all
over the island weaver-birds, chats, shrikes, sunbirds, and sparrows
abound.     Cuckoos and falcons are occasionally met with, whilst in the
vicinity  of  habitations the scavenger-hawk of the East and a carrion
crow are ready to perform their offices. A few quail occur on the
plains.    All the birds except the Passeres, Picarieae, and Columbse,
are of wide distribution.     The Passeres are the most numerous of all,
and include eight species not known from other regions, and two of
these belong to a new type of sparrow — Bhynchostruthus—ch&ra.c-
terised by the massive form of its bill. The sunbird, as might be
expected, is new, and is of interest from having no metallic colouring
on its plumage.      A small lark on the plains has a peculiar plaintive
note, but    the song-bird of the island is a new starling, its melody
equalling that of a thrush.
     The snakes of the island are very peculiar. Of the four species
known three are endemic, and two of them are so distinct as to
form new genera with Asiatic and Mediterranean alliances rather
than African, the fourth is the same as one brought by Tristram
from the shores of the Dead Sea.
     Great interest always attaches to the land and fresh-water mollusca
of a large and ancient island, and in this feature Socotra is not dis-
appointing ; for a very large proportion of the shells are endemic,
and of the genera to which they belong some have a very instructive
distribution.    Thus Otopoma is restricted to the East African islands
and Arabia, Lithidion has the same area but extends to India,
 Cyclotopsis is represented    outside Socotra only in India and the
 Seychelles, whilst Tropidophora is known from Madagascar alone.
     In all other animal groups interesting alliances of similar nature
 are discoverable.
      On account of our scanty knowledge of the fauna of Socotra and
 our still slighter acquaintance with that of the adjacent mainland, it
 is impossible to estimate the proportion of the endemic part of
 the fauna.     But what we do know shows very clearly the strong
 African facies and relation to the faunas of the other African (East)
 islands, and at the same time indicates the occurrence in great force of
 Arabian and S.W. Asiatic forms as well as a clear strain of Indian
 and Eastern resemblances.
      The vegetation of the island varies in aspect with the character of
 the rocks. Starting from the shore one finds no representative of a
 marine phaenogamic vegetation, although in the stagnant brackish
  waters at the mouths of the streams naiads occur.      The coast is not
  favourable for seaweeds, being too shingly and sandy.
      On the dry sandy plains the vegetation typical of the desert
 regions on the mainland reigns; small-leaved, stunted, and woody
 bushes and herbs, often so rigid as to become spiny, or fleshy
 plants without foliage-leaves prevail.    Aromatic odours are a marked

1883.]         on the   Island of Socotra and its Recent Revelations.   307
feature  of many plants, and also the occurrence of gums and resins,
which   in  some cases appear as natural exudations in the form of
tears.   The common desert characteristics of a glaucous grey colora-
tion or a hairy pubescence mark also many of the plants. The flora
of this region is indeed thoroughly that of the Arabo-Saharan type,
such genera being abundant, as Fagonia, Cleome, JErua, Farsetia,
Balsamodendron, Anticharis, Breweria, &c.
    Leaving the plains, and passing to the hill slopes and valleys,
plant life is more vigorous, but in no place sufficiently so to call for
the designation of forest, nor is there anything in the way of fine
timber. But in the valleys, wherever there is any degree of moisture,
small trees of some 20 to 25 feet, with smaller shrubs packed so
densely as to exclude the light from above, linked together by far-
reaching lianes, and underlain by a thick under-scrub of fern and
herb, make an almost impenetrable thicket, and produce a verdure
quite tropical in its luxuriance.   In this district the type of flora is
of the general tropical     old-world  type, having representatives of
such genera as Grewia, Ormocarpum, Diclirostachys, Dirichletia, Lasio-
siphon, &c.
    Once out of the valleys and upon the plateaux the scene is
essentially different.  Wide barren stretches of grey limestone extend
on every side unrelieved, save by an isolated Dracaena, or tree-
Euphorbia of stiff erect habit, looking like the remnant of the vegeta-
tion of some old geological epoch ; or where a lake-like depression,
with its brown earth sparingly coated with green herbage, intervenes.
And again, reaching the higher altitudes on the granitic range, the
vegetation impresses one at once with its sub-temperate character.
The arborescent type has almost entirely disappeared.      Shrubby com-
posites such as species of Psiadia, Pluchea, and Kleinia are found,
and quaint types such as those of Thamnosma                Nirarathamnos
(Umbelliferae), Cephalocroton,   Dorstenia, Adenium,  &c,   are frequent.
Twiggy, narrow-leaved herbs form a dense deep carpet on the soil,
interrupted here and there by a protruding lichen-covered boulder,
and for all the world like the covering of heather on a Scottish moor ;
whilst within the shade of the boulders, or in the moisture of the
overhanging cliffs in the ravines, bright green herbs, such as species
of Galium and Gypsophila, nestle in beds of liverwort and moss, so that
it would require no very great effort to believe one was exploring an
Alpine crag in a temperate region.
     The flora is a pretty extensive one. It comprises, as we know       it,
somewhere about 600 species and varieties of Phsenogams, 20 species
of Vascular Cryptogams, whilst Cellular Cryptogams number about
300 species.     The extent of the flora thus 900 to 1000 species.
                                             is
     Amongst Phsenogams the proportion of Monocotyledons to Dicoty-
ledons    is

they arc not showing above ground.

 308                     Professor Bayley Balfour                  [April  20,
     Of the families most numerously represented, Leguminosce and
  Graminecp each embrace about 1-1 1th of the whole Phaanogams, and
 they are closely followed by Compositce (about l-14th), Acanthacece
and Euphorbiacece (each about l-20th), and Cyperacece (about l-25th).
 Orchidece are represented      by but one species.     Lichenes are most
numerous of Cellular Cryptogams.
     The flora of a continental island such as Socotra is in the main
 interesting in connection with the geographical distribution of plants
and the working out of the history of their migrations over the face of
the globe.      But in the flora now under discussion there are a
number of special features in individual plants well deserving of
attention, and   I may now notice some of them.
     Of plants striking as having brilliant flowers may be noted the
Adenium, from which Aden is said to derive its name ; a tuberous
Begonia, which has been introduced into horticulture ; a fragrant
Crinum, species of Exacum, Buellia, Jasminum, &c.          Few wild plants
yield edible fruits. The jujube is alone abundant.
     On morphological grounds there falls to be noticed firstly Den-
drosicyos socotrana, known to the inhabitants as the camhane tree,
a new genus of Cucurbitaceas.         This plant differs from the ordinal
characters in being a tree with a stem often four or five feet in
diameter at the base, rapidly tapering, and forming a very soft juicy
wood.     Another plant of interest, on morphological grounds, is a
small tree bearing a fruit like a pomegranate, but instead of having
the double row of carpels characteristic of the true Punica granatum,
there is but a single whorl.         Can this be the primitive type of
the Pomegranate ? Another morphologically interesting plant is a
Menisperm, a Cocculus, which differs from the ordinal type in being a
hard erect undershrub, with cladodes and short spiny branches.
     Of plants interesting for their products we have several in Soeotra.
Amongst them the first place is claimed by the Dragon's-blood tree,
Draccena Cinnabari.      The dragon's-blood of commerce at the present
time is, as is well known, the product of Calamus Draco of Sumatra.
But the Socotran gum-resin is the old KLwdfSapL mentioned by Dios-
corides. It is known on the island as edah ; amongst the Arabs it is
Mtir. The plant is endemic, and nearly allied to the D. Draco of
Teneriffe.   From the other gum-resin-producing species, D. Ombet
of Abyssinia and D. schizantha of Somali-land, of which we have as
yet but imperfect knowledge, it is apparently quite distinct.            The
gum-resin exudes in tears from the      stem  of the tree,  and is  collected
after the rains ; the gatherer chipping off the tears into goat-skins.
There are three forms in which the gum-resin is exported.           Of these
edah amsello — the tears as they exude from the tree — is the purest
kind is called edah dukhah.

                                 It consists of the small chips and frag-
ments of the tears which have been broken off in separating the gum-
tears from the tree, or by attrition ; it sells at one dollar for 4 lbs.
The cheapest is the edah muJcdehah, which brings a dollar for 5 lbs.,

  and is very impure.     It is in the form of small flat- sided masses, and
  consists of fragments of gum-resin and refuse of the gatherings
 melted together into a flat cake, and then broken up into smaller
 portions.
     Of other gum-resin-produciDg trees on the island, the frankincense
 and myrrh tree s must be noticed.       I have already referred to the dis-
 cussion that has taken place regarding the incense country of the
 ancients.    The Hadramaut country is the incense region par excellence,
 and to its kings Socotra is said to have been subject.          But Socotra
                                                                             "

                            "
 the " Isles of the Sea        of the Old   Testament.     Now   we find the
 genus Boswellia, which yields frankincense (olibanum), represented in
Socotra by no less than three species, all of which are endemic, and
 possibly there is a fourth, and as there are only three other known
 species of the genus, all of which save one are Somali-land plants, the
 proportion occurring in Socotra is very large. The commonest
 frankincense in the island is the ameero, but it is not much exported.
      Of myrrh plants Socotra possesses no less a share. Besides the
                                                                       "
 Balsamodendron      Mukul which yields the " Indian bdellium — the
 googul or muhul of the Arabians, — there are probably five other species
 of the genus on the island. Possibly one of these is the Arabian
 B. opobalsamum, the true myrrh plant. The myrrh collected is
 termed leggehen, and is said to be exported.
     So far then as the occurrence of frankincense and myrrh pro-
ducing trees is evidence, Socotra may well be the To Nuter of Theban
monuments ; for probably no area of equal extent has so many
peculiar forms.
     Probably the most important plant of the island, so far as pro-
ducts are concerned, is the Aloe Perryi which yields the " Socotrine
 aloes" of commerce.        The gum is known as tdyef by the natives;
the Arabs call it sobr.        Although this kind of aloes has been so
 long known, and has the reputation of being finer than either
 Barbadoes or Cape aloes, it is only within the past few years that the
character of the plant has been made known.             It grows abundantly
on the island, especially on the limestone plateaux.           The collection
of the gum is a very simple process, and can be accomplished at any
season.     The collector scrapes a slight hollow on the surface of the
ground in the vicinity of an aloe-plant, into which he depresses the
centre of a small portion of goat-skin spread over the ground.           The
leaves of the aloe are then cut and laid in a circle on the skin, with
the cut ends projecting over the central hollow.         Two or three layers
are arranged.       The juice, which is of a pale amber colour with a
sweet, slightly mawkish odour and taste, flows from the leaves into
the goat-skin.      After about three hours the leaves are exhausted;
the skin is removed from beneath them, and the contained juice
transferred to a mussock.         Only the older leaves are used. The
juice thus collectod is of a thin watery character, and is known as

tdyef rhiho, or watery aloes.              In this condition it is exported to
Muscat and Arabia, and sells for three dollars the skin of 30 lbs.
By keeping, however, the aloes changes in character.                      After a month
the juice gets, by loss of water,            denser   and    more    viscid   ; it is then
known as tdyef gesheeshah, and is more valuable — a skin of 30 lbs.

 to allow of an experimental trial of this as                 a material for woodcuts
or other purposes.          I learn from Dr. Schweinfurth, that he has sent
 some     to  Berlin   to  be   tried in this way. Should the wood prove
 serviceable,     it requires no special mention to indicate how valuable
 this product may become, in view of the exhaustion of the boxwood
forests (of which we hear so much) in the S.E. of Europe.

       Surveying the flora from the point of view of its relations and
 development, we shall consider the Phaenogams alone.                          The limita-
 tions of genera          and   species amongst          Cellular     Cryptogams — the
 Thallophytes in particular         —  are so uncertain that they afford no basis
 for comparisons. And must also state that in making statistical esti-
                            I
 mates of the relations of the flora, one can only do so in the most
 general way, as our knowledge of the flora itself                      is not complete,
 and then we know so very little            of  that  of  the  adjacent mainlands.
       Of the 600 species and varieties of Phaenogams, which are com-
 prised in 81 natural orders, and in 324 genera, about 200 are endemic,
i.  e. endemic species are to non-endemic ones in the proportion of about
1    to3.    This proportion        is   greater than         found in the Seychelles

 Madagascar       flora,   wherein     Mr.   Baker     makes     the  proportion     nearly
1   to 2.    The  endemic    species    and  varieties   are   referable   to   143 genera,
 and of these         proportion to the whole genera of the flora of about
                      a

  Ocean Islands, but falls far short of Madagascar, where                    it   is to1    7.
        The species     which    are   not   endemic     are   almost    all   referable   to
  genera of considerable         dispersion,     and   of   the   species  themselves     we
  find that about l-4th are cosmopolitan in the Tropics, many of them

weeds    of cultivation.    A large proportion, about l-3rd, are species
belonging     to  Tropical Africa and Tropical Asia.           The greater
number of these are limited to the plain region of North-East
Africa, and South-West Asia, reaching as far as Scindh and
Afghanistan, and there forming part of the great desert flora.       But a
few extend into the Indian Peninsula itself, even reach the Malay-
Archipelago, or spread into Australia (the latter form about 1-1 3th of
the whole third).       Westwards we find an extension of a considerable
proportion of this third (about l-8th), passing to the Mediterranean
region and the Canary Islands, whilst some (about l-6th) reach the
Cape de Verde Islands.        Of the remainder of the non-endemic flora,
a fair proportion (about l-16th) are found in Tropical Africa alone,
chiefly in Abyssinia, and a smaller proportion (about l-20th) are
natives of Asia, chiefly Arabia, but are not African. A few are re-
stricted to South Africa, a few are Indian alone, one is Mascarene
and Indian, and one is Gorgonian.
     In the endemic flora we find many plants of very antiquated
types.    These occur especially on the hill regions of Haghier.      Such
are Draccena, tree Euphorbia, Euryops, Aloe, Thamnosma, Cocculus,
Dendrosicyos,     &c.   We find also a fair number of genera whose
maximum development takes place in temperate regions. Of the
genera comprising this flora about 2-5ths have a wide tropical range, a
fair number are common to Tropical Africa and Asia, and a few are
chiefly Mediterranean.       Amongst those having restricted distribution
may be noted three, Diceratella, Taverniera and Anisotes, which are
small genera of the plains of South-West Asia.               Campy lanthus,
represented     at Aden,    has a  single species  in the Cape de Verde
Islands.    Three genera are essentially Tropical African — Cephalo-
croton, Eureiandra, and Camptoloma, and of these the last two are
ditypic and found only in Angola. Graderia and Babiana are genera
not found beyond the limits of South Africa ; whilst Lasiocarys is a
South African genus having a single representative in Abyssinia, and
Euryops is a South African one, with one species in Arabia.
    The only purely Indian genus is the ditypic Priotropis.
    The occurrence in Indian Ocean islands of restricted New World
types or of forms related to these is a remarkable and well-known fact
of distribution. We have for example the Sapotaceous Labourdonnaisia
represented in Natal, Mascarene Islands, and Cuba ; the Laurineous
Ocotea with representatives in Canary Islands, South Africa, and
Madagascar, its main distribution being American ; and the Eodri-
guesian Mathurina        with its nearest ally the Central American
Erblichia.    In Socotra we have illustrations of the same peculiarity.
The Eutaceous genus Thamnosma is otherwise represented in Cali-
fornia by one species and in Texas by another, and its occurrence is
the more remarkable as with the exception of Peganum it is the only
genus of true Rues found in the New World.           Amongst the endemic
genera we have a like feature, for the Verbenaceous Conlocarpum is
almost congeneric with the tropical and sub-tropical American

    To summarise the features presented by the PhaBnogamic flora of
the Island of Socotra, we may say : —
      1.      It   is that of     a   continental island and presents features of great
antiquity.
     2. Relative proportion of orders to genera and of these to species
is large.
     3. There are few annuals.
     4. It possesses much individuality and further exhibits three
distinct elements, (a) of a dry parched region, (6) of a moister tropical
region,       of cooler and more temperate region.
                   (c)   a
     5. Its affinities are essentially Tropical African and Asian, but the
African element predominates, and in the African element we find in
great force the features of the flora of the mountainous region of
Abyssinia, West Tropical Africa and South Africa, and also of
Madagascar. This element of the flora too        that of the higher regions

     It may not be out of place to conclude these introductory remarks
 with     reference to what may be learned from the biological and
           a
 physical features of the past history of the island and the changes                   it
 has undergone, and the way in which the features as we now see them
have come to be.
      The position of the island would a priori lead one to expect that                it
had formerly been        part of Africa.
                                  a        This     undoubtedly has been,

indeed, with Madagascar,     to be regarded as  the  remains of    greatly   a
advanced African coast-line at         remote period.
                                                 a       This connection
with the mainland explains the general African affinities of its fauna
and flora     but there remains the problem of the South and West
                    ;
African relations for elucidation.       The botanical features of Africa
have long excited investigation and speculation. The Cape flora, as                    is
well known,       one of isvery old and highly specialised type, and in
                                       a
Northern Africa and Western Europe there are many plants in the
flora which, as Mr. Bentham has pointed out, are very nearly allied
to corresponding Cape species.        Again, on the east side of Africa
one finds on the Abyssinian hills and the range stretching south,
a    vegetation distinctly South African. Further, on the Cameroon
Mountains and Fernando Po there are not many characteristic
 Cape types, but what there are, are identical with species of the
Abyssinian hills. The relations and similarities of the floras of
 these different regions would all seem to point to the conclusion
 first promulgated by Sir Joseph Hooker, that the South African
 flora has been continued along the highlands of East Africa from

1883.J         on the   Island of Socotra and its Becent Bevelations.             313
 Natal to Abyssinia, and in like manner that there was a connec-
 tion between the western region about Biafra and the Abyssinian
 district.    It would appear probable that at a time when the tropical
 zone was much cooler than it now           is,
                                           the northern forms of plant life
 spread    over South Africa, but with the  diminution of the cold of the
 glacial epoch they were driven back     and   retreated northwards,    few   a
 types left on the higher regions being the only evidence of the
 invasion and the survivors of the hordes extinguished.         Thus at the
 present day on the higher lauds of Abyssinia, West Africa, and in
 South Africa, we have the fragmentary traces of the extension of an old
 African flora, and of this flora Socotra would appear to exhibit on its
hills the most north-easterly limit, just as Madagascar and perhaps
the Mascarene Islands show the most easterly extension.
     The African affinities being so explained, what of the Indian and
Asiatic    ?   The higher level of the land necessary to unite Socotra
and Madagascar with the African continent,               continued over
                                                         if                        a
slightly wider area, would produce some interesting changes in
surface features.     Africa would be joined to Arabia, the Persian Gulf
would cease to exist, and the Tigris and Euphrates, united in one
 stream, would pour their waters through         delta occupying much of
                                                  a
the Arabian Sea, and through which also the Indus would debouch.
Thus  a     means of transit for the migration of Indo-Malayan types
would be afforded.      That some such connection as this did formerly
exist all evidence conclusively shows, and that by this route migration
took place      isequally certain, and we have thus an explanation of
Indo-Malayan affinities in Socotra and in Africa, without calling in
                                                                       "

brought about the present surface features in this region,            clear

that the separation of Africa from Asia and the formation of the
straits of Bab-el-Mandeb took place before the final isolation of
Socotra.
   Australian affinities are explained on the same lines as are the
Asiatic but when we come to deal with the American we touch
         ;                                                                         a
matter of which at present we can give no adequate explanation.
That the many forms identical generically in the Indian Ocean
Islands and in America are sprung from one stock of great antiquity
must be admitted, but whether the migrations which have led to their
occurrence now in such antipodean regions were directed in an easterly
or ina  westerly direction,    one of those problems of which we have
                                 is
not yet the materials for    solution.

earliest geological epochs but in brief some, such as this, may be
                                  ;
sketched.   During the Carboniferous epoch there was in the region
of Socotra     shallow sea, in which was deposited on the top of the
               a
fundamental gneisses of this spot — which had ere now been certainly

much seamed and fractured by volcanic outbursts — the sandstone of
which we have such a large development in Nubia.            This sea sub-
sequently deepened, allowing the formation of the shales, which now
constitute the argillite of the island. During the Permian, Socotra
may have been a land surface, forming part of the great mass of land
which probably existed in the region at that epoch.         In early and
middle Tertiary times, when the Indian peninsula was an island,
and the sea which stretched into Europe washed the base of the
Himalayan hills, Socotra was probably under water, and the great
mass of its limestone was deposited ; but it is quite possible that at
this epoch its higher peaks were still above water.         Thereafter it
gradually rose, undergoing violent volcanic disturbance, and again
possibly became part of the mainland, though it is likely for only a
short period, and subsequently it reverted to its insular condition, in
which state it has remained.
     An island, then, from Tertiary times, the various denuding agents
have during that time sculptured its surface in the fantastic manner
we see at the present day ; and the fauna and flora have lost many
of the old types which linked them with their primitive stock,
retaining, however, some few as records of their origination, and at
the same time have developed new and replacing forms, which are in
their turn undergoing modification.

          Sir William Siemens, D.C.L. LL.D. F.E.S. M.B.L
             Some of  the Questions involved in Solar Physics.
The lecturer introduced his subject by drawing attention to the cir-
cumstance that the idea of the sun being an exceedingly hot body
was of very modern date ; that both ancient and modern writers up
to the early portion of the present century attributed to him a
glorious and supernatural faculty of endowing us with light and heat
of the degree necessary for our well-being ; whilst even Sir William
Herschel had attempted to find an explanation in justification of the
time-honoured conception that the body of the sun might be at a low
temperature and inhabitable by beings similar to ourselves, which he
did in surrounding the inhabitable surface by a non-conducting atmo-
sphere — the penumbra— to separate it from the scorching influence of
the exterior photosphere.
    It was not till the views of Kant, the philosopher, had been
developed by La Place, the astronomer, in his famous
                                                               '
                                                                 Mecanique
Celeste,' that the opinion gained ground that our central orb was a
mass of matter in a state of incandescence,         representing such an
enormous aggregate as to enable it to continue radiation into space
for an almost indefinite period of time.
    The lecturer illustrated by means of a diagram the fact that of all
the heat radiated away from the sun, only g^ oooooo TT P ar * cou ld fall
upon the surface of our earth, vegetation and force of every kind
being attributable to this radiation; whilst all but this fractional
proportion apparently went to waste.
    Recent developments of scientific research had enabled us to know
much more of the constitution of the sun and other heavenly bodies
than had formerly been possible.           Comte says in his 'Positive
Philosophy'     (Martineau's translation of 1853) that "amongst tho
things impossible for us ever to know was that of telling what were
                                                      "
the materials of which the sun was composed ;            but within only
seven years of that time Messrs. Bunsen and Kirchhoff published
their famous research, showing that by connecting the dark Fraun-
hofer lines of the solar spectrum with the bright lines observed in the
spectra of various metals, it was possible to prove the existence of
those substances in the solar photosphere, thus laying the foundation
of spectrum analysis, the greatest achievement of modern science.

316                          Sir William  Siemens                [April 27,
Dr. Huggins and others, applying this mode of research to other
heavenly bodies, including the distant nebulas, had extended our
chemical knowledge of them in a measure truly marvellous.
     Solar observation had thus led to an analytical method by which
chemistry had been revolutionised ; and it would be, in the lecturer's
opinion, through solar observation that we should attain to a much
more perfect conception of the nature and effect of radiant energy in
its three forms of heat, light, and actinism, than we could as yet
boast of.     The imperfection of our knowledge in this respect was
proved by the circumstance that whereas some astronomers and
physicists, including Waterston, Secchi, and Ericsson, had, in following
Sir Isaac Newton's hypothesis, attributed to the sun a temperature of
several millions of degrees Centigrade, others, including Pouillet and
Vicaire, in following Dulong and Petit, had fixed it below 1500° C.
Between these two extremes, other determinations, based upon different
assumptions, had fixed the solar temperature at between 60,000° and
9000°.
     The lecturer having conceived a process by which solar energy
may be thought to a certain extent self-sustaining, had felt much
interested for some years in the question of solar temperature.           If
the temperature of the solar photosphere should exceed 3000° C,
combustion of hydrogen would be prevented by the law of dissocia-
tion, as enunciated by Bunsen and Sainte Claire Deville ; and his
speculative views regarding thermal maintenance must fall to the
ground. To test the question, he in the first place mounted a
parabolic reflector on a heliostat with a view of concentrating solar
rays within its focus, which, barring comparatively small losses by
absorption in the atmosphere and in the metallic substance of the
reflector, should reproduce approximately the solar temperature.         By
introducing   a rod of carbon   through a  hole at the apex of the reflector
until it reached the focus, its tip became vividly luminous, producing
a light comparable to electric light.           When a gas burner was
arranged in such a way that the gas flame played across the focal area,
combustion appeared to be retarded, but was not arrested, showing
that the utmost temperature attained in the focus did not exceed
materially that producible in a Deville oxy-hydrogen furnace, or in
the lecturer's regenerative gas furnace, in which the limit of dissocia-
tion is also reached.
     Having thus far satisfied himself, his next step was to ascertain
 whether terrestrial sources of radiant energy were capable of imitating
 solar action in effecting the decomposition of carbonic acid and aqueous
vapour in the leaf-cells of plants, which led him to undertake a series
 of researches on electro-horticulture, extending over three years, a
 subject he had brought before the Eoyal Society and the Eoyal
 Institution two years ago. By these researches he had proved that
 the electric arc possessed not only all the rays necessary to plant-life,

glass,  which, as Professor Stokes had shown, produced this effect
without interference with the yellow and other luminous and intense
heat rays.     He next endeavoured to estimate the solar temperature
by instituting a comparison between the spectra due to different
known luminous intensities.          Starting with the researches of Pro-
fessor Tyndall on radiant energy, supplementing them by experiments
of his own on electric arcs of great power, and calling to his aid
Professor Langley, of the Alleghany Observatory, to produce for him
a complete spectrum of an Argand burner, he concluded that with
the temperature of a radiant source, the proportion of luminous rays
increased in a certain ratio ; whereas in an Argand gas burner only
2J per cent, of the rays emitted were luminous and mostly red and
yellow, the most brilliant portion of a gas flame emitted 4 per cent.,
as shown by Tyndall, the carbon thread of an incandescent electric
light between 5 and 6 per cent., a small electric arc 10 per cent.,
and in a powerful 5000-candle electric arc as much as 25 per cent,
of the total radiation was of the luminous kind. Professor Langley,
in taking his photometer and bolometer up the Whitley mountains,
 18,000 feet high, had proved that of the solar energy not more than
 25 per cent, was luminous, and that the loss of solar energy sustained
between our atmosphere and the sun was chiefly of the ultra-violet
 kind.   These rays, if they penetrated our atmosphere, would render
 vegetation impossible, as proved by the lecturer's own experiments
above referred to.       It was thus shown that the temperature of the
 solar photosphere could not materially exceed that of a powerful
electric arc, or, indeed, of the furnaces previously alluded to, leading
 him to the conclusion already foreshadowed by Sainte Claire Deville,
 and accepted by Sir William Thomson, that the solar temperature
 could not exceed 3000° C. The energy emitted from a source much
 exceeding this limit would no longer be luminous, but consist mainly
 of ultra-violet rays, rendering the sun invisible, but scorching and
 destructive of all life.       The accompanying diagram (Fig. 1) of the
 spectra alluded to shows clearly the gradual advance of the luminous
 band, as marked by the letters A to H.
     Not satisfied with these inferential proofs, the lecturer had endea-
 voured to establish a definite ratio between temperature and radiation,
 which formed the subject of a very recent communication to the Royal
 Society.* The experiment consisted in heating, by means of an electric
 current, a platinum or iridio-platinum wire, a metre long, and sus-
 pended between binding screws, as shown in the accompanying
 sketch (Fig. 2) ; the energy of the current was measured by two instru-
 ments — an electro-dynamometer, giving it in amperes, and a galvano-
 meter of high resistance giving the electro-motive force between
 the same points in volts.         The product of the two readings gave
 the volt-amperes, or Watts of energy communicated to the wire, and
 dispersed from it by radiation and convection.              A reference to the

lecturer's paper on the Electrical Resistance Thermometer, which
formed the Bakerian Lecture of the Boyal Society in 1871, would
show that the varying electro-motive force in volts observed on the
galvanometer was a true index of the temperature of the wire while
being heated by the passage of the current. By combining his former
experiments on the dependence of resistance upon temperature, with
his recent one, a law of increase of radiation with temperature was
established experimentally up to the melting-point of platinum ; this,
when laid down in the form of a diagram, gave very consistent results
expressible by the simple formula
                             Rad tn =Mt 2 -\-(pt,
M being    a coefficient due to substance radiating ; an expression repre-
sented in the accompanying diagram (Fig. 3), in which the abscissa?
represent energy dispersed and the ordinates the corresponding
temperatures.
     Sir William Thomson had lately shown that the total radiating
energy from a unit of surface of the carbon of the incandescent lamp
amounted to eV^ n P ar * °^ * ne energy emitted from the same area of
the solar photosphere, and taking the temperature of the incandescent
carbon at 1800° C. (the melting-point of platinum, which can just be
heated to the same point), it follows in applying Sir William Thom-
son's deductions to the lecturer's formula that the solar photosphere
does not exceed 2700° C, or, adding for absorption of energy between
us and the sun, about 2800° C, a temperature already arrived at
by the lecturer by a different method.        The character of the curve
was that of a parabola slightly tipped forward, and if the ratio given
by that curve held good absolutely beyond the melting-point of
platinum, it would lead to the conclusion that at a point exceeding
3000° C. radiation would become, as it were, explosive in its character,
rendering a surface temperature beyond that limit physically difficult
to conceive.
     Clausius had proved that the temperature obtainable in a focus
could never exceed that of the radiating surface, and Sainte Claire
Deville that the point of dissociation of compound vapours rises with
the density of the vapour atmosphere.      Supposing interstellar space to
be filled with a highly attenuated compound vapour, it would clearly
be possible to effect its dissociation at any point where, by the concen-
tration of solar rays, a sufficient focal temperature could be estab-
 lished ; but it was argued that the higher temperature observable in a
focal sphere was the result only of a greater abundance of those solar
vibrations called rays within a limited area, the intensity of each
vibration being the outcome of the source whence it emanated : thus,
 in the focal field of a large reflector the end of a poker could bo
 heated to the welding-point, whereas in that of a small reflector the
 end of a very thin piece of wire only could be raised to the same tem-
 perature. If, however, a single molecule of vapour not associated or
 pressed upon by other molecules could be sent through the one focus

 1883.]      on some of  the Questions involved in Solar Physics.       321
or the other, dissociation in obedience to Dcville's law must take place
irrespective of the focal area ; but, inasmuch as the single solar ray-
represented the same potential of energy or period of vibration as nume-
rous rays associated in a focus, it seemed reasonable that it should be
as capable of dealing with the isolated molecule as a mere accumulation
of the same within a limited space, and must therefore possess the
same dissociating influence.     Proceeding on these premises, the lecturer
had procured tubes filled with highly attenuated vapours, and had
observed that an exposure of the tubes to the direct solar rays or to
the arc of a powerful electric light effected its partial or entire dis-
sociation ; the quantity of matter contained within such a tube was
too slight to be ameuable to direct chemical test, but the change
operated by the light could be clearly demonstrated by passing an
electric discharge through two similar tubes, one of which had, and
the other had not, been exposed to the radiant energy from a source
of high potential.     If  space could be thought filled with such vapour,
of which there was much evidence in proof, solar rotation would
 necessarily have the effect of emitting such vapour equatorially by an
 action of circulation which might be likened to that of a blowing
 fan.   When reaching the solar photosphere,           by virtue of solar
 gravitation this dissociated vapour would, owing to its increased
 density, flash into flame, and could thus be made to account in great
 measure for the maintenance of solar radiation, whilst its continual
 dissociation in space would account for the continuance of solar radia-
 tion into space without producing any measurable calorific effect.
      Time did not permit him to enter more fully into these subjects,
 which formed part of his solar hypothesis, his main object on this
 occasion having been to elucidate the point of cardinal importauce to
 that hypothesis, that of the solar temperature.

                         Weather Knowledge   in 1883.
 Rather    more than   ten years since I had  the honour of delivering    a
 Friday Evening Lecture in this Theatre, and my subject on that
 occasion was somewhat similar to that which       I  have chosen for this
 evening.    It was  then   " Recent Progress   in  Weather    Knowledge,"
 and to-night   I must endeavour to lay before you the results of ten
 years' further experience of a work of which the complexity becomes
 daily more patent.
     Dealing first with the forecasting of the character of seasons.
 In 1873 the theory of a connection between the Frequency of Sun-
 spots and the Weather had been recently promulgated, and appeared
 to promise most valuable results.       It is universally admitted that
the presence of spots on the solar surface indicates increased activity
in his gaseous envelope, which ought to and must affect our atmo-
sphere.
     A connection between the Frequency of Sun-spots and the preva-
lence of Hurricanes in the Indian Ocean was the first phenomenon
which was cited as a proof that such influence is traceable, and the
statistics brought forward appeared to confirm the idea.       The period-
icity of Rainfall was the next subject studied, and as an outcome of the
changes in rainfall distribution the recurrence of Famines has furnished
the text for numerous reports and pamphlets.         Another subject dealt
with has been Temperature, but as to this, one set of investigators
holds that years of sun-spot frequency correspond to years of excessive
heat, while another set maintains that they correspond to years of
excessive cold !
     This discordance has been somewhat allayed by the suggestion
that the causes which produce heat in one region produce cold in
another.    On the whole, however, it may be said that the precise mode
in which the sun exercises his action on our atmosphere has not as
yet been explained, and as far as the climate of Western Europe is
concerned, the warmest adherents of sun-spot influence must admit
that observations of the condition of the sun's surface cannot as yet
be depended on as a sound basis for prophecy of coming weather.

     The second column gives the mean temperature of the entire
United Kingdom for the six months October — March, for the last
seven years, and the third gives the number of sun-spots observed
at Kew during the same period.
     No approach to concordance is traceable between the two columns
of figures.
     If we go further afield and compare the general temperature of
the globe, at least the closest approximation to it which is attainable,
with the sun-spot curve for the thirty-five years ending with 1875, as
has been done by Dr. Koppen,* we see that though for some part
of the time some of the temperature curves appear to agree with the
curve of sun-spots, the accordance in one hemisphere is associated with
a striking discordance in the other.          (Fig. 1, p. 325.)
     The figures which         I have cited therefore support the statement
that the precise nature of the relation between what we may call
solar and terrestrial weather has not as yet been demonstrated.
     As regards the whole question of prediction of the Seasons, either
by sun-spots or by any other means, the same author, Dr. Koppen, has
published several papers " On Protracted Periods of Weather," devoting
his attention especially to severe winters, and he gives the following
summary of his results : — f
     " The main feature of the entire investigation has been to prove
that, for certain intervals, strongly marked periodical influences make
 their appearance and then vanish entirely, at times being replaced by
others of a totally different character. No law has as yet been
 discovered for these changes, and so the outcome of the enquiry is on
the whole negative and indicates that all forecasting of the seasons is
                             "
 the merest guesswork.
     We may therefore conclude that at the present date there is no

logists by the demand of the public to see in the newspapers some

    The brilliant successes achieved in this line by the Chief Signal
Office at Washington have attracted general notice, and the public of
every nation in Europe has expected that their own offices shall do
as much for them as that of Washington does for the States of the
Union.
   The public has, however, naturally forgotten to take into consider-
ation             several most                     important advantages                                which the Signal              Office

326                           Mr. R. H. Scott                      [May  4,
enjoys over its compeers.      Firstly, an extensive continent from which
to gather its reports, with one language and one telegraphic system ;
secondly, a military organisation, which ensures due training and
proper subordination of the employes to their chiefs ; and thirdly and
finally, a most liberal supply of funds.
      In all these particulars European systems fall far behind that of
the United States.       Our continent is not large, and it is cut up by
inland seas like the Mediterranean and the Baltic, while for us
in these islands, the ocean lies to the westward, and from that we can
at present gather no reports.
      Moreover, the difference of languages and habits between the
different states has been found, hitherto, to present insuperable difficul-
ties to the introduction of an absolutely uniform system of reporting.
     To take one instance of the difficulty of organising weather reports
in Europe, information as to the state of Sea Disturbance on our
shores is justly considered one of the most important observations for
our coast observers, but when we came to devise an international code
for reporting,, we found that inland organisations, such as that of
Austria, objected to setting apart any space in the code for such, to
them, uninteresting details.
     My audience will therefore see that it is not easy for us Europeans
to devise a system of weather reporting which shall meet with
universal acceptance.
       Again, supposing that the code were satisfactorily arranged as
regards the reports of instrumental observations, it is found to be
practically impossible to organise a system of notices of the general
appearance of the sky and the weather, in fact, of the very indications
 which are the most valuable of all to the skilled weather watcher.
      Here is the crowning defect of all centralised weather services
 like our own ; the forecaster, situated at a distance of some hundred
 miles from his most important stations, has to draw his conclusions at
 second hand, from information at best scanty for each station,
 frequently unpunctual in its arrival, and also at times entirely deficient
 at the most critical moment, owing to interruptions in telegraphic
 communication during stormy weather.
      The only practical mode of partially overcoming this difficulty of
 excessive centralisation, would entail very considerable expense.       It
 would be the maintenance in the chief centres of population, of local
 offices, charged with the preparation of forecasts for their own special
                         I
 neighbourhoods, and fear that neither the Government nor the local
 authorities would give money for such an experiment.
      No serious attempt at local forecasting is made in Europe, except
 by   one German newspaper, the Magdeburger Zeitung, for the scheme
 started in France by Leverrier shortly before his death, of local
 forecasting by experts appointed by the Communal Authorities, was
 speedily brought to a stop after his death by a demand from the French
 Postal Authorities for the repayment of the expense of telegraphy.
      We are thus obliged to forecast for the whole country, and as the

   various portions of these islands are variously circumstanced as
   regards proximity to the sea, and as to the mountainous or flat
   character of their surface, an attempt has been made to group the
   counties together into a series of districts, the boundaries of which are
   determined by the general character of the agriculture most developed
   within tliem.    Thus the western districts are mainly grass producing,
   while the eastern are corn producing.
       This division is necessarily more or less of an arbitrary nature,
  as the separation between a grazing and an arable region is not a
  hard and fast line, and of course a driving shower does not cease to
  fall on crossing a couuty boundary. But supposing a forecast is
  drawn up for any one district, it is necessarily limited by the
  exigencies    of telegraphy to a very few words, and it is simply
  impossible to frame it so as to be correct for the whole of the
  district.   If  there is a range of hills crossing the country, the wind
  which produces rain on the weather slope of the ridge brings dry
  weather to its lee side.       This is a consequence of the well-known
  principle, that air forced to rise over an obstacle like a hill, is cooled
  at the rate of about 1° F. for every 300 feet, and is also expanded
  by the pressure on it being reduced.        Both of these actions reduce its
  capacity for containing moisture in the state of vapour, and rain is
  produced as the air ascends.          Once it has crossed the ridge the
 reverse action takes place, the air is heated and compressed by
 descent.     It thus becomes capable of containing more moisture, and
is felt as a warm and dry wind.
      To give an instance of this action on a somewhat large scale,          I
 may cite the district of Elgin and Nairnshire, on the south coast of
 the Moray Firth.          This comparatively flat area is bounded on the
 south and south-east by the Grampians, and on the west by the hills
 of Inverness-shire and Boss-shire, and all the air from the south and
 west has had to travel up a series of successive hill sides on its
passage from the Atlantic.           The result is, that the region    I have
 named has a rainfall not more than one half that of the upper valleys
 of the Grampians, and yet it is situated in the same district for fore-
 casting. Such is the exceptionally dry character of this strip of
 coast, that one summer a friend of mine who has a fishing on the
 Spey told me that for some weeks while the river was in spate,
showing that rain fell on the hills, and the fishermen out in the Firth
had rain almost every night, not a drop fell at Nairn
      My hearers will therefore perceive that the same wording will
not suit a whole district, unless it be judiciously phrased so as to
bear more than one interpretation.
      The figures which       I  give in Table I. are obtained in a very
general way ;     the  forecast for the district is tested by as many reports
from that district as are available.          This mode, therefore, gives a
higher figure for correctness than would be obtained by testing them
for a single place.
     The second series of figures, in Table II. however, are obtained by

a different method, and one which is comparatively free from the
objection just stated, as the observers who furnish the data are quite
independent of the office, and the forecast is tested by the weather
they themselves experience.

 office from its own data.
      I find, on enquiry, from all the European offices which issue
 forecasts, that the percentages of success which they claim officially
 are almost identical with that shown on the diagrams.          They arc on
the whole about 80, but no one       is really  contented   with  the results.
 The critics of foreign forecasts are just as severe on their own systems
as the writers of newspaper letters are on us over here, and as one of
my correspondents, the gentleman who manages the Magdeburg office
 remarks, those who are least content are the forecasters themselves,
though naturally they do not publish their dissatisfaction.
      To give my audience one illustration out of many of the difficulty
                                                         I
of our task in England, the same gentleman whom have just quoted
Bays :
         " Our greatest trouble is the lateness of arrival of the English
telegrams, and, without news from England, no one in Germany can
dream of forecasting."        Now we, in these islands, as is so often said,
can apparently never hope for daily telegraphic news from signal
ships in the Atlantic, so that ocean must keep its wonted silence, and
our forecasting must be even more hazardous than that of our German
neighbours.
      Another development of forecasting, and in fact its earliest form,
the desire to carry out which gave rise to the whole system of
weather telegraphy, and as a result of the latter, to the science of
Modern Meteorology, is the issue of Storm Warnings.               These were
instituted in this country by FitzEoy, in 1866.           They   were tempo-
rarily suspended at Christmas 1866 and resumed a year later, and the
diagram gives the average results for the entire United Kingdom,
from the year 1870, being the first year for which the figures were
regularly submitted to Parliament.          The interval of twelve years
divides    itself naturally  into two periods of equal length, the break
between which happens to coincide with the institution of an evening,
in addition to the afternoon service of reports.
      This was carried on, in the first instance, at the sole cost of the
 Times newspaper,       and in order to furnish materials for drawing
the chart in its morning issue, and it is only within the last three years
that the expense of this part of our work has been borne by the
Government.
      The figures show at the first glance an improvement of 8 per cent,
in the first column, and this is a considerable advance, but my
audience must not take away the idea that if the receipt of four hours'
later intelligence raises the percentage of success, we might anticipate
the possibility of warning the coasts for all storms, if the reporting
hours were extended to midnight, or the service were even con-
tinuous.
      The extension of the reporting service would enable us in London
to know what was taking place on the coasts far better than we do,
but we could not impart our knowledge to those whom we wish to
benefit.     Practically, storm warnings must be issued before sundown,

330                            Mr. B. H. Scott                               [May 4,
for no port at present will bear the expense of maintaining lamps for
night signals.     If we allow an hour or so for the warning message to
reach the distant stations, and most of them take much longer than
that, we see that in winter a warning to a Scotch port must leave
London at 2 p.m. to be in time to be communicated by signal.
Warnings issued at 7 p.m. rarely come to the fisherman's knowledge
till next morning, even if they should reach the telegraph station
before that office closes for the night. .
     Accordingly the figures in the table give a somewhat too favourable
idea of our real success in warning.

     The diagram also does not show the storms which have been
missed.      Of these there are instances every year. That of October
23-4, 1882, was a most striking case. The storm came on so suddenly,
not setting in at any station before midnight, and raging with full
fury at 8 a.m., that with our present knowledge it appears to have
been impossible to have caught it.
                                             I
     It would take me too long were to continue this subject, and                     I
 would only imj>ress upon my hearers that accidents must happen like
 that of October last, and that we must only not let them discourage us,
 and do our honest best.
     The practical result of our forecasting of weather is that while we
 are generally fairly correct as to the direction and force of wind, we
 are most liable to fail in predicting rain, especially as to its amount.
 In fact not only we, but every Meteorological Office in Europe, have
 to confess inability to foretell rain, quantitatively, to say whether the
 rain expected to fall will be only slight, or a deluge.                 In no single
 case have exceptionally heavy falls, either local, like thunderstorms,
 or general rains, been foretold.       I take as instances, the rain of April
 13, 1878, in London, which burst so many sewers; the hail-storm at
 Richmond, August 3, 1879, which will long be remembered in Kew
 Gardens ; or lastly, the snow-storm of January 18, 1881.
     These failures are very serious defects in practice, and apparently
 are in great measure attributable to our own ignorance of the conditions
 of the upper strata of the atmosphere.
     Attempts have been made in various directions to organise systems

1883.]                   07i   Weather Knowledge       in 1883.       331
of upper strata observations.     These may be classified under three
heads, Personal, Mechanical, and Optical.
                                   I
     By personal observations, mean those made on mountain stations
or in balloon ascents.
     Of Mountain Stations we have not yet had a fair trial in these
islands, for no mountain observatory, deserving the name, has yet been
built.   The Scottish Meteorological Society are endeavouring, with
great zeal and considerable success, to raise funds to build and
maintain a station on Ben Nevis, the highest spot in the United
Kingdom, and to place it in telegraphic connection with Fort
William, and so with the postal telegraph wires in general, but
hitherto all that has been done is that the observer, Mr. C. L.
Wragge, has with a most praiseworthy exertion of energy, and in
the face of great difficulties, climbed the 4000 feet before 9 a.m.
daily for 4J months in 1881, and for 5 months in 1882.          To give an
idea of what he occasionally experienced,          I
                                              may quote his words in a
letter of November 1, 1882, printed in ' Nature : " The track was
                                                    '
snowed up, and it was necessary to force a way through great banks
and drifts of snow.    The average depth was 2 feet ; once we got off
our course in the blackness of thick cloud-fog, and trackless snow."
     Mr. Wragge on each occasion, as soon as he reached Fort William
on his return, generally about 3 p.m., sent a telegram to us in
London.     This never arrived before 5 p.m., so that it was practically
useless for all forecasting or storm warning on the day on which the
observation was made.      We must therefore reserve our judgment as
to the usefulness of the proposed station until it is in efficient working
order, and the observations can reach us more promptly.
    As regards Balloons the observations are necessarily sporadic and
uncertain.   No ascent is possible if the wind is at all strong.        No
captive ascent can attain any great height, and no free ascent can be
made with a certainty of being able to send off a telegraphic message
when the observer reaches terra firma, for he may come down miles
from   a   telegraph station.
    The admitted impracticability of guiding a balloon, and the
liability to accidents, in the case of a squall, either on leaving the
ground or on returning to      of both of which recent instances, one
                                  it,
unfortunately fatal, are on record, render      unadvisable to rest any
                                                   it
hopes  of permanently   extending  our  knowledge  of the upper currents
of the atmosphere by the aid of aeronauts.     Moreover, they can never
give us reports at     afixed hour every day for the purpose of com-
pleting our charts.
    The mechanical method of observation may be soon dismissed       :   it
consists either in sending up instruments in small captive balloons, or
attached to kites, or in placing them on elevated peaks.     In all these
cases the registration     to be effected by means of electricity.
                           is                                        The
apparatus devised by Sir W. Siemens, and lent by him to the
Meteorological Society, has been in operation on Boston church tower
for several months, and has worked well, and the same may be said

332                           Mr. B. H. Scott                    [May 4,
of Olland's Telemeteorograph on the tower of Utrecht Cathedral, but
the obtaining of records from such an elevation as can be secured on
the loftiest buildings, is not obtaining them from the upper currents
of the air, and we have yet to prove the practicability of raising an
electric thermometer to a height of, say, 2000 feet, and maintaining it
there in all ordinary weathers, before we can say that much is to be
expected from mechanical upper current observation.
     Lastly, we come to optical modes of observing the condition of the
air above us. These are the only ones which as yet give us much
encouragement, and of them      I shall only mention two. Spectroscopy
and Cirrus Cloud Observations.
     The former has an enthusiastic advocate in Professor Piazzi
Smyth, whose repeated letters to the newspapers have at least
attracted the notice of many who have not seen his copiously
illustrated work on the subject, " Madeira Spectroscopic."     Professor
Smyth maintains that by observations of his rain-band in the spec-
trum, he can form an accurate estimate of the amount of moisture
 suspended in the air.      This belief of his is not as yet, however,
accepted as an article of faith by meteorologists at large, and, even if
it were, it still remains to be proved how much warning of coming rain
such phenomena will afford.        If they only give it for a few hours,
 the advantage they present to us is not very material.
     Under any circumstances there are great obstacles to the general
introduction of spectroscopic observations at telegraphic reporting
 stations. The instruments are comparatively costly, and their use
 requires more skill and delicacy of handling than we can expect from
 men of the rank of our ordinary telegraphic reporters.
     Lastly, we come to the observation of the clouds, especially of the
 upper clouds, which has been of late almost reduced to a science,
 mainly by the labours of the Eev. W. Clement Ley in this country,
 and of Professor H. Hildebrandsson       of Upsala in Sweden, around
 whom a knot of observers are gathering.           Mr. Ley is the most
 enthusiastic, and also by far the most experienced of the authorities
 upon the subject, and he said of himself in a lecture delivered a few
 years ago, that he had spent yL part of his waking existence in
 watching cloud motion. What he advances therefore must be received
 with due respect.
      For his own district, the Midlands, he claims to be almost
 infallible as regards weather, when he can secure an observation, and
 from our experience of his telegrams to us his announcements for the
 country in general are frequently astonishingly correct. In few words,
 the principle which he applies is the motion of the highest stratum of
                       "
 clouds, the " cirrus    of Howard and its relatives. He has shown that
 the various motions of these clouds can be explained by the view
 that the air slowly whirls out of a cyclonic area in the upper strata,
 in directions opposite to those of the wind motion at the earth's
 surface.
     Thus for instance, when pressure is higher over France or Germany

1883.]                on Weather Knowledge   in 1883.                333
than it is in Scotland, a motion of cirrus from north-west indicates
the existence of a depression situated to the west of us, and as that
depression advances on us the first wind we shall feel will be south
or south-east, certainly not north-west.
    Similar rules have been laid down for cirrus motion in other
azimuths, and from its rate conclusions may be drawn as to the motion
of the depression whence it takes it rise.
    This seems exceedingly promising, but now comes the other side
of the picture. Mr. Ley himself admits that the faculty of cloud
observing is incommunicable by simple teaching. The motions of
these clouds are so gradual, and are apparently so liable to be con-
founded with the motions of other and lower strata, that a great
exercise of judgment is requisite before an opinion is pronounced.
    Supposing, even, we have only one stratum to deal with, the head
must be kept immovable during the period of observation, and the
motion of the cloud across or past a fixed object, like a chimney,
watched.     Lastly, the observations cannot be always taken at fixed
hours, at the fixed observing epochs, but must be made whenever
opportunity offers. The observers, therefore, must have abundance of
leisure, and that is a commodity hard to meet with in these busy
times.
    What   is,then, the general conclusion we can draw as to weather
knowledge and its prospects in 1883   ?    I have endeavoured to show
you that weather knowledge   is practically weather prediction, and that,
for the seasons, in Europe at least, no trustworthy basis for predic-
tion has as yet been established.
    For the daily forecasting of weather much has been effected, but
much more remains to be done, and the most important advance we
can make   isin the direction of training observers in the difficult art
of upper cloud observation, the most promising field of study at
present.
    The enquiry into Atlantic weather which     is now being carried on
in our Office, and which enables us to prepare daily weather maps of
the ocean with nearly 400 observations on each, will,      it   is
                                                                 hoped,
throw light on how and where some of the storms which visit us take
their rise, but  itwill certainly show what actual condition over the
ocean accompanied each manifestation and movement of cirriform
clouds at our stations, and will thus afford data for laying down rules
to determine the position and track of a  storm-centre before itreaches
our coasts.
     Cirrus observations are in fact the only practical means we have
of, so to speak, annulling our insular and isolated position, and of
extending our outposts over the Atlantic.

                       Oysters and the Oyster Question.
   [The whole discourse, with additions, is printed in the October and November
numbers of the ' English Illustrated Magazine,' published by Messrs. Macmillan.]
The oyster possesses representatives of all the most important organs
of the higher animals, and is endowed with corresponding functions.
                                "
The " loves of the oyster may be mythical, and we may even be
sceptical as to its parental tenderness ; but no parent can take
greater care of its young. And though the oyster seems the type of
dull animal vegetation in its adult condition, it passes through a vaga-
bond, if not a stormy youth, between the time in which it is sheltered
by the parental roof, and that in which it "ranges itself" as a grave
and sedentary member of the oyster community.               It has a shell com-
posed of two pieces or valves, the one of which is thick and has a
convex outer surface, while the other is thinner and flattened.             The
contour of each valve is irregularly oval, with a small end, which
usually presents a triangular prominence known as the umbo or beak
(urn.) (Fig. 1), and which answers to the back or dorsal region of the
animal. When this is turned upwards, the opposite or ventral margin
is seen to be evenly curved, and to be gradually continued into the
curved line of the front margin (ant.), while the hinder margin (post.)
is usually straighter.       By attention to these characters, the right
valve can always be distinguished from the left ; but, in the great
majority of cases, it is more easily known because it is the flat valve.
If   the oyster is fixed, it is the convex valve which is attached ; and
free oysters naturally lie on this valve, inasmuch as the other is the
lighter, and the more easily raised by the mechanism which will be
presently described.
      The exterior of the shell is rough and usually of a brownish-green
colour. It is marked by lines, which run approximately parallel
with the contour of the shell, around a common centre placed at the
summit of the umbo, and indicate the successive layers by the apposi-
tion of which the shell has been deposited upon the skin of the
animal.     The inner face of each valve has the well-known white and
opaline or iridescent aspect which appertains to nacre or mother-of-
pearl, except the flattened or concave surfaces of the umbones, which
are marked by parallel lines answering to the lines of growth on the

                     on Oysters and the Oyster Question.                 337

exterior. At the bases of the umbones, the valves are joined together,
along a short transverse line, in a sort of hinge by a band of dark-
brown elastic substance, the ligament (I.), which, in the middle of the
hinge, forms a thicker cushion. About the centre of the inner face
of each valve there is a large well-defined rounded depression, like a
scar, which marks the place of attachment of a strong and important
muscle.
      Each valve is sometimes solid throughout, but in old oysters, and
especially in those that live in deep water, the substance of the valves,
and more particularly of the thick convex left valve, contains wide
 cavities, separated only by thin layers of nacreous substance, which
are full of sea-water.
      In structure, the nacre, or mother-of-pearl, is very dense, hard,
 and finely laminated ; but the superficial outer layer is made up of
 small polygonal prisms, and is somewhat friable.        Each of these sub-
 stances, the nacreous and the prismatic, consists of layers of organic
 matter impregnated with salts of lime.
      If the oyster has been left at peace for some time in its native sea-
 water, the edges of the valves, beyond the hinge, will be seen to be
 separated by a chink which is wider opposite the umbones.               But,
 upon the least disturbance, the chink is closed and the shut valves
 cannot be thrust asunder, without the expenditure of an amount of
 force which usually breaks them.
      An expert oyster-opener, however, mindful of the maxim, arte non
 vi, gets them apart with the utmost ease.       A strong, flat-bladed knife
 is introduced between the margins of the valves, and the knife being
 kept close to the inner face of one of them, is swept round the region
 of the muscular impression.       If  the operation is properly performed,
 the shell at once gapes widely ; and it will now be found that, if the
 valve which has sprung up is pressed down, it immediately returns to
 its former position.     The shell that, before, could hardly be forced
  open,  now  will not keep shut. The reason of this becomes apparent
  if the soft body, the edible part of the oyster, which lies within the
  shell is carefully cleaned out so that the interior of the valves can be
  seen.    On looking towards the hinge, the thick elastic cushion
  formed by the middle of the ligament, will be found to be compressed
  when the valves are brought together; and, when the external
  pressure is removed, its elastic reaction suffices to thrust them apart.
  In fact, it is like the spring of a door, arranged in such a manner as
  to keep the door ajar.     While the oyster is alive, the great muscle
  already mentioned,    which  is called the adductor (Fig. 1, add.),the ends
  of which are attached to the two scars on the inner face of the valves,
  is always ready to overcome the elasticity of the ligament and close the
  valves, when need arises.      And what the judicious oyster-opener does
  is to cut this muscle close to one or other of its attachments.       Thus
  the force by which the valves are made to gape is elasticity of a purely
  mechanical character, and is as active in the dead as in the living
  oyster ; while that by which the valves are closed is the contractility
                                                                   z 2

 which inheres only in living muscle.               Hence a dead oyster is readily
 known by its persistent gaping.                                                          *
      We shall see that a certain amount of separation of the valves is
 necessary for the discharge of all the functions of the living oyster.
 Hence, it is of advantage to the animal that this condition should be
 assumed and maintained without any muscular exertion ; while intruders
 and enemies can be shut out, or at any rate sharply pinched, at any
 moment, by calling the adductor into action.
      If  one valve is removed very carefully, so as not to injure the soft
 body within, the form of the latter is seen to have a general corre-
 spondence with that of the interior of the shell.                      It is therefore
 flattened from side to side, with the left side convex and the right
 flattened (Fig. 1).      Its contour is oval, with the long axis perpendi-
 cular to the middle of the hinge ; and there is a short dorsal side

 shell. That is to say, it has the form of a half oval, the straight side
 of which looks dorsally and a little forward. The upper and anterior
 portion of the muscle is darker than the rest and sharply denned
 from it (Fig. 1, add.).
     Just above the straight side of the muscle, a dark patch indicates
 the place of the heart, which may be seen pulsating in the chamber
 or pericardium which contains it (Fig. 1,              Above this the  h).

  the  gill plates hang down, like    so many elongated Gothic sickle-
  shaped   pendants, from the roof of the branchial cavity, which is
  formed   by their conjoined edges. On the posterior side, the cavity
  inclosed between the pallial lobes is deep below, but rapidly becomes
  shallower above, where the lobes are narrowed to mere bands.       The
  two bands pass into one another at the posterior end of the dorsal
  integument — and form a rudimentary posterior hood, the velamen
 (Fig. 1 (A), ve), which is very large in many other Lamellibranchs.
  The intestine projects beneath the integument as it runs obliquely
 downwards, over the posterior face of the adductor, to end in the
  short but prominent tubular vent.      The posterior interpallial space
 into which this opens answers to the cloacal chamber of other Lamel-
  libranchs (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 (A), cl.). It is continued forwards,
 between the trunk and the dorsal faces of the gills, into a long
 supra-branchial chamber (Fig. 2 (A), su.br.ch.), which extends forwards
 and upwards, in front of the trunk, as far as the anterior and superior
 ends of the gills.    For their anterior third, the dorsal edges of all
 the gills become attached to the front face of the trunk.    The supra-
 branchial chamber thus becomes subdivided into four passages,
 which end blindly in front. The intra-lamellar cavities, which are
 inclosed by each V-shaped branchial plate, communicate, either
 indirectly through these passages, or directly, with the supra-
 branchial chamber, and this widens behind into the cloacal chamber,
 which opens freely on to the exterior upon the posterior side of the
 body.    But the supra-branchial chamber, its passages, and the intra-
lamellar cavities, would be completely shut off from the infra-
branchial chamber by the walls of the gill plates, were it not that
these walls are perforated, like a sieve, by multitudes of very narrow
parallel slits.
      The mouth of the oyster leads into a wide gullet, which passes
back for a short distance, and then dilates into a spacious stomach,
the lower and anterior end of which is continued into the long
conical first part of the intestine, which passes downwards in front of
the adductor, closely applied to its anterior contour.         The next
portion of the intestine then bends sharply upon itself and turns
forwards parallel with the first part ; crosses this on the right side,
runs up along the back of the stomach, bends forwards and down-
wards, and turning back on the left side of the stomach (thus forming
a completely circular loop) passes at first backwards and then down-
wards to the vent, the place of which has been already described
(Fig. 2 (A)).
      The stomach and the circular loop of the intestine are surrounded
by a dark brown or greenish organ, the short branched tubules of
which unite into larger tubes or ducts which open into the stomach.
This organ is known as the liver — though it by no means exactly
answers to the organ so called in the higher animals, but secretes the
fluid which is the chief agent in digestion.
      The heart (Fig. 2 (A) ) lies in a spacious pericardial cavity (pc.)

  342                         "Professor Huxley                   [May 11,
  situated between the flat face of the adductor muscle, behind and
 below, and the mass of the digestive viscera in front and above.       It
 consists of a large dark-coloured auricular division (au.), partly
 divided into two, which is situated below and in front and which com-
 municates by two short tubular passages with the pear-shaped ven-
 tricle (v.), the long axis of which is directed upwards and backwards.
 Large arterial trunks are continued from the ventricle, one upwards
 and backwards along the posterior moiety of the circular loop of the
 intestine, one forward along the anterior moiety, one downwards to
 the adductor.     The successive contractions of the auricle and the ven-
 tricle may be readily seen in the living oyster. The blood is colour-
 less and contains numerous colourless corpuscles. It is conveyed by
 the arteries to all parts of the body and thence proceeds to a large
 venous canal, which lies in the middle line of the anterior face of the
 trunk.    From this it passes through the renal organs to the gills, and
 is thence returned by a main vessel on each side to the auricular
division of the heart. The branchiae consist of the four sickle-shaped
plates already mentioned, which extend, in pairs, from the palps in
front and above, to near the level of the vent behind (Fig. 2 (A) br.).
Unlike a sickle, however, it is the convex edge of each which is sharp,
while the concave edge is broader. Each plate or lamella, as we have
seen, is Y-shaped, consisting of two laminae which bound the intra-
lamellar cavity, and join below to form the edge of the lamella.         It
can be shown that each gill plate answers to half the gill of those
Lamellibranchs in which the structure of the branchia retains its
primitive simplicity.     Consequently the oyster has two gills and each
lamella is a hemi-branchia made up of two lamince. Of the three
partitions which separate the supra-branchial passages, the right and
left represent the stems of the branchiae, while the middle one is
formed by the adherence of the edges of the inner laminae of the two
inner hemi-branchiae to one another and to the anterior face of the
trunk.     Even to the naked eye the surface of a hemi-branchia appears
marked with regular parallel transverse lines. And a low magnify-
ing power shows that these lines are the optical expression of a series
of parallel foldings of the lamina. The re-entering angles of the oppo-
site folds correspond and are united together for some distance, so that
the intra-lamellar chamber, or cavity of the hemi-branchia, is divided
into a series of parallel transverse tubular cavities, which are widely
open above, but which narrow and apparently become closed below.
The lamina itself consists of close-set parallel branchial filaments.
Each of these filaments has the shape of a lath, about y^V o * n °^ an mcn
thick, and five or six times as wide ; and they are set edge-wise with
their flat faces not more than -^jy^th. °f an mcn a P ar k At intervals,
transverse bands unite these lath-shaped branchial filaments together.
                                              "
The outwardly turned edges of the " laths are closely beset with very
long vibratile hair-like processes, known as cilia; and, during life,
these work in such a fashion as to drive the water through the narrow
clefts between the branchial filaments into the cavities of the tubes,

whence it escapes into the supra-branchial passages and chamber and
thence makes its way out by the cloacal chamber.        The place of the
water thus swept out of the infra-branchial chamber is, of course,
made good by a corresponding flow between the pallial lobes into it.
Hence, while the oyster is alive, and in its proper element, a powerful
stream constantly sets in on the ventral and anterior side of the body
and pours out from the cloacal opening on the posterior side.         The
direction of the stream is marked by the arrows in Fig. 2 (A).
     It is upon the proper maintenance of this current that the life of
the oyster depends.      For these animals feed upon the microscopic
organisms, largely consisting of diatomaceous plants, which live in
the sea ; and as they possess no organs for seizing such food, they are
almost entirely dependent for their supply of nourishment upon the
indraught caused by the cilia on the gills, and especially upon those
which line the edges of the branchial plates and direct a portion of the
current towards the mouth. The anterior ends of each pair of hemi-
branchiae are attached between the two palps of the side to which they
belong. The applied surfaces of the palps, between which lies the
commencement of the mouth-cleft, are ridged and richly ciliated, so
that anything brought by the ciliary current of the gills is led
directly into the oral cavity. The cilia which line this eventually
drive it into the stomach.    Thus the unimpeded action of the cilia of
the gills is essential to the nutrition of the oyster ; but it is not less
necessary to its respiration, to the carrying away of the waste products
of the renal and alimentary organs, and to the expulsion of the repro-
ductive products. For all these processes depend, either on the flow
of water through the laminae of the gills, or upon the current which
sets out from the supra-branchial and cloacal chambers.
     Hence the importance of tolerably clear water to oysters.          If
turbid water, laden with coarse sediment, enters the infra-branchial
cavity, particles of mud, too large to be moved by the cilia, lodge
upon the gills, and, gradually obstructing the current, interfere with
the primary functions of feeding and breathing to such an extent as to
irjjure, or even to destroy the animal.
     It would be out of place here to give any account of the compli-
cated renal organs of the oyster, recently discovered and described by
Dr. Hoek. But it is necessary to notice the openings by which the
cavity common to them and the reproductive organs debouches.
These are the small slit-like apertures (Fig. 2 (A), ug.) situated one
on each side of the lower and front face of the trunk, which open
into the supra-branchial cavity.
     The nervous system of the oysters is more poorly developed than
that of any of their allies among the lamellibranchiate mollusks.
Only two out of the three pairs of nerve masses, or ganglia, which
these animals ordinarily possess have been clearly made out, while,
of these, the pair which is most likely to represent the sensorium of
higher animals is exceedingly small. Moreover, no organs of special
sense have been demonstrated.         So that, if any reasoning from

more or less coloured; and the mass, acquiring             brownish hue,a                       is
termed " black spat."        This change depends on the development
of the young, which acquire certain degree of coloration within the

pulsion.    When this propeller is moderately active, the larvas dance
up and down in the water, with the disk uppermost ; but when
the action is more rapid, they swim horizontally with the disk
forward.
     How long the larval oysters remain in this locomotive state, under,
natural conditions, is unknown, but they may certainly retain their
activity for a week, as    I have kept them myself in a bottle of sea-
water, which was neither changed nor aerated, for that period.         But,
sooner or later, they settle down, fix themselves by one side to any
solid body, and rapidly take on the characters of minute oysters,
which have the appearance of flattened disks, ^th of an inch, more
or less, in diameter ; they are therefore perfectly visible, as white
dots, on the surface of the substance to which they adhere.         In this
                                  " is
condition, the name of " spat          also applied to them. The loco-
motive larvaB being practically invisible in the sea, this spat appears to
be as it were precipitated out of the water ; and, since great quan-
                                                               " of
tities appear at once, the oyster fishermen speak of a " fall        spat.
     It is important to observe, that when oyster fishermen say that
there has been no " fall
                           "
                             of spat in a given season, all that is really
implied is that the young fixed oysters have not made their appearance.
The fact of the absence of a " fall of spat " does not justify the con-
clusion that the oysters have not bred as usual. It is quite possible,
that just as many eggs have been deposited in the branchial cavity,
and that just as many larvee have been set free as in other years ; but
that the larvae have been destroyed by those changes of temperature
to which they are so sensitive, or by other causes.     But, of course, it
is also quite possible that the oysters have been really barren ; or
that, although the eggs have reached the mantle cavity, the larvas
have not hatched out.      Oyster eggs, no less than hens' eggs, may be
addled.
     It is obviously useless to speculate upon the causes of a " failure
of spat," until, by the examination of samples of oysters from time to
time, and by sweeping the superjacent water with a fine towing-net,
the exact nature of the particular case of failure has been ascertained.
 There is much reason to believe that the fertility of oysters preserved
in parks is greatly diminished, although the oysters themselves may
be improved in fatness and quality by the process, and that this is
especially the case when the water in which they are preserved has a
low degree of salinity ; and it is very desirable to ascertain the nature
of the modifications effected in the structure and functions of the
reproductive apparatus of the oyster under these circumstances.
     It is unfortunate that the same word " spat " should be applied to
things so different in their nature, as the eggs and unhatched young
of the oyster contained within the mantle cavity on the one hand, and
the young fixed oysters on the other ; while there is no familiar name
for the very important stage of development which lies between these
two.    " Brood," " fry," and " spat " would be very convenient names
for the three stages, if " brood " were not already in use for the

346                              Professor Huxley                        [May 11,
smallest of the young fixed oysters.              Perhaps the most convenient
                                     "
course will be to use " fry              for the eggs or embryos which are
contained within the mantle cavity of the parent ; " larvae " for the
                                    "
locomotive stage ; and " spat for the final condition.
      In order to become spat, the larva appears invariably to fix itself
by one side (almost always the left) ; and, if the surface is favourable,
the extent of the surface of adhesion becomes very considerable, and
the oyster is fixed throughout life.           But, if the surface of adhesion is
small, the oyster, as it increases in size, readily becomes detached and
lies free, though motionless, on the bottom.
      The young oysters grow very rapidly. In five or six months, they
attain the size of a threepenny piece ; and, by the time they are a
twelvemonth old, they may reach an inch or more in diameter. The
rate of growth varies with the breed of oyster, and with the conditions
to which it is exposed ; but it is a roughly accurate and convenient
way of putting the matter to say, that, at two years, the oyster
measures two inches across, and at three years, three inches.               x\fter
this, which may be regarded as the adult age, the growth is much
slower, and the shell increases in thickness, much more than in
circumference.
      The natural term of the oyster's life is not known, but there is
reason to believe that it may extend to twenty years or more.                  An
excellent authority, Professor Mobius, is of opinion that most of the
adult Schleswig oysters are from seven to ten years old, and that,
though oysters over twenty years of age are rare, he has met with
occasional specimens which had attained between twenty-five and
thirty years.
       Oysters breed long before they are full grown, very probably in
the first year of their age, certainly in the second.          Their productivity
appears      to   reach its maximum    at  five  or six  years, and afterwards to
decline ; but much further observation is needed before any definite
rules can be laid down on this subject.
       These are the most important obvious phenomena presented by
the reproductive processes of the oyster.*               We must now consider
them a little more in detail, and under those aspects which are hidden
from ordinary observation.
      The oyster, like other animals, takes its origin in an egg, or ovum,
a minute, relatively structureless, protoplasmic spheroidal body, about
^J^th of an inch in diameter, by a long series of developmental
changes which take place in that ovum after it has united with
another living particle of extremely minute size, the spermatozoon, and
in consequence of the fertilisation effected by that union, just as the
ovule of a plant develops in consequence of the influence of the pollen
     *  It  must be remembered that the account here given holds good only of the
 Ostrea    edulis  of England and Northern Europe. In the Portuguese oyster
((?. angulata) and the American oyster (0. virginiana) the eggs are set free at
once, and are not incubated in the mantle cavity of the parents.

                                        Whore are theso ova and sperma-

which the answer       gradually shaping itself, thanks mainly to the
                        is

determined that this marking         produced by the ramifications of
                                    is                                              a
tubular organ, — the reproductive gland — the trunk of which debouches
into a  cavity common to     and the renal organs, which again,
                             it                                        will   it

                                     a
chamber (Fig.      (A), ug). The trunk of the gland, on each side,
                   2
passes upwards and backwards, in front of and above the adductor
and muscle, and gives off multitude of branches, some of which cross
                              a
the middle line and become inextricably united with those of the other
side, while others form    network beneath the skin which covers the
                             a
stomach and the liver.    From this network, blind offshoots are given
off perpendicularly inwards, and extend for        variable depth into the

metamorphoses of these cells that the ova, on the one hand, and the
spermatozoa,   on the other, are produced.
    During the breeding season, an examination of the adult oysters
on an oyster-bed shows    that the number of individuals the repro-
ductive glands  of  which  contain hardly anything but ova       about   is
equal to that of the individuals in which the reproductive gland
contains hardly anything but spermatozoa.      say
                                                   " hardly anything "
                                                        I
because competent observers have affirmed, that careful search will
always reveal few spermatozoa in the former, and
               a                                        few ova in the
                                                                a
latter. Whether    this be  so  or not, there can  be no doubt that,
practically, oysters, while actually breeding, are either males or
females.
    When the ova or spermatozoa are ripe, they flow out of the repro-
ductive gland into the surrounding water.        The spermatozoa are
carried away by the exhalent currents of the oyster in which they are
developed, and are doubtless drawn in by the inhalent currents of
adjacent oysters, the eggs of which they fertilise.  And, as the eggs
already exhibit the first of that series of changes which lead to the
formation of the larva, when they leave the reproductive gland,                    it
would appear that they must undergo fertilisation while still within
that organ.
    The eggs which pass into the supra-branchial chamber must also
be driven out by the exhalent current    but   ;would seem that, when
                                                        it
they reach  the   hinder edge  of the branchial partition, they come

within the influence of the inhalent current and are thereby swept
back into the infra-branchial chamber.            Here they accumulate, and
becoming imbedded in a viscid albuminous matter, secreted by the
                          "       "
parent, constitute the white         fry (Fig. 2 (B) ).
     From the nature of the case, this account of what takes place is
not the result of direct observation ; but it seems to be by far the
most probable explanation of the facts which can be observed.           In an
oyster   which  contains    white  fry,  in fact,  the  reproductive gland is
flaccid, and contains nothing, or hardly anything, but a few unex-
pelled ova.
     The case is different, however, with oysters the eggs of which
have been laid so long that they have passed into the condition of
                                         I
" black spat." Here many, or, as have recently found in one case,
the great majority, of the tubes of the gland contain developing sper-
matozoa, while only a few exhibit ova.           And Dr. Hoek has recently
made the important observation that, if an oyster which contains fry
is kept for a fortnight in an aquarium by itself and then examined,
the reproductive organ will be found no longer to contain ova, but
abundant developing and fully formed spermatozoa.
     After producing eggs, in fact, the female oyster changes its sex
 and becomes male.
     The conclusion, first advocated by M. Davaine many years ago,
 that the same individual oyster is alternately male and female, is
 therefore, unquestionably correct. What has yet to be made out is
 the period of recurrence of this extraordinary alternation of sexes.
 Do oysters change their sexes once or more than once in a season ?
 Until this point is ascertained, all calculations as to the propor-
 tionate number of oysters which breed during a season, based on the
 observation of the proportion of those which at any given time contain
 fry, are obviously unsafe.     If, for example, the alternation took place
 once a month, not more than half the oysters might at any time
 contain fry, and yet, in four months, every oyster might have spatted
 twice.
     In the case of the Portuguese and the American oysters, in which
 both the reproductive products pass at once into the water and no
 incubation takes place, artificial fecundation is easily effected.       The
 embryos develop normally, pass through            their  changes  within  the
 egg, and their locomotive stage, into the condition of fixed oysters
 rapidly, when confined in properly arranged aquaria. It is probable,
 therefore, that artificial breeding will sooner or later be practised on
 a great scale with these oysters.         In the case of our own oysters,
 artificial propagation by the methods practised in the case of the
 Portuguese and American forms, which involve the destruction of both
 parents, is obviously out of the question, unless some substitute can
 be found for the process of incubation, during which it is probable
 that the young oysters receive, not merely shelter but nourishment,
 from the parent. But a careful study of the conditions under which
 our oysters breed freely, will no doubt enable oyster cultivators to

for their attachment.
    It has been seen that the young animal which is hatched out of
the egg of the oyster is extremely unlike the adult, and it will be
worth while to consider its character more closely than we have
hitherto done.
     Under a tolerably high magnifying power the body is observed to
be inclosed in a transparent but rather thick shell, composed, as in
the parent, of two valves united by a straight hinge (Fig. 3 A.     But            h).
these valves are symmetrical and similar in size and shape, so that

 of different character, the outer brownish, with a friable prismatic
 structure, the inner dense and nacreous.            In the larva, there is no
 such distinction, and the whole shell consists of a glassy substance
 devoid of any definite structure.
      The hinge line answers, as in the adult, to the dorsal side of tho
 body. On the opposite, or ventral side, the wide mouth (m.) and the
 minute vent (an.) are seen at no great distance from one another.
 Projecting from the front part of the aperture of the shell there is a
 sort of outgrowth of the integument of what we may call the back of
 the neck, into a large oval thick-rimmed disk termed the velum (v.),
 the middle of which presents a more or less marked convex promi-
 nence.     The rim of the disk is lined with long vibratile cilia, and it
 is the lashing of these cilia which propels the animal, and, in the
 absence of gills, probably subserves respiration.           The funnel-shaped
 mouth has no palps ; it leads into a wide gullet and this into a
 capacious stomach.       A sac-like process of the stomach on each side
 (rZ., l.l.) represents the
                               " liver." The narrow intestine is already
 partially coiled on itself, and this is the only departure from perfect
 bilateral symmetry in the whole body of the animal.                 The alimen-
 tary  canal  is lined throughout    with ciliated  cells,  and  the  vibration of
 these cilia is the means by which the minute bodies which serve the
 larva for food are drawn into the digestive cavity.
      There are two pairs of delicate longitudinal muscles (r.s., r.i.) which
 are competent to draw back the ciliated velum into the cavity of the
 shell, when the animal at once sinks.          The complete closure of the
valves is effected, as in the adult, by an adductor muscle, the fibres of
 which pass from one valve to the other (Fig. 3, a. add.). But it is
a very curious circumstance that this adductor muscle is not the same
as that which exists in the adult.        It lies, in fact, in the fore part of
the body, and on the dorsal side of the alimentary canal.              The great
 muscle of the adult, on the other hand, lies on the ventral side of
the alimentary canal and in the hinder part of the body. And as
the muscles, respectively, lie on opposite sides of the alimentary
canal, that of the adult cannot be that of the larva which has merely
 shifted its position ; for, in order to get from one side of the alimen-
tary canal to the other, it must needs cut through that organ.                But,
as in the adult, no adductor muscle is discoverable in the position
occupied by that of the larva, or anywhere on the dorsal side of the
alimentary canal ; while, on the other hand, there is no trace of any
adductor on the ventral side, in the larva — it follows that the dorsal
or anterior adductor of the larva must vanish in the course of develop-
ment, and that a new ventral or posterior adductor must be developed
to play the same part and replace the original muscle functionally,
though not morphologically.*
    * The larva of the cockle has, at first, like the
                                                       oyster larva, only one ad-
ductor, which answers to the anterior of the two adductors which the cockle
possesses in the adult state.

     This substitution is the more interesting since it tends to the same
conclusion as that towards which all the special peculiarities of the
oyster lead us ; namely, that, so far from being a low or primitive
form of the group of lamellibranchiate mollusks to which it belongs,
it is in reality the extreme term of one of the two lines of modifica-
tion which are observable in that group. The Trigonice, the arks, the
cockles, the freshwater mussels, and their allies, constitute the central
and typical group of these mollusks.        They possess two sub-equal
adductors, a large foot, and a body which is neither very deep nor
very long. From these, the series of the boring bivalves exhibits a
gradual elongation of the body, ending in the ship-worm (Teredo) as
its extreme term.     While, on the other hand, in the sea mussels, the
Ariculce, and the scallops, we have a series of forms which, by the
constant shortening of the length and increase of the depth of the body,
the reduction of the foot, the diminution of the anterior of the two
adductors, and the increase of the posterior, until the latter becomes
very large and the former disappears, end in the oyster.
     And this conclusion, that the oysters are highly specialised Lamelli-
branchs, agrees very well with what is known of the geological history
of this group, the oldest known forms of which are all dimyary, while
the monomyary oysters appear only later.
     When the free larva of the oyster settles down into the fixed state,
the left lobe of the mantle stretches beyond its valve and applying
itself to the surface of the stone or shell, to which the valve is to
adhere, secretes shelly matter, which serves to cement the valve to its
support. As the animal grows, the mantle deposits new layers of
shell over its whole surface, so that the larval shell valves become
separated from the mantle by the new layers which crop out beyond
their margins and acquire the characteristic prismatic and nacreous
structure. The summits of the outer faces of the umbones thus
correspond with the places of the larval valves, which soon cease to
be discernible.     After a time, the body becomes convex on the left
side and flat on the right ; the successively added new layers of shell
mould themselves upon it ; and the animal acquires the asymmetry
characteristic of the adult.
     Oysters are gregarious, in consequence of the vast multitude of
locomotive larvaB which are set free simultaneously ; and which, being
subjected to the same influences, tend to settle about the same time in
the area to which the swarm drifts.         Millions of oysters are thus
aggregated together over stretches of the bottom of the sea, at depths
of from one or two, to twenty or more, fathoms, and constitute what
are known as oyster beds.
     Although oysters live and grow well enough in estuaries, in which
the salinity of the water undergoes large variations, according to the
state of the tide and the volume of fresh water that is poured in, yet
they do not flourish permanently and breed freely in water with less
than 3 per cent, of saline constituents. Thus the Baltic is, at pre-

 sent, unfit for their support ; and the east coast of Schleswig, washed
 by its brackish waters, is devoid of oysters, while certain parts of the
 west coast are famous for their oyster beds.      Gravel, stones, and dead
                                             "
 shells — commonly known as " cultch — form the most favourable
 bottom, as they facilitate the attachment of the young.            Disturbed
muddy bottoms, on the other hand, are fatal, for reasons which have
 already been given. But it is a curious fact, that even where a large
extent of sea-bottom presents apparently the same conditions, oyster
beds occur in some localities and not in others.
     The struggle for existence is as intense in the case of the passive
oyster as in that of the most active of animals. Oyster competes
against oyster for the common store of food suspended in the water,
and for the dissolved carbonate of lime out of which the shell must
be made.      Innumerable other animals, sponges, corallines, polypes,
tunicates, other bivalve mollusks, especially mussels and cockles, live
in the same way and abound on oyster beds, often attached to the
shells of the oysters.    Prof. Mobius counted as many as 221 distinct
animals of various species on one oyster shell.           All these compete
with the oyster for food, while, on the other hand, they may
occasionally supply food to the oyster in the shape of debris, and,
perhaps, of their eggs and microscopic larvas.
     From birth onwards oysters are the prey of many animals. The
minute larvae, as they swim about, are probably swallowed by every-
thing which has a mouth large enough to admit them ; and, as soon as
the young oysters have become sedentary, they are eaten by every-
thing which has jaws strong enough to crush them.              Ground fishes,
such as rays and fish of the cod tribe, easily break them up when they
have grown much larger ; while starfishes swallow them whole.            Even
the half-grown oyster,    with  a shell strong enough    to resist most teeth,
and too big for the maw of an ordinary starfish, is not safe from the
depredations of the dog whelk (Purpura lapillus) and the whelk tingle
(Murex erinaceus), which effect a burglarious entrance, by means of
the centre-bit with which nature has provided their mouths.               It is
very curious to watch a dogwhelk perched upon an oyster shell and
patiently working, hour after hour, until the little and apparently
insignificant tunnel, by which the insidious enemy will get access to
the fat prey within, is completed.      If  you pull him off, he puts on as
soft a look as the most innocent snail Could do, as who should say,

have few more dangerous adversaries.            In the Bay of Arcachon,
14,000 whelk tingles were picked off 100 acres of oyster ground in the
course of a month.
     Other animals injure the oyster indirectly by mining in the shell.
The boring sponge, Gliona, does this ; and a very curious instance of

  mischief done in this way by a burrowing annelid (Leucodore) was
  recently brought to my notice by Sir Henry Thompson.                   The
  Leucodore drives burrows into the shell and lives in them without any
  evil intent towards the oyster. But the burrows fill with fine mud,
  and this, spreading into the vacuities of the shell, gives rise to inky
  patches, which look unpleasant when the oyster is opened and damage
  its commercial value, though, as   I can testify, the flavour of the oyster
  is nowise impaired.
       The larval oysters are extremely sensitive to cold, and any sudden
  fall in the temperature of the air during the swarming time is fatal to
  them.     Even the adult oyster is readily killed by sudden frosts, if the
  water is sufficiently shallow to allow the change of temperature to
 penetrate.     Great heat is equally pernicious. At Arcachon, immense
 numbers of oysters were killed by the hot summer of 1870.
       To this long list of influences against which every oyster has to
 struggle successfully, if it is to attain maturity, larger knowledge will
 doubtless add many others.       But these are enough to enable us to
 understand why it is that the increase of a given stock of oysters may
 be, and usually is, very slight, notwithstanding the prodigious fertility
 of the individual oyster.    A very large proportion of the oysters in a
 bed, under ordinary circumstances, breed during the season ; and, as
 each adult female oyster, on an average, gives rise to a million eggs,
 one would expect a prodigious increase, even if nine-tenths of the
 young were destroyed.      But from the small proportion of half-grown
 to full-grown oysters (40-50 per cent.) it is clear that the real addition
 to the oyster population, in most years, is very small.      It is probable,
in fact, that unless the conditions are unusually favourable, not more
than two or three out of every million of the fry of the oyster ever
reach maturity.
      It is obvious that the conditions of existence of the oyster are of
an extremely complicated character, and that the population of an
oyster bed, under natural conditions, must be subject to great fluctua-
tions. A few good spatting years, accompanied by a falling off in
the number of starfishes and dogwhelks, may increase it marvellously,
while the contrary conditions may as strikingly reduce it.
      Man interferes with this state of things in two ways.       On the one
hand he is one of the most efficient of destroyers, and on the other, he is
the only conservator of the mollusks, albeit his conservation is with a
view to ultimate destruction. Let us consider him first under the
aspect of destroyer.     In some places, oysters are taken at low tide by
the hand ; but usually they are captured by means of the dredge,
which is essentially a bag, the sides of the mouth of which are
fashioned into scrapers.     The dredge is drawn slowly over the oyster
bed for a certain time, and the oysters, with multitudes of other
animals, stones, and the like, are scraped into the bag. This is then
hauled up, and the contents emptied on to the deck ; the oysters are
picked out and the refuse returned to the sea.

      There can be no doubt that the great mass of oysters in an oyster
  bed may be removed by systematic and continuous dredging.             But
  those who are best acquainted practically with the nature of that
  operation will be least inclined to believe that all the oysters on a bed
  could be cleared off in this way, even if the attempt were made ; and,
  as it must cease to be profitable to dredge long before the point of
  entire clearance is reached, it is plain that, in practice, the attempt
  will not be made. It may be doubted if ordinary dredging ever fails
  to leave some thousands of oysters, great and small, on a bed of any
  extent.
      Thus, if we admit, for the sake of argument, that an oyster bed
 may be exhausted by ordinary dredging, the reason why the oysters
 vanish is not obvious. For, supposing only a thousand oysters left,
  they ought to suffice to restore the bed by degrees.     I am aware that
 it is said that, in the meanwhile, the enemies and competitors of the
 oyster have got the upper hand, that the ground has been spoiled by
 accumulation of mud and so on. But this reasoning leaves out of
 sight the fact that the oysters have not been there from all eternity.
 There was a time when there were no oysters on the ground, and when
 the oyster larvae immigrated, they fixed themselves there, increased
 and multiplied, in spite of all obstacles.   Why should they not do so
 again ?
      The question is further complicated by the consideration that it is
 by no means certain whether the population of a given oyster bed is
 kept up by the progeny of its own oysters or by immigrants.          As  I
 have pointed out, it is ascertained that the larvae, even under very
 unfavourable circumstances, may swim about for a week ; and it
 has been estimated that they are ordinarily locomotive for two or
 three times that period. Even if we suppose the average period of
freedom to be not more than three days, the chance that an oyster
larva will eventually settle within a mile of the spot at which it was
hatched, in any estuary or in the open sea, must be very small.        For,
in an estuary, and almost always in the sea, one of the two alternating
currents of water is dominant, and a floating body will drift, on the
whole, in that direction, often many miles in the course of a day.
      The opportunity of observing the natural formation of a new
oyster bed is rare, but the details of the process have been carefully
watched in at least one case. Up to the year 1825, the Limfjord in
northern Jutland consisted of a series of brackish water lakes com-
municating with one another, and opening on the east into the
Kattegat.     In the last century, unsuccessful attempts were made to
plant them with oysters. But, on the 3rd of February, 1825, a great
storm broke through the dam which separated the western part of the
Limfjord from the North Sea ; in consequence of this, the water of
the fjord became gradually Salter, the brackish water plants and
animals disappeared and North Sea animals took their places. Among
these, in 1851, oysters were observed, and, year by year, they extended
over a larger area. In 1860, only 150,000 were taken ; at present,

1883.]               on Oysters and the Oyster Question.                      355
there   are ninety-eight beds, and, in 1871-1872, 7,000,000 of full-
grown oysters were exported.             There could have been very few
oysters before 1851, when the first were noticed.            But supposing the
first entered as early as 1840, then, in thirty years, they spread them-
selves over an area of about sixty-four English miles, so that every
year, on the average, they advanced more than two miles.                     The
oyster-beds are,   at   present,  three-fifths  of a mile   to five miles  apart,
so that the larvae must have been able to wander for at least five
miles.*
     During this slow process of immigration, it is obvious that the
enemies and the competitors of the oysters had just as good a chance
as the oysters themselves ; and yet the latter have established them-
selves with great success.        Why should they be unable to do the like
elsewhere ?
     I  must confess myself unable to arrive at a conclusion on the
                                                          "
question whether what is called " over-dredging — that is, dredging
to the extreme limit at which it is commercially profitable to dredge
— is alone competent permanently to destroy an oyster bed or not.
That oyster beds have disappeared after they have been much dredged,
I  do not doubt.     But the commonest of all fallacies is the confusion
of post hoc with propter hoc ; and        I  have yet to meet with a case in
which it is proved by satisfactory evidence, that an oyster bed has
been permanently annihilated by dredging, when the spatting seasons
have been good, and when there has been no reason to suspect an
inroad of destructive mollusks or starfishes.
     Man intervenes in favour of the oyster by the process which is
known as " oyster-culture."         This consists in collecting the spat as
soon as it has attached itself, and removing it to conveniently-situated
natural and artificial shallows, known as " oyster-parks," where it can
be protected   from its enemies and at the same time nourished.
     Practised at Whitstable and elsewhere from time immemorial, this
process has more recently been developed through laying down fascines
of twigs, or tiles, in the way of the oyster larvse during the spatting
season.      In good spatting years, the quantity of young oysters
obtained in this way is prodigious.           In 1865, Mr. Nichols, the fore-
man of the Whitstable Company, told the Sea Fisheries' Commis-
sioners, that, in the year 1858, the spat was very abundant, and that
the brood gathered in that and the three following years formed the
stock from which the market had ever since been supplied.                 But he
added, that they did not expect a good spatting season more than
once in every six years ; and that, within his recollection, there had
been no spat upon the flats, where it is usually collected for a period
of thirteen consecutive years.
     It will be observed that oyster culture is not oyster breeding, but
simply a means of profiting by the abundant produce of those years

in which the young successfully reach their fixed stage. The supply
is therefore very precarious. Moreover, it is by no means easy to find
localities, suited for oyster-parks, which must be protected from
storms, and yet have free access to the sea ; shallow, and yet not
liable to become too hot in summer or too cold in winter ; open to
currents which bring nutriment, and yet not liable to be silted
up by mud.        Even when all these conditions are fulfilled, much
labour and watchfulness are needed to keep the beds clean and free
from the incursions of enemies.          And, when all that skill and
industry can do is done, ostreiculture is attended with no less risk
and uncertainty than agriculture in a variable climate.       Favoured by
one or two fortunate spatting years, M. Coste made ostreiculture the
fashion a quarter of a century ago,      A large capital was embarked, in
France and in this country, in establishing oyster-parks, but it may
be questioned whether more than a small fraction of the investment
has ever found its way back into the pockets of the investors ; and, in
many cases, the results have been disastrous.
      The increasing scarcity and dearness of oysters were subjects of
 complaint twenty years ago, and the outcry has become louder of
 late years.    Three causes, and only three, so far as  I know, have been
 assigned for this unsatisfactory state of things : first, the increase in
 the demand for oysters, owing in large measure to modern facilities of
 transport, consequent upon the vast development of the means of
 locomotion ; second, an unusual succession of bad spatting years ;
 third, over-dredging, that is to say, the removal of so many oysters
 from the oyster beds that the number left is insufficient to keep up
 the stock.
      That the first and the second of these causes have had a great deal
 to do with the matter is beyond doubt ; but, whether any harm has
 resulted from simple over-dredging is a question respecting which
 very different opinions are entertained, and       I  have already stated
  my   reasons  for  reserving my opinion   on  the  subject. But    I shall
 suppose, for argument's sake, that all three influences are in operation,
 and proceed to ask what can be done by legislation to mitigate their
 evil effects.
      A sumptuary law restricting the consumption of oysters, per head,
 is  not practicable in these days ; and therefore, the first cause of dear-
 ness, great demand, must be left to cure itself by the increase of price
 to which it gives rise.
      Nor is the second cause of scarcity within reach of legislation.
  The seasons cannot be rendered favourable to oyster spatting by Act
  of Parliament.
      But it is very generally believed that the enforcement of what is
                         "
  called a " close time is an effectual remedy for over-dredging. Oyster
  " close time " means that oysters shall not be taken during the months
  of May, June, July, and August, which are supposed, not quite
  accurately, to cover the breeding season of the shell-fish.

  1883.]              on Oysters and the Oyster Question.              357
      But surely nothing is more obvious than this, that the prohibition
 of taking the oysters from an oyster bed during four months of the
 year is not the slightest security against its beiug stripped clean (if
 such a thing be possible) during the other eight months.         Suppose,
 that in a country infested by wolves, you have a flock of sheep,
 keeping the wolves off during the lambing season will not afford
 much protection if you withdraw shepherd and dogs during the rest of
 the year.
      These considerations are so obvious, that   I cannot but think that
 the cry for close time for oysters must be based on a confused notion
 that, as close time is good for salmon, so it must be good for oysters.
 But there is really no analogy between the two things which here pass
 under the name of "close time"          Close time for oysters is merely
 protection of oysters during the breeding season ; close time for
 salmon is not merely protection of salmon during the breeding season,
 it means a practical limitation of the capture of salmon all the year
 round by the weekly close time, supplemented by the license duties
 on rods and nets. You might protect the breeding grounds of salmon
as strictly as you pleased and as long as you pleased ; but, if too
many of the ascending fish were captured, the stock would fall off,
 and if all were captured, it would come to an end.
      If the protection afforded to an oyster bed is to be made equivalent
to that given to a salmon river, measures must be taken by which the
undue diminution of the stock of oysters, at any time, may be pre-
vented.     The most effectual way of doing this is to form an estimate
of the number of oysters on a bed before the commencement of the
open season ; and to permit the removal of only such a percentage as
will leave a sufficient stock. And regulations of this nature have
long been carried out in the Schleswig oyster fisheries and in those of
France.      A subsidiary regulation, tending towards the same end, is
that which enforces the throwing back into the sea of all half-grown
oysters.     As oysters produce young before they are half-grown, this
procedure must contribute to the breeding stock.
     AVhen, nearly twenty years ago, my colleagues, Sir James Caird,
Mr. Shaw-Lefevre, and I, had to deal with the oyster question, I am
not aware that any of us doubted the value of protection of public
oyster beds in the open sea, if it could only be made efficient.
     What we are quite clear about, however, was : —
     (1) That the close time regulation which then existed was always
useless, and sometimes mischievous.
     (2) That the regulation prohibiting the taking of half-grown
oysters interfered with the transfer of oysters from the public beds,
where they were exposed to all sorts of dangers, to the private grounds
where they were protected.
     (3) That it was practically impossible to establish an efficient
system of protection on our public oyster beds.
     And therefore we came to the conclusion that the best course that

358     Professor Huxley   on Oysters and the Oyster Question.  [May 11,
could be adopted was to abolish all the delusive and vexatious regula-
tions which were in force ; and to see what could be done by giving
such rights of property in parts of our shores favourable to oyster
culture, as would encourage competent persons to invest their money
in that undertaking.
     [In the latter part of the discourse Professor Huxley commented
on the results derived from Reports on the Oyster Fisheries, especially
in the Bay of Cancale and the Bay of Arcachon, pointing out the
uncertainty which has attended oyster culture and the inefficiency of
such restrictive legislation as has hitherto been adopted.]
     I for my part believe that the only hope for the oyster consumer
lies first in oyster culture, and secondly, in discovering a means of
breeding oysters under such conditions that the spat shall be safely
deposited. And      I have no doubt that when those who undertake the
business are provided with a proper knowledge of the conditions
under which they have to work, both these objects will be attained.

Kustarnoe Proiezvodstvo    ; or, the  Peculiar System of Domestic Industry
                         in  the  Villages  of Bussia.
In  the earliest stages of civilisation the family forms the social unit,
as   in modern times the basis of our social organisation is the
individual.    The elder type has been much longer maintained in
Russia than elsewhere, and most strikingly presents itself in what the
Russians term Kustarnoe jproiezvodstvo.         The root of the term is to be
found in the word Kust a bush, and is applied to the members of a
family who, when united in some common labour, form as it were an
organic inseparable whole and may be compared with a bush. Among
the Russian peasantry there exist two kinds of families, large and small.
The latter are composed of a husband, wife, and unmarried children ;
but the former include the married sons and daughters who still
continue to live with their children in the house of their father. It
is amongst the large families that Kustarnoe industry chiefly obtains.
In the division of labour, as well as in sharing the profits, a principle
of equality, without any difference being made as to age or sex, is
observed.    The greatest care is taken to confine to each household the
particular branch of trade with which it is occupied. The relations
existing between the members of a family are necessarily closer and
of a less irksome character than can exist between an employer and an
apprentice : and in the Moscow Exhibition of 1862, we had numerous
examples of the healthy influence exercised by this system on the
industry of the country. Though very hard pressed by its unequal
concurrence with factory labour, it still very largely prevails in the
more important governments of Russia. The number of workmen em-
ployed in the factories of Russia, excluding those in Poland and
Finland, does not exceed 711,000, whilst many of the branches of
Kustarnoe industry have taken their rise within a very recent period,
and those of an earlier date produce twice or three times as much as
they did before the commencement of the present century. It must
for a very long time play an important part in the economical life of
the people, and for this reason its development and extension should
be encouraged.     For this purpose, the lots of peasant land, which are
inadequate to supply the elementary wants of life, should be enlarged ;
elementary technical schools should be opened in those districts
where Kustarnoe industry is greatly practised ; greater encouragement
should be given to the formation of co-operative associations, or
artels, among the peasant classes ; and credit-banks might also with
advantage be opened by the government, and the peasant be thus
enabled to secure small loans on fair and equitable conditions.

         On Whales, Past and Present, and their Probable Origin.
 Few natural groups present so many remarkable, very obvious, and
 easily appreciated illustrations of several of the most important
 general laws which appear to have determined the structure of animal
 bodies, as those selected for my lecture this evening.       We shall find
 the effects of the two opposing forces — that of heredity or conforma-
 tion to ancestral characters, and that of adaptation to changed en-
 vironment, whether brought about by the method of natural selection
 or otherwise — distinctly written in almost every part of their structure.
 Scarcely anywhere in the animal kingdom do we see so many cases of
 the persistence of rudimentary and apparently useless organs, those
 marvellous and suggestive phenomena which at one time seemed
hopeless enigmas, causing despair to those who tried to unravel their
meaning,     looked upon as mere will-o'-the-wisps, but now eagerly
welcomed as beacons of true light, casting illuminating beams upon
the dark and otherwise impenetrable paths through which the
organism has travelled on its way to reach the goal of its present
condition of existence.
     It is chiefly to these rudimentary organs of the Cetacea and to
 what we may learn from them that        I propose to call your attention.
In each case the question may well be asked, granted that they are,
as they appear to be, useless, or nearly so, to their present possessors,
insignificant, imperfect, in fact rudimentary, as compared with the
corresponding or homologous parts of other animals, are they sur-
vivals, remnants of a past condition, become useless owing to change
of circumstances and environment, and undergoing the process of
gradual degeneration,     preparatory to their final removal from an
organism    to which they are only, in however small a degree, an incum-
brance, or are they incipient structures, beginnings of what may in
future become functional and important parts of the economy ? These
questions will call for an attempt at least at solution in each case as
we proceed.
     Before entering upon details,     it will be necessary  to give some
genera] idea of the position,   limits, and principal modifications of the
group of animals from which the special illustrations will be drawn.
                     "
The term " whale is commonly but vaguely applied to all the larger

1883.]    on Whales, Pa*t and Present, and their Probable Origin.      361
and    middle-sized Cetacea, and though such smaller species as the
dolphins and porpoises are not usually spoken of as whales, they may
for all intents and purposes of zoological science be included in the
term, and will come within the range of the present subject.         Taken
all together the Cetacea constitute a perfectly distinct and natural
order of mammals, characterised by their purely aquatic mode of life
and external fishlike form.    The body is fusiform, passing anteriorly
into the head without any distinct constriction or neck, and posteriorly
tapering off gradually towards the extremity of the tail, which is pro-
vided with a pair of lateral pointed expansions of skin supported by
dense fibrous tissue, called " flukes," forming together a horizontally-
placed, triangular propelling organ.      The fore-limbs are reduced to
the condition of flattened ovoid paddles, incased in a continuous in-
tegument, showing no external sign of division into arm, forearm, and
hand, or of separate digits, and without any trace of nails. There are
no vestiges of hind-limbs visible externally.       The general surface of
the body is smooth and glistening, and devoid of hair.        In nearly all
 species a compressed median dorsal fin is present.      The nostrils open
 separately or by a single crescentic valvular aperture, not at the
 extremity of the snout, but near the vertex.
      Animals of the order Cetacea abound in all known seas, and some
 species are inhabitants of the larger rivers of South America and
 Asia.    Their organisation necessitates their life being passed entirely
 in the water, as on the land they are absolutely helpless ; but they
 have to rise very frequently to the surface for the purpose of respira-
 tion. They are all predaceous, subsisting on living animal food of
 some kind.     One genus alone (Oreo) eats other warm-blooded animals,
 as seals and even members of its own order, both large and small.
 Some feed on fish, others on small floating Crustacea, pteropods, and
 medusae, while the staple food of many is constituted of the various
 species of Cephalopods, chiefly Loligo and other Teuthidce, which
 must abound in some seas in vast numbers, as they form almost the
 entire support of some of the largest members of the order.          With
 some exceptions the Cetacea generally are timid, inoffensive animals,
 active in their movements, sociable and gregarious in their habits.
      Among the existing members of the order there are two very dis-
 tinct types — the Toothed Whales, or Odontoceti, and the Baleen
 Whales, or Mystacoceti, which present throughout their organisation
 most markedly distinct structural characters, and have in the existing
 state of nature no transitional forms.     The extinct Zeuglodon, so far
 as its characters are known, does not fall into either of these groups as
 now constituted, but is in some respects intermediate, and in others
 more resembles the generalised mammalian type.
      The important and interesting problem of the origin of the
  Cetacea and their relations to other forms of life is at present involved
 in the greatest obscurity. They present no more signs of affinity
  with any of the lower classes of vertebrated animals than do many of
 the members of their own class.       Indeed, in all that essentially dis-

 362                            Professor Flower                   [May 25,
 tinguishes a mammal from one of the oviparous vertebrates, whether
 in the osseous, nervous, vascular, or reproductive systems, they are as
 truly mammalian as any, even the highest, members of the class.
 Any supposed signs of inferiority are, as we shall see, simply modifi-
 cations in adaptation to their peculiar mode of life.     Similar modifica-
 tions are met with in another quite distinct group of mammalia, the
 Sirenia (Dugongs and Manatees), and also, though in a less complete
 degree, in the aquatic Carnivora or seals.        But these do not indicate
 any community       of  origin  between   these  groups and the Cetacea.
 In fact, in the present state of our knowledge, the Cetacea are
 absolutely isolated, and little satisfactory reason has ever been given
 for deriving them from any one of the existing divisions of the
 class rather than from any other.          The question has indeed often
 been mooted whether they have been derived from land mammals at
 all, or whether they may not be the survivors of a primitive aquatic
 form which was the ancestor not only of the whales, but of all the
 other members of the class.                                 I
                                       The materials for — will not say
 solving  — but for throwing some light upon this problem, must be
 sought for in two regions — in the structure of the existing members
of the order, and in its past history, as revealed by the discovery of
fossil remains. In the present state of science it is chiefly on the
former that we have to rely, and this therefore will first occupy our
attention.
     One of the most obvious external characteristics by which the
mammalia are distinguished from other classes of vertebrates is the
more or less complete clothing of the surface by the peculiar modifi-
cation of epidermic tissue called hair.        The Cetacea alone appear to
be exceptions to this generalisation.        Their smooth, glistening exte-
rior is, in the greater number of species, at all events in adult life,
absolutely bare, though the want of a hairy covering is compensated
for functionally by peculiar modifications of the structure of the skin
itself, the epidermis being greatly thickened, and a remarkable layer of
dense fat being closely incorporated with the tissue of the derm or true
skin : modifications admirably adapted for retaining the warmth of the
body, without any roughness of surface which might occasion friction
and so interfere with perfect facility of gliding through the water.
Close examination, however, shows that the mammalian character of
hairiness is not entirely wanting in the Cetacea, although it is reduced
to a most rudimentary and apparently functionless condition.           Scat-
tered, small, and generally delicate hairs have been detected in many
species, both of the toothed and of the whalebone whales, but never
in any situation but on the face, either in a row along the upper lip,
around the blowholes or on the chin, apparently representing the
large, stiff "vibrissas" or "whiskers" found in corresponding situa-
tions in many land mammals.           In some cases these seem to persist
throughout    the life  of the  animal  ; more often they are only found in
the young or even the foetal state.         In some species they have not
been detected at any age.

  1883.]  on Whales,   Past and Present, and their Probable Origin.     363
    Eschricht and Reinhardt counted in a new-born Greenland Eight
 Whale (Balcena mysticetus) sixty-six hairs near the extremity of the
 upper jaw. and about fifty on each side of the lower lip, as well as a
 few around the blowholes, where they have also been seen in Megap-
 tera longimana and Balainoptera rostrata.          In a large Rorqual
 (Balcenoptera   musculus), quite adult and sixty-seven feet in length,
 stranded in Pevensey Bay in 1865, there were twenty-five white,
 straight, stiff hairs about half an inch in length, scattered somewhat
 irregularly on each side of the vertical ridge in which the chin ter-
 minated, extending over a space of nine inches in height and two and
 a half inches in breadth.    The existence of these rudimentary hairs
 must have some significance beyond any possible utility they may be
 to the animal.    Perhaps some better explanation may ultimately be
 found for them, but it must be admitted that they are extremely
 suggestive that we have here a case of heredity or conformation to a
 type of ancestor with a full hairy clothing, just on the point of
 yielding to complete adaptation to the conditions in which whales now
 dwell.
     In the organs of the senses the Cetacea exhibit some remarkable
 adaptive modifications of structures essentially formed on the Mam-
 malian type, and not on that characteristic of the truly aquatic
 Vertebrates, the fishes, which, if function were the only factor in the
production of structure, they might be supposed to resemble.
     The modifications of the organs of sight do not so much affect the
eyeball as the accessory apparatus.      To an animal whose surface is
always bathed with fluid, the complex arrangement which mammals
generally possess for keeping the surface of the transparent cornea
moist and protected, the movable lids, the nictitating membrane, the
lachrymal gland, and the arrangements for collecting and removing the
superfluous tears when they have served their function cannot be
needed, and hence we find these parts in a most rudimentary condition
or altogether absent.     In the same way the organ of hearing in its
essential structure is entirely mammalian, having not only the sacculi
and semicircular canals common to all but the lowest vertebrates, but
the cochlea, and tympanic cavity with its ossicles and membrane, all,
however, buried deep in the solid substance of the head ; while the
parts specially belonging to terrestrial mammals, those which collect
the vibrations of the sound travelling through air, the pinna and the
tube which conveys it to the sentient structures within are entirely or
practically wanting. Of the pinna or external ear there is no trace.
The meatus auditorius is certainly there, reduced to a minute aperture
in the skin like a hole made by the prick of a pin, and leading to a
tube so fine and long that it cannot be a passage for either air or
water, and therefore can have no appreciable function in connection
with the organ of hearing, and must be classed with the other
numerous rudimentary structures that whales exhibit.
     The organ of smell, when it exists, offers still more remarkable
evidence of the origin of the Cetacea.    In fishes this organ is specially

 364                         Professor Flower                     [May 25,
 adapted   for the perception of odorous substances permeating the
 water; the terminations of the olfactory nerves are spread over
 the inner plicated surface of a cavity near the front part of the
nose, to which the fluid in which the animals swim has free access,
although it is quite unconnected         with the respiratory passages.
Mammals, on the other hand, smell substances with which the
atmosphere they breathe is impregnated ; their olfactory nerve is dis-
tributed over the more or less complex foldings of the lining of a
cavity placed more deeply in the head, but in immediate relation to
the passages through which air is continually driven to and fro on its
way to the lungs in respiration, and therefore in a most favourable
position for receiving impressions from substances floating in that air.
 The whalebone whales have an organ of smell exactly on the mam-
malian type, but in a rudimentary condition.          The perception of
odorous substances diffused in the air, upon which many land mam-
mals depend so much for obtaining their food, or for protection from
danger, can be of little importance to them.     In the more completely
modified Odontocetes the olfactory apparatus, as well as that part of
the brain specially related to the function of smell, is entirely wanting,
but in both groups there is not the slightest trace of the specially
aquatic olfactory organ of fishes.       Its complete absence and the
vestiges of the aerial organ of land mammals found in the Mystaco-
cetes are the clearest possible indications of the origin of the Cetacea
from air-breathing and air-smelling terrestrial mammalia.       With their
adaptation to an aquatic mode of existence, organs fitted only for
smelling in air became useless, and so have dwindled or completely
disappeared.    Time and circumstances have not permitted the acquisi-
tion of anything analogous to the specially aquatic smelling apparatus
of fishes, the result being that whales are practically deprived of
whatever advantage this sense may be to other animals.
     It is characteristic of the greater number of mammalia to have
their jaws furnished with teeth having a definite structure and mode
of development.       In all the most typical forms these teeth are
limited in number, not exceeding eleven on each side of each jaw, or
forty-four in all, and are differentiated in shape in different parts of
the series, being more simple in front, broader and more complex
behind.     Such a dentition is described as " beterodont." In most
cases also there are two distinct sets of teeth during the lifetime of
the animal, constituting a condition technically called
                                                           " diphyodont."
     All the Cetacea present some traces of teeth, which in structure
and mode of development resemble those of mammals, and not those
of the lower vertebrated classes, but they are always found in a more
or less imperfect state. In the first place, at all events in existing
species, they are never truly heterodont, all the teeth of the series
resembling each other more or less or belonging to the condition
called " homodont," and not obeying the usual numerical rule, often
falling short of, but in many cases greatly exceeding it. The most
typical Odontocetes, or toothed whales, have a large number of similar,

  1883.]  on Whales,   Past and Present, and their Probable Origin.   365
  simple, conical, recurved, pointed teeth, alike on both sides and in
  the upper and under jaws, admirably adapted for catching slippery,
 living prey, such as fish, which are swallowed whole without mastica-
 tion. In one genus (Pontoporia) there may be as many as sixty of
 such teeth on each side of each jaw, making 240 in all. The more
 usual number is from twenty to thirty.           These teeth are never
 changed, being
                   " monophyodont," and they are, moreover, less firmly
 implanted in the jaws than iu land mammals, having never more than
 one root, which is set in an alveolar socket which is generally wide
 and loosely fitting, though perfectly sufficient for the simple purpose
 which the teeth have to serve.
     Most singular modifications of this condition of dentition are met
 with in different genera of toothed whales, chiefly the result of sup-
 pression, sometimes of suppression of the greater number, combined
 with excessive development of a single pair. In one large group, the
 Ziphioids, although minute rudimentary teeth are occasionally found
 in young individuals, and sometimes throughout life, in both jaws, in
 the adults the upper teeth are usually entirely absent, and those of
 the lower jaw reduced to two, which may be very large and projecting
 like tusks from the mouth, as in Mesoplodon, or minute and entirely
 concealed beneath the gums, as in Hyperoodon, — an animal which is
 for all practical purposes toothless, yet in which  a  pair of perfectly
 formed though buried teeth remain throughout life, wonderful examples
 of the persistence of rudimentary and to all appearance absolutely
 useless organs.    Among the Delphinidce similar cases are met with.
 In the genus Grampus the teeth are entirely absent in the upper, and
few and early deciduous in the lower jaw.       But the Narwhal exceeds
all other Cetaceans, perhaps all other vertebrated animals, in the
specialisation of its dentition.    Besides some irregular rudimentary
teeth found in the young state, the entire dentition is reduced to a
single pair, which lie horizontally in the upper jaw, and both of which
in the female remain permanently concealed within the bone, so that
this sex is practically toothless, while in the male the right tooth
usually remains similarly concealed and abortive, and the left is im-
mensely developed, attaining a length equal to more than half that of
the entire animal, projecting horizontally from the head in the form
of a cylindrical or slightly tapering pointed tusk, with the surface
marked by spiral grooves or ridges.
     The meaning and utility of some of these strange modifications it
is impossible, in the imperfect state of our knowledge of the habits
of the Cetacea, to explain, but the fact that in almost every case a
more full number of rudimentary teeth is present in early stages of
existence, which either disappear, or remain as concealed and function-
less organs, points to the present condition in the aberrant and
specialised forms as being one derived from the more generalised
type, in which the teeth were numerous and equal.
     The Mystacocetes, or Whalebone Whales, are distinguished by
entire absence of teeth, at all events after birth.  But it is a remark-

 366                           Professor Flower                     [May 25,
able fact, first demonstrated by Geoffroy St. Hilaire, and since amply
confirmed by Cuvier, Eschricht, Julin, and others, that in the foetal
state they have numerous minute calcified teeth lying in the dental
groove of both upper and lower jaws.             These attain their fullest
 development about the middle of foetal life, after which period they
 are absorbed, no trace of them remaining at the time of birth. Their
 structure and mode of development has been shown to be exactly that
characteristic of ordinary mammalian teeth, and it has also been
observed that those at the posterior part of the series are larger, and
have a bilobed form of crown, while those in front are simple and
conical, a fact of considerable interest in connection with speculations
as to the history of the group.
     It is not until after the disappearance of these teeth that the
baleen, or whalebone, makes its appearance.         This remarkable struc-
ture, though, as will be presently shown, only a modification of a part
existing in all mammals, is, in its specially developed condition as
baleen, peculiar to one group of whales.        It is therefore perfectly in
accord with what might have been expected, that it is comparatively
late in making its appearance.          Characters that are common to a
large  number   of  species appear early, those that are special to a few,
at a late period ; alike both in the history of the race and of the
individual.
     Baleen consists of a series of flattened, horny plates, several
hundred in number, on each side of the palate, separated by a bare
interval along the middle line.         They are placed transversely to the
long axis of the palate, with very short spaces between them.           Each
plate or blade is somewhat triangular in form, with the base attached
to the palate, and the apex hanging downwards.            The outer edge of
the blade is hard and smooth, but the inner edge and apex fray out
into long, bristly fibres, so that the roof of the whale's mouth looks
as if covered with hair, as described by Aristotle.          The blades are
longest   near the  middle  of  the series, and gradually  diminish  towards
the front and back of the mouth. The horny plates grow from a dense
fibrous and highly vascular matrix, which covers the palatal surface
of the maxillae, and which sends out lamellar processes, one of which
penetrates the base of each blade.       Moreover, the free edge of each of
these processes is covered with very long vascular thread-like papillae,
one of which forms the central axis of each of the hair-like epidermic
fibres of which the blade is mainly composed.          A transverse section
of fresh whalebone shows that it is made up of numbers of these soft
vascular papillae, circular in outline, each surrounded by concen-
trically arranged epidermic cells, the whole bound together by other
epidermic cells, which constitute the smooth cortical (so-called
" enamel
           ") surface of the blade, and which, disintegrating at the free
edge, allows the individual fibres to become loose and to assume the
hair-like appearance spoken of before.        These fibres differ from hairs
in not being formed in depressed follicles in the enderon, but rather
resemble those of which the horn of the rhinoceros is composed.          The

blades are supported and bound together for a certain distance from
their base, by a mass of less hardened epithelium, secreted by the
surface of the palatal membrane or matrix of the whalebone in the
intervals of the lamellar processes.       This is the " intermediate sub-
         "                         "
stance     of Hunter, the " gum of the whalers.
     The function of the whalebone is to strain the water from the
small marine mollusks, crustaceans, or fish upon which the whales
subsist.     In feeding they fill the immense mouth with water contain-
ing shoals of these small creatures, and then, on their closing the
jaws and raising the tongue, so as to diminish the cavity of the mouth,
the water streams out through the narrow intervals between the hairy
fringe of the whalebone blades, and escapes through the lips, leaving
the living prey to be swallowed.        Almost all the other structures to
which    I  am specially directing your attention are, as     I have men-
tioned, in a more or less rudimentary state in the Cetacea ; the
 baleen, on the other hand, is an example of an exactly contrary con-
 dition, but an equally instructive one, as illustrating the mode in
 which nature works in producing the infinite variety we see in animal
 structures. Although appearing at first sight an entirely distinct and
 special formation, it evidently consists of nothing more than the highly
 modified papillae of the lining membrane of the mouth, with an exces-
 sive and cornified epithelial development.
      The bony palate of all mammals is covered with a closely adhering
 layer of fibrovascular tissue, the surface of which is protected by a
 coating of non-vascular epithelium, the former exactly corresponding
 to the derm or true skin, and the latter to the epiderm of the external
 surface of the body.       Sometimes this membrane is perfectly smooth,
 but it is more often raised into ridges, which run in a direction trans-
 verse to the axis of the head, and are curved with the concavity back-
 wards ; the ridges moreover do not extend across the middle line, being
 interrupted by a median depression or raphe.         Indications of these
 ridges are clearly seen in the human palate, but they attain their
greatest development in the Ungulata.        In oxen, and especially in the
 giraffe, they form distinct laminae, and their free edges develop a row
of pointed papillae, giving them a pectinated appearance. Their epithe-
 lium is thick, hard, and white, though not horny. Although the
 interval between the structure of the ridges in the giraffe's palate and
 the most rudimentary form of baleen at present known is great, there
 is no difficulty in seeing that the latter is essentially a modification of
 the former, just as the hoof of the horse, with its basis of highly
 developed vascular laminae and papillae, and the resultant complex
 arrangement of the epidermic cells, is a modification of the simple
 nail or claw of other mammals, or as the horn of the rhinoceros is
 only a modification of the ordinary derm and epiderm covering the
 animal's body differentiated by a local exuberance of growth.

 from more simple palate structures are entirely lost to our sight,
 probably for ever, th*e conditions in which it now exists in different

 species  of whales, show very marked varieties of progress,       from a
 simple comparatively   rudimental   and  imperfect condition, to what is
 perhaps the most wonderful example of mechanical adaptation to
 purpose known in any organic structure.      These variations are worth
 dwelling upon for a few minutes, as they illustrate in an excellent
 manner the gradual modifications that may take place in an organ,
 evidently in adaptation to particular requirements, the causation of
which can be perfectly explained upon Darwin's principle of natural
selection.
     In the Rorquals or fin-whales (genus Balsenoptera), found in
almost all seas, and so well known off our own coasts, the largest
blades in an animal 70 feet long do not exceed 2 feet in length,
including their hairy terminations ; they are in most species of a
pale horn colour, and their structure is coarse and inelastic, sepa-
rating into thick, stiff fibres, so that they are of no value for the
ordinary purposes to which whalebone is applied to the arts.        These
animals feed on fish of considerable size, from herrings up to cod,
and for foraging among shoals of these creatures the construction of
their mouth and the structure of their baleen is evidently sufficient.
This is the type of the earliest known extinct forms of whales, and it
has continued to exist, with several slight modifications, to this day,
because it has fulfilled one purpose in the economy of nature.       Other
purposes for which it was not sufficient have been supplied by gradual
changes taking place, some of the stages of which are seen in the
intermediate conditions still exhibited in the Megaptera, and in the
Atlantic and Southern Eight Whales. Before describing the extreme
modifications in the direction of complexity,    I may mention, to show
the range at present presented in the development of baleen, that
there has lately been discovered in the North Pacific a species called
by the whalers the Californian Grey Whale (Machianectes glaucus),
which shows the opposite extreme of simplicity.       The animal is from
30 to 40 feet in length ; the baleen blades are only 182 on each side
(according to Scammon) and far apart, very short (the longest being
from 14 to 16 inches in length), light brown or nearly white in
colour, and still more coarse in grain and inelastic than that of the
Rorquals.    The food of these whales is not yet known with certainty.
They have been seen apparently seeking for it along soft bottoms of
the sea, and fuci and mussels have been found in their stomachs.
    In the Greenland Right Whale of the circumpolar seas, the Bow-
head of the American whalers (Balcena mysticetus), all the peculiarities
which distinguish the head and mouth of the whales from other
mammals have attained their greatest development.         The head is of
enormous size, exceeding   one-third  of the whole length of the creature.
The cavity of the mouth is actually larger than that of the body,
thorax, and abdomen together. The upper jaw is very narrow, but
greatly arched from before backwards, to increase the height of the
cavity and allow for the great length of the baleen, the enormous
rami of the mandibles are widely separated posteriorly, and have a

 1883.]   on Wltales, Past and Present, and their Probable Origin.     369
 still further outward sweep before they meet at the symphysis in
 front, giving the floor of the mouth the shape of an immense spoon.
 The baleen blades attain the number of 350 or more on each side,
 and those in the middle of the series have a length of ten or even
 twelve feet. They are black in colour, fine and highly elastic in
 texture, and fray out at the inner edge and ends into long, delicate,
 soft, almost silky, but very tough hairs.
      How these immensely long blades depending vertically from the
 palate were packed into a mouth the height of which was scarcely
 more than half their length, was a mystery not solved until a few
 years ago. Captain David Gray, of Peterhead, at my request, first gave
 us a clear idea of the arrangement of the baleen in the Greenland
 whale, and showed that the purpose of its wonderful elasticity was
 not primarily at least the benefit of the corset and umbrella makers,
but that it was essential for the correct performance of its functions.
It may here be mentioned that the modification of the mouth structure
of the Right Whale is entirely in relation to the nature of its food. It is
by this apparatus that it is enabled to avail itself of the minute but
highly nutritious crustaceans and pteropods which swarm in immense
shoals in the seas it frequents.    The large mouth enables it to take
in at one time a sufficient quantity of water filled with these small
organisms, and the length and delicate structure of the baleen provides
an efficient strainer or hair sieve by which the water can be drained
off.   If the baleen were, as in the Rorquals, short and rigid, and only
of the length of the aperture between the upper and lower jaws when
the mouth was shut, when the jaws were separated a space would be
left beneath it through which the water and the minute particles of
food would escape together.      But instead of this, the long, slender,
brush-like ends of the whalebone blades, when the mouth is closed,
fold back, the front ones passing below the hinder ones in a channel
lying between the tongue and the bone of the lower jaw. When the
mouth is opened their elasticity causes them to straighten out like a
bow that is unbent, so that at whatever distance the jaws are separated,
the strainer remains in perfect action, filling the whole of the interval.
The mechanical perfection of the arrangement is completed by the
great development of the lower lip, which rises stiffly above the jaw-
bone, and prevents the long, slender, flexible ends of the baleen being
carried outwards by the rush of water from the mouth, when its
cavity is being diminished by the closure of the jaws and raising of
the tongue.    The interest and admiration excited by the contempla-
tion of such a beautifully adjusted piece of mechanism is certainly
heightened by the knowledge that it has been brought about by the
gradual adaptation and perfection of structures common to the whole
class of animals to which the whale belongs.
     Few points of the structure of whales offer so great a departure
from the ordinary mammalian type as the limbs.        The fore-limbs are
reduced to the condition of simple paddles or oars, variously shaped,
but always flattened and more or less oval in outline.           They are
                                                            2 b 2

freely movable at the shoulder-joint, where the humerus or upper-
arm bone articulates with the shoulder-blade in the usual manner,
but beyond this point, except a slight flexibility and elasticity, there is
no motion between the different segments.            The bones are all there,
corresponding in number and general relations with those of the
human or any other mammalian arm, but they are flattened out, and
their contiguous ends, instead of presenting hinge-like joints, come in
contact by flat surfaces, united together by strong ligamentous bands,
and all wrapped up in an undivided covering of skin, which allows
externally of no sign of the separate and many-jointed fingers seen in
the skeleton.
     Up to the year 1865 it was generally thought that there was
nothing to be found between this bony framework and the covering
skin, with its inner layer of blubber, except dense fibrous tissue,
with blood-vessels and nerves sufficient to maintain its vitality.
Dissecting a large Korqual, 67 feet in length, upon the beach of
Pevensey Bay in that year,        I was surprised to find lying upon the
bones of the fore-arm well-developed muscles, the red fibres of which
reached nearly to the lower end of these bones, ending in strong
tendons, passing to, and radiating out on, the palmar surface of the
hand. Circumstances then prevented me following out the details
of their arrangement and distribution, but not long afterwards Pro-
fessor Struthers, of Aberdeen, had an opportunity of carefully dis-
secting the fore-limb of another whale of the same species, and he
                                                                                    '
has recorded and figured his observations in the ' Journal of Anatomy
for November 1871. He found on the internal or palmar aspect of
the limb three distinct muscles corresponding in attachments to the
flexor carpi ulnaris, the flexor profundus digitorum, and the flexor
longus pollicis of man, and on the opposite side but one, the extensor
communis digitorum.*           Large as these muscles actually are, yet,
compared with the size of the animal, they cannot but be regarded as
rudimentary, and being attached to bones without regular joints and
firmly held together by unyielding tissues, their functions must be
reduced almost to nothing. But rudimentary as the muscles of the
Fin-whales are, lower stages of degradation of the same structures are
found in other members of the group. In some they are indeed
present in form, but their muscular structure is gone, and they are
reduced in most of the toothed whales to mere fibrous bands, scarcely
distinguishable from the surrounding tissue which connects the inner
surface of the skin with the bone.          It is impossible to contemplate
these structures without having the conviction forced home that here
are the remains of parts once of use to their possessor, now, owing to
the complete change of purpose and mode of action of the limb, reduced
to a condition of atrophy verging on complete disappearance.

developed    limbs, but so situated that it is almost impossible to
conceive that they can be of any use ; the whole limb, such as it is,
being buried deep below the surface, where any movement, except of
the most limited kind, must be impossible.       Indeed, that the move-
ment is very limited and of no particular importance to the animal
was shown by the fact that in two out. of eleven whales dissected the
hip-joint was firmly anchylosed (or fixed by bony union) though
 without any trace of disease. In the words of Dr. Struthers, " Nothing
can be imagined more useless to the animal than rudiments of hind-
legs entirely buried beneath the skin of a whale, so that one is inclined
to suspect that these structures must admit of some other interpreta-
tion. Yet, approaching the inquiry with the most sceptical deter-
mination, one cannot help being convinced, as the dissection goes on,
that these rudiments really are femur and tibia. The functional point
of view fails to account for their presence.     Altogether they present
for contemplation a most interesting instance of those significant
 parts, rudimentary structures."
      We have here a case in which it is not difficult to answer the
 question before alluded to, often asked with regard to rudimentary
 parts : Are they disappearing or are they incipient organs ? We can
 have no hesitation in saying that they are the former.     All we know
 of the origin of limbs shows that they commence as outgrowths upon
 the surface of the body, and that the first-formed portions are the
 most distal segments.     The limb, as proved by its permanent state in
 the lowest Vertebrates, and by its embryological condition in higher
 forms, is at first a mere projection or outward fold of the skin, which,
 in the course of development, as it becomes of use in moving or
 supporting the animal, acquires the internal framework which
 strengthens it and perfects its functions.    It would be impossible on
 any theory of causation yet known, to conceive of a limb gradually
 developed from within outwards. On the other hand, its disappearance
 would naturally take place in the opposite direction ; projecting parts
 which had become useless, being in the way, would, like all the other
 prominences on the surface of the whales, hair, ears, &c, be removed,
  while the most internal, offering far less interference with successful
 carrying on the purposes of life, would be the last to disappear,
 lingering, as in the case of the Greenland Whale, long enough to
  reveal their wonderful history to the anatomist who has been fortunate
  enough to possess the skill and the insight to interpret it.
      Time will not allow of more illustrations drawn from the structure
  of existing Cetacea ; we turn next to what the researches of palaeon-
  tology teach of the past history of the order. Unfortunately this does
  not at present amount to very much.      As is the case with nearly all
  other orders of mammals, we know nothing of their condition, if they
  existed, in the mesozoic age.       Even in the Cretaceous seas, the
  deposits at  the bottom of  which  are so well adapted to preserve the
  remains of the creatures which swam in them, not a fragment of any
  whale or whale-like animal has been found. The earliest Cetaceans

  whose structure, as far as we know     it,
                                          was intermediate between that
 of the existing suborders of whales, having the elongated nasal bones
 and anterior position of the nostrils of the Mystacocetes, with the
 teeth of the Odontocetes, and with some characters more like those of
 the generalised mammalian type, than of any of the existing forms.
 In fact Zeuglodon      precisely what we might have expected a priori
                        is
 an ancestral form of whale to have been.      The remarkable smallness
 of its cerebral cavity, compared with the jaws and the rest of the
 skull, so different from that of modern Cetaceans,     exactly paralleled
                                                       is
 in the primitive types of other groups of mammals.        The teeth are
 markedly differentiated in different parts of the series.         In the
 anterior part of both jaws they are simple, conical, or slightly com-
 pressed and sharp pointed.       The first three of the upper jaw are
 distinctly implanted in the premaxillary bone, and so may be reckoned
 as incisors.   The tooth which succeeds, or the canine,      also simple

is   followed by five teeth with two distinct roots and compressed
 pointed crowns, with denticulated cutting edges. It has been thought
 that there was evidence of     avertical succession of the molar teeth,
 as in diphyodont mammals, but the proof of this         not quite satis-

 some anatomists        appears to indicate freedom of motion at the

ordinary Cetacea.      Of the structure of the pelvis and hind-limb we
are at present in ignorance.
     From the middle Miocene period fossil Cetacea are abundant, and
distinctly divided into the two groups now existing. The Mysta-
cocetes, or Whalebone Whales, of the Miocene seas were, as far as we
know now, only Balcenopterce, some of which (as the genus Cetotherium)
 were, in the elongated flattened form of the nasal bones, the greater
distance between the occipital and frontal bones at the top of the
head, and the greater length of the cervical vertebrae, more generalised
than any now existing.        In the shape of the mandible also, Van

 other organic structures known, past or present.       Instead of living in
 an age of degeneracy of physical growth, we are in an age of giants,
 but it may beat the end of that age. For countless centuries impulses
 from within and the forces of circumstances from without have been
 gradually shaping the whales into their present wonderful form and
 gigantic size, but the very perfection of their structure and their
 magnitude combined, the rich supply of oil protecting their internal
 parts from cold, the beautiful aj)paratus of whalebone by which their
 nutrition is provided for, have been fatal gifts, which, under the
 sudden revolution produced on the surface of the globe by the de-
 velopment of the wants and arts of civilised man, cannot but lead in a
 few years to their extinction.
       It does not need much foresight to divine the future history of
 whales, but let us return to the question with which we started,
 What was their probable origin?
       In the first place, the evidence is absolutely conclusive that they
 were not originally aquatic in habit, but are derived from terrestrial
 mammals of fairly high organisation, belonging to the placental divi-
 sion of the class, — animals in which a hairy covering was developed,
 and with sense organs, especially that of smell, adapted for living on
 land ; animals, moreover, with four completely-developed pairs of
 limbs on the type of the higher vertebrata, and not of that of fishes.
 Although their teeth are now of the simple homodont and diphyodont
 type, there is much evidence to show that this has taken place by the
 process of degradation from a more perfect type, even the foetal teeth
 of whalebone whales showing signs of differentiation into molars and
 incisors, and many extinct forms, not only the Zeuglodons, but also
  true dolphins, as the Squalodons, having a distinct heterodont den-
                                                              "
  tition, the loss of which, though technically called a degradation,''
  has been a change in conformity to the habits and needs of the
  individuals.     So much may be considered very nearly, if not quite,
  within the range of demonstrated facts, but it is in determining the
  particular group of mammals from which the Cetacea arose that
  greater difficulties are met with.
       One of the methods by which a land mammal may have been
  changed into an aquatic one is clearly shown in the stages which still
  survive among the Carnivora.         The seals are obviously modifications
  of the land Carnivora,      the Otariae, or sea-lions and sea-bears, being
  curiously intermediate. Many naturalists have been tempted to think
  that the whales represent a still further stage of the same kind of
. modification.     So firmly has this idea taken root that in most popular
  works on zoology in which an attempt has been made to trace the
  pedigree of existing mammals, the Cetacea are definitely placed as
  offshoots of the Pinnipedia, which in their turn are derived from the
  Carnivora.      But there is to my mind a fatal objection to this view.
   The seal of course has much in common with the whale, inasmuch as
   it is a mammal adapted for an aquatic life, but it has been con-
   verted to its general fish-like form by the peculiar development of its

hind-limbs into instruments of propulsion through the water; for
though the thighs and legs are small, the feet are large and
are the special organs of locomotion, the tail being quite rudi-
mentary. The two feet applied together form an organ very like the
tail of a fish or whale, and functionally representing               it, but only
functionally, for the time has    I     trust quite gone by when the Cetacea
were defined as animals with the " hinder limbs united, forming                 a
forked horizontal tail," In the whales, as we have seen, the hind-
limbs are aborted and the tail developed into          a      powerful swimming
organ.    Now  it   isvery  difficult   to   suppose    that when the hind-limbs
had once become so well adapted to             a     function so essential to the
welfare of the animal as that of swimming, they could ever have
become reduced and their action transferred to the tail — the animal
                                                                 ;
must have been in        too helpless condition to maintain its existence
                         a
during the transference,     if  it took place, as we must believe, gradually.
It is far more reasonable to suppose that whales were derived from
animals with large tails, which were used in swimming, eventually
with such effect that the hind-limbs became no longer necessary, and
so gradually disappeared.         The powerful tail, with lateral cutaneous
flanges, of an American species of otter (Pteronura sandbachii) or the
still more familiar tail of the beaver, may give some idea of this
member in the primitive Cetacea.         I         think that this consideration
disposes  of the  principal   argument     in  favour  of the whales being related
to the seals,  as  most   of  the  other    resemblances, such as those in the
characters of their teeth, are evidently resemblances of analogy related
to similarity of habit.
     As pointed out long ago by Hunter, there are numerous points in
the structure of the visceral organ of the Cetacea far more resembling
those of the Ungulata than the Carnivora.                 These are the complex
stomach, simple liver, respiratory organs, and especially the repro-
ductive organs and structures relating to the development of the
young. Even the skull of Zeuglodon, which has been cited as pre-
senting great resemblance to that of seal, has quite as much likeness
         a                                 a
to one of the primitive pig-like Ungulates, except in the purely
adaptive character of the form of the teeth.
     Though there is, perhaps, generally more error than truth in
popular ideas on natural history,     I        cannot help thinking that some
insight  has  been  shown    in  the  common       names attached to one of the
most familiar of Cetaceans by those whose opportunities of knowing
its nature have been greatest — " Sea-Hog," '* Sea-Pig," or " Herring-
Hog" of our fishermen, Meerschwein of the Germans, corrupted into
the French "Marsouin," and also 4i Porcpoisson,"                   shortened into
" Porpoise."
     The difficulty that might be suggested in the derivation of the
Cetacea from the Ungulata, arising from the latter being at the
present day mainly vegetable feeders,          is     not great, as the primitive
 Ungulates   were  probably     omnivorous,      as their  least modified descend-
ants, the pigs, are still and the aquatic branch might easily have

gradually become more and more piscivorous, as we know from the
structure of their bones and teeth, the purely terrestrial members
have become by degrees more exclusively graminivorous.
     One other consideration may remove some of the difficulties that
may arise in contemplating the transition of land mammals into
whales. The Gangetic Dolphin (Platanista) and the somewhat re-
lated Inia of South America, which retain several rather generalised
mammalian characters, and are related to some of the earliest known
European Miocene dolphins, are both to the present day exclusively
fluviatile, being found in the rivers they inhabit almost up to their
very sources, more than a thousand miles from the sea. May this not
point to the freshwater origin of the whole group, and thus account
for their otherwise inexplicable absence from the Cretaceous seas ?
     We may conclude by picturing to ourselves some primitive gene-
ralised, marsh-haunting animals with scanty covering of hair like the
modern hippopotamus, but with broad, swimming tails and short
limbs, omnivorous in their mode of feeding, probably combining
water-plants with mussels, worms, and freshwater crustaceans, gradu-
ally becoming more and more adapted to fill the void place ready for
them on the aquatic side of the borderland on which they dwelt, and
so by degrees being modified into dolphin-like creatures inhabiting
lakes and rivers, and ultimately finding their way into the ocean.
Here the disappearance of the huge Enaliosaurians, the Ichthyosauri
and Plesiosauri, which formerly played the part the Cetacea do now,
had left them ample scope.       Favoured by various conditions of tem-
perature and climate, wealth of food supply, almost complete immunity
from deadly enemies, and illimitable expanses in which to roam, they
have undergone the various modifications to which the Cetacean type
has now arrived, and gradually attained that colossal magnitude
which we have seen was not always an attribute of the animals of this
group.
     Please to recollect, however, that this is a mere speculation, which
may or may not be confirmed by subsequent palseontological discovery.
Such speculations are,     I  trust, not without their use and interest,
especially when it is distinctly understood that they are offered only
as speculations and not as demonstrated facts.

                   The Forms and History          of the Sword.
There seems to be       a  culminating point not only in all human arts,
but in the fashion of particular instruments.            And it so happens that
the pre-eminent and typical instruments of war and of music attained
their perfection at nearly the same time, in the first quarter of the
eighteenth century.       Within that period the violin, chief minister of
the most captivating     of  the arts of peace, and the sword> the chosen
weapon of skilled single combat and the symbol of military honour,
assumed their final and absolute forms — forms on which no improve-
ment has been found possible.         Strangely enough, the parallel holds
a step further.   In each case, although nothing more could be added
to the model or the workmanship, it was yet to be long before the
full capacities of the instrument were developed.                   A quartet of
Beethoven hardly diners more from the formal suites and gavottes
of such composers as Rameau, than does the sword-play of the school of
Prevost or Cordelois from the nicely balanced movements and counter-
movements taught and figured in the works of De Liancour or Girard.
Nor has fencing been without its modern romantic school ; we may
even say that it has had its Berlioz in the brilliant and eccentric De
Bazancourt, a charming writer on the art, and — as he has been de-
scribed to me by competent authority — un tireur des plus fantaisistes.
And in both cases we may truly say that the period of academic
formality was the indispensable predecessor of the more free and
adventurous development of our own time.                 But before the modern
 small-sword could even exist — the sword, as it is called eminently
and without addition in its land of adoption, epee as opposed to sabre
— a long course of growth, variation, and experiment had to be run
through.    To give some general notion of the forms and history of
the sword is what     I   shall now attempt ;        I  say some notion, for the
subject, narrow  as  it  may   seem  at   first  sight, is one that marvellously
grows upon consideration ;       and  I   can   well understand that (if report
says true) Captain Burton has found three volumes none too many for
the compass of the exhaustive work which, after long preparation, he
is about to give us. And though there are perhaps not many of us
nowadays who would, like Claudio before he fell in love, walk ten
mile a-foot to see a good armour,       I   think we shall find the story not
without interest.

     The sword is essentially a metal weapon. Here at the outset we
are on disputable ground ; one cannot take a part either way without
differing from good authorities.      But some part must be taken, and
on this point  I hold with General Pitt-Eivers.     The larger wooden or
stone weapons, clubs and the like, were not and could not be imitated
in bronze in the early days of metal-work, for the one sufficient reason
that metal was too scarce.        We start then with spear-heads of
hammered bronze, imitating the pointed flints which doubtless were
still used for arrow-heads until bronze was cheap enough to be thrown
or shot away without thought of recovering it. The general form of
these spear-heads was a kind of pointed oval, a type which has con-
tinued with only minor variations in the greater part of the spears,
pikes, and lances of historical times.     It is difficult to say whether
the spears thus headed were oftener used as missile or thrusting
weapons, though the javelin has also forms peculiar to itself, of which
the most famous example is the Roman pilum. In the semi-historical
warfare of the Homeric poems the spear is almost always thrown ; in
the later historical period it is held fast as a pike ; the Romans, care-
fully practical in all matters of military equipment, had different
spears for different kinds of service.    In mediaeval Europe the missile
use of spears had,     I  believe, disappeared altogether, except in the
defence of walls and in naval combats.          However these things may
be, the need of a handier weapon than the spear for close quarters,
and a readier and more certain one than the club, must have been felt
at an early time. A spear broken off short would at once give a hand-

weapon like the Zulu                             When metal becomes more
abundant, and skill in working it more common, such weapons are
separately designed and made ; the spear-head is enlarged into a
blade, with but little alteration of form, and we have a bronze*

dagger of the type known to English archaeologists as leaf-shaped,"
the characteristic type of the bronze period everywhere. Some of
the Greek bronze daggers, indeed, are rather smaller than the full-
sized spear-heads. With increasing command of metal the length of
blade is increased ; and we have in course of time a true sword. It
is impossible to define where the dagger ends and the sword begins,
but perhaps the metal-bladed weapon may fairly be called a sword
when it is two feet long or upwards, and has a metal grip, or nucleus
                       "
of a grip (the "tang of the modern armourer), wrought in the same
piece with   it,and finished off with      acounter-guard or pommel. It
may   be  observed   that  the  prehistoric   armourers, as far as one can
guess,  had no  theories  as to the most  effective length of their weapons.
I  believe the dimensions       were  determined     (within the limits of
practical handling by man of average stature) almost wholly by the
                           a
costliness of the material.       In the later bronze and earlier iron

metals.   Iron came first where, as in Africa,  it  was most accessible. But

 periods we find the blades attaining almost or quite the length of a
 modern sabre.       And in like manner the bulging curvature towards
 the point appears not to have been adopted in order to give cutting
 power (which to some extent it does), but to be a mere imitation of
 the spear-head, which in turn owes its form to imitation of the earlier
chipped flint points. However produced, and for whatever reasons
retained, this leaf-shape is the continuing type of the Greek sword
 throughout ancient Greek history ; and it is not only thus persistent,
 but now and then recurs at much later times in unexpected ways.                 It
 is exactly reproduced in a pattern of short sword for the French
 dismounted      artilleryman, dated 1816, which may be seen in the
Musee d'Artillerie at the Invalides, and in some recent experimental
sword-bayonets.* As the blade lengthened, the leaf-shape was less
marked, and in the days of the Roman empire, and the barbarian
dynasties which were built up on its ruins, the symmetrical curvature
had disappeared, leaving a straight and broad blade which became the
European sword of the middle ages. Meanwhile the leaf-shape had
thrown out other offshoots elsewhere.            From the mediaeval type of
sword,     or in some cases from one of     these  other forms, are derived all
the weapons of this class now employed by the European races of
man.
      Even in the prehistoric period the leaf-shape underwent varia-
 tions. There have lately been found at Mycenae several sword (or
rather dagger) blades of unknown antiquity, differing from the
common pattern in being straight-edged ; as likewise, it is worth while
to note, are the swords figured on Assyrian sculptures, narrow and
slender weapons mounted not unlike the Roman army sword, and
apparently tapering to a point.              These Mycenaean examples are
elaborately decorated, and of the utmost interest as specimens of early
artistic metal work.        Two of them are considerably shorter than the
others, and these are the most finely wrought. f         The blades are covered
with hunting scenes and figures of animals, partly real and partly
fabulous ; the style of the work is archaic, and both the general style
and certain details suggest an Egyptian origin for the school from
which it came, if not for the artists themselves.          The figures are not
wrought in one piece with the blades, but made separately and let in.

variety, and indicate to some extent the natural colouring of the
objects.    Whether imported or produced by a naturalised school of
craftsmen, arms so richly adorned cannot have been at any time other-
wise than a luxury confined to chiefs of the highest rank. These are
of an antiquity far greater than that of the Homeric poems ; and in
Homer there is nothing that would lead us to expect such work, though
decorated scabbards and mountings are mentioned.           Swords occur now
and then as presents, but there is no trace of their being peculiarly
valuable possessions, and still less of any peculiar feeling of honour
being associated with them.        The spear is the favourite weapon of
Homer's mighty men, as witness the spear of Achilles which none but
himself can cast. The sword is used only when the spear has failed,
and seems to do little execution then.         In historical Greece, and to
some extent among the Romans, the military point of honour was
bound up with the shield, probably because the abandonment of it
was naturally the first action of defeated troops anxious to lighten
themselves in retreat.
     So far as anything can be inferred from the allusions of the
Greek tragedians, and from a few historical details like the improve-
ments in equipment introduced by Iphicrates, the sword had a better
relative position among the arms of Greek warriors in post-Homeric
times.    Probably this was due to the supplanting of bronze by iron —
a process which was complete so long before Thucydides wrote, that
iron was in his language the natural and obvious material of weapons.
To wear arms is for him to wear iron : in old times, he says, every
                                "
man in Greece M wore iron          in every-day life, like the barbarians
nowadays.     But it is in the Roman armies that we find the first distinct
evidence of the use of the sword being studied with anything like
system.    We learn from Vegetius — a writer of the late fourth century
a.d., and of no great authority for his own sake, but likely enough to
have preserved genuine traditions of the service — that the Roman
soldier was assiduously practised in sword exercise.          What is more
important,   the Romans     had   discovered    the advantage of using the
point, and regarded enemies who could only strike with the edge as
contemptible. Vegetius assigns as reasons for this both the greater
effectiveness of a thrust and the less exposure of the body and arm in
delivering it ; reasons which though not conclusive are plausible, and
show that the matter had been thought out.             Further, the Roman
practice, notwithstanding the temptation to keep the shielded side fore-
most, was to advance the right side in attacking, as modern swords-
men do.     The weapon was a thoroughly practical one : the straight
and short blade was mounted in a hilt not unlike that of a Scottish
dirk, scored with well-marked grooves for the fingers, and balanced
with a substantial pommel : this last point, by the way, is too much
neglected in our present military swords.           A shorter and broader
pattern was worn by superior         officers, sometimes   in a highly orna-
mented scabbard, of which there is a very fine specimen in the British
Museum. Longer swords were used by the cavalry and by the foreign

troops in the Roman service*              There is no evidence, however, that
the Romans ever attained the point of cultivating swordsmanship in
the proper sense, that is, making the sword a defensive as well as an
offensive arm.
     After the fall of the Roman empire the sword in general use is a
longer and larger weapon, but handled, we may suspect, with less
skill and effect. It is straight, heavy, double-edged, and of varying
length apparently determined by no rule beyond the strength or the
fancy of the owner. A good historical specimen of this type is the
sword of Charles the Great, exhibited in the Louvre.                As often as not
the earlier mediaeval swords are rounded off at the end ; and from
this, as well as from the fact that some centuries later the " foining
        "
fence      of the Italian school was regarded as a wholly new thing, it
appears that the Roman tradition of preferring the point to the edge
had been lost or disregarded. There is every reason, indeed, to believe
that the mediaeval form is the continuance of a prehistoric one.
Swords dug up in various parts of Europe from several feet of gravel
show no essential difference of pattern from those which were common
down to the sixteenth century.            The hilts of the prehistoric swords
do indeed affect (though not invariably) a shortness in the grip which
seems to modern Europeans absurd, though a parallel to it may be
found in modern Asiatic swords ; and very short handles occur in
European weapons as late as the thirteenth century. From three to
three and a half inches, or sometimes even less, is all the room given
to the hand.        The modern European swordsman's grip is flexible ; he
requires free space and play for the fingers, and for the directing
action of the thumb which is all but indispensable in using the
point.      The short grip is intended to give a tight-fitting and rigid
grasp,    so that the whole motion of the cut comes from the arm and
shoulder ; and this is the manner in which Oriental swords are still
handled.        Apart from this difference in the size of the grip, a
me.liaeval knight's sword, or one of the Scottish swords to which the
name of claymore (commonly usurped by the much later basket-hilted
pattern) properly belongs, has little to distinguish it from the arms
of unknown date which, for want of a more certain attribution, are
vaguely called British in our museums.                  But one thing of great
curiosity happened to the sword in the middle ages ; it became a
symbol of honour, an object almost of worship, the chosen seat and
image of the sentiment of chivalry.              This may be accounted for in
part by the accident of the cross-guard seeming to the newly con-
verted barbarians to invest it with a sacred character ;             I say accident,
for the cross-guard is certainly prehistoric and therefore pre-Christian.

new significance and importance to such customs as that of swearing
by the sword — itself a widely spread one, and of extreme antiquity.*
I   think that other though not dissimilar influences also came into
play.      In the Old Testament the sword is much oftener mentioned
than the spear, and is a recognised symbol of war and warlike power.
Thus, to take one of the best known passages, we read in the forty-fifth
Psalm, " Gird thee with thy sword upon thy thigh, O thou most
             "
mighty :        in the Yulgate, Accingere gladio tuo super femur tuum,
potentissime.       Now it is no matter of conjecture that such a passage
deeply affected the mediaeval imagination.                 These words are quoted
by a man of peace, our own Bracton, writing in the thirteenth century,
when he speaks of the king's power, and of the counsellors and barons
who are his companions, girt with swords, assisting him to do judgment
and justice.       It seems hardly too fanciful to think that the fascination
and pre-eminence of the sword which were at their height in Bracton's
time, and are not extinct yet, were in some measure derived from that
one triumphant note of the Psalmist.                Not that others were wanting ;
there is the two-edged sword in the hands of the saints : Exaltationes
Dei in gutture eorum, et gladii ancipites in manibus eorum, a verse that
was in time to serve the Puritans as it had served the Crusaders.
      But to follow out the associations of the sword with knighthood,
semi-religious military vows and enterprises, and military honour in
general, would be matter for a discourse of itself.                Let us return to
the fashion and development of the weapon.                   There was little varia-
tion from the eleventh to the sixteenth century, save that the
decoration of the scabbard and mountings (of which                 I do not propose
to speak) grew more elaborate with the growth of art and luxury, and
that the average length tended to increase. After the twelfth century
the sword is generally pointed as well as two-edged, and the point
was sometimes used with effect.               In a fourteenth century MS. in the
British Museum, engraved in Hewitt's ' Ancient Armour and
Weapons,' a mounted knight is delivering a thrust in quarte (as we
now say), which completely pierces his adversary's shield.                     In the

itself was the object of worship ; the feeling is more easily revived in fighting
times, even now, than men of peace are apt to think, as Korner's well-known
 sword-song shows.      Compare General Pitt-Rivers's Catalogue of his collection
(Stationery Office, 1877), p. 102. Some of the formulas in Ducange suggest the"

 sixteenth century the blade is made narrower and lighter, and the
 sword-hand is for the first time adequately guarded.      First, the plain
 cross-bar puts on various curved forms intended to arrest or entangle
 an enemy's blade with greater effect.      Then rings project on either
 side of the root of the blade, and are worked, as time goes on, into a
 more or less complex system of convolutions            according to the
 costliness of the weapon and the skill and fancy of the maker. These
 curved guards are known as pas d'dne, while the cross-pieces in the
 plane of the blade, now slender and elongated, and often curving
 towards the point, are called quillons.  Next the guard throws up one
 or more branches, covering or encircling the exposed outer part of the
 hand.     These branches form a shell or basket pattern, their ends are
 solidly joined to the pommel (after an interval of hesitating osculation,
 well exemplified in a sword now in the museum of the United Service
 Institution, which was borne by Cromwell at Drogheda). and nothing
 but a process of selection and simplification is now needed to produce
 all the modern patterns of sword-hilts.      It was at Venice that the
 basket-hilt came first into regular use in the swords named Schiavone,
from being worn by the Doge's body-guard (Schiavoni, Slavs, i. e.
 Dalmatians).     In these it is of a flattened elliptical shape. The
Scots, renowned before the middle of the sixteenth century for their
 careful choice of weapons, took up the model, and in the course of
another generation or two developed it into the well-known basket-
guard still used by our Highland regiments, the most complete pro-
tection for the swordsman's hand ever devised without undue loss of
freedom.     Meanwhile the pas d'dne solidifies into a hollowed disc or
even a deep bell-shaped cup, the characteristic feature of the guard of
the Spanish rapier and the modern duelling sword.        One cannot help
speaking of the works of men's hands, when one traces them in
historical order through their several forms, as if they were organic
and grew like flowers, or like variations of a natural species ; and in
truth it is not an idle conceit, for the development of design and
workmanship answers to a real organic development in the men from
whose brain and hand the work proceeds ; every generation takes up
from its fathers, if it is worthy of them, a new starting-point of
imagination and aptitude, and the strange conservatism of the
imitative faculty is a sure warrant of continuity.
     The latter half of the sixteenth century was the time when the
sword stood highest in artistic honour. Then it was that Holbein
designed its ornaments       for Henry VIII., and that Albert Durer
engraved a crucifixion on a plate of gold for the boss of a sword or
dagger of the Emperor Maximilian's.        Both the sword and its orna-
ment disappeared at an early time, the prey of some greatly daring
collector, and nothing is now known of their fate : the design
survives, for impressions were taken as from an ordinary engraver's
plate, and some are still in existence, though a good example is
extremely rare.     But in the true armourer's or swordsman's eyes the
work even of a Holbein and a Durer is only extraneous adornment,

and must   yield in interest to the qualities of the blade. And at this
time the sword-smith became again, as he had been in the ruder ages
when metal working was the secret of a few craftsmen, a man of
renown. In Spain, in France, in Germany, and in Italy, there rose
up masters and schools of sword-cutlery.              There was a time when
the blades of Bordeaux and Poitiers had the best price in the English
market ; but soon those of Toledo, combining beauty, strength, and
elasticity, gained that eminence of which the tradition still clings to
them.     Othello's " sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper," was such
an one as these now before us.         And Shakespeare, be it noted, knew
here, as always, exactly what he was speaking of ; for it was long
believed that the quality of the finest blades depended on their being
tempered in mountain streams.          Germany was not far behind in the
race either ; the Solingen blades, stouter and rougher than the
Spanish ones, but for that reason fitter for common military service,
made their trade-mark of a running wolf known throughout the north
of Europe.     The wolf, or hieroglyphic symbol that passed for one,
was easily taken for a fox.       Hence, it should seem, the cant name of
fox for a sword, which is current in our Elizabethan literature.           " O,
Signieur Dew, thou diest on point of fox," cries Pistol to his captive
on the field of Agincourt.       A still greater reputation was gained by
the strong and keen broadswords bearing the name of Andrea Ferara,
long a puzzle to antiquaries from the want of positive knowledge
whether he was of Italian or Spanish origin.             The story that he was
invited to Scotland by James V. appears to be mere guess-work.
There exists, however, contemporary evidence that some time after
1580 two brothers, Giovan Donato and Andrea dei Ferari, were well-
known sword-makers, working at Belluno in Friuli, the Illyrian
territory of Venice ; and this goes far to settle the question between
Spain and Italy.*       Probably the name of Ferara became a kind of
trade-mark, and was used afterwards by many successors or imitators.
    During this time the Spanish and Italian rapier was undergoing
its peculiar development, and leading the way to the modern art of
fencing.    But this takes us out of the general line of history into a
distinct branch. We have henceforth to consider the sword, not as
the simple following out of a given primitive form, but as a weapon
diverging from that form in two directions.            It may be specialised as
a cutting or as   a thrusting  arm.   In  the  military sabre of our own time
we find both qualities reconciled by a sufficiently effective compromise,
but only after a long course of experiments.
     For many centuries the armourers and swordsmen of the East
have cultivated the edge at the expense of the point, and have attained
a partly just and partly fabulous renown.               The point, after being
neglected since the days of the Eomans, has made up its lost time in
the West, and made it up triumphantly ; for it is now admitted that
the swordsman who would be a complete master of the edge must have

learnt the ways of the point also.       Let us take the earlier stage first,
as shown in the cutting swords of the East.        Broadly speaking, their
characteristic feature is a decidedly curved blade as opposed to the
straight or nearly straight European form. Not that all old European
swords are straight, or all Eastern swords curved.         There are curved
blades of mediaeval and even earlier times (one prehistoric example is
in the Copenhagen Museum), and one remarkable type of Indian sword,
the Mahratta gauntlet sword (Pat a), is quite straight ; but the contrast
holds good in the main. The object of curvature is to gain cutting
power.     When a straight sword strikes its object full, the direction of
the stroke is at right angles to the length of the blade ; and the amount
of resistance, for a given velocity of stroke and substance to be cut, is
measured by the acuteness of the angle shown by a transverse section
of the cutting blade.    The finer this angle, the less the resistance. In
the case of an instrument not intended to bear rough usage or cut hard
bodies, or much of any substance at one stroke (as a razor), it is only
a question of workmanship how fine the angle can be made.           But with
a sword it is otherwise.     Without a certain amount of thickness, the
best steel blade would be too fragile or too flexible, so that in practice
the limit up to which its cutting power can be increased by fining
down the edge is soon reached.      But now let the blow be delivered in
a direction not at right angles, but oblique to the axis of the blade.
The angle of resistance will then be given by an oblique section of
the blade, and in proportion to the obliquity it will be finer than the
angle of a straight cross section.     It is on exactly the same principle
that the steepness of a road or path on a mountain side is diminished
by giving it a zigzag course.     With a straight edge this effect can be
produced by    what is called a drawing cut.      But it is far more simply
and certainly produced by giving a permanent curvature to the edge
in the part where the stroke falls. A weapon thus formed cannot
help presenting an oblique section of the blade in the act of cutting,
and therefore will cut better than a straight weapon of similar trans-
verse section.   This is the principle of all curved swords, exemplified
in the choice Persian blades, in the common Indian sabre (Talwar),
and in the light cavalry sword of almost identical pattern which was
used in our own service in the Peninsular and Waterloo campaigns.
Near the hilt the blade is nearly straight, but towards the centre of
percussion it bends rapidly away.            This effect is enhanced by
mounting the sword so that the initial direction of the blade, from
which the curve falls back, makes a sensible angle with the line of
direction of the hilt, and goes before it to meet the object struck at ;
in the sword-smith's terms, by making the edge "lead forward."
Hence the elegant double curve made by the blade and hilt of the
Persian sabre. The same rule is followed, though less obviously, by
the most recent European patterns.       In Japanese swords it is reversed,
for some reason which    I have never seen explained.
    The use of a curved blade is of unknown antiquity in the East.
Its most ancient form was probably short, and broader at the point
                                                               2 c 2

than at the handle (the scimitar properly so called) ; an exaggerated
representation of this type is the conventional weapon of Orientals and
barbarians among the painters of the Eenaissance or even later.
Passing over earlier stages, however, let us come to the sabre which
was made known to Western Europe by the crusades, and whose form
and fashion have continued to our own day without notable change.
These Indian and Persian arms exhibit the perfection of a specialised
type. Great cutting power is gained by the curvature, which ensures
an oblique section of the blade, and therefore an acuter angle of
resistance, being presented to the object struck.         Everything else is
sacrificed to the power of the edge, and sacrificed deliberately.        The
small grip and the partial or total neglect of protection for the sword-
hand are part of the same plan.         Defence is left to the shield and
armour. The curious projecting pommel of the commonest pattern of
Indian sabre may act, indeed, as a guard for the wrist, bat it has other
uses ; it may become a weapon of offence at close quarters, it balances
the weight of the blade, and it may be grasped with the left hand for
a two-handed blow.       Scottish broadswords not uncommonly have a
kind of outside loop made in the hilt for the same purpose.
     More time and labour have been given to the making and adorn-
ment of choice weapons in Syria, Persia, and India than in any other
part of the world.       The best steel always came, it appears, from
India. Damascus has given its name to the characteristic processes
of Oriental metal-work, but has long ceased to be the chief seat of the
art : " the best blades at the present day are still made in Khorassan,
where the manufacture, has been carried on since the time of Timour,
who transported thither the best artificers of Damascus."*          Neverthe-
less, Damascus blades, or what purport to be such, are still freely sold
to travellers in the East.     One such purchaser,      I   am told, observed
that a number of these swords had the same inscription in Arabic
characters. He was unable to read it himself, but afterwards con-
sulted an Orientalist, who informed him that the writing signified —
   I
 " am not a Damascus blade." It may be believed that the interpre-
tation was faithful, for the jest is quite in the Persian manner. The
damasked or "watered" appearance of the blades which are most
highly esteemed in the East appears to have been originally due to an
accidental crystallisation of the steel in the process of conversion.
 The production of it was long thought a secret, but Western experts
 have now both explained and imitated it.f
     While we are among Indian weapons, we may learn from them
that the development of the sword from the dagger by successive
 steps and modifications is not a matter of mere archaeological con-
jecture. Almost conclusive proof is given by the series of inter-
 mediate forms between the straight broad dagger (Katar), with a
 handle formed by a pair of cross-bars set close together between two

 other bars parallel to the axis of the blade which serve as hand-guards,
and the long sword with gauntlet hilt called Pata. The dagger, as far
as the blade goes, is of a widespread type : the mediaeval short

swords, for example, called by modern antiquaries " anelace             or
  '                 "
    langue-de-boeuf   (though there is some doubt as to what anelace or
aulas, a name peculiar to England and of unknown origin, really
 means), are not unlike it.    But the mounting is peculiar, and enables
 us to follow the transitions.   First the blade is made about a third
 or a half longer. Then a kind of shell covering the back of the hand
is added to the bars of the hand-guard. In this form the weapon is
called " Bara jamdadu " (death-giver), aud seems to be known only in
a limited part of Southern India.        Finally the blade is lengthened
into a double-edged sword, and the hand-guard is closed in so as to
make a complete gauntlet-shaped hilt. The original cross-bar handle
remains, making the grip entirely different from that of an ordinary
sword.* One does not see how an arm thus mounted can be used
except for a sweeping blow, no room being given for the slightest
play of the wrist. It is not uncommon to find old Spanish or other
European blades mounted in these gauntlet hilts — a fact worth
noticing, to correct the popular impression that Eastern swords are
better than European ones.      This is far from being generally true.
Not only may old Spanish, Italian, or German blades be found in col-
lections of Oriental arms, but in quite modern times Indian horsemen
have been kuown to use by preference English light cavalry swords,
remounted in their own fashion, and to do terrible execution with
them.     European swords have been found ineffective in Indian war-
fare, not because they were bad in themselves, but because they were
not kept sharp like the Indian ones.      " A sharp sword will cut in
                                                                      any-
one's hand," said an old native trooper to Captain Nolan in answer to
questions as to the secret of the Indian horsemen's blows. And if
European sword-smiths do not produce habitually such elaborate work
as those of Persia and Damascus, it is not because they have not the
secret of their Eastern fellow-craftsmen, but because the time and
expense required for watered blades are such as would not be compen-
sated by the price obtainable in the Western market. Only in the
East, where men seem to take no count of time, and where centuries
have passed without historians and without any means of fixing dates,
could this branch of the armourer's art have arisen, or be regularly
practised.

feats performed by Richard and Saladin ; and most readers probably
imagine the cutting of the cushion and the veil to require some temper
to be found only in Oriental blades, or some refinement of address
peculiar to Oriental hands.            But these and other feats of Eastern
swordsmen have been and are repeated with success by Europeans in
our own time.        It is true that a light and very sharp sword, not the
service arm, is used for that special purpose.
     Various peculiar types of curved swords and more or less similar
weapons occur in different parts of the East.               One which deserves
special mention, from the distances to which it has travelled, is the
yataghan type.         The doubly- curved blade of the yataghan, still a
constant part of the armed Albanian's equipment, and a favourite
Turkish weapon,* is identical in form with the short sword or falchion
(Kopis) figured on sundry Greek monuments, and with the Kukri of
Nepal.      This last, indeed, is commonly broader and more curved ;
but there is an elongated variety of it which cannot be distinguished
from the yataghan, and which occurs in Nepal itself, in the Deccan,
and in Sind.       A precisely similar arm, probably imported by Roman
auxiliaries, has been found at Cordova and elsewhere in Spain, and
may be seen in the Pitt-Rivers collection and the Musee d'Artillerie.
It makes a very handy and formidable weapon, combining, if not too
much curved, a strong cutting edge with considerable thrusting power.
Of its birthplace,      I believe, nothing is known ; it is more or less used
in all the Mahometan parts of Asia, and the geographical distribution
would point to Persia or thereabouts for a common origin ; but then
 Persia is just the country where the thing seems to be least common,
 and the word is purely Turkish.           It is not impossible that, notwith-
 standing the strong temptation to make out a pedigree, we have here
a case of independent invention in two or more distinct quarters ; and
 in fact the Kukri of the Gorkhas is stated (on what authority                   I  do
 not know) to be derived from a bill-hook used for woodcutter's work
 in the jungles. In modern times the yataghan has been the parent of
 the French sword-bayonet, and it was even proposed by Colonel
 Marey, the author of a full and ingenious monograph on the forms
 and qualities of swords, to make the infantry officer's sword of this
 pattern.
       There are many kinds of outlandish weapons, in Nepal and farther
 east, of which the edge has a concave instead of a convex curvature.
  I doubt whether these be properly swords ; at all events, they have
 had no influence on European forms.                 The Japanese swords also
  stand by themselves,         though they are historically nothing but a
  superior variety of the general type which is found in China and
  Burmah, and to some extent in the Malay archipelago.                     They are
  exceedingly sharp, but have no flexibility at all.            It may be worth
  noting   that  the   custom    of  wearing   two  swords,  which    has been the

occasion of some curiosity and conjectural explanation, is not confined
to Japan.    Certain Arabs in the Mahratta service are stated to have
done the same.*        The two swords of the Japanese, however, are of
such different sizes as to be rather comparable to the sword and
dagger of Europeans, and perhaps there is really nothing to explain.
     We pass now to the other special line of development, that of the
rapier and small-sword.         Whatever differences of opinion may be
possible about the sabre, there can be no doubt that the straight
sword which ultimately became a thrusting sword is an extension of
the dagger.     The East is rich in daggers of many forms, so rich that
in India alone a score of distinct names for distinct varieties of the
weapon appear to be current.          There is a broad difference, however,
between the straight and the curved daggers, and the modes of using
them ; the straight ones being held like a sword, the curved ones the
reverse way, with the little finger next the blade.           Among the curved
species is one of which the shape would be puzzling if it were not
known to be simply copied from a buffalo horn. The proof is that a
dagger of this class is sometimes nothing but the sj)lit and sharpened
buffalo horn itself.   I   am not sure that all the curved daggers may
not be due to some imitation of this kind, and thus be quite uncon-
nected with the course of development              leading up to the modern
sword. That the curved sabre is modified from a straight sword, not
enlarged from a curved dagger,         is, I  think, too plain for discussion.
The broad-bladed straight dagger          which  lengthened into the gauntlet-
hilted sword has already been mentioned.             But neither in this nor in
any other case does the enlargement of the dagger appear to have
suggested in the East the fabrication or use of full-sized sword with
                                                               a
thrusting for its chief or sole purpose.            The rapier, the duelling
sword, and the art of fencing, are purely Western inventions.              Before
going further, let us put needful distinction of terms beyond mistake.
                               a
A   duelling sword and     a  rapier are not the same thing, though they
are often confused.         The rapier       is  cut-and-thrust sword so far

modified as to be used chiefly for pointing, but not to the complete
exclusion of the edge. The duelling sword                      weapon made, and
                                                               is

capable of being used, for pointing only.           Such      construction would
be naturally first applied to the dagger, as its cutting edges could
never be of much offensive service unless                 were of

clumsy type.      Cutting power being         once   regarded as secondary or
superfluous,   the two-edged blade            isnarrowed for convenience of
carriage, perhaps also of concealment, until thickening becomes neces-
sary to make   it   strong enough.       This reinforcement may be effected
by  a ridge  on  either  side of  the  blade,  or by    ridge on one side only,

<k             "
  median ridge we get a blade of quadrangular section, not corre-
sponding to anything now in familiar use. Both the three-edged and
the four-edged shape occur among mediaeval daggers ; they are also
found, though exceptionally, in Indian specimens.     It is difficult to
say when they were introduced.     We have a distinct record of three-
edged swords or long daggers having been employed at the battle of
Bovines (a.d. 1214); they are specially described by the chronicler as
a novelty.*   But no example of so early a date appears to be either
preserved or figured anywhere ; and it was as nearly as possible five
centuries afterwards that the bayonet-shaped small-sword prevailed
over the rapier. It is worth noticing that some of the Scottish broad-
swords of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries have a
" median ridge " so
                     strongly marked as to make them almost three-
edged.
    As for the two-edged rapier, its parentage is obvious. It is the
military sword of all work, in the form it had assumed in the first
half of the sixteenth century, lengthened, narrowed, and more finely
pointed.f   The interesting question               is,
                                          what led to the use of the

protected by armour, there was no necessity and no scope for fine
swordsmanship. Hard hitting was the only kind of attack worth culti-

at short ranges      source of positive danger, just as nowadays, when

being abandoned as worse than useless against fire-arms,            becameit
needful to resort to skill instead of mechanical protection for defence

  scurity about the local origin of the rapier and of fencing.             A credible
  tradition refers it to Spain, whence it was imported into Italy by the
  Spanish armies early in the sixteenth century. The finest old rapiers
  are Spanish, and there is mention of very early Spanish books on the
  subject, which, however, do not seem to be extant.*
     From Italy the fashion came into France and England, and "spread
  apace, not without grumbling from the older sort of gentlemen and
  soldiers, of which the echoes are yet audible to us in sundry passages
 of Shakespeare.         At some time between 1570 and 1580 the rapier be-
 came the favourite companion of the exquisites of London.                  " Shortly
 after (the twelfth or thirteenth year of Queen Elizabeth)," says
 Howes, the continuer of Stow's ' Annals,' " began long tucks, and
 long rapiers, and he was held the greatest gallant, that had the deepest
 ruff and longest rapier : the offence to the eye of the one, and the
 hurt unto the life of the subject that came by the other, caused her
 Majesty to make proclamation against them both, and to place selected
 grave citizens at every gate to cut the ruffs and break the rapiers'
 points of all passengers that exceeded a yard in length of their
 rapiers, and a nail of a yard in depth of their ruffs." A later writer
 fixes the date of this proclamation to 1586, and adds that it forbad
                   "
 rapiers to be carried, as they had been before, upwards in a hectoring
manner," but says nothing of the ruffs. f In 1594-5 two English
treatises appeared on the new art of fence, one translated from the
Italian of Giacomo di Grassi, the other the work of Vincentio Saviolo,J
an Italian master established in England.                 The translator of Grassi
tells us in his " Advertisement to the Eeader," that " the sword and
buckler fight was long while allowed in England (and yet practice
in all sorts of weapons is praiseworthy), but now being laid down,
the sword, but with serving-men, is not much regarded : § and the

rapier fight generally allowed, as a weapon because most perilous,
therefore most feared, and thereupon private quarrels and common
frays most shunned." On the other hand, some partisans of the old
sword and buckler play maintained its excellence on the express
ground that men skilled in it might fight as long as they pleased
without hurting one another; and others denounced the rapier as
" that mischievous and imperfect weapon which serves to kill our
friends in peace, but cannot much hurt our foes in war" (George
Silver, 'Paradoxes of Defence,' 1599). But they were soon dis-
comfited.     In 1617 we find one Joseph Swetnam, a garrulous and not
original author, declaring that the short sword or back-sword (a stout
sword so called from having only one edge) is against the rapier
" little better than a tobacco pipe or a fox tail." We must not sup-
pose that the rapier fight of the sixteenth century resembled modern
fencing. It was the commoner practice to hold a dagger in the left
 hand for parrying ; this, by the way, has an odd analogy in China,
 where instruments like blunt skewers are used for the same purpose.
 And not only did the use of the dagger, or in its absence of the
 gauntleted left hand, make the conditions different from those of the
 modern fencing-school, but the principles and methods were as yet
                                                                '
 crude and unformed. The fencing-match in ' Hamlet is now presented
 according to the modern fashion, and Dumas and Gautier, both of
 whom knew the historic truth well enough, freely introduce the
 modern terms and rules into the single combats of their novels.               In
 each case this course is justified by artistic necessity.         But if we look
 to the engravings in Saviolo or Grassi, we shall find that Hamlet and
 Laertes, when the play was a novelty at the Globe Theatre, stood at
 what would now be thought an absurdly short distance (for the lunge,
 or delivery of the thrust by a swift forward movement of the right
 foot and body, with the left foot as a fixed point, was not yet invented),
 with their sword-hands down at their knees, the points of their rapiers
 directed not to the breast but to the face of the adversary, and their
 left hands held up in front of the shoulder in a singularly awkward
 attitude. A great object was to seize the adversary's sword-hilt with
 the left hand; and this perhaps explains the "scuffling" in which
 Hamlet and Laertes change foils — a thing barely possible in a
 fencing-match of the present day.            An incidental illustration of the
 part  of the  left hand   in defence    is given in { Romeo and Juliet,' where
 it is related that Mercutio
                                " with one hand beats
                    Cold death aside, and. with the other sends
                    It buck to Tybalt."'
 The duel with rapier and dagger had particular rules of its own ; and
  the handling of a
                        " case of rapiers "
                                               (that is, a rapier in either hand)
  was also taught, but, one would think, only for display.
      During this period the use of the edge was combined with that of
  the point, but the point was preferred.              " To tell the truth," says

1883.]                 on the   Forms and History of     the Sword.           393
Saviolo,     "I
              would not advise any friend of mine, if he were to fight

for his credit and life, to strike neither mandrittas nor riversas (the
technical names of direct and back-handed cuts), " because he puts
himself in danger of his life ; for to use the point is more ready, and
spends not the like time.'-'     In the books of the seventeenth century
the instructions for mandrittas and riversas disappear accordingly,
and at the beginning of the eighteenth we find the small-sword in
existence and the rapier gradually giving place to it.          Experiments
had already been made with thrusting blades of triangular or quad-
rangular section ; at least, specimens of such, ascribed to the early
seventeenth or even the end of the sixteenth century, may be seen in
museums.      In some of these cases, however, one would like to ascer-
tain that a more recent blade has not been mounted in a hilt of the
period attributed to the weapon.        Be that as it may, the small-sword
completely prevailed     over the  two-edged rapier some time about 1715.
At the same time that the form of the blade was changed, its length,
which had been excessive, was reduced to a handier and not less
effective compass.     A sword 36 inches long was reckoned short at
the beginning of the seventeenth century, and some rapiers extend to
four feet and more.      The standard length of the modern small-sword
and its representative for fencing purposes,          the foil, is from 32
to 34 inches only.       Sir William Hope, of Edinburgh, writing in
1692, considers three-quarters of an ell to be " an indifferent good
length," that is, " neither too long, which would be unhandsome            e. (i.
unhandy or clumsy), nor         too  short, which    would be very incon-
          "
venient      :taking the ell at 45 inches, this comes very near the
present measure.      As regards the mounting and guard also, there was
a  marked return to simplicity.         The elaborate work of the Spanish
rapier-hilts disappears,   to  be replaced by     plain shell guard for the
                                                     a

                                a
decoration      desired, for the walking-sword which every gentleman
                 if
habitually wore until near the end of the last century. Meanwhile
the art of fencing made rapid progress, and may be said to have been
fixed in substance upon its modern lines by 1750 or thereabouts. To
give an account of its development before and since that time would
require not      part of
                  a         discourse, nor

             is
a  reflection of the general temper, and even the tastes and style of the
age.    The sword of each period seems fitted by no mere accident to

   394                      Mr. Frederick Pollock                 [June   1,
   the gentlemen, botli scholars and soldiers, like Bassanio, who wore
   and handled it.    The long rapier, with its quillons and cunningly
  wrought metal-work, and somewhat rigid hand-hold, is a kind of
  visible image of the stately and involved periods of Elizabethan prose.
   I can persuade myself that it was not in the nature of things for
  Sidney or Raleigh to be otherwise armed.        When we come to the
  great forerunners of modern English, Hobbes (who has iu nowise for-
  gotten to put a sword in the right hand of the mystical figure
  representing the might of the State in the frontispiece to his
  '
    Leviathan ') seems to wield an Andrea Ferara, such a blade and so
  mounted as Cromwell's, dealing nimbly and shrewdly with both edge
  and point.    And in the exquisite dialectic of Berkeley and Hume, as
  clear and graceful as it is subtle, and without a superfluous word, we
 surely have the true counterpart of the finished play of the small-
  sword, the perfection of single combat.      Warfare is on a grander
  scale now, the controversies of philosophers as well as the campaigns
  of generals.     There are modern philosophical arguments which
 profess to be more weighty, as they are certainly more voluminous,
 than Hume's or Berkeley's, and which remind one not of an assault
 between two strong and supple fencers in which every movement can
 be followed, but of a modern field-day, where there is much hurrying
 to and fro, much din, dust, and smoke, and extreme difficulty in
 discovering what is really going on.
       But our story is not fully done. At the same time, or almost the
 same time, with the small-sword there came in an offshoot of this
  class of weapons which has a curious little history of its own, namely
 the bayonet, a modified dagger in its immediate origin, but influenced
 in its settled ordinary form by the small-sword, and by the sabre
 and yataghan in various experimental forms which have ended in the
 sword-bayonet largely used in Continental services, and to some
 extent in our own.     There is a new French pattern of this weapon in
 which the yataghan curve is abandoned; though quite straight, it
 still has only one edge. It seems a considerable improvement on the
 shape which we have copied from an older French model.             There
have been some rather pretentious writings in France and elsewhere
 about the reduction of bayonet practice to a system ;   I am inclined to
think that a man who knows how to use the point of a sword (the
necessary foundation of all skill in hand-weapons) will very soon
learn what the bayonet is and is not capable of.
      A word is also due to the modern military sabre. This, broadly
speaking, is a continuation of the straight European military sword
of the sixteenth century, lengthened and lightened after the example
of the rapier, but one-edged instead of two-edged (which, according
to the French authorities, is the decisive mark of sabre as distinguished
fn m epee), and in many cases more or less curved after the fashion of
the Eastern swords.      Meanwhile, the long straight sword has thrown
out a most eccentric development, or even " sport," in the shape of
the German Schlager with which students' duels are fought.            This

1883.]            on the  Forms and History of     the Sword.             395
is too remotely connected with the main part of the subject to be
dwelt upon here ; the duels in question, for the rest, have been often
and pretty recently described by English observers.            The rapier and
the small-sword are weapons of single combat, not of general military
use ; the small-sword is too fragile, the rapier both too fragile and too
long, for a soldier's convenience.      It is true that it was proposed by no
less an authority than Marshal Saxe to arm cavalry with long bayonet-
 shaped swords, and his opinion has been followed by at least one
 modern writer.     But it is founded on the erroneous notion that a good
 cutting sabre cannot have a good point, and therefore either the edge
 or the point must be wholly sacrificed: a notion which has so far
 prevailed that late in the eighteenth century an excessively curved
light cavalry sabre (apparently copied with close fidelity from an
Indian model) was introduced throughout the armies of Europe. It
 was the weapon of our light dragoons all through the Peninsular and
Waterloo campaigns, and effective for cutting, but almost or quite
useless for pointing.     Even now there remains a certain difference in
 most services between the shape of the light and the heavy cavalry
 swords, the heavy cavalry sword being straighter, or sometimes per-
 fectly straight.   But it is pretty well understood by this time that
 one and the same sword can be made, though not so perfect for
 thrusting as the duelling sword, nor so powerful for cutting as an
 Indian talwar or the old dragoon sabre, yet a very sufficient weapon
 for both purposes.     A blade of moderate length, not too broad, and
 lightened by one or more grooves running nearly from hilt to point,
 may be shaped with a curve too slight to interfere gravely with the
 use of the point, yet sensible enough to make a difference in favour
 of the edge. This plan is now generally followed.
      The use of the edge, after being unduly neglected in consequence
 of the startling effectiveness of the rapier-point, has also been more
 carefully studied in modern times.         Closely connected with the error
 just   now  mentioned,   that  the  same   blade cannot be good for both
 cutting or thrusting, is an equally erroneous belief that a cut cannot
 be delivered with sufficient force except by exposing one's whole
  body.    The old masters of rapier-fence already knew better.          What
                                                              " By my counsel
  says Grassi in the contemporary English version ?
  he that would deliver an edge-blow shall fetch no compass with his
  shoulder, because whilst he beareth his sword far off, he giveth time
  to the wary enemy to enter first ; but he shall only use the compass
  of the elbow and the wrist : which, as they be most swift, so are they
  strong enough if they be orderly handled."             This is exactly what
  the  best  modern  teachers  say.    Though    sabre-play   cannot rival the
  refinements of the lighter      and   more    subtle  small-sword, there is
  much more science in it than would be supposed by any one not
  acquainted with the matter ; and it may easily be seen that a pair of
  single-stick players who have learnt from a good master do, in fact,
  expose themselves wonderfully little.        Nor is it easy to say on which
  side the advantage ought       to be  in a  combat between foil and sabre,

the players being of fairly equal skill, and each acquainted with the
use of both weapons.
    My final word, albeit it savour of egotism, shall be one of practical
testimony and counsel to a generation of students.         I must add my
voice to those of a long chain of authorities, medical and other, to
bear witness that the exercise of arms, whether in the school of the
small-sword, or in the practice, more congenial, perhaps, to the
English nature, of the sturdier sabre, is the most admirable of regular
correctives for the ill habits of a sedentary life.    It is as true now
as when George Silver wrote it under Queen Elizabeth, that
                                                                     " the
exercising of weapons putteth away aches, griefs, and diseases, it
increaseth strength and sharpeneth the wits, it giveth a perfect
judgment, it expelleth melancholy, choleric and evil conceits, it
keepeth a man in breath, perfect health, and long life."

                     J. G. Crawford, Esq.
                     Gustavus Steinthal, Esq.
were elected Members of the       Royal Institution.
     The decease of Mr. William Spottiswoode, Pres. R.S. Manager
and Vice-President, on June 27th, was announced from the Chair.
    In conformity with Resolutions passed by the Managers and
Members, a Sub-Committee of Managers met this day and passed the
following Resolutions :—
     Resolved : " That the Managers of the Royal Institution desire to record
         their profound regret for the recent death of Mr. William Spottis-
         woode, who for so many years, as Manager, Treasurer, or Secretary,
         rendered such eminent services to the Royal Institution.
             " In him the world has lost a man of the first distinction. While
         his own researches have done much to advance the progress of
         mathematical and physical science, his encouragement          and wise
         counsels to other workers have also been of the utmost value.       As
         President of the Royal Society he has fulfilled the duties of his high
         office with conspicuous ability and success.
            " As one of the heads of the important public establishment, with
         which his family has been long connected, it is known that he
         afforded an admirable example of what should be the conduct of one
         placed in a position of so much responsibility and authority.
            " His interest in all that tends to promote the general welfare of
         humanity was equally remarkable.         No good work of a public
         nature, which came within the range of his means, was ever allowed
         to proceed without his aid and sympathy.
            "His character presented a remarkable combination of intellectual
         strength and fine moral qualities.   His judgment was unerring, and
         of so discreet a kind, as to ensure for it a deference which was
         universal.     In private life his kindliness, courtesy, and general
         culture, endeared him to his friends, and engaged the regard of all
         who were so fortunate as to become acquainted with him.
    Vol. X.                                                          2 D

               " The public tribute paid to the memory of the late President of
            the Eoyal Society, by his interment in Westminster Abbey, is a
            striking proof of the general esteem in which he was held.
               " It rests for the Managers to express their deep
                                                                           sympathy with
            Mrs. Spottiswoode, and the other members of Mr. Spottiswoode's
            family, under their heavy bereavement."
       Resolved   :
                    " That  a Copy of this Resolution be forwarded to Mrs. Spottis-
            woode."

  1883.]                       General Monthly Meeting.                             405
       The following Resolution, passed by the Managers at their Meeting
  this day, was read     : —
      "In the death of Sir William Siemens the Royal Institution has lost an
  eminent member and a generous friend.           The outcome of his great practical
  researches was frequently brought before us in lectures delivered in our theatre ;
  he was our benefactor in presenting to us apparatus of great value ; while his
  wise counsel, as a Manager, was ever ready when the interests of the Institution
  required it. He showed his veneration for one of its Professors by naming a
  vessel — a model one of its kind — constructed under his personal supervision for
  the transport and laying down of telegraphic cables, 'The Faraday.'         In every-
  thing he touched, practical genius, guided by a knowledge" of principles not
 frequent among practical men, was displayed.        In the domains of heat, electricity,
 and metallurgy he won his chief renown; and here the ultimate issues of his
 labours are at present incalculable.     England, the land of his adoption, has lost
 through his death an engineer of singular power, penetration, and many-sidedness.
 The source of the quality last mentioned, by which he was characterised, was,
 first of all, inherent ability, and, secondly, the comprehensive scientific education
 which he received in the seminaries and universities of his native land. He came
 to us thoroughly equipped with the theoretic knowledge necessary for practical
 ends, and he applied that knowledge successfully in the most varied spheres of
 action.    As regards invention, he came of a family to the manner born: all his
 brothers, and especially his eldest brother, the celebrated Dr. Werner Siemens,
 having achieved distinction in applying science to the uses of life. William
 Siemens was a man of the most charming disposition, genial, kindly, without
 jealousy or bitterness, and as a natural result he secured not only the respect but
 the warm affection of those who intimately knew him.         The Members who were
 present on the occasion of our last Monthly Meeting will not readily forget the
 animated description he then gave us from the Chair, of a new application of
 steam power which he had just seen tried on the River Spree, near Berlin. How
little could the freshness and the vigour of that exposition prepare his hearers
for the catastrophe so soon to follow ! Among the Members of the Ro\ al Institu-
tion he has left many mourning friends, who profoundly sympathise with his
family in their great bereavement, and more especially with Lady Siemens in
her irreparable loss."
      The following Lecture Arrangements were announced : —

  1883.]           Professor Tyndall    on Count   Rumford,   dtc.              407
            Professor Tyndall, D.C.L. LL.D. F.R.S. M.R.L
         On Count Rumford,        Originator of    the  Royal Institution.
                   (Lectures delivered May  3, 10, and 17, 1883.)
 On a bright calm day in the autumn of 1872 — that portion of the
 year called,    I  believe, in America the Indian summer —             I  made a
 pilgrimage   to  the  modest   birthplace of  Count   Rumford,    the  originator
 of the Royal Institution.       My guide on the occasion was Dr. George
 Ellis of Boston, and a more competent guide              I  could not possibly
 have had.   To Dr. Ellis the American Academy of Arts and Sciences
had committed the task of writing a life of Rumford, and this labour
of love had been accomplished in 1871, a year prior to my visit to
the United States.        In regard to Rumford's personal life, Dr. Ellis's
elaborate volume constitutes, if         I may so speak, the quarry out of
which the building materials of these lectures are drawn. The life
of such a man, however, cannot be duly taken in without reference to
his work, and the publication by the American Academy of Sciences
of four large volumes of Rumford's essays renders the task of dealing
with his labours lighter than it would have been, had his writings
been suffered to remain scattered in the magazines, journals, and
transactions of learned societies to which they were originally com-
municated.
     The name of Count Rumford was Benjamin Thompson.                          For
thirty years    he   was    the contemporary     of   another   Benjamin,     who
reached a level of fame as high as his own.            Benjamin Franklin and
Benjamin Thompson were born within twelve miles of each other, and
for six of the thirty years just referred to the one lived in England
and the other in France.          Yet there is nothing to show that they
ever saw each other, or were in any way acquainted with each other,
or, indeed, felt the least interest in each other.            As regards post-
humous fame, Rumford has in England fared worse than Franklin.
For ten, or perhaps a hundred, people in this country, who know
something of the career of the one, hardly a unit is to be found
acquainted with the career of the other.          Among scientific men, how-
ever, the figure of Rumford presents itself with singular impressive-
ness at the present day — a result mainly due to the establishment
of the grand scientific generalisation known as the Mechanical
Theory of Heat. Boyle, and Hooke, and Locke, and Leibnitz, had
more or less distinctly ranged themselves on the side of this theory.
But by experiments conducted on a scale unexampled at the time,
and by reasonings, founded on these experiments, of singular force
and penetration, Rumford has made himself a conspicuous landmark

 in the history of the theory. His inference from his experiments
 was, as many of yon know, that heat is a form of motion.
      The town of Woburn, connected in my memory with a cultivated
companion, with genial sunshine and the bright colouring of American
trees, is nine miles distant from the city of Boston. In North Woburn,
a little way off, on March 26th, 1753, Rumford was born.         He came
of people who had to labour for their livelihood, who tilled their
own fields, cut their own timber and fuel, worked at their varied
trades, and thus maintained the independence of New England
yeomen.       Thompson's father died when he was two years old. His
mother married again, and had children by her second husband ; but
the affection between her and her first-born remained strong and
unbroken to the end of her life. The arrangements made for the
maintenance of mother and son throw some light upon their position.
She was to have the use of one-half of a garden ; the privilege of land
to raise beans for sauce ; to receive within a specified time 80 weight
of beef, 8 bushels of rye, 2 bushels of malt, and 2 barrels of cider.
Finally, she had the liberty of gathering apples to bake, and three
bushels of apples every year.
      The fatherless boy had been placed under the care of a guardian,
from whom his stepfather, Josiah Pierce, received a weekly allowance
of two shillings and fivepence for the child's maintenance.         Young
Thompson received his first education from Mr. John Fowle, a
graduate of Harvard College, described by Dr. Ellis as "an accom-
plished and faithful man." He also went to a school at Byfield, kept
by a relation of his own.      At the age of eleven, he was placed for a
 time under the tuition of Mr. Hill, " an able teacher in Medford,"
 adjoining Woburn.       The lad's mind was ever active, and his inven-
 tion incessantly exercised, but for the most part on subjects beside his
 daily work. In relation to that work, he came to be regarded as
 " indolent, flighty, and unpromising."         His guardians, at length
 thinking    it  advisable to  change  his  vocation, apprenticed him in
 October 1766, to Mr. John Appleton,      of Salem, an  importer of British
 goods.     Here, however, instead of wooing customers to his master's
 counter, he occupied himself with tools and implements hidden
 beneath it.    He is reported to have been a skilful musician, passion-
 ately fond of music of every kind ; and during his stay with
 Mr. Appleton, whenever he could do so without being heard, he
  solaced his leisure by performances on the violin.
      By the Eev. Thomas Barnard, minister of Salem, and his son,
 young Thompson was taught algebra, geometry, and astronomy. By
  self-practice, he became an able and accurate draughtsman. He did
 not escape that last infirmity of ingenious minds — the desire to con-
  struct a perpetual motion. He experimented with fireworks, and was
 once seriously burnt by the unexpected ignition of his materials. His
 inquisitiveness is illustrated by the questions put to his friend Mr.
 Baldwin in 1769. He wishes to be told the direction pursued by the

  1883.]   on Count  Bumford, Originator of       the Boyal Institution.    409
 rays of light under certain conditions ; he desires to know the cause of
 the change of colour which fire produces in clay.          "Please," he adds,
 " to give the nature, essence, beginning of existence, and rise of the
 wind in general, with the whole theory thereof, so as to be able to
 answer all questions relative thereto."         One might suppose him to be
 preparing for a competitive examination. He grew expert in drawing
 caricatures, a spirited group of which has been reproduced by Dr.
 Ellis. It is called a Council of State, and embraces a jackass with
 twelve human heads.         These sketches were found in a mutilated
 scrap-book,  which   also  contains   a kind of journal of his proceedings
 in 1769, when he changed his place in Salem for a situation in a
 dry-goods store in Boston. He mentions a French class which he
 attended in the evenings, records the purchase of a certain measure of
 black cloth, states his debt to his uncle Hiram Thompson for part of
 the rent of a pew.     The liabilities thus incurred he met by cutting
 and carting firewood.     Mixed with entries such as these are " direc-
 tions for the backsword," in which the postures of the combatants
 are defined, and illustrated by sketches.          The scrap-book also con-
tains an account of the expense he had been at " towards getting an
 electrical machine."     Soon afterwards he began the study of medicine
under Dr. John Hay, of Woburn.
     Thompson keeps a strict account of his debts to Dr. Hay ; credits
him with a pair of leather gloves ; credits Mrs. Hay with knitting
him a pair of stockings. These items he tacks on to the more serious
cost of his board from December 1770 to June 1772 at forty shillings,
old currency, per week, amounting to 156Z. The specie payments of
Thompson were infinitesimal, eight of them amounting in the aggre-
gate to 21.    His further forms of payment illustrate the habits of
the community in w7hich he dwelt.           Want of money caused them to
fall back upon barter. He debits Dr. Hay with the following items,
the value of which no doubt had been previously agreed upon between
them. "To ivory for smoke machine; parcels of butter, coffee,
sugar, and tea, parcels of various drugs, camphor, gum benzoine,
arsenic, calomel, and rhubarb : one-half of white sheep-skin leather ;
brass wire ; white oak timber ; to sundry lots of wood ; to other lots
delivered while   I was at Wilmington,         and left by me when    I  was at
Wilmington the last time ; to a blue Huzza cloak, bought of Zebediah
Wyman, and paid for by fifteen and a half cords of wood ; a pair of
knee buckles ; a chirurgical knife ; to a cittern, and to the time            I
have been absent from your house, nineteen weeks at forty shillings ;
and for the time my mother washed for me."               To help him, more-
over,  to eke out the  funds   necessary   for  the prosecution of his studies,
Thompson tried his     hand   from  time  to  time at school teaching.
     At this early age, for he was not more than seventeen, he had
learnt not only the importance of order in the distribution of his
working time, but also the importance of exercise and relaxation.
The four and twenty hours of a single day are thus spaced out.

want to peruse."
      In 1771 he managed, by walking daily from Woburn to Cambridge
and back, a distance of some sixteen miles, to attend the lectures on
natural philosophy delivered by Professor Winthrop in Harvard
College.        This privilege was secured to him by his friend Mr.
Baldwin, with whom about this time he appears to have quarrelled.
The difference, however, was rapidly adjusted, and it left no abiding
trace behind.           Thompson had taught school for a short time at
Wilmington, and afterwards for six weeks and three days at Bradford,
where his repute rose so high that he received a call to Concord, the
capital town of New Hampshire, situated higher up than Bradford on
the river Merrimac.            The Indian name of Concord was Penacook. In
1733 it had been incorporated as a town in Essex county, Massa-
chusetts.         Some of the early settlers in Essex county had come from
the English Essex ; and, as regards pronunciation, they carried with
them the name of the English Essex town, Komford, of brewery
celebrity.         They, however, changed the first o into u, calling the
American town Rumford.                Strife had occurred as to the county or
state to which Rumford belonged.                    But the matter was amicably
settled at last ; and to denote the subsequent harmony, the name was
changed from Rumford to Concord.*                     In later years, when honours
     *  In  connection    with this subject  I  have been favoured with the following
interesting letter : —

     " I venture    to proffer a remark upon a detail in your interesting paper upon
 Count Rumford.                                           I
                      My apology for so doing is that am a Romford man, and that
I  think you may care for the mere crumb of information          I possess bearing upon
the spelling and pronunciation of the name of my native place.
     "Romford is always pronounced Rwmford by Essex folk. When                    I was a
 boy it was spelled almost indifferently, Romford and Rumford.           I remember that
the post-mark in my school days (some forty years ago) was Rumford.             Norden's
map of Essex (1599) has Rumforde ; and on Bowen's map (1775) the spelling is
the same — Rumford.          The registers in the vestry book, from 1665 until some
fifty years ago, give Rumford.       So that I  think it safe to say that the traditional
spelling and pronunciation with the Essex settlers at Concord must have been
Rumford.        I  must, however, add — but   I  fear  I am hardly justified in troubling
you with so long a note — that the o occurs in two Latin entries in the Register —
         " 1
             1564,  Baptizata fuit Anna Baylie filia Hugonis Cissor, Romford.'
u  And in     the same year there is an entry of a burial with * Romfordiae.'            I
believe it    was the Latinizing of Rumford that modified the vowel, the alteration
being prompted by the mistaken notion that the etymology of the place was

1883.]       on Count    Bumford, Originator of         the Boyal Institution.     411
fell thick upon him, Eumford was made a Count of the Holy Roman
Empire.        He chose for his title Count Rumford, in memory of his
early association with Concord.
     " When Benjamin Thompson went to Concord as a teacher, he was
in the glory of his youth, not having yet reached manhood.                         His
friend Baldwin describes him as of a fine manly make and figure,
nearly six feet in height, of handsome features, bright blue eyes, aud
dark auburn hair. He had the manners and polish of a gentleman,
with fascinating wrays, and an ability to make himself agreeable."*                 In
Concord, at the time of Thompson's arrival, there dwelt the widow of
 a Colonel Rolfe with her infant son.                     Her husband had died in
December 1771, leaving a large estate behind him. Eumford was
indebted to Mrs. Rolfe's father, the Rev. Timothy Walker, minister
of Concord, for counsel, and to her brother for civility and hos-
pitality.     There the widow and the teacher met, and their meeting was
a prelude to their marriage.          Rumford, somewhat ungallantly, told his
friend Pictet in after years that she married him rather than he her.
She was obviously a woman of decision. As soon as they were
engaged, an old curricle, left by her father, was fished up, and, therein
mounted, she carried Thompson to Boston, and committed him to the
care of the tailor and hairdresser.             This journey involved a drive of
sixty  miles.        On the  return,  it is    said,   they called at the house of
Thompson's mother, who,           when   she     saw  him, exclaimed, " Why, Ben,
my son, how could you go and lay out all your winter's earnings in
           "
finery ?        Thompson was nineteen when he married, his wife being
thirty-three.
     In 1772 he became acquainted with Governor Wentworth, then
resident at Portsmouth.          On the 13th of November there was a grand
military review at Dover, New Hampshire, ten miles from Ports-
mouth, at which Thompson was present. On two critical occasions
in the life of this extraordinary man his appearance on horse-
back apparently determined the issues of that life.                      As he rode
among the soldiers at Dover, his figure attracted the attention of the
governor, and on the day following, he was the great man's guest.                   So
impressed was Wentworth with his conversation that he at once made
up his mind to attach Thompson to the public service. To secure this

question.     The nearest ford town is //ford, with which the room;/ ford contrasts.
Of late the sluggish little river has come to be called the river Rom.          This is

 infinitely stronger claims.      He rapidly, however, became a favourite
 with the governor, and on his proposing, soon after his appointment,
 to make a survey of the White Mountains, Wentworth not only fell in
 with the idea, but promised, if his public duties permitted, to take
 part in the survey himself.      . It will be remembered      that at this time
 Thompson was not quite twenty years old.
     For a moment, in 1773, he appears in the character of a farmer,
and invokes the aid of a friend to procure for him supplies of grass
and garden seeds from England.            But amid pre-occupations of this
kind his scientific bias emerges.         After a brief reference to the seed
procured for him by his friend Baldwin, he proposes to the latter the
following question : " A certain cistern has three brass cocks, one of
which will empty it in 15 minutes, one in 30 minutes, and the other in
60 minutes. Qu. — How long would it take to empty the cistern if all
three cocks were to be opened at once ?           If  you are fond of a corre-
spondence    of this kind, and     will  favour  me     with an easy question,
Arithmetical or Algebraical,        I will endeavour to give as good an
account of it as possible.     If you find out an answer to the above im-
mediately,   I hope you will not take it as an affront, my proposing
anything    which  you may think so easy, for         I  must confess   I scarce
ever met with any little notion that puzzled me so much in my
life."
     In 1774 the ferment of discontent with the legislation of the mother
country had spread throughout the colony. Clubs and committees
were formed which often compelled men to take sides before the
                                                                           " Our
requisite data for forming a clear judgment had been obtained.
                             "
candour," says Dr. Ellis, must persuade us to allow that there were
reasons, or at least prejudices and apprehensions which might lead
honest and right-hearted men, lovers and friends of their birthland,
to oppose the rising spirit of independence as inflamed by dema-
gogues, and as foreboding discomfiture and mischief."                Thompson
became " suspect," though no record of any unfriendly or unpatriotic
act or speech on his part is to be found.           He was known to be on
friendly terms with Governor Wentworth, but the governor, when he
gave Thompson his commission, was highly popular in the province.
Prior to Wentworth's accession to office he " had strongly opposed
every measure of Great Britain which was regarded as encroaching
upon our liberties."    He thought himself, nevertheless, in duty bound
to stand by the royal authority when it was openly defied ; and this
naturally rendered him obnoxious.
     Thompson was a man of refractory temper, and the circumstances
of the time were only too well calculated to bring that temper out.

   " There was something," says Dr. Ellis, " exceedingly humiliating and
   degrading to a man of an independent and self-respecting spirit in the
   conditions imposed at times by the ' Sons of Liberty,' in the process of
   cleansing oneself from the taint of Toryism. The Committees of Cor-
   respondence and of Safety, whose services stand glorified to us through
   their most efficient agency in a successful struggle, delegated their
   authority to every witness or agent who might be a self-constituted
  guardian of patriotic interests, or a spy, or an eavesdropper, to catch
  reports of suspected persons." Human nature is everywhere the
  same, and to protect a cherished cause these
                                                   " sons of liberty " some-
  times adopted the tactics of the papal inquisition.         On the 8th of
  November, 1774, for example, one Nicholas Austin had to go down
  upon his knees and make the following confession :
                                                               " Before this
  company    I confess  I have been aiding and assisting in sending men
  to Boston to build barracks for the soldiers to live in, at which you
  have justly reason to be offended, which     I am sorry for, and humbly
  ask your forgiveness ; and    I  do affirm, that for the future    I never
  will be acting or assisting in any wise whatever, in act or deed,
 contrary to the constitution of the country ; as witness my
 hand."
       Public feeling grew day by day more exasperated against
  Thompson, and in the summer of 1774, he was summoned before a
 committee to answer to the charge of being unfriendly to the cause of
  liberty. " He denied the charge, and challenged proof. The evidence,
 if any such was offered — and no trace of testimony, or even of
 imputation of that kind is on record — was not of a sort to warrant
 any proceeding against him, and he was discharged." The discharge,
 however, gave him but little relief, and extra-judicial plots were
 formed against him. The Concord mob resolved to take the matter
 into their own hands.       One day they collected round his house, and
 with hoots and yells demanded that Thompson should be delivered
 up to them. Having got wind of the matter, he escaped in time ;
 and on the assurance of Mrs. Thompson and her brother Colonel
 Walker that he had quitted Concord, the mob dispersed.
      In a letter addressed to his father-in-law at this time from
 Charlestown near Boston, he gives his reasons for quitting home.
 " To have tarried at Concord and have stood another trial at the bar
 of the populace would doubtless have been attended with unhappy
 consequences, as my innocence would have stood me in no stead
 against the prejudices of an enraged infatuated multitude — and much
 less against the determined villany of my inveterate enemies, who
 strive to raise their popularity on the ruins of my character."
      He returned to his mother's house in Woburn, where he was
joined by his wife and child.       While they were with him, shots were
exchanged and blood was shed at Concord and Lexington.            Thompson
 was at length arrested, and confined in Woburn.         A " Committee of
 Correspondence" was formed to inquire into his conduct. They
 invited every one who could give evidence in the affair to appear at

the meeting house on the 18th of May.            The committee met, but
finding nothing against the accused, they adjourned the meeting.        He
then addressed a petition to the Committee of Safety for the colony
of Massachusetts Bay, in which he begged for a full and searching
trial, relying on an acquittal commensurate with the thoroughness of
the examination.       The petition was not attended to. On the 29th of
May, 1775, he was examined at Woburn, where he conducted his own
defence.      He was acquitted by the committee, who recommended him
to the    " protection of all good people in this and the neighbouring
 provinces."      The committee, however, refused to make this acquittal
 a public one, lest, it was alleged, it should offend those who were
 opposed to Thompson.
      Despair and disgust took possession of him more and more.        In a
 long letter addressed to his father-in-law from Woburn, he defends
 his entire course of conduct. His principal offence was probably
 negative ; for silence at the time was deemed tantamount to antag-
 onism. During his brief period of farming, he had working for him
 some deserters from the British army in Boston.        These he persuaded
 to go back, and this was urged as a crime against him.       He defended
 himself with spirit, declaring, after he had explained his motives,
 that if his action were a crime, he gloried in being a criminal.       He
 made up his mind to quit the country, expressing the devout wish
 " that the happy time may soon come when             I  may return to my
 family in peace and safety, and when every individual in America
 may sit down under his own vine and under his own fig-tree, and have
 none to make him afraid."
      On this letter, and on the circumstances of the time, Dr. Ellis
 makes the following pertinent remarks : " Major Thompson was not
 the only person in those troubled times that had occasion to charge
 upon those espousing the championship of public liberty a tyrannical
 treatment of individuals who did not accord with their schemes or
 views.      Probably in our late war of rebellion his case was paralleled
  by   those   of hundreds in both sections of our country, who with
 halting and divided minds or unsatisfied judgments, were arrested in
 the process of decision by treatment from others which put them under
 the lead of passion.      The choice of a great many Royalists in our
  revolution would have been wiser and more satisfactory to themselves,
  had they been allowed to make it deliberately."         On October 13th,
  1775, Thompson quitted Woburn, reached the shore of Narragansett
  Bay and went on board a British frigate.          In this vessel he was
  conveyed to Boston, where he remained until the town was evacuated
  by the British troops.      The news of this catastrophe he carried to
  England. Henceforward, till the close of the war, he was on the
  English side. As a matter of course he was proscribed by his country-
 men, and his property confiscated.
      Thompson was not only a man of great capacity, but, in early days,
 of social pliancy and teachableness which enabled him with extreme
     a
 rapidity to learn the manners and fall into the ways of great people.

On the English side the War of Independence was begun, continued,
and ended, in ignorance. Blunder followed blunder, and defeat followed
defeat, until the knowledge which ought to have been ready at the
outset came too late.     Thompson for a time was the vehicle of such
belated knowledge.       He   was immediately attached to the Colonial
Office, then ruled over by Lord George Germain.                 Cuvier, in his
'                                                                          " On
  Eloge,' thus describes his first interview with that minister :
this occasion by the clearness of his details and the gracefulness of his
manners, he insinuated himself so far into the graces of Lord George
Germain that he took him into his employment." With Lord George
lie frequently breakfasted, dined, and supped, and was occasionally
his guest in the country.      But besides giving information useful to
his chiefs, he occupied himself with other matters. He was a born ex-
perimentalist, handy, ingenious, full of devices to meet practical needs.
He turned his attention to improvements in military matters ; " advised
and procured the adoption of bayonets for the fusees of the Horse
Guards, to be used in fighting on foot." He had previously been
engaged with experiments on gunpowder, which he now resumed.
The results of these experiments he communicated to Sir Joseph
 Banks, then President of the Royal Society, with whom he soon
became intimate.       In 1779, he was elected Fellow of the Royal
Society.
     When the war had become hopeless, many of the exiles who had
been true to the Royalist cause came to England, where Thompson's
official position imposed on him the duty of assuaging their miseries
and adjusting their claims.       In this connection, the testimony of Dr.
Ellis regarding him is that " so far as the relations between these
refugees and Mr. Thompson can be traced,           I  find no evidence that he
failed to do in any case what duty and friendliness required of him."
Still he did not entirely escape the censure of his outlawed fellow-
countrymen. One of them in particular had been a judge in Salem when
Thompson was a shop-boy in Appleton's store.               Judge Curwen com-
plained   of Thompson's fair appearance       and    uncandid behaviour. He
must have keenly felt the singular reversal in their relations.          " This
young man," says the judge,       " when a shop-lad to my next neighbour,
ever appeared active, good-natured,        and sensible ; by a strange con-
currence of events, he is now Under-Secretary to the American
Secretary of State, Lord George Germain, a Secretary to Georgia,
Inspector of all the clothing sent to America, and Lieutenant-Colonel
Commandant of Horse Dragoons at New York; his income from
these sources is,    I  have been told, near 7000Z. * a year — a sum
infinitely beyond his most sanguine expectations."
     As the prospects of the war darkened, Thompson's patron in
England became more and more the object of attack.                  The people
had been taxed in vain.      England was entangled in Continental war,
and it became gradually recognised that the subjugation of the colony
                   * This Dr. Ellis considers to be a delusion.

was impossible. Burgoyne had surrendered, and the issue of the war
hung upon the fate of Cornwallis.       On October 19th he was obliged
to capitulate. The effect of the disaster upon Lord North, who was
then Prime Minister, is thus described by Sir M. W. Wraxall : —
" The First Minister's firmness, and even his
                                                   presence of mind, gave
way for a short time under this awful disaster.     I    asked Lord George
afterwards how he took the communication.             *
                                                        As he would have
taken a ball in his breast,' replied Lord George.       '
                                                          For he opened his
arms, exclaiming wildly, as he paced up and down the apartment
                                                  ' "
during a few minutes,      God ! it is all over !
     To Thompson's credit be it recorded, that he showed no tendency
to desert the cause he had espoused when he found it to be a failing
one.   In 1782 his chief was driven from power, and at this critical
time he accepted the commission of lieutenant- colonel in the British
army, and returned to America with a view of rallying for a final
stand such forces as he might find capable of organisation.        He took
with him four pieces of artillery, with which he made experiments
upon the voyage.     His destination was Long Island, New York, but
stress of weather carried him to Charleston, South Carolina. Here the
influence of his presence and energy was soon felt. " The regiment
of cavalry," says Pictet, " called the King's American Dragoons was
raised at this time in his native country by his friends and agents, and
he was then commissioned as its lieutenant-colonel             commandant.
This circumstance led him to return to America to serve with his
regiment. He had intended to land at New York, but contrary winds
compelled him to disembark at Charleston.      Obliged to pass the winter
there, he was made commander of the remains of the cavalry in
the royal army, which was then under the orders of Lieutenant-
General Leslie. This corps was broken, but he promptly restored
it, and won the confidence and attachment of the commander.             He
led them often against the enemy, and was always successful in his
enterprises."
    About the middle of April Thompson reached New York, and
took  command     of the King's American Dragoons. Colours were
presented to the regiment on August 1st,    very vivid account of the
                                            a
ceremony   being  given in Kivington's Boyal  Gazette of August 7th,
1782.   Prince William Henry, afterwards King William the Fourth,
was there at the time.    The regiment passed in review before him,
performing marching salutes.     They then returned, dismounted, and
formed in semicircle in front of the canopy.
           a                                     After an address by
their chaplain,  the whole  regiment  knelt down, laid their helmets
and arms on the ground, held up their right hands, and took      most
                                                                   a
solemn oath of allegiance to their sovereign, and fidelity to their
standard. From Admiral Digby the prince received the colours, and
presented them with his own hands to Thompson, who passed them
on to the oldest cornets.   " On   agiven signal the whole regiment,
with all the numerous spectators, gave three shouts, the music played

       Many complaints have been made of the behaviour of the troops
 during their stay at Long Island, New York. But war is always
  horrible ; and it is pretty clear, from the account of Dr. Ellis, that
  the complaints had no other foundation than events inseparable
 from the carrying on of war.            In the statement of Thompson's
 case, his biographer, extenuatin nothing, and setting down naught
 in malice, winds up his third chapter with these words : " Having
 thus pronounced upon him as m opposition, in act, to himself
 and his convictions, I may add to such praise as is due to him as a
 good soldier, quick and true and bold in action, and faithful to the
 government which lie served, the higher tribute that from the hour
 when the war closed, he became, and ever continued to be, the con-
 stant friend and generous benefactor of his native country."
      Early in April 1783, he obtained leave to return to England,
 but, finding there no opportunity for active service, he resolved
 to try his fortune on the Continent, intending to offer his services as
 a volunteer in the Austrian army against the Turks.             The historian
 Gibbon crossed the Channel with him. In a letter dated Dover,
                                                       "
 September 17th, 1783, Gibbon writes thus : — Last night, the wind
 was so high that the vessel could not stir from the harbour; this day
 it is brisk and fair. We are flattered with the hope of making Calais
 Harbour by the same tide in three hours and a half ; but any delay
 will leave the disagreeable option of a tottering boat or a tossing
night.     What a cursed thing to live in an island ! this step is more
awkward than the whole journey.          The triumvirate of this memorable
embarkation will consist of the grand Gibbon, Henry Laurens, Esq.,
President of Congress; and Mr. Secretary, Colonel, Admiral, Phi-
losopher Thompson, attended by three horses, who are not the most
agreeable fellow-passengers.        If we survive, I  will finish and seal my
letter at Calais. Our salvation shall be ascribed to the prayers of
my lady and aunt, for
          "
                            I  do believe they both pray."        The " grand
Gibbon is reported to have been terribly frightened by the plunging
of his fellow-passengers, the three blood horses.
      Thompson pushed on to Strasburg, where Prince Maximilian of
Bavaria, then a field marshal in the service of France, was in garrison.
As on a former occasion in his native country, Thompson, mounted
on one of his chargers, appeared on the parade ground.            He attracted
the attention of the Prince, who spoke to him, and, on learning that he
had been serving in the American war, pointed to some of his officers,
and remarked that they had been in the same war.                 An animated
conversation immediately began, at the end of which Thompson was
     * Whether Thompson at tin's time made
                                            any effort to communicate with the
members of his own family is not known.    To do so would have been difficult,
but not impossible.

418                           Professor Tyndall        [May 3, 10, and 17,
invited to dine with the Prince. After dinner, it is said, he produced
a portfolio containing plans of the principal engagements, and a col-
lection of excellent maps of the seat of war.        Eager for information,
the Prince again invited him for the next day, and when at length the
traveller took leave, engaged him to pass through Munich, giving him
a friendly letter to his uncle, the Elector of Bavaria.
     Thompson carried with him wherever he went the stamp of power
and the gift of address.      The Elector, a sage ruler, saw in him im-
mediately   a  man   capable of rendering the state good service.        He
pressed   his visitor to accept  a post  half military and half civil.  The
proposal was a welcome one to Thompson, and he came to England
to obtain the king's permission to accept it.        Not only was the per-
mission granted, but on February 23rd, 1784, he was knighted by the
king.    Dr. Ellis publishes the " grant of arms " to the new knight.
In it he is described as " Son of Benjamin Thompson, late of the
Province of Massachusetts Bay in New England, Gent., deceased, and
as one of the most antient Families in North America ; that an Island
which belonged to his Ancestors, at the entrance of Boston Harbour,
where the first New England Settlement was made, still bears
his name ; that his Ancestors have ever lived in reputable Situations
in that country where he was born, and have hitherto used the Arms
of the antient and respectable Family of Thompson, of the county of
York, from a constant Tradition that they derived their Descent from
that Source." The original parchment, perfect and unsullied, with
all its seals, is in the possession of Mrs. James F. Baldwin, of
Boston, widow of the executor of Countess Sarah Kumford.*               The
knight himself, observes his biographer, must have furnished the
information written on that flowery parchment. Thompson was fond
of display, and he here gave rein to his tendency. He returned
to Munich, and on his arrival the Elector appointed him colonel of
a regiment of cavalry and general aide-de-camp to himself.           He was
lodged in a palace, which he shared with the Bussian Ambassador,
and had a military staff and a corps of servants.           " His imposing
figure, his manly and handsome countenance, his dignity of bearing,
and his courteous manners, not only to the great, but equally to his
subordinates and inferiors, made him exceedingly popular."
    He soon acquired a mastery of the German and French languages.
He made himself minutely acquainted with everything concerning
the dominions of the Elector — their population, and employments,
their resources and means of development, and their relations to other
powers. He found much that urgently needed removal and much that
required reformation.       Speaking of the Electorate, Cuvier remarks
      "
that its sovereigns had encouraged devotion, and made no stipula-
tion in favour of industry.      There were more convents than manu-
factories in their states; their army was almost a shadow, while
ignorance and idleness were conspicuous in every class of society."

Thompson, however, evoked no religious animosity. He avowed him-
self a Protestant, but met with no opposition on that score.       Holding
as he did the united offices of Minister of War, Minister of Police,
and Chamberlain of the Elector, his influence and action extended to
all parts of the public service.   Then, as now, the armies of the con-
tinent were maintained by conscription.         Drawn away from their
normal occupations, the rural population returned after their term of
service lazy and demoralised.     This was a great difficulty, in dealing
with which patient caution    had  to combine with administrative skill.
Four years of observation were spent at Munich, before Thompson
attempted anything practical.     The pay of the soldiers was miserable,
their clothing bad, their quarters dirty and mean ; the expense being
out of all proportion to the return.     The officers, as a general rule,
regarded the soldiers as their slaves ; and here special prudence was
necessary   in endeavouring to effect a change.         The more earnest
among the officers were induced to co-operate with him, by making
the reforms which he sought to introduce to originate apparently with
them,    He aimed at making soldiers citizens and citizens soldiers.
The situation of the soldier was to be rendered pleasant, his pay was
to be increased, his clothing rendered comfortable and even elegant,
while all liberty consistent with strict subordination was to be per-
mitted him. Within, the barracks were to be neat and clean ; and
without, attractive. Eeading, writing, and arithmetic were to be
taught, not only to the soldiers and their children, but to the children
of the neighbouring peasantry.      The paper used in the school would,
it was urged, be practically free of cost, as it would serve afterwards
for cartridges.
     The marshes near Mannheim were dreary bogs, useless for cultiva-
tion and ruinous to the health of the city.     Thompson drained them,
banked them in, and converted them into a garden for the use of the
garrison. For the special purpose of introducing the culture of
the potato, he extended the plan of military gardens to all other
garrisons.    They were tilled, and their produce was owned, by non-
commissioned officers and privates, each of whom had a plot of
365 square feet allotted to him.     Gravel walks divided the plots from
each other.     The plan proved completely successful.            Indolent
soldiers became industrious, while the soldiers on furlough spreading
abroad their taste and knowledge, caused little gardens to spring up
everywhere over the country.      Having secured this end, he converted
it into a means of suppressing the enormous evils of mendicity.
Bavaria was infested with beggars, vagabonds, and thieves, native
and foreign.     These mendicant tramps were in the main stout,
healthy, and able-bodied fellows, who found a life of thievish indo-
lence pleasanter than a life of honest work.           " These
                                                                 detestable
vermin had recourse to the most diabolical arts, and the most horrid
crimes in the prosecution of their infamous trade."         They robbed,
and maimed and exposed little children, so as to extract money from
the tender-hearted.    In the cities the beggars formed a distinct caste,

with professional rules to guide them. Their training was a training
in robbery; the means they employed for extorting support being
equivalent to direct plunder. Seeing no escape from the incubus, the
public had come to bow to it as a necessity. The energy with which
Thompson grappled with this evil may be inferred from the fact that
out of a population of sixty thousand, two thousand six hundred
beggars were seized in a single week.
    Four regiments of cavalry were so cantoned that every village in
Bavaria and the adjoining provinces had a patrol party of four or five
mounted soldiers "daily coursing from one station to another."        The
troopers were under strict discipline, extreme care being taken to
avoid collision with the civil authorities.       This disposition of the
cavalry was antecedent to seizing,     as a beginning, all the beggars in
the capital. Aged and infirm mendicants were carefully distinguished
from the sturdy and able-bodied. Voluntary contributions were
essential, but the inhabitants, though groaning under the load of
mendicancy, had been so often disappointed in their efforts to get rid
of     that they now held back. Thompson resolved to give proof of
      it,
success before asking for general aid.     He interested persons of high
rank in his scheme       organised
                          ;           bureau to relieve the needy and
                                       a
employ the idle.    The members of his committee were Presidents of
the great offices of State, who worked without pay.         The city was
divided into sixteen districts, with      committee of charity for each,
                                           a
while    respected citizen assisted by
            a                              priest and physician, serving

gratuitously,  looked  after the worthy poor. He knew perfectly well
that in the city many bequests consecrated to charity were being
abused and wasted, but he cautiously abstained from meddling with
them.
      The problem before him might well have daunted    a   courageous man.
It  was neither more nor less than to convert people bred up in lazy
and dissolute habits into thrifty workers.      Precepts, he knew, were
unavailing, so his aim was to establish habits. Reversing the maxim
that people must be virtuous to be happy, he made his beggars happy
as   astep towards making them virtuous.        He affirmed that he had
learnt the importance of cleanliness through observing the habits of
birds and beasts. Lawgivers and founders of religions never failed to
                                                               " Virtue,"
recognise the influence of cleanliness on man's moral nature.
he said, " never dwelt long with filth and nastiness, nor do     Ibelieve
there ever was     person scrupulously attentive to cleanliness who was
                      a
a  consummate villain."     He had to deal with wretches covered with
filth and vermin, to cleanse them, to teach them, and to give them the
pleasure and stimulus of earning money.      He did not waste his means
on fine buildings, but taking     deserted manufactory, he repaired
                                   a                                        it,

mechanics.     Halls were provided for the spinners of flax, cotton, and
wool. Other halls were set up for weavers, clothiers, dyers, saddlers,
wool-sorters, carders, combers, knitters, and seamstresses.
     The next step was to get the edifice filled with suitable inmates.

New Year's Day was the beggars' holiday, and their patron and
reformer chose that day to get hold of them.            It was the 1st of Janu-
ary,   1790.    In  the  prosecution  of his  despotic  scheme  all men seemed
to fall  under   his  lead.   To relieve  it of the odium   which  might accrue
if it were effected wholly by the military, he associated with himself
and his field officers the magistrates of Munich.              They gave him
willing sympathy and aid. On New Year's morning he and the chief
magistrate walked out together.           With extended hand a beggar im-
mediately accosted         them.   Thompson, setting the example to his
followers, laid his hand gently upon the shoulder of .the vagabond,
committed him to the charge of a sergeant, with orders to take him to
the Townhall, " where he would be provided for in one way if he
were really helpless, but in another way if he were not."             Thompson
encouraged his associates, and      with   such  alacrity was the  work   accom-
plished, that at the end of that day not a single beggar remained at
large. The name of every member of the motley crew was inserted in
prepared lists, and they were sent off to their haunts with instructions
to appear on the following day at the military workhouse, where they
would inhabit comfortable warm rooms, enjoy a warm dinner daily,
and be provided with remunerative work.               In the suburbs the same
measures were followed up successfully by patrols of soldiers and
police.
      With his iron resolution was associated, in those days, a plastic tact
which enabled him to avoid jealousies and collisions that a man of more
hectoring temper and less self-restraint would infallibly have incurred.
To the schools for poor students, the Sisters of Charity, the hospital for
lepers, and other institutions had been conceded the right of making
periodic appeals from house to house ; German apprentices had also
been permitted to beg upon their travels ; all of these had their claims
adjusted.     After he had swept his swarm of paupers into the quarters
provided    for them, Thompson's hardest work began. Here the inflexible
 order   which   had characterised him through life came as a natural force
 to his aid.  "  He encouraged a spirit of industry, pride, self-respect, and
 emulation, finding help even in trifling distinctions of apparel."           His
 pauper workhouse was self-supporting, while its inmates were happy.
 For several years they made up all the clothing of the Bavarian
 troops, realising sometimes a profit of 10,000 florins a year. Thompson
 himself constructed and arranged a kitchen which provided daily a
 warm and nutritive dinner for a thousand or fifteen hundred persons ;
 an incredibly small amount of fuel sufficing to cook a dinner of this
 magnitude.       The military workhouse was also remunerative.               Its
 profits for six years exceeded a hundred thousand dollars.                  The
 military workhouse at Mannheim was unfortunately set on fire and
 ruined during the siege of the city by Austrian troops.
      Thompson had the art of making himself loved and honoured by
 the people whom he ruled in this arbitrary way.             Some very striking
 illustrations of this are given in the 1 Life and Essays.' He once, for
 example, broke down at Munich under his self-imposed labours.                 It

422                           Professor Tyndall        [May   3, 10, and 17,
was thought that he was dying, and one day while in this condition,
his attention was attracted by the confused noise of a passing multitude
in the street. It was the poor of Munich who were going in procession
to the church to put up public prayers for him.         " Public prayers ! "
he exclaims, " for me, a private person, a stranger, a Protestant ! " Four
years afterwards, when he was dangerously ill at Naples, the people, of
their own accord, set apart an hour each evening, after they had finished
their labours in the military workhouse, to pray for his recovery.
     Men find pleasure in exercising the powers they possess, and
Kumford possessed, in its highest and strongest form, the power of
organisation.     The relief of the poor, which occupied his attention for
years,  was  pursued    by him as a scientific inquiry. He differentiates
the people who have fair claims upon the State from those whose
infirmity and incapacity render continnous assistance necessary, but
who cannot be aided by compulsory taxation.         In this case the prompt-
ings of humanity must be invoked. Persons of high rank ought here
to take the lead, combining with those immediately below them to
secure efficient supervision and relief.     The expense thus incurred is
small compared with that incidental to beggary and its concomitant
thieving. Thompson's hope and confidence never forsook him. He faced
unquailing, problems from which less daring spirits would have re-
coiled. He held undoubtingly that " arrangement, method, provision
for the minutest details, subordination, co-operation, and a careful
system of statistics, will facilitate and make effective any undertaking,
however burdensome and comprehensive."            Such a statement would
 surely have elicited a bravo from Carlyle.        In him flexible wisdom
 formed an amalgam with despotic strength. With skill and resolution
the objects of public benevolence must be made to contribute as far
as possible to their own support.         The homeliest details do not
escape him.       He commends well dressed vegetables as a cheap
and wholesome form of nutrition.         He descants upon the potato, he
gives rules for the construction of soup-kitchens, and determines
the nutritive value of different kinds of food.           During his boy-
hood at Woburn he had learnt the use of Indian corn, and at
Munich he strongly recommends the dumplings, bread, and hasty
pudding that may be made from maize.          Pure love of humanity would
at first sight, seem to have been the motive force of Thompson's action.
Still, it has been affirmed by those who knew him that he did not
really love his fellow men. His work had for him the fascination of
a problem above the capacities of most men, but which he felt himself
able to solve.     It was said to be the work of his intellect, not of his
heart.    In  reference   to him, Cuvier quotes what Fontenelle said of
Dodard, who turned his rigid observance of the fasts of the Church
into a scientific experiment on the effects of abstinence, thereby taking
the path which led at once to heaven and into the French Academy.
I   should hesitate before accepting this as a complete account of
 Kumford' s motives.
     In the north-easterly environs of Munich a wild and neglected

1883.]    on Count  Rumford, Originator of    the Royal Institution.     423
region of forest and marsh, which had formerly been the hunting
ground of the Elector, was converted by Thompson into an " English
garden."     Pleasure grounds, parks, and fields were laid out, and
surrounded by a drive six miles long.       Walks, promenades, grottos,
a Chinese pagoda,      a racecourse,   and other attractions were intro-
duced ; a lake was formed, and a mound raised ; while a refreshment
saloon, handsomely furnished, provided for the creature comforts
of the visitors.    Here, during Thompson's absence in England in
1795, and    without  his knowledge, a monument was raised to com-
memorate his beneficent achievements.       " It stands within the
                                                                     garden,
and is composed of Bavarian freestone and marble.       It is quadrangular,
its two opposite fronts being ornamented with basso-rilievos, and bear-
ing inscriptions." The wanderer, on one side, is exhorted to halt, while
thankfulness strengthens his enjoyment. " A creative hint from Carl
Theodor, seized upon with spirit, feeling, and love by the friend of
man, Rumford, has ennobled into what thou now seest around thee
this once desert region."     On the other side of the monument is a
dedication to " Him who eradicated the most scandalous of public
evils, Idleness and Mendicity ; who gave the poor help, occupation,
and morals, and to the youth of the Fatherland so many schools of
culture.    Go, wanderer! try to emulate him in thought and deed,
and us in gratitude."
     Rumford's health, as already indicated, had given way, and in 1793
he went to Italy to restore it. He was absent fur sixteen months, and
during his absence was seriously ill at Naples.          Had he been less
filled with his projects, it might have been better for his health.
Had he known how to employ the sanative power of nature, he
would have kept longer in working order his vigorous frame.              But
the mountains of Maggiore were to him less attractive than the
streets of Yerona, where he committed himself to the planning of soup-
kitchens.    He made similar plans for other cities, so that to call his
absence a holiday would be a misnomer.         He returned to Munich in
August 1794, slowly recovering, but not able to resume the manage-
ment of his various institutions.    In September 1798, after an absence
 of eleven years, he returned to London.        Dr. Ellis describes him as
" the victim of an outrage " on his arrival, the
                                                        meaning of which
seems to be that his trunk containing his papers, which was carried
 behind his carriage, was appropriated by London thieves.          " By this
 cruel robbery," he says,  " I have been deprived of the fruits of the
labours of my whole life.    ...  It is the more jminful to me, as it has
 clouded my mind with suspicions that can never be cleared up."
 What the suspicions were we do not know.
     Soon afterwards he was invited by Lord Pelham. then Secretary
 for Ireland, to visit him in Dublin ; he went, and during his two
 months' stay there, busied himself with improvements in warming,
 cooking, and ventilation, in the hospitals and workhouses of the city.
 He left behind him a number of models of useful mechanism.              The
 Royal Irish Academy elected him a member.              The grand jury of

Dublin presented him with an address ; while the Viceroy and the
Lord Mayor wrote to him officially to thank him for his services.
Dr. Ellis has not been able to find these documents, but they were
seen by Pictet, who describes them as " filled with the most flattering
expressions of esteem and gratitude."
     In Rumford's case the life of the mind appeared to have interfered
with the life of the affections.     When he quitted America, he left his
wife and infant daughter behind him, and whether there were any
communications afterwards between him and them is not known. In
1793, in a letter to his friend Baldwin, he expressed the desire to
visit his native country. He also wished exceedingly to be personally
acquainted with his daughter, who was then nineteen.              His affection
for his mother, which appears to have been very          real, also appears in
his letter. With reference to this projected visit, he asks, " Should
I  be kindly received ?     Are the remains of party spirit and political
persecutions    done  away  ?  Would it be necessary to ask leave of the
         "
 State ?      A year prior  to the  date of this letter, Rumford's wife had
died, at the age of fifty-two.        On the 29th of January, 1796, his
                                            " Sally Thompson," sailed for
daughter, who was familiarly called
London to see her father. She had a tedious passage, but soon after
her arrival she writes to her friend Mrs. Baldwin, "All fatigue and
anxiety are now at an end, since my dear father is well and loves
me."
     In  a
            '
              History of her Life,' written many years afterwards, she,
however, describes the disappointment she experienced on first meeting
her father. Her imagination had sketched a fancy picture of him.
She " had heard him spoken of as an officer, and had attached to this
an idea of the warrior with a martial look, possibly the sword, if not
 the gun, by his side."     All this disappeared when she saw him. He
 did not strike her as handsome, or even agreeable, — a result in part
 due to the fact that he had been ill and was very thin and pale.           She
                                       " quite from the heart," while the
 speaks, however, of his laughter
                                                          "
 expression of his mouth, with teeth described as the most finished
 pearls," was sweetness itself.     He did not seem to manage her very
 successfully.     She had little knowledge of the world, and her
 purchases in London he thought both extravagant and extraordinary.
 After having, by due discipline, learnt how to make an English
 courtesy, to the horror of her father, almost the first use she made of
 her newly acquired accomplishment was to courtesy to a house-
 keeper.
      His labours in   the production of cheap and nutritive food neces-
 sarily  directed   Rumford's   attention to fireplaces and chimney flues.
 V/hen he first published his essay on this subject in London, he
 reported that he had not less than five hundred smoky chimneys on
  his hands.     His aid and advice were always ready, and were given
 indiscriminately     to all sorts and conditions of men.           Devonshire

Lord Sudley's, the Marquis of Salisbury's, and a hundred and fifty
other houses in London were placed in his care. The saving of fuel,
with gain instead of loss of warmth, varied in these cases from one-
half to two-thirds. " Giving very simple and intelligible information,
about the philosophical principles of combustion, ventilation, and
draughts, he prepared careful diagrams to show the proper measure-
ments, disposal, and arrangements of all the parts of a fire-place and
flue.   He took out no patent for his inventions, but left them free to
the public.    In a poem published at this time by Thomas James
Matthias we have the following appreciative reference to the labours
of Rumford : —
                " Nonsense, or sense, I'll bear in any shape
                  In gown, in lawn, in ermine, or in crape :
                  What's a fine type, where truth exerts her rule  ?
                  Science is science, and a fool's a fool.
                  Yet all shall read, and all that page approve,
                  When public spirit meets with public love.
                  Thus late, where poverty with rapine dwelt,
                  Rumford's kind genius the Bavarian felt,
                  Not by romantic charities beguiled,
                  But calm in project, and in mercy mild ;
                  Where'er his wisdom guided, none withstood,
                  Content with peace and practicable good ;
                  Round him the labourers throng, the nobles wait,
                  Friend of the poor, and guardian of the state."
      The pall of smoke which habitually hung over London, " covering
 all its prominent edifices with a dingy and sooty mantle," curiously
 and anxiously interested him.         He " saw in that smoke the unused
 material which was turned equally to waste and made a means of
 annoyance and insalubrity."          He would bind himself, if the oppor-
 tunity were allowed him, "to prove that from the heat, and the
 material of heat, which were thus wasted, that he would cook all
 the food used in the city, warm every apartment, and perform all the
 mechanical work done by means of fire." Under heat Rumford would
 doubtless comprise both the imperfectly consumed gases such as car-
 bonic oxide, and the heated air and other gases discharged by the
 chimneys.
      There is no doubt that the present age has entered largely into
 the labours of Rumford.           Many of the devices and conveniences
 now employed in our kitchens owe their origin to him. The prac-
 tical needs and mechanical ingenuity of his own countrymen have
 caused them to follow his lead with conspicuous success.               We have,
 for example, in our modest little kitchen in the Alps, an American
 oven, which, with the expenditure of an extremely small amount of
 fire-wood, heats our baths, cooks our meat, bakes our bread, boils our
 clothes, and contributes to the warmth and comfort of the house.
 This arrangement traces its pedigree to Rumford.
      In 1796 he founded the historic medal which bears his name.
 On the 12th of July of that year he wrote thus to Sir Joseph
                                                                     2 f 2

  request that the Royal Society would do me the honour to accept of
i £1000 stock in the Funds of this country, which                 I  have actually
  purchased,    and    which    I  beg  leave   to  transfer   to   the President,
  Council, and Fellows of the Royal Society, to the end that the
  interest of the same may be by them, and by their successors, received
  from time to time for ever, and the amount of the same applied and
   given once every second year, as a premium to the author of the most
  important discovery or useful improvement which shall be made, or
  published by printing, or in any way made known to the public, in any
  part of Europe, during the preceding two years, on Heat or Light."
       He adds in a subsequent letter, as further denning his wishes,
  that the premium should be limited to new discoveries tending to
  improve theories of Fire, of Heat, of Light, and of Colours, and to
  new inventions and contrivances by which the generation, and pre-
  servation, and management of heat and of light may be facilitated.
  The device and inscriptions on the medal were determined by a com-
  mittee. It was resolved "that the diameter of the medal do not
  exceed three inches, and that Mr. Milton be employed in sinking the
  dies of the said medal."        Two medals are always given, one of gold,
  the other of silver, and a sum of about seventy pounds usually accom-
  panies the medals.        Rumford himself was the first recipient of the
  medal.     The second was given to Sir John Leslie, the founder's cele-
  brated rival in the domain of radiant heat.                On the same date
  Rumford presented to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences
  the same sum for the promotion of the same object.                    In fact the
                  J
  letters to Sir oseph Banks and to the Honourable John Adams, then
  President of the American Academy, are identical in terms.                  For a
  long   series  of  years   the  American    Academy     did   not   consider that
  the candidates    for  the  medal    had  reached   the level of merit     which
  would justify its award. No award was therefore made ; and in 1829
  the Rumford bequest had increased from five thousand to twenty
  thousand dollars.       After some litigation the terms of the bequest
  were extended     to  embrace   applications of it far beyond the design of
  the testator.     Permission was obtained to apply the fund to the
  publication of books, or methods of discovery, bearing on the Count's
  favourite subjects of experiment ; and to the aid and reward of scien-
  tific workers.    Thus, in 1839, Dr. Hare, of Philadelphia, received from
  the Academy six hundred dollars for his invention of the compound
  blow-pipe, and his improvements in galvanic apparatus. In 1862 the
   Rumford medal was awarded to Mr. John B. Ericsson for his caloric
  engine ; while Mr. Alvan Clark, so celebrated for his improvements of
  the refracting telescope, and the eminent Dr. John Draper of the
  University of New York, have been also numbered among the
  recipients.
       Accompanied by his daughter, Rumford returned to Germany
   in 1796. " Three weeks' constant travel ; circuitous routes to avoid
   troops ; bad roads ; still worse accommodations ; passing nights in

1883.]     on Count   Bum ford, Originator of the Royal Institution.    427
the carriages for the want of an inn ; scantiness of provisions, joined
with great fatigue, rendered our journey by no means agreeable."
At Munich they were lodged in the splendid house allotted to the
Count. France and Austria were then at war, while Bavaria sought
to remain rigidly neutral. Eight days after Rumford's arrival, the
Elector took refuge in Saxony.        Moreau had crossed the Rhine and
threatened Bavaria.       After a defeat by the French, the Austrians
 withdrew to Munich, but found the gates of the city closed against
them.      They planted batteries on a height commanding the city.
 According to arrangement with the Elector, Rumford assumed the
 command of the Bavarian forces, and by his firmness and presence of
 mind prevented either French or Austrians from entering Munich.
 A foreigner acting thus was sure to excite jealousy and encounter oppo-
 sition, but, despite all this, he was eminently successful in realising
 his aims.     The consideration in which he was held by the Elector
 is illustrated by the fact that he made Miss Thompson a Countess of
 the Empire, conferring on her a pension of 200/. a year, with liberty
 to enjoy it in any country where she might wish to reside.
      The following incident is worth recording. In March 1796,
 Rumford s daughter, wishing to celebrate his birthday, chose out of
 his workhouse a dozen of the most industrious little boys and girls,
 dressed them up in the uniform of that establishment, and robing
 herself in white, led them into his room and presented them to him.
 He was so much touched by the incident, that he made her a present
 of two thousand dollars (400Z.) on condition that she should, in her
 will, apply the interest of the sum to the clothing, every year for ever,
 on her own birthday, of twelve meritorious children — six girls and six
 boys— in the Munich uniform.         The poor children were to be chosen
 from her native town, Concord. Habit must to some extent have
 blinded Rumford's eyes to the objection which independent New
  Englanders wrere likely to make to this fantastic apparel. They
  bluntly stated their objections, but " with grateful hearts they never-
                                                               "
  theless expressed their willingness to accept the donation.        Nothing
  further was done during Rumford's lifetime.
       The New England girl, brought up in Concord, transplanted
  thence to London, and afterwards to Munich, was subjected to a
  somewhat trying ordeal.        After a short period of initiation, she
  appears to     have  passed through it creditably.     Her writing does
  not exhibit her as possessing any marked qualities of intellect.       She
   was bright, gossipy, "volatile," and throws manifold gleams on
  the details of Rumford's life.    He constantly kept a box at the opera,
   though   he  hardly  ever went  there, and hired by the year a doctor
  named Haubenal.       She amusingly describes a quintuple present made
   to her by her father soon after her arrival in Munich.          The first
   item was " a little shaggy dog, as white as snow, excepting black eyes,
                   "
   ears and nose ; the second was a lady named Yeratzy, who was
   sent to teach her French and music ; the third was a Catholic priest,
   named Dillis, who was to be her drawing master ; the fourth was a

   428                         Professor Tyndall       [May 3, 10, and 17,
  teacher  of Italian, named Alberti ; and the fifth, the before-mentioned
  Dr. Haubenal, who was to look after her health. She did not at all
  like the arrangement.    She was particularly surprised and shocked at
  a doctor's offering his services before they were wanted.      " Said I to
  myself, surrounded by people who speak French — and all genteel
  people speak it at Munich — and knowing considerable of the lan-
  guage already, where is the use of my fatiguing myself with masters ?
  Music the same." In fact the little dog "Cora" was the only wel-
  come constituent of the gift.
       She describes with considerable spirit a ball which was organised
  to celebrate her father's birthday.     All united to do him honour.
 Wreaths surrounded his bust ; his workhouse children, joined by
 some children of the nobility, all dressed in white, handed addresses
 to him, and sang in accompaniment to the swell of music of which
 he was passionately fond.         All this was arranged without his
 knowledge, and possibly not without an intention to give dramatic
 force to a revelation made at the time. It was observed that
 Eumford had singled out from the children a little girl of eight,
 who accompanied him when he walked, and took her place beside
 him when he sat. The little girl was his illegitimate child.         Sarah,
 on learning this, was stunned, threw herself into the dance that
 she had previously declined, and thus whirled away her indigna-
 tion. Her partner was the young Count Taxis, Eumford's aide-
 de-camp, between whom and Eumford's daughter a friendly intimacy
 was obviously growing up. Eumford noticed this, and disapproved of it.
 Being invited to dinner at the house of the Countess Lerchenfeld,
with her father's consent Miss Thompson went.            Count Taxis hap-
pened to be one of the party, and on hearing this Eumford jumped to
the conclusion that a ladies' conspiracy was afoot to counteract his
wishes.      With a lowering look he taxed his daughter with what he
supposed to be an intrigue.       At first she could only stare at him in
surprise.
             " After which, on knowing what it meant, like many young
people who laugh when there is nothing to laugh at, an irresistible
inclination seized me to laugh."        She gave way to her inclination,
" and it ended in my father's boxing my ears."        She was stunned by
the indignity and " quitted the room, without making an observation,
or trying to appease him by saying     I was innocent."
     The elector put the seal to his esteem for Eumford by appointing
him as Plenipotentiary from Bavaria to the Court of London.            King
George, however, declined to accept him in this capacity. Mr. Paget,
the minister at the court of Bavaria, was desired
                                                       " to lose no time in
apprising the ministers of His Electoral Highness that such an
appointment would be by no means agreeable to His Majesty, and that
His Majesty relies therefore on the friendship and good understanding
 which has always hitherto subsisted between himself and the Elector
 of Bavaria, and that His Highness will have no hesitation in with-
                                                            " Should there

 unexpectedly arise any difficulty about a compliance with the re-

 1883.]    on Count   Rumford , Originator of the Royal Institution.   429
 quest, which His Majesty is so clearly warranted in making,         I  am
 to direct you, in the last resort, to state in distinct terms that His
 Majesty will by no means consent to receive Count Rumford in the
 character which has been assigned to him."         The fact of Rumford's
 being not only a British subject, but that he had actually filled a
confidential situation under the British Government, were cited, as
rendering his appointment peculiarly objectionable. Some correspon-
 dence ensued between Lord Grenville and Rumford, but the appoint-
ment was not ratified.
     Rumford was obviously stung by the refusal of King George to
accept him as Bavarian minister ; and the thought which had often
occurred to him of returning to his native country now revived. Mr.
Rufus King was at that time American Ambassador in London ; and
he, by Runiford's desire, wrote to Colonel Pickering, then Secretary
of State for the United States, informing him that intrigues in
Bavaria, and the refusal of the English king, had caused the Count
to decide on establishing himself at, or near, Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Mr. King describes the Count's intention to live in the character of
a German nobleman, renouncing all political action, and devoting
himself to literary pursuits.     Mr. King describes Rumford as having
had much experience of cannon foundries ; and as having made im-
portant improvements in the mounting of flying artillery.          He was,
moreover, the possessor of an extensive military library, and wished
nothing more ardently than to be useful to his native country.       They
had made provision for the institution of a military academy in the
United States.    This they offered to place under the superintendence
of Rumford.         I
                 " am authorised," said Mr. King, " to offer you, in
addition to the superintendence of the military academy, the appoint-
ment of Inspector General of the Artillery of the United States ; and
we shall moreover be disposed to give to you such rank and emolu-
ments as would be likely to afford you satisfaction, and to secure to
us the advantage of your service."
     The hour for the final decision approached, but before it arrived
another project had laid hold of Rumford's imagination — a project
which in its results has proved of more importance to science, and of
more advantage to mankind, than any which this multifarious genius
had previously undertaken.       This project was the foundation of the
Royal Institution of Great Britain. In answer to the American
Ambassador, he says, " Nothing could have afforded me so much
satisfaction as to have had it in my power to have given to my
liberal and generous countrymen such proof of my sentiments as
would in the most public and ostensible manner have evinced, not
only my gratitude for the kind attentions     I  have received from them,
                             I
but also the ardent desire feel to assist in promoting the prosperity
of my native country.        But engagements, which great obligations
have rendered sacred and inviolable, put it out of my power to dispose
of my time and services with that unreasoned freedom which would
be necessary in order to enable me to accept of those generous offers

pleased to propose to me."
      The climate of Europe did not seem to suit the Countess Sarah.
Possibly the simple tastes and habits of her childhood were too
deeply ingrained in her constitution to permit of her deriving any
real enjoyment from the outsided, and apparently noisy life, which
she was forced to lead in Munich and London.              Be this as it may,
she returned to America, reaching the port of Boston on October 10th,
1799, " being then just twenty-five years of age."          Eumford himself
remained in England with the view of realising what             I  have called
the greatest project of his life — the founding of the Royal Institution.
      His ideas on this subject took definite shape in 1799.        They were
set forth   in a pamphlet of fifty pages bearing the following lengthy
title : " Proposals for forming by subscription, in the metropolis of
the British Empire, a public institution for diffusing the knowledge
and facilitating the general introduction of useful mechanical inven-
tions and improvements, and for teaching, by courses of philosophical
 lectures and experiments, the application of science to the common
 purposes of life." The introduction to this pamphlet is dated from
 Bumford's residence in Brompton Bow, March 4th, 1799.                 His aim
 he alleges to be to cause science and art to work together; to
 establish relations between philosophers and workmen ; to bring
 their united efforts to bear in the improvement of agriculture, manu-
 factures, commerce, and in the augmentation of domestic comforts.
 He specially dwells on the management of fire, it being, as he thinks,
  a subject of peculiar interest to mankind.       Fuel, he asserted, cost the
  kingdom more than ten millions spelling annually, which was much
 more than twice what it ought to cost.        Bumford knew human nature
  well, and  for the greater portion of  his  life  knew how to appeal to it
  with effect. In fact, the knowledge never failed him, though towards
  the end irritability, due to ill-health and crosses of various kinds,
  rendered him less able to apply the knowledge than when he was in
  the blossom of his prime. As regards the success of his new scheme,
  he urged upon the excellent men with whom he acted the necessity
  of making the indolent and luxurious take an interest in it. Such
                      " must either be allured or shamed into action."
  persons, he says,
  Hence, he urges, the necessity of making benevolence " fashionable."
       It ought to be mentioned that Bumford at this time could count
  on the sympathy and active support of a number of excellent men,
  who, in advance of him, had founded a
                                                 " Society for bettering the
  condition and increasing the comforts of the poor."         Bumford sought
  the aid of the committee   of this society.     It was  agreed on all hands
   that the proposed new Institution promised to be too important to
  permit of its being made an appendage to any other.           It was resolved
  that it should stand alone. A committee                 consisting of eight
   members of the above society was, however, appointed to confer with
   Bumford regarding his plan. To each member of this committee he

 1883.]     on Count  Itumford, Originator of the Royal Institution.   431
 submitted a statement of his views.        These are in part set forth in
 the title to his pamphlet already quoted.     The aim of the institution,
 furthermore, was " to excite a spirit of improvement among all
 ranks of society, and to afford the most effectual assistance to those
 who are engaged in the various pursuits of useful industry." He
 begs, however, that His Majesty's Ministers may be informed of the
intention of the founders of the Institution to accept his services.
 This he deems necessary because of his being, in the first place, a
 subject of His Majesty, and also, by His Majesty's special permission,
the servant of a foreign prince.       He recommends that the Govern-
ment should be fully informed not only as to the general aims but
also of the details of the scheme, and then asked for countenance and
support in carrying it into execution.
     The committee met and ratified Eumford's proposals. They
agreed that subscribers of fifty guineas each should be the perpetual
proprietors of the Institution; that a contribution of ten guineas
should secure the privileges of a life subscriber ; whilst a subscrip-
tion of two guineas should constitute an annual subscriber. Besides
other important rights, each proprietor was to receive two transferable
tickets, admitting to every part of the Institution, and to all the
lectures and experiments.       Each life subscriber was to receive one
ticket, not transferable, securing free admission to every part of the
establishment, and to all lectures and experiments.       An annual sub-
scriber had a single ticket for a single year, but might at any time
become a life subscriber by the additional payment of eight guineas.
The managers, nine in number, were to be chosen by ballot by the
proprietors.     The managers were to be unpaid and, without any
pecuniary advantage to themselves, were held solemnly pledged to the
faithful discharge of their duties.    Three were to constitute a quorum,
but in special cases six were required. A Committee of Visitors was
also appointed, the same in number as the Committee of Managers,
and holding office for the same number of years.
      The managers were to devote the surplus funds of the Institution
 to the purchase of models of inventions, and improvements in the
 mechanical arts ; and a room in the Institution was to be devoted to
 the , reception of them.    The room still exists, and though diverted
 from   its original purpose, is called " the Model Eoom." A general
 meeting of the proprietors was held at the house of Sir Joseph Banks,
 in Soho Square, on the 7th of March, 1799. Fifty-eight persons,
 comprising men of distinction in science, members of Parliament and
 of the nobility, including one bishop, were found to have qualified as
 proprietors by the subscription of fifty guineas each.        The prelate
 was the Bishop of Durham.       The Committee of Managers was chosen,
 and they held their first meeting at the house of Sir Joseph Banks on
 the 9th of March, 1799.      Mr. Thomas Bernard, one of the most active
 members of the Society from whose committee the first managers
 were chosen, was appointed Secretary.         To Rumford and Bernard
 was delegated the duty of preparing a draught of a charter ; while

 432                          Professor Tyndall          [May    3, 10,  and 17,
Earls Morton and Spencer, Sir Joseph Banks, and Mr. Pelham, were
requested "to lay the proposals before His Majesty, the Eoyal
 Family, the Ministers, the great officers of State, the members of both
 Houses of Parliament, of the Privy Council, and before the twelve
judges."
     On the 13th of January, 1800, the Koyal Seal was attached to the
 Charter of the Institution. In the same year was published, in
                 '
quarto form, The Prospectus, Charter, Ordinance, and Bye-laws of
the Eoyal Institution of Great Britain.'           The king was its Patron,
 and the first officers of the Institution were appointed by him. The
 Earl of Winchilsea was President.           Lord Morton, Lord Egremont,
and Sir Joseph Banks were Vice-Presidents.             The managers, chosen
by sealed ballot by the proprietors, were divided into three classes of
 three each ; the first class serving for one, the second for two, and the
third for three years.       The Earls of Bessborough, Egremont, and
 Morton, respectively, headed the lists of the three classes.           Rumford
himself was appointed to serve for three years.            The three lists of
 Visitors were headed by the Duke of Bridgevvater, Viscount Palmer-
 ston and Earl Spencer, respectively.          That Rumford possessed the
 power of persuasion, and the infection of enthusiasm, is sufficiently
 demonstrated by this powerful list.         But neither persuasion nor en-
 thusiasm might have been found availing had not his actual achieve-
 ments in Bavaria occupied the background.             The first Professor of
 Natural Philosophy and Chemistry was Dr. Thomas Garnett, while
 the first Treasurer was Mr. Thomas Bernard.               But this was not
 enough. A home and foreign secretary, legal counsel, a solicitor
 and a clerk, were added to the list. One rule established at this time
 has been adhered to with great fidelity to the present day.            No poli-
 tical subject was to be mentioned in the lectures.
     In a somewhat florid style Rumford (for he was obviously the
 writer) descants on the name and objects of the new project. The
 word Institution is chosen because it had been least used pre-
 viously, and because it best indicates the objects of the new
 society.    The influence of the mechanical arts on the progress of
 civilisation and refinement is pointed out and illustrated by reference
 to nations, provinces, towns, and even villages which thrive in pro-
 portion to the activity of their industry.          "Exertion quickens the
 spirit  of invention,  makes   science   flourish, and  increases the moral
 and physical powers of man." The printing-press, navigation, gun-
 powder, the steam-engine, are referred to as having changed the
 whole course of human affairs.         The slowness with which improve-
 ments make their way among workmen is ascribed to the influence of
 habit, prejudice, suspicion, jealousy, dislike of change, and the narrow-
 ing effect of the subdivision of work into many petty occupations. But
 slowness is also due to the greed for wealth, the desire for monopoly,
 the spirit of secret intrigue exhibited among manufacturers.           Between
 these two the philosopher steps      in,  whose  business  it is  " to  examine
 every operation of nature and art, and to establish general theories for

  1883.]     on Count   Rumford, Originator of     the Royal Institution.     433
  the direction and conducting of future processes."           But philosophers
  may  become    dreamers,   and  they  have therefore   habitually  to be called
  back  to  the study  of  practical questions  which    boar upon  the ordinary
 pursuits of life.     Science and practice are, in short, to interact, to the
 advantage of both.        This object may be promoted by the offering of
 premiums, as done by the Society of Arts,* by the granting of patents ;
 and, finally, by the method of the new Institution — the diffusion of
 the knowledge of useful mechanical inventions, and their introduction
 into life.
      One of the first practical steps taken towards the realisation of
 these ideas was the purchase of the house, or rather houses, in
 Albemarle Street, in which we are now assembled, and their modifica-
 tion to suit the objects in view. Rumford's obvious intention was to
 found an Institute of Technology and Engineering.                Mere descrip-
 tion was not sufficient.     He demanded something visible and tangible,
 and therefore proposed that the Institution should be made a reposi-
tory for models of all useful contrivances and improvements : cottage
 fireplaces and kitchen utensils ; kitchens for farm-houses and for the
houses of gentlemen ; a laundry, including boilers, washing, ironing,
and drying-rooms ; German, Swedish, and Russian stoves ; open
chimney fireplaces, with ornamental grates ; ornamental stoves ;
                     "
working models of that most curious and most useful machine, the
                   "
 steam-engine ;       brewers' boilers ; distillers' coppers ; condensers ;
large boilers for hospitals ; ventilating apparatus in hot-houses ;
lime-kilns ; steam-boilers for preparing food for stall-fed cattle ;
spinning-wheels ; looms ; agricultural implements ; bridges of various
constructions ; human food ; clothing ; houses ; towns ; fortresses ;
harbours ; roads ; canals ; carriages ; ships ; tools ; weapons ; &c.
Chemistry was to be applied to soils, tillage, and manures ; to the
making of bread, beer, wine, spirits, starch, sugar, butter, and cheese ;
to the processes of dyeing, calico-printing,          bleaching, painting, and
varnishing ; to the smelting of ores ; the formation of alloys ; to
mortars, cements, bricks, pottery, glass, and enamels.                Above all,
" the phenomena of light and heat — those great powers which give life
and energy to the universe — powers which, by the wonderful process
of combustion, are placed under the command of human beings — will
engage a profound interest."          In reference to the alleged size of the
bed of Og, the king of Basan, Bishop Watson proposed to Tom
Paine the problem to determine the bulk to which a human body
may be augmented before it will perish by its own weight.                 As re-
gards the projected         Institution,  Rumford surely had passed this
limit, and by the ponderosity of his scheme had ensured either the
necessity of change or the certainty of death.            In such an establish-
ment Davy was sure to be an iconoclast. He cared little for models —
not even for the apparatus with which his own best discoveries were
                                * Founded in 1753.

434                                 Professor Tyndall   [May 3, 10, and 17,
made, but incontinently broke it up whenever he found it could be
made subservient to further ends.
     The Journal of the Eoyal Institution was established at this time,
and published under Rumford's direction.         No private advertisements
were to appear in         it,
                        but    was to be sold for 3d. when its contents
                                    it
amounted to eight pages, and for 6d. when they amounted to sixteen.
The experiments and experimental lectures of Davy were then attracting
attention.   Rumours of the young chemist reached Rumford through
Mr. Underwood and Mr. James Thompson. At Rumford's request,
Davy came to London.        His life at the moment was purely land of
                                                                   a
promise, but Rumford had the sagacity to see the promise, and the
wisdom to act upon his insight.           Nor was his judgment rapidly
formed; for several     interviews,   doubtless meant to test the youth,
preceded his announcement to Davy, on the 16th of February, 1801,
the resolution of the managers,
                                         " That Mr. Humphry Davy be
engaged in the service of the Royal Institution, in the capacity of
Assistant Lecturer in Chemistry, Director of the Chemical Laboratory,
and Assistant Editor of the Journals of the Institution and that he
                                                              ;
be allowed to occupy      room in the house, and be furnished with coals
                                a
and candles, and that he be paid         salary of one hundred guineas per
                                           a
 annum."    Rumford,   moreover,    held  out to Davy the prospect,    if he
 devoted himself entirely and permanently to the Institution, of
 becoming, in the course of two or three years, full Professor of
 Chemistry, with      salary of 300Z. per annum, " provided," he adds,
                      a
 " that within that period you shall have given proofs of your fitness to
 hold that distinguished situation." This promise of the professorship
 in two or three years was ominous for Dr. Garnett, between whom and
 the managers differences soon arose which led to his withdrawal from
 the   Institution.
     Davy began his duties on Wednesday, the 11th of March, 1801.
 He was allowed the room adjoining that occupied by Dr. Garnett, to
 whom he was to refund the expenses incurred in furnishing the room.
 The committee of expenditure paid to Dr. Garnett 201. 2s. 3d. for          a
 new Brussels carpet, and 111. 6s. for twelve chairs, the carpet and
 chairs being transferred to the room occupied by the managers.
 " Count Rumford reported further that he had purchased cheaper               a
 second-hand carpet for Mr. Davy's room, together with such other
 articles as appeared to him necessary to render the room habitable,
 and among the rest      new sofa-bed, which, in order that
                           a                                  may serve
                                                                  it
 as    model for imitation, has been made complete in all its parts."
       a
      The name of man who has no superior in its annals now appears
                      a
 for the first time in connection with the Institution. Here also the
  sagacity of Rumford was justified by events.     At the suggestion of
  Sir Joseph Banks he had an interview with Dr. Thomas Young,
  destined to become so illustrious as the decipherer of the Egyptian
  hieroglyphics, and, by his discovery of Interference, the founder of
  the undulatory theory of light. It was proposed to him, by Rumford,
  to accept an engagement as Professor of Natural Philosophy in the

 1883.]    on Count  Rumford, Originator of      the  Royal Institution.     435
 Institution, as Editor of its Journals, and as superintendent of the
 house, at a salary of 300Z. per annum.        Young accepted the appoint-
 ment, and the Managers confirmed it by resolution on the 3rd of
 August, 1801 : — " Resolved, that the managers approve of the measures
 taken by Count Rumford ; and that the appointment of Dr. Young be
 confirmed."
     Rumford's health fluctuated perpetually, and it was said at the
 time that this was due in some measure to the fanciful notions he
 entertained, and acted on, with regard to diet and exercise.                But
 Dr. Young affirms that his habits     in   these respects. were guided by
his physicians.
     Many years ago, wishing to supplement my knowledge of the
 Turkish bath,    I  referred to a paper of Rumford's which gave an
account of a visit to Harrogate and his experience there.             According
to the rules of the place he had his bath in the evening, and went to
bed immediately afterwards. He found himself restless and feverish ;
the bath, indeed, seemed to do him more harm than good.               An obser-
vant fellow-lodger of his had had, and had corrected, the same expe-
rience. Acting on his advice, Rumford took his bath two hours before
his dinner, engaging afterwards in his usual work, or going out to
have a blow on the common.       So far from suffering from chill through
this exposure, he found himself invigorated by it.                My own ex-
perience,   I may say,  corroborates  all  this.     Rumford    took  the senses
of man as he found them,        and  tried    to  enhance    the gratifications
thence derived: — "To increase the pleasure of a warm bath he
suggests the burning of sweet scented woods, and aromatic gums and
resins in small chafing dishes in the bathing rooms, by which the air
will be perfumed with the most pleasant odours." He spiritedly
defends this counsel : — " Effeminacy is no doubt very despicable,
especially in a person who aspires to the character and virtues of a
man.          I
        But see no cause for calling anything effeminate which has
no tendency to diminish either the strength of the body, the dignity
of the sentiments, or the energy of the mind.           I see no good reason
for considering those grateful aromatic perfumes, which in all ages
have been held in such high estimation, as a less elegant or less
rational luxury than smoking tobacco or stuffing the nose with snuff."
    Rumford, for a year or so, occupied rooms in the Institution, but
his private residence was in Brompton Row, described by his friend
Pictet as being about a mile from London.            Grass and trees grew in
front of the house.     The windows had a double glazing, and outside
were placed vases of flowers and odorous shrubs.              Pictet, who was
Rumford's guest    in  1801, minutely   describes     the whole    arrangement
of the house. Into Rumford's working room, which overlooked the
country, the light came through a set of windows arranged on the
arc of a circle.    The window-sills were arranged with flowers and
shrubs, so that you might suppose yourself to be in the country, close
to a garden bordered by a park.           Pictet goes on to describe the
various strokes of ingenuity shown in the management of fuel and

436                             Professor Tyndall         [May 3, 10, and 17,
fire-places.     The beds, moreover, were disguised as elegant sofas.
Under each sofa were two deep drawers containing the bedding and
other night gear, all of which were hidden by a fringed valence.              At
night the sofa was converted in a few minutes into an excellent bed,
while in the morning, with equal rapidity, the bed was transformed
into an ornamental piece of furniture.           Pictet occupied one-half of
the charming dwelling.            Perfect freedom was given and enjoyed,
 and the learned Genevese always tried to arrange his day's work so
that he might, if possible, engage his friend on some subject of
research common to them both.
     A portion of the motive force of a man of Rumford's temperament
may be described as irritability.         During the possession of physical
vigour    and  sound   health,  this  force is clasped by power of will and
directed by intelligence and tact.           But when health slackens and
physical vigour subsides, what was formerly a firmly ruled power
 becomes an energy wanting adequate control.                Rumford's success
in managing all manner of men in Bavaria illustrates his pliancy
as much as his strength.           But before he started the Royal Insti-
tution his health had given way, and his irritability, it is to be
 feared, had got the upper hand.            In point of intellect, moreover,
 he came then into contact with people of larger calibre and more
 varied accomplishments than he had previously met.                   He could
 hardly count upon the entire sympathy of Young and Davy, though
 I  believe he remained on friendly terms with them to the end.
 They were gems of a different water, if           I may use the term, from
 Rumford.        The chief object of his fostering care was mechanical
 invention, as applied to the uses of life.           The pleasures of both
 Young and Davy lay in another sphere.            To them science was an end,
 not a means to an end.        The getting at the mind of nature, and the
 revealing    of  that mind    in  great theories, were the objects of their
 efforts, and formed the occupation of their lives.           Had they been as
 enthusiastic as Rumford himself in Rumford's own direction, the three
 united would probably have daunted opposition, and for a somewhat
 longer time endeavoured to realise Rumford's dream.             But differences
 arose between him and the other managers.            " It is very clear to me,"
 writes Dr. Bence Jones to Dr. Ellis, " that Count Rumford fell out
 with Mr. Bernard and with Sir John Hippesley.                The fact was that
 Rumford's idea of workshops and kitchen, industrial school, mechanics'
 institution, model exhibition, social club-house, and scientific com-
 mittees to do everything, was much too big and unworkable for a
 private body, and was fitted only for an absolute wealthy government."
 In 1803 Dr. Bence Jones informs us that difficulties were gathering
 round the Institution, and it was even proposed to sell it off.
  Rumford had quitted London and gone to Paris. By Davy's aid,
  Mr. Bernard and Sir John Hippesley carried on the work, but in
 a fashion different from that contemplated by Rumford — that is
  to say, "without workshops, or mechanics' institute, or kitchen, or
  model exhibition."      The place of these was taken by experimental

 1883.]    on Count  Rumford, Originator of  the Royal Institution.    437
and theoretical researches, which, instead of dealing with things
already achieved, carried the mind into unexplored regions of nature,
forgetful, if not neglectful, whether the discoveries made in that region
had or had not a bearing on the arts and comforts or necessities
of material life.
     Rumford and his Institution had to bear the brunt of ridicule, and
he felt it ; but men of ready wit have not abstained from exercising it
on societies of greater age and higher claims. Shafts of sarcasm
without number have been launched at the Royal Society. It is per-
fectly natural for persons who have little taste for scientific inquiry
and less knowledge of the methods of nature, to feel amused, if not
scandalised, by the apparently insignificant subjects which sometimes
occupy the scientific mind. They are not aware that in science the
most stupendous phenomena often find their suggestion and interpre-
tation in the most minute, — that the smallest laboratory fact is
connected by indissoluble ties with the grandest operations of nature.
Thus the iridescences of the common soap-bubble, subjected to
scientific analysis, have emerged in the conclusion that stellar space
is a plenum filled with a material substance, capable of transmitting
motion with a rapidity which would girdle the equatorial earth eight
times in a second ; while the tremors of this substance, in one form,
constitute what we call light, and, in all forms, constitute what we
call radiant heat. Not seeing this connection between great and
small ; not discerning that as regards the illustration of physical
principles there is no great and no small, the wits, considering the
small contemptible, permitted sarcasm to flow accordingly.             But
these things have passed away, otherwise it would not be superfluous
to remind this audience, as a case in point, that the splendour which
in the form of the electric light now falls upon our squares and
thoroughfares, has its germ and ancestry in a spark so feeble as to
be scarcely visible when first revealed within the walls of this
Institution.
    It  is with reluctance that  I take the slightest exception to what
my American friends have written regarding Rumford and his
achievements.     But what they have written induces me to assure them
that the scientific men of England are not prone to stinginess in
recognising the merits of their fellow-labourers in other lands ; and
had Rumford, instead of accomplishing none of his work in the land
of his birth, accomplished the whole of it there, his recognition
among us here would not be less hearty than it is now.           As things
stand, national prejudice, if it existed, might be expected to lean to
Rumford's side.      But no such prejudice exists, and to write as if it
did exist is a mistake. In reference to myself, Dr. Ellis, gently but still
reproachfully, makes the following remark : — " Professor Tyndall in
his work on Heat has but moderately recognised the claims and merit
of Rumford, when, after largely quoting from his essay, he adds,
'
  When the history of the dynamical theory of heat is written, the

438                           Professor Tyndall          [May    3, 10,     and 17,
man    who in opposition to the scientific belief of his time could
experiment, and reason upon experiment, as did Eumford in the
                                                                           "
investigation here referred to, cannot be lightly passed over.'                In
my opinion,     the  most   dignified   and  impressive way of dealing with
labours like those of Eumford, is to show by simple quotations, well
selected, what their merits are.         ThisI    did in the book referred to
by Dr. Ellis, which was published at least eight years in advance of
his. But the expression of my admiration for Eumford was not
confined to the passage above quoted, which is taken from the
appendix to one of my lectures.                             I
                                          In that lecture drew attention to
Eumford's labours in the following words : — "              I  have particular
pleasure    in  directing  the  reader's   attention  to  an  abstract  of Count
Eumford's memoir on the generation of heat by friction, contained
in the appendix to this lecture.             Eumford in this memoir anni-
hilates the material theory of heat.          Nothing more powerful on the
 subject  has  since  been  written."
      But I   must not go too far, nor suffer myself to deal with one-
 sided exclusiveness with the merits of Eumford.                  The theoretic
conceptions with which he dealt were not his conceptions, but had
been the property of science long prior to his day.                     I
                                                               This, fear, was
 forgotten when      the  following claim for Eumford was made by a
 writer who has done excellent service in diffusing sound science
                                                   "
 among the people of the United States : — He was the man who first
 took the question of the nature of heat out of the domain of meta-
 physics, where it had been speculated upon since the time of Aristotle,
 and placed it upon the true basis of physical experiment."                   The
 writer of this passage could hardly, when he wrote               it,  have been
 acquainted with the experiments and the reasonings of Boyle and
 Hooke, and Leibnitz and Locke.              As regards the nature of heat,
 these men were quite as far removed from metaphysical subtleties
 as Eumford himself.        They regarded heat as " very brisk agitation
                                                        a
 of the insensible parts of an object which produces in us that sensa-
 tion from whence we denominate the object hot              ;   so what in our
 sensation    isheat, in the object is nothing but motion."          Locke, from
 whom I      here quote, and who merely expresses the ideas previously
 enunciated by Boyle and Hooke, gives his reasons for holding this
 theoretic conception.       u This,"
                                       he says, " appears by the way heat         is
 produced, for we see that the rubbing of        a    brass nail upon       aboard
 will make    it  very hot and the axle-trees of carts and coaches are
                          ;
  often hot, and sometimes to    a    degree that it   sets them on fire, by the
 rubbing of the naves of the wheels upon them.               On the other side,
 the utmost degree of cold        is   the cessation of that motion of the
  insensible particles which to our touch        is  heat." The precision of
 this statement could not, within its limits, be exceeded at the present
 day.
      There    is   acurious resemblance, moreover, between one of the
  experiments of Boyle, and the most celebrated experiment of Eumford.
  Boyle employed three men accustomed to the work, to hammer nimbly

  1883.]    on Count  Rumford, Originator of  the Royal Institution.     439
 a piece   of iron. They made the metal so hot, that it could not be
 safely touched.     As in the case of Ruinford, people were looking on
 at this experiment, and Boyle's people, like those of Rumford, were
 struck with wonder, to see the sulphur of gunpowder ignited by heat
 produced without any fire. Hooke is equally clear as regards the
 nature of heat, and, like Rumford himself, but more than a century
 before him, he compares the vibrations of heat with sonorous vibra-
 tions. That Rumford went beyond these men is not to be denied.
 It could not be otherwise with a spirit so original and penetrating.
 But to speak of the space between him and Aristotle as if it were a
 scientific vacuum is surely a mistake.
     While in Paris, Rumford made the acquaintance of Madame
 Lavoisier, a lady of wealth, spirit, social distinction, and, it is to be
added, a lady of temper.      Her illustrious husband had suffered under
 the guillotine on the 8th of May, 1794 ; and inheriting his great
 name, together with a fortune of three million francs, she gathered
 round her, in her receptions, the most distinguished society of Paris.
 She and Rumford became friends, the friendship afterwards passing
into what was thought to be genuine affection.           The Elector of
Bavaria took great interest in his projected marriage, and when that
consummation came near, settled upon him an annuity of 4000 florins.
 Before their marriage he was joined by Madame Lavoisier at
Munich, whence they made a tour to Switzerland together. In a
letter to his daughter he thus describes his bride elect : "        I made
the acquaintance of this very amiable woman in Paris, who,        I believe,
would have no objection to having me for a husband, and who in all
respects would be a proper match for me.         She is a widow without
children, never having    had  any ; is about my own age (she was four
years younger than Rumford), enjoys good health, is very pleasant in
society, has a handsome fortune at her own disposal, enjoys a most
respectable reputation, keeps a good house, which is frequented by all
the first philosophers and men of eminence in the science and literature
of the age, or rather of Paris. And, what is more than all the rest,
is goodness itself."    He goes on to describe her as having been very
handsome in her day, " and even now at forty-six or forty-eight is not
bad looking."      He describes her as rather embonpoint, with a great
deal of vivacity, and as writing incomparably well.
     Before the marriage could take place, he was obliged to obtain
from America certificates of his birth, and of the death of his former
wife. All preliminaries having been arranged, Count Rumford and
Madame Lavoisier were married in Paris on the 24th of October,
1805.     He describes the house in which they lived, Rue d'Anjou,
No. 39, as a paradise.     " Removed from the noise and bustle of the
street, facing full to the south, in the midst of a beautiful garden of
more than two acres, well planted with trees and shrubbery.             The
entrance from the street is through an iron gate by a beautiful
winding avenue well planted, and the porter's lodge is by the side of
    Vol. X.     (No. 76.)                                       2 g

  this gate, a great bell to be rung in case of ceremonious visits."
  Long after this event Eumford's daughter commented on it thus : —
  " It seems there had been an
                                      acquaintance between these parties of
  four years before the marriage. It might be thought a long space
  of time for perfect acquaintance.         But, ' ah Providence ! thy ways
  are past finding out.'"
      In a letter written to his daughter two months after his marriage,
  he describes their style of living as really magnificent ; his wife as
  exceedingly fond of company, in the midst of which she makes a
  splendid figure. She seldom went out, but kept open house to all the
  great and worthy.        He describes their dinners and evening teas,
  which must have been trying to a man who longed for quiet. He could
  have borne the dinners, but the teas and their gossip annoyed him. In-
  stead of living melodious days, his life gradually became a discord ; and
  on the 15th of January, 1806, he confides to his daughter, as a family
  secret, that he is " not at all sure that two certain persons were not
  wholly mistaken in their marriage, as to each other's characters." The
  denouement hastened ; and on the first anniversary of his marriage he
 writes thus to his daughter : — " My dear child.          This being the first
 year's anniversary of my marriage, from what            I  wrote two months
 after it you will be curious to know how things stand at present.            I
 am sorry to say that experience only serves to confirm me in the
 belief that in character and natural propensities Madame de Eumford
 and myself are totally unlike, and never ought to have thought of
 marrying.      We are besides, both too independent, both in our senti-
 ments and habits of life, to live peaceably together, — she having been
 mistress all her days of her actions, and I, with no less liberty, leading
 for the most part the life of a bachelor. Very likely she is as much
 disaffected towards me as    I  am towards her. Little it matters with me,
 but  I call her a female dragon, — simply by that gentle name ! We
 have got to the pitch of my insisting on one thing and she on
 another."
      On the second anniversary of his marriage, matters were worse.
The quarrels between him and Madame had become more violent and
open, and having used the word quarrels to his daughter, he gives the
                                    I
following sample of them : — " am almost afraid to tell you the story,
my good child, lest in future you should not be good ; lest what         I am
about relating should set you a bad example, make you passionate,
and so on. But        I had been made very angry. A large party had
been invited     I  neither liked nor approved of, and invited for the
sole purpose of vexing me.          Our house being in the centre of the
garden,    walled  around,  with  iron gates, I put on my hat, walked down
to the porter's lodge, and gave him orders, on his peril, not to let any
one in.     Besides,  I took away the keys.       Madame went down, and
when the company arrived, she talked with them, — she on one side,
they on the other, of the high brick wall.           After that she goes and
pours boiling water on some of my beautiful flowers."
     Six months later on, the sounds of lamentation and woe are con-

1883.]   on Count      Rumford, Originator of   the   Royal Institution.              441
 tinued.     There was no alteration for the better.           He thought of
 separation, but the house and garden in the Eue d'Anjou being a
joint concern, legal difficulties arose as to the division of it. "                     I
 have suffered," he says to his daughter, " more than you can imagine
 for the last four weeks ; but my rights are incontestable and              am    I
 determined to maintain them.       I    have the misfortune to be married
 to one of the most imperious, tyrannical, unfeeling women that ever
 existed, and whose perseverance in pursuing an object is equal to her
 profound cunning and wickedness in framing it."                 He purposed
 taking    a  house   at Auteuil. It would be unfortunate             if,
                                                                      notwith-
 standing all the bounties of the King of Bavaria, he could not live
 more independently than with this unfeeling, cunning, tyrannical
             * Alas little do we know                                   Do you

 preserve my      letters?     You  will  perceive   thatI   have  given very
 different accounts of this woman, for lady      I     cannot call her."    He
 describes his habitation as no longer the abode of peace.          He break-
 fasts alone in his apartment, while to his infinite chagrin most of the
 visitors are his wife's determined adherents. He           sometimes present

 proofs of her implacable hatred and malice."
      The lease of the villa at Auteuil was purchased by Eumford in
 1808. The separation between him and his wife took place "amicably"
 on the 13th of June, 1809.        Ever afterwards, however, anger rankled
 in his heart. He never mentions his wife but in terms of repugnance
and condemnation.          His release from her fills him with unnatural
jubilation.     On the fourth anniversary of his wedding-day he writes
 to his daughter, "I     make choice of this day to write to you, in reality
to testify joy, but joy that  I     am away from her."       On the fifth anni-
versary    he writes thus :
                             " You will perceive that this     the anniversary

closing  six months  of his married  life he  describes   as a purgatory
sufficiently painful to do away with the sins of         thousand years.

1870, the young journalist Victor Noir was shot dead by Prince Pierre
Bonaparte. Here, towards the end of 1811, the count was joined by
his daughter. They found pleasure in each other's company, but the
affection between them does not appear to have been intense.          In his
conversations   with  her the  source of his bitterness appears.   "  I have
not," he says, " deserved to have so many enemies ; but it is all from
coming into France, and forming this horrible connection.         I  believe
that woman was born to be the torment of my life." The house and
gardens were beautiful ; tufted woods, winding paths, grapes in
abundance, and fifty kinds of roses. Notwithstanding his hostility to
his wife, he permitted her to visit him on apparently amicable terms.
The daughter paints her character as admirable, ascribing their
differences to individual independence arising from having been accus-
tomed to rule in their respective ways : " It was a fine match, could
they but have agreed." One day in driving out with her father, she
remarked to him how odd it was that he and his wife could not get on
together, when they seemed so friendly to each other, adding that it
struck her that Madame de Rumford could not be in her right mind.
He replied bitterly, " Her mind is, as it has ever been, to act differently
from what she appears."
     The statesman Guizot was one of Madame de Rumford's most
intimate friends, and his account of her and her house is certainly
calculated to modify the account of both given by her husband.
Rumford became her guest at a time when he enjoyed in public
" a splendid scientific popularity. His spirit was lofty, his con-
versation was full of interest, and his manners were marked by
gentle kindness. He made himself agreeable to Madame Lavoisier.
He accorded with her habits, her tastes, one might almost say with
her reminiscences             She married him, happy to offer to a dis-
tinguished    man   a  great fortune and a most agreeable existence."
Guizot goes on to state that their characters and temperaments were
incompatible.     They had both grown to maturity accustomed to inde-
pendence, which it is not always easy even for tender affection to
stifle. The lady had stipulated, on her second marriage, that she
 should be permitted to retain the name of Lavoisier, calling herself
Madame Lavoisier de Rumford.            This proved disagreeable to the
 Count, but she was not to be moved from her determination to
 retain the name.      I
                      " have," she says, " at the bottom of my heart
 a profound conviction that M. de Rumford will not disapprove of me
 for  it,and that on taking time for reflection, he will permit me to
 continue to fulfila  duty whichI    regard as sacred."   Guizot adds that
 the hope proved deceptive, and that " after some domestic agitations,
 which M. de Rumford, with more of tact, might have kept from
 becoming so notorious,     a    separation became necessary."       Guizot
 describes her dinners and receptions during the remaining twenty-
 seven years of her life as delightful.      Cultivated intellects, piquant
 and serious conversation, excellent music, freedom of mind and tongue,
 without personal antagonism or political bias, "licence of thought

  and speech without any distrust or disquiet as to what authority
  might judge or say-— a privilege then more precious than any one
  to-day imagines, just as one who has breathed under an air-pump can
  best appreciate the delight of free respiration."         One cannot, however,
  forget the pouring of boiling water over the roses.
      The ' Gentleman's Magazine ' for 1814 describes the seclusion in
  which Eumford's later days were spent.             After the death of the illus-
  trious Lagrange, he saw but two or three friends, nor did he attend
 the meetings of the National Institute, of which he was a member.
  Cuvier was then its perpetual secretary, and for him Rumford always
 entertained the highest esteem.             He differed from Laplace on the
 question of surface-tension, and dissent from a man then standing so
 high in the mathematical world was probably not without its penal con-
 sequences.    Rumford always congratulated himself on having brought
 forward two such celebrated men as the Bavarian general Wieden,
 who was originally a lawyer or land steward, and Sir Humphry
 Davy.     The German, French, Spanish, and Italian languages were as
 familiar to the count as English.             He played billiards against him-
 self ; he was fond of chess, which however made his feet like ice and
 his head like fire.   The designs of his own inventions were drawn by
 him with great skill ; but he had no knowledge of painting and sculp-
 ture, and but little feeling for them.         He had no taste for poetry, but
 great taste for landscape gardening. In later life his habits were
 most abstemious, and it is said that his strength was in this way so
reduced, as to render him unable to resist his last illness.                After
three days' suffering from nervous fever he succumbed on the 21st of
August, when he was on the eve of returning to England.                   He was
buried in the small cemetery of Auteuil, which has since been disused
as a place of burial.      The grave, says Dr. Ellis, is marked by a hori-
zontal stone   — une pierre tumulaire — and by a perpendicular monu-

                      Eumford's Scientific Work.
     As a factor in human affairs, Kumford ascribed to gunpowder a
dominant position.      No other invention had exercised so great an
influence. Hence the arduous labour he expended in determining its
action.     At Stoneland Lodge, the country seat of Lord George
Germain, in the year 1778, his inquiries into the force and applica-
tions of gunpowder began.          He directed his attention to the position
of the vent, the weight and pressure of the charge, its bursting power,
the quickness of combustion, the weight and velocity of the projectile,
the effect of windage, and to many other matters of interest to the
gunner.      On all these questions he threw important light.                 The
velocity was determined in two ways : first, by the ballistic pendulum,
invented by his predecessor and namesake Benjamin Robins ; and
secondly from the recoil of the gun itself. The ballistic pendulum is
a heavy mass, so suspended            as to be capable of free oscillation.
Against it the bullet is projected, and from the weight of the bullet,
the weight of the pendulum, and the arc, or distance, through which
it is urged by the bullet, the velocity of the latter may be calculated.
     To determine the recoil of the gun, he had it suspended by a
bifilar arrangement, which permitted it to swing back when it was
fired. Action and reaction being equal, the momentum of the gun
was the momentum of the bullet on leaving the gun, and from the
weight of the piece, and the arc of recoil, the velocity of the bullet
was computed.      The agreement between the results obtained by these
two methods was in many cases remarkable.                 Until quite recently,
Eumford's experiments      on  the  force   of gunpowder     were considered to
be the best extant.     A  mind    so  observant    could not  fail to notice the
heating effects produced by the percussion of the bullet against its
target, and by the jar of the gun at the moment of its discharge.              By
such   facts  he was naturally    led   to reflect on  that  connection   between
mechanical power and the generation of heat which he afterwards did
so much to illustrate and develope.
     The phenomena both of light and heat fascinated him ; and we
accordingly find him from time to time abandoning practical aims,
and seeking for knowledge which had no apparent practical outcome.
Thus we see him experimenting on the action of green vegetables and

other matters upon light, or rather the action of light on the green
leaves of plants. From this inquiry he turned to estimate the quantities
of moisture taken up by different substances in humid air. Sheeps' wool
he found to be the most absorbent, while cotton wool and ravellings
of fine liuen were among the least.      These experiments he regarded
as of the highest importance, as they explained,       to his mind, the
salubrity of flannel when worn next the skin. Its healthfullness he
ascribed to its power of taking up the moisture of the body, sensible
and insensible, and dispersing it by evaporation in the air.
     The propagation of heat in fluids was but imperfectly understood
when Eumford took the subject up.       In various parts of his writings,
he dwells on the importance of what he calls accidental observations,
deeming them more fruitful than those which have sprung from the
more recondite thoughts of the philosopher.      But accidents, however
numerous, if they fail to reach the proper soil are barren.     Rumford
ascribed to accident the investigations now referred to. He had been
  experimenting upon liquids, employing bulbs of copper with glass
 tubes attached to them.      On one occasion, having filled his bulb and
  tube with spirits of wine, and heated the liquid, he placed it to cool
 in a window where the sun happened to shine upon it. Particles of
  dust had found their way into the spirit, and the sun, shining on
  these particles, made their motions vividly apparent.          Along the
 axis of his tube the illuminated particles rose ; along its sides they fell,
  thus making manifest the currents within the liquid. The reason of
 this circulation is obvious enough.       The glass tube in contact with
 the cold air had its temperature lowered.       The glass drew heat from
 the liquid in contact with it,  which thereby being rendered more dense,
 fell along the sides of the tube, while, to supply its place, the lighter
 liquid rose along the axis. The motion here described          exactly that
                                                                     is
 of the great geyser of Iceland.     The water falls along the sides of the
geyser tube, and rises along the axis.      In this way then heat       pro-    is
 pagated through liquids.     It  is  case
                                       a   of bodily transport by currents,
and not one of true conduction from molecule to molecule.
      It immediately occurred to Rumford to hamper this motion of
convection.     He called to mind an observation he had made at Baiae,
when the water of the sea being cool to the touch, the sand              few    a
inches below the water was intolerably hot.         This he ascribed to the
impediment offered by the sand to the upward diffusion of the heat.
The length of time required by stewed apples to cool, also occurred
to him.     He had frequently burnt his mouth by          spoonful of apple
                                                               a
taken from the centre of     a    dish after the surface had become cool.
He devised thermometers with           view of bringing his notions to an
                                       a
experimental test.        With pure water he compared water slightly
thickened with starch, water containing eider-down, and stewed apples
bruised into  a   pulp which consisted almost wholly of water.        In all
cases he found the propagation of heat impeded, and cooling retarded,
by everything that prevented the formation of currents. As he pur-
sued his inquiries, the idea became more and more fixed in his mind
that convection   is the only means        by
                                          which heat    diffused in liquids.

He denied them all power of true conduction, and though his experi-
ments    did not, and could not, prove this, they did prove that in the
propagation of heat through the liquids he examined, which were water,
oil, and mercury, conduction played an extremely subordinate part.
     Eumford changes from time to time the tone of the philosopher
for that of the preacher. He seems filled with religious enthusiasm
on contemplating what he holds to be the wisdom and benevolence
displayed in the arrangement of the physical world.            One fact in
particular excited this emotion.       De Luc had pointed out that when
water is cooled, it shrinks in volume, until it reaches a temperature of
about 40° Fahr. At this point it ceases to contract, and expands when
cooled still further.     The expansion we now know to be due to in-
cipient crystallisation, or freezing, which when it once sets in greatly
enhances the expansion.      A consequence of this is that ice floats as a
lighter body upon water. This fact riveted the attention of Rumford,
and its obvious consequences filled him with the enthusiasm to which
I  have referred.     He was strong, but untrained, and his language
was not always such as a truly disciplined man of science would
employ.
            " Let me," he says, " beg the attention of my reader, while
I  endeavour to investigate this most interesting subject, and let me at
the same time bespeak his candour and indulgence.       I  feel the danger
to which a mortal exposes himself who has the temerity to undertake
to explain the designs of Infinite Wisdom.      The enterprise is adven-
turous, but it cannot surely be improper."
     He " explains " accordingly ; and, notwithstanding his professed
humility, does not hesitate to brand those who fail to see with
his eyes as "degraded, and quite callous to every ingenuous and
noble sentiment."       He indulges in excursions of the imagination
with a view of rendering clear the misfortunes that would accrue if
the arrangement of the world had been different from what it
is. "Had not Providence, in a manner which may be well con-
 sidered as miraculous," stopped the contraction of water before
it reached its freezing-point, and caused it to expand afterwards,
 a single winter would freeze every fresh-water lake within the

 polar circle to a vast depth, and it is more than probable that the
 regions of eternal frost would have spread on every side from the
 poles, and, advancing towards the equator, would have extended its
 dreary and solitary reign over a great part of what are now the most

 fertile and most inhabited climates of the world !             He expands
 this thesis in various directions, the whole argument being based
 on the assumption that
                             " all bodies are condensed
                                                          by cold, without
 limitation, water only excepted." Eepeated disappointments in such
 matters have taught us caution. Legitimate grounds for wonder exist
 everywhere around us ; but wonder must not be cultivated at the
 expense of truth.      Brought to the proper test, the assumption on
  which Eumford built his striking teleological argument is found to
 be a mere quicksand.      The fact that he adduces as unique is not an
 exception to a universal law. There are other substances, to which

1883.]    on Count   Bumford, Originator of   the Boyal Institution.     447
his reasoning has not the remotest application, which, like water,
expand before and during crystallisation.        The conditions necessary
to the life of our plauet must have existed before life appeared ; but
whether those conditions had prospective reference to life, or whether
its immanent energy did not seize upon conditions which grew into
being without any reference to life, we do not know ; and it would be
mere arrogance at the present day to dogmatise upon the subject.
     In the controversy whether heat was a form of matter or a form
of motion, Bumford espoused the latter view. Now those who sup-
posed heat to be matter naturally thought that it might be ponder-
able, and experiments favourable to this notion had been executed.
Operating with a balance of extreme delicacy, Rumford took up this
question, and treated it with great skill and caution.     His conclusion
from his experiments was that, if heat be a substance — a fluid sui
generis — it must be something so infinitely rare, even in its condensed
state, as to baffle all our attempts to discover its gravity. But
                                                                     " if the
opinion which has been adopted by many of our ablest philosophers,
that heat is an intestine vibratory motion of the constituent parts of
bodies, should be well founded, it is clear that the weights of bodies
can be in no wise affected by such motion."       The weight of a bell, he
urges in another place, is not affected by its sonorous vibration.
     Early in the year 1803, he being then in Munich, Rumford broke
ground in the domain of radiant heat. He prepared bright metallic
vessels, filled them with hot water, placed them in a large and quiet
room, and observed the time required to cool them down a certain
number of degrees.       Covering some of his vessels with Irish linen
and leaving others bare, he found, to his surprise, that the covered
vessels were more rapidly chilled than the naked ones.           Comparing
in the same room a thick glass bottle, filled with hot water, with a tin
bottle of the same shape and size, he found that the water in the glass
vessel cooled twice as rapidly as that in the tin one. When, moreover,
he coated his metallic vessel with glue, the cooling process was hastened,
as it had been by the linen.     Applying a second, a third, and a fourth
coating of glue, he found the chilling promoted ; but beyond this he
came to a point where the addition of any further coatings produced
a retardation of the chilling.    Painting some of his vessels black and
some white, he    found  the times  of cooling to be practically the same
          —
for both a result which he seems to have afterwards forgotten.
From these and other experiments of the same kind he drew the just
conclusion that a hot body does not lose its heat by the mere com-
munication of it to the air, but that a large proportion of the heat
escapes in rays, the escape being facilitated by the substances with
which his vessels were coated.      The more rapid chilling of the glass
bottle was due, in like manner, to the fact that glass possesses a
 greater radiative power than tin.
     He next applies himself with energy, zeal, and tenacity, to prove
 that there are frigorific rays which act in all respects like calorific
 rays, and which ^njoy an individuality quite as assured as that of the

latter.  Tie pictures his frigorific rays as produced by                   vibrations
of a special kind. In Pictet's celebrated experiment of                     conjugate
mirrors, and in many other experiments, chilling by a                      cold body
showed itself to be so exactly analogous to heating by a                  warm one,
that Rumford never could shake from his mind the notion of rays of
cold.    The fall of the thermometer in one focus when a lump of ice
was placed in the other, was in his view caused by a positive emission
of cold rays from the ice, and not to its absorption of the heat radiated
against it by the thermometer.           These frigorific rays, he says, were
suspected by Bacon.          Their existence was actually established by
the academicians of Florence, but these learned gentlemen were so
" blinded by their prejudices respecting the nature of heat, that they
did not believe the report of their own eyes."
     Rumford indulges in various untenable speculations and erroneous
notions regarding the part played by clothing, by the blackness of
the negro's skin, and by the oiled surface of the Hottentot.                  We are,
he contends, kept      warm    by   our   clothing,   not    so  much   by confining
our heat as by keeping off the frigorific rays which tend to cool us.
He reverts to the respective cases of a black and a white man, and
describes an experiment which elucidates his views. He covered two
of his vessels with goldbeater's skin, and painted one of them black
 with Indian ink, leaving the other of its natural white colour. Filling
both vessels with hot water, he left them to cool in the air of a large,
quiet room.      The vessel covered with the black skin represented a
negro,  the  other   vessel a white man ; and the result was that while
the black required only 23^- minutes to cool, the white man required
28 minutes.     The practical issue of the experiment is thus stated : —
" All     I
          will venture to say on the subject           is,   that were
                                                                     I      called to
inhabit     very
              a   hot  country,   nothing     should    prevent    me  from   making
the experiment of blackening my           skin, or,  at  least,  of wearinga    black
shirt, in the shade, and especially at night, in order to find out             if, by
those means,      could not contrive to make myself more comfortable."
                  I
     There was at times     a  headstrong element,      if   I    may use the term,
in Rumford's scientific reasoning.          He  here    overlooks    the fact that in
a  former experiment he found scarcely                an    appreciable difference
between white and black as regards their powers of cooling.                   He also
forgets  the possible    influence    ofa    second   coating,    which   his  former
experiments    had  revealed.    As    regards    the  negro    and  the  white  man,
Rumford's first experiment        illustrated    the   case    more   correctly than
any subsequent ones. There are, moreover, transparent substances
which, used as varnishes, would not have impaired the whiteness of
the goldbeater's skin, but which would have hastened the cooling
quite as much as the Indian ink.
     Those who are acquainted with Sir John Leslie's experiments on
radiant heat will not fail to notice that he and Rumford travelled
over common ground.            With    a   view of setting this matter right
                              entitled   " Historical     Review of Experiments
Rumford wrote         paper
                      a
on the Subject of Heat," in which he shows that his experiments

1883.]    on Count  Rumford, Originator of    the Royal Institution.  449
were not only talked about and executed before learned societies, but
that they were in part published prior to the appearance of Leslie's
celebrated work in 1804.       Still the style of that work furnishes,   I
think, internal evidence of its perfectly independent character, while
the extent and variety of Leslie's labours render it practically
impossible that they could have been derived from anything that
Rumford had previously done. The two philosophers had no personal
knowledge of each other, and the credit to be awarded, where they
deal with the same subject, belongs,    I think, equally to both.
    Rumford's experimental     work   was   far smaller in quantity than
that of Leslie, but in regard to theory he must be conceded the
highest place. In theory Leslie was inconsistent and confused, while
Rumford, judged by the circumstances of his time, was in the main
clear and correct.    The part played by the luminiferous ether in the
phenomena     of light had been revived and enforced by the powerful
experiments of Dr. Thomas Young.          The undulatory hypothesis was
therefore at hand, and Rumford made able use of it. He has written
a paper entitled "Reflections on Heat," in which he describes the
views regarding its nature that were prevalent in his time. " Some,"
he says, " regard it as a substance, others as a vibratory motion of the
particles of matter of which a body is composed."        The heating of a
body is, on the one hypothesis, due to the accumulation within it of
caloric, while others hold the heating to be due to the acceleration of
the vibratory motion. " On the hypothesis of vibratory motion, a
body which has become cold is thought to have lost nothing except
motion; on the other hypothesis, it is supposed to have lost some
material substance." The loss of motion Rumford clearly apprehends
to be due to its communication to "an eminently elastic fluid — an
ether which fills all space throughout the universe."         The theoretic
notions thus expressed are,   in point of clearness and correctness, far
in advance of those entertained by Leslie.
    As already mentioned, the fact of water changing its density at a
temperature of 40° Fahr., powerfully affected the mind of Rumford.
 On this subject he made many experiments ; and one of the minor
applications of the knowledge thus derived may be here noted. In
company with his friend Professor Pictet, of Geneva, he paid a visit
to the Mer de Glace, and discovered in the ice a pit "perfectly cylin-
drical, about 7 inches in diameter, and more than 4 feet deep, quite
full of water." He was informed by his guides that these pits are
formed in summer, and gradually increase in depth during the warm
weather.     How can these pits deepen ?        Rumford answers thus :—
The warm winds which in summer blow over the surface of the
column of ice-cold water, communicate some small degree of heat to
the fluid.   The water at the surface being thus rendered specifically
heavier, sinks to the bottom of the pit, to which the heat thus carried
down is communicated, the depth of the pit being thereby increased.
We have here a small specimen of Rumford's penetration, but it is a
very interesting one. The sun's invisible rays, however, are probably

450                          Professor Tyndall          [May 3, 10, and 17,
more influential   than the action of the warm wind in producing the
observed effect.
     Various  interesting experiments were made by Eumford on what
is now known as " surface tension." From his experiments he in-
ferred that the surface of a liquid — of water for example — is covered
by a pellicle which can be caused to tremble throughout, by touching it
with the point of a needle.       He proposed to the geometricians of
Paris to determine the shape of a drop resting on a horizontal
surface, and restrained solely by the resistance of a pellicle exerting a
given force on its surface.     This pellicle he considers to be due to
the adhesion of the particles of liquids to each other, and he makes
various ingenious calculations to determine the size of a particle of
heavy matter, of gold for instance, which would rest suspended in
 water because of its inability to force asunder the particles of the
liquid. The diameter of a sphere of gold which would behave in this
way he found to be -^-g-jVos" °f an i ncn -
     Even among scientific men, probably few are aware that Eumford
experimented on the diffusion of liquids ; a field of investigation in
which Graham afterwards rendered himself so eminent. Into a glass
cylinder,  If  inch in diameter and 8 inches high, he poured a layer of
saturated aqueous solution of muriate of soda 3 inches thick, over
this he carefully poured a layer of distilled water of the same thick-
ness, he then let a drop of the oil of cloves fall into the vessel.    This
oil, being heavier than the pure water and lighter than the solution,
rested as a sphere at the common boundary of the two liquids.             A
layer of olive oil four lines in thickness was then poured over the
water, in order to shut off the air.    The object of the experiment was
to ascertain whether one liquid remained permanently superposed
upon the other without any mixing.          If  this proved to be the case
the position of the drop     of oil  would   remain   constant ; but if the
heavy mineral solution rose into the water overhead, the drop of
oil, which Kumford called his "little sentinel," would warn him of
the event by rising in the liquid.     After twenty-four hours he entered
the cellar in which   the experiment   was  made, and found that the little
ball of oil had risen three lines. For six days it continued to rise at
the rate of about three lines a day.    He afterwards experimented with
other solutions, the result being u that the mixture went on continually,
but very slowly, between the various aqueous solutions employed and
the distilled water resting upon them."        Eumford's experiments were
probably prompted by his views on molecular physics. He would
hardly have thought of the foregoing arrangement were not the intestine
motions of the ultimate particles of bodies present to his mind. He
is, moreover, quite aware of the importance of the result which he has
here established. He says that the subject has often occupied his
                                                           " a considerable
thoughts, and that he had at different times made
number of experiments with a view of throwing light into the profound
darkness with which the subject is shrouded on every side."
     His manifold industry was devoted in part to steam considered as

1883.]   cm   Count Bumford, Originator   of   the   Royal Institution.    451
a  vehicle for transporting heat ; on the means of increasing the heat
obtained in the combustion of fuel ; on a new steam boiler, in which
we have a forecast of the tubular boiler of George Stevenson.           After
some preliminary experiments on wood and charcoal, he definitely
takes up the important investigation of the quantity of heat developed
in combustion, and in the condensation of vapours.          He describes the
new calorimeter employed in the inquiry.            It was a kind of worm,
through which the heated air and products of combustion were led,
and in which the heat was delivered up to cold water surrounding the
worm.
     He experimented upon white wax, spirit of wine, alcohol, sulphuric
ether, naphtha, charcoal, wood, and inflammable gases.             Whenever
it was possible he aimed at quantitative results, and in the present
instance he " estimated the calorific power of a body by the number
of parts, by weight, of water, which one part, by weight, of the body
would, on perfect combustion, raise one degree in temperature.         Thus,
1 lb. of charcoal, in combining with 2f lbs. of oxygen, to form car-
bonic acid, evolves heat sufficient to raise the temperature of about
8000 lbs. of water 1° C.        Similarly, 1 lb. of hydrogen, in combining
with 8 lbs. of oxygen, to form water, generates an amount of heat
sufficient to raise 34,000 lbs. of water 1° C. The calorific powers,
therefore, of carbon and hydrogen are as 8 : 34. The refined re-
searches of Favre and Silbermann entirely confirm these determina-
tions of Eumford." — (Percy.)         Following the experiments on com-
bustion, we have others made to determine the quantity of heat set
free by the condensation of various vapours, and the capacity of
various liquids for heat. We have also an elaborate inquiry into the
structure of wood, the specific gravity of its solid parts, the liquids
and elastic fluids contained in    it,   the quantity of charcoal to be ob-
tained from   it, and the heat generated by the combustion of wood of
different kinds.
     But the main object of Eumford's life and the subject which chiefly
interested him was the practical management of fire, and the economy
of fuel. Eighty-seven pages of the second volume of his collected
works are devoted to this subject.        The whole of the third volume     is
devoted to    it, whilea     large portion of the fourth and last volume
is  occupied with kindred questions.         Some of those essays are rather
tiresome   to a reader   of the  present day, and Eumford had      asuspicion
that they might appear so to contemporary readers.            " believe," he
                                                              I
       " that am sometimes too prolix for the taste of the
says,      I                                                      age but
                                                                       ;    it
should be remembered that the subjects     I      have undertaken to inves-
tigate are by no means indifferent to me that
                                            ;        I  conceive them to be
intimately connected with the comforts and enjoyments of mankind            ;
and that a    habit of revolving them in my mind, and reflecting on their
extensive usefulness, has awakened my enthusiasm, and rendered              it
quite impossible for me to treat them with cold indifference."
     For the most part,  it   is  only when Eumford     isself-conscious that
 this tedium appears.       He wishes to excite his reader's interest, and

452                         Professor Tyndall        [May 3, 10, and 17,
 sometimes adopts means to this end which defeat themselves.     Such is
 the case when he dwells with reiteration on the refined and exquisite
pleasure which he derives from being of service to humanity.        Some
 also would deem him tedious, though      I deem him courageous, when
he deals with the details of his schemes.    He leaves no stone unturned
in his effort to render himself clear. He is in many cases simply
 writing out a specification, to be followed in all particulars.      He
 gives directions as to the manner in which a slice of hasty pudding
is to be eaten. A small pit is to be dug in the centre of the cake, a
piece of butter placed in the pit, while the removed bit is to be placed
on the butter to aid in melting it.  You then begin at the circumference
 of your pudding, and eat all round, dipping each piece in the butter
before conveying it to the mouth.     Such details were sure to provoke
sarcasm, and they did provoke it.      But amid the verbosity we have
 incessant flashes of practical wisdom and examples of intellectual
force. When he ceases to think of the exquisite delight of his phi-
lanthropic labours — ceases to think of himself — and permits his own
personality to be effaced by his subject, we see Eumford at his best ;
and his best was excellent.      Suggestion follows suggestion, experi-
ment succeeds experiment, until he has finally exhausted his subject,
or is pulled up by inability to proceed further.
     He tested quantitatively the relative intensities of various lights,
constructing, while doing so, his well-known photometer.         Placing
two lights in front of a white screen, and at the same distance from it,
and fixing an opaque rod between the lights and the screen, he obtained
two shadows corresponding to the two lights.       When the lights were
equally intense, the shadows were equally dark, but when one of the
lights was more powerful than the other the shadow corresponding to
that other was rendered pale, because the light from the most intense
source fell upon it.   Eemoving the more intense light further from
the screen, until a point was reached when the shadows appeared
equal, Eumford obtained all the elements necessary for the computa-
tion of the relative intensities of the lights.   He had only to apply
the law of inverse square, which makes a double distance correspond
to a fourfold intensity, a treble distance to a ninefold intensity, and
so on.    In connection with these experiments he dwells repeatedly
upon a defect which harasses the official gas examiners of the present
day, and that is the fluctuations of the candles used as standards of
measurement.     These photometric measurements are succeeded by a
brief, but beautiful essay on " Coloured Shadows," which, in connec-
tion with another short essay on the " Harmony of Colours," strik-
ingly illustrates Eumford's penetration and experimental skill. He
produced two shadows, one from daylight, the other from candle-
light. The daylight shadow being shone upon by the candle, was,
as might be expected, yellow, because the candle sheds a yellow light.
But the other shadow, instead of being colourless, was " the most
beautiful blue that it was possible to imagine."       He states clearly
that the colour of one shadow is real, while that of the other is imagi-

  1883.]    on Count Rumford, Originator of    the Royal Institution.   453
                         "
  nary. He finds it impossible to produce two shadows at the same
  time from the same body, the one answering to a beam of daylight,
  and the other to the light of a candle or lamp, without these shadows
  being coloured, the one yellow, and the other blue."         He obtained
  shadows from     a  light    coloured  by  means  of  interposed glasses,
  and compared them with shadows obtained from uncoloured light.
  The shadows were always coloured when the lights differed from
  each other in whiteness, and the colours of the shadows were
  always such as, when added together, produced a pure white. The
 real colour in fact, evoked, or " called up," or summoned an imagi-
 nary complementary colour. Goethe probably derived the expression
 "                                                          " Farbenlehre "
    geforderte Farben," which occurs so often in the
 from the terminology of Rumford.
      But the experiments and discussion on which the fame of Rumford
 mainly rest are described in an essay of twenty pages, which almost
 vanishes in comparison with the sum total of his published work.
 A cannon foundry had been built under his superintendence at
 Munich, where the heat developed during the boring of cannon
 powerfully attracted his attention. Upon this heat he made numerous
 tentative experiments       which are described in the essay.        With
 the view of determining its exact quantity, he cut a cylinder from
 the muzzle end of a gun not yet bored, partially hollowed out
 this cylinder, and fitted into it a borer which resembled a blunt
 chisel in shape.      The borer being strongly pressed against the
 bottom of the cylinder, it was caused to rotate by horse-power.        He
 surrounded his cylinder with a wooden box, filling the box with water
 which embraced the entire cylinder.        Soon after the starting of the
 rotation, the water felt warm to the hand. In an hour it had risen to
 107° in temperature.       In two hours and twenty minutes it had risen
 to 200°, while in two hours and thirty minutes it actually boiled.
      " Rumford carefully estimated the quantity of heat possessed by
 each portion of his apparatus at the conclusion of his experiment, and
 adding all together, found a total sufficient to raise 26*58 lbs. of ice-
cold water to its boiling-point, or through 180° Fahr. By careful
calculation he found this heat equal to that given out by the com-
bustion of 2303 • 8 grains ( = 4^ oz. troy) of wax.         He then deter-
                        '
mined the ' celerity with which the heat was generated, summing
up thus : From the results of these computations it appears that
             '
the quantity of heat produced equably, or in a continuous stream, if
I   may use the expression, by the friction of the blunt steel borer
against the bottom of the hollow metallic cylinder, was greater than
that produced in the combustion of nine wax candles, each three-
quarters of an inch in diameter, all burning together with clear
bright flames.'
     " ' One horse,' he continues, ' would have been equal to the work
performed, though two were actually employed.           Heat may thus be
produced merely by      the  strength of a horse, and, in a case of neces-
sity, this heat might be used in cooking victuals. But no circumstances

454         Professor Tyndall on Count Bumford.         [May 3, 10, and 17.
could be imagined in which this method of procuring heat would be
advantageous; for more heat might be obtained by using the fodder
                                                  "
necessary for the support of a horse as fuel.'
    This is an extremely significant passage, intimating, as it does,
that Rumford saw clearly that the force of animals was derived from
the food, no creation of force taking place in the animal body.
    " By meditating on the results of all these experiments we are
naturally," he says, " brought to the great question which has so often
been the subject of speculation among philosophers, namely, What is
heat — is there any such thing as an igneous fluid ? Is there anything
that, with propriety, can be called caloric ? "
    " We have seen that a
                              very considerable quantity of heat may be
excited by the friction of two metallic surfaces, and given off in a
constant stream or flux in all directions, without interruption or
intermission, and without any signs of diminution or exhaustion. In
reasoning on this subject, we must not forget that most remarkable
circumstance, that the source of the heat generated by friction in
these experiments appeared        evidently to be inexhaustible.      It is
hardly necessary to add that anything which any insulated body or
system of bodies can continue to furnish without limitation cannot
possibly be a material substance ; and it appears to me to be ex-
tremely difficult, if not quite impossible, to form any distinct idea
of anything capable of being excited and communicated in those
experiments, except it be Motion."*

                                             On Rainbows.
    The oldest historic reference    to the rainbow is known to all : "     do     I
    set my bow    in the  cloud, and   it shall be for a token of a covenant
    between me and the earth. . . . And the bow shall be in the cloud ;
    and      I
             shall look upon       thatit,   may remember
                                                I              the everlasting
    covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that                    is
    upon the earth." To the sublime conceptions of the theologian
    succeeded the desire for exact knowledge characteristic of the man of
    science.    Whatever its ultimate cause might have been, the proximate
    cause of the rainbow was physical, and the aim of science was to
    account for the bow on physical principles.         Progress towards this
    consummation was very slow.           Slowly the ancients mastered the
    principles of reflection. Still more slowly were the laws of refrac-
    tion dug from the quarries in which nature had embedded them.                       I
    use this language, because the laws were incorporate in nature before
    they were discovered by man.        Until the time of Alhazan, an Arabian
    mathematician, who lived at the beginning of the twelfth century,
    the views entertained regarding refraction were utterly vague and
    incorrect. After Alhazan came Roger Bacon and Vitellio,* who mado
    and recorded many observations and measurements on the subject of

     A ray of light may, for our purposes, be presented to the mind as
a luminous straight line.     Let such a ray be supposed to fall vertically
upon a perfectly calm water surface.        The incidence, as it is called,
is then perpendicular, and the ray goes through the water without
deviation to the right or left. In other words, the ray in the air and
the ray in the water form one continuous straight line.       But the least
deviation from the perpendicular causes the ray to be broken, or
" refracted," at the point of incidence. What, then, is the law of
refraction discovered by Snell ? It is this, that no matter how the
angle of incidence, and with it the angle of refraction, may vary, the
relative magnitude of two lines, dependent on these angles, and called
their sines, remains, for the same medium, perfectly unchanged.
Measure, in other words, for various angles, each of these two lines
with a scale, and divide the length of the longer one by that of the
 shorter ; then, however the lines individually vary in length, the
 quotient yielded by this division remains absolutely the same. It           is,
 in fact, what    called the index of refraction of the medium.

 ments, the rainbow could not have been explained.        Again and again,
 moreover, the angular distance of the rainbow from the sun had been
 determined and found constant.      In this divine remembrancer there
 was no variableness.     A line drawn from the sun to the rainbow, and
 another drawn from the rainbow to the observer's eye, always enclosed
 an angle of 41°. Whence this steadfastness of position — this inflexible
 adherence to    a particular angle?     Newton gave to De Domini s*
 the credit of the answer  ;  but we really owe      to the genius of Des-

 on raindrop. He saw them in part reflected from the outside surface
      a
 of the drop. He saw them refracted on entering the drop, reflected
 from its back, and again refracted on their emergence.          Descartes
 was acquainted with the law of Snell, and taking up his pen he cal-
 culated, by means of that law, the whole course of the rays. He
 proved that the vast majority of them escaped from the drop as
 divergent rays, and, on this account, soon became so enfeebled as to
 produce no sensible effect upon the eye of an observer.       At one par-
 ticular angle, however — namely, the angle 41° aforesaid — they
 emerged in  a  practically parallel sheaf.   In their union was strength,
 for  it  was this particular    sheaf which carried the light of the

 doubt whether among the pleasures of the intellect there is any more
 pure and concentrated than that experienced by the scientific man
 when a difficulty which has challenged the human mind for ages
 melts before his eyes, and recrystallises as an illustration of natural
 law. This pleasure was doubtless experienced by Descartes when he
 succeeded in placing upon its true physical basis the most splendid
 meteor of our atmosphere.      Descartes showed, moreover, that the
 " secondary bow " was produced when the rays of light underwent two
 reflections within the drop, and two refractions at the points of inci-
 dence and emergence.
     It is said that Descartes behaved ungenerously to Snell — that,
 though acquainted with the unpublished papers of the learned Dutch-
 man, he failed to acknowledge his indebtedness.      On this I will not
             I
 dwell, for notice on the part of the public a tendency, at all events
 in some cases, to emphasise such shortcomings. The temporary weak-
 ness of a great man is often taken as a sample of his whole character.
 The spot upon the sun usurps the place of his " surpassing glory."
 This is not unfrequent, but it is nevertheless unfair.
     Descartes proved that according to the principles of refraction,
a circular band of light must appear in the heavens exactly where
the rainbow is seen. But how are the colours of the bow to be
accounted for ? Here his penetrative mind came to the very verge
of the solution, but the limits of knowledge at the time barred his
further progress.     He connected the colours of the rainbow with
those produced by a prism ; but then these latter needed explanation
just as much as the colours of the bow itself. The solution, indeed,
was not possible until the composite nature of white light had been
demonstrated by Newton.      Applying the law of Snell to the different
colours of the spectrum, Newton proved that the primary bow must
consist of a series of concentric circular bands, the largest of which
is red, and the smallest violet ; while in the secondary bow these
colours must be reversed.                                         I
                              The main secret of the rainbow, if may
use such language, was thus revealed.
     I  have said that each colour of the rainbow is carried to the
eye by a sheaf   of approximately parallel rays. But what determines
this parallelism?     Here our real difficulties begin, but they are
to be surmounted by attention.        Let us endeavour to follow the
course of the solar rays before and after they impinge upon a spherical
drop of water.     Take first of all the ray that passes through the
centre of the drop.    This particular ray strikes the back of the drop
as a perpendicular, its reflected portion returning along its own
course.     Take another ray close to this central one and parallel
to it —for the sun's rays when they reach the earth are parallel.
When this second ray enters the drop it is refracted ; on reaching the
back of the drop it is there reflected, being a second time refracted
on its emergence from the drop. Here the incident and the emergent
rays enclose a small angle with each other.         Take again a third
ray a little further from the central one than the last.      The drop

 will act upon it as it acted upon its neighbour, the incident and
 emergent rays inclosing in this instance a larger angle than before.
 As we retreat further from the central ray the enlargement of this
angle continues up to a certain point, where it reaches a maximum,
after which further retreat from the central ray diminishes the angle.
Now, a maximum resembles the ridge of a hill, or a watershed,
from which the land falls in a slope at each side.            In the case
before us the divergence of the rays when they quit the raindrop
would be represented by the steepness of the slope.          On the top of
the watershed  —  that is to say, in  the  neighbourhood of our maximum
— is a kind of summit level, where the slope for some distance almost
disappears.    But the disappearance of the slope indicates, in the
case of our raindrop, the absence of divergence.        Hence we find that
at our maximum, and close to                     it,
                                       there issues from the drop     sheaf                   a
of rays which are nearly, if not quite, parallel to each other.     These
                                     "

have in each case the accompanying deviation, or the angle enclosed
by the incident and emergent rays. It will be seen that as the angle
i increases, the deviation also increases up to 42° 28', after which,
although the angle of incidence goes on augmenting, the deviation
becomes less.     The maximum 42° 28' corresponds to an incidence
of 60°, but in reality at this point we have already passed, by small                         a
quantity, the exact maximum, which occurs between 58° and 59°. Its
amount       42° 30'.

the rainbow.     In    precisely similar manner the other colours rise
                         a
to their maximum, and fall on passing beyond             the maximum    it       ;
    * There is, in fact,  bundle of rays near the maximum, which, when they
                             a
enter the drop, are converged by refraction almost exactly to the same point at
its back.     If
              the convergence were quite exact, then the symmetry of the liquid
                                                                   — that
sphere would cause the rays to quit the drop as they entered                to say,  it       is
perfectly parallel.   But inasmuch as the convergence         not quite exact, the
                                                                       is
parallelism after emergence    only approximate.
                                      is            The emergent rays cut each
other at extremely sharp angles, thus forming

     for the violet band being 40° 30'.      The entire width of the primary
     rainbow is therefore 2°, part of this width being due to the angular
     magnitude of the sun.
          We have thus revealed to us the geometric construction of the
     rainbow.      But though the step here taken by Descartes and Newton
     was a great one, it left the theory of the bow incomplete. Within
     the rainbow proper, in certain conditions of the atmosphere, are seen
     a series of richly-coloured zones, which were not explained by either
     Descartes or Newton.       They are said to have been first described by
     Mariotte,*   and  they long challenged explanation.    At this point our
•
     difficulties thicken, but, as before, they are to be overcome by atten-
    tion. It belongs to the very essence of a maximum, approached con-
    tinuously on both sides, that on the two sides of it pairs of equal value
    may be found.       The maximum density of water, for example, is 39°
    Fahrenheit.      Its density when 5° colder, and when 5° warmer, than
    this maximum is the same.       So also with regard to the slopes of our
    watershed.      A series of pairs of points of the same elevation can be
    found upon the two sides of the ridge ; and, in the case of the rain-
    bow, on the two sides of the maximum deviation we have a succession
    of pairs of rays having the same deflection. Such rays travel along
    the same line, and add their forces together after they quit the drop.
    But light, thus reinforced by the coalescence of non-divergent rays,
    ought to reach the eye. It does so ; and were light what it was once
    supposed to be —a flight of minute particles sent by luminous bodies
    through space — then these pairs of equally deflected rays would
    diffuse brightness over a large portion of the area within the primary
    bow.      But inasmuch as light consists of leaves and not of particles,
    the principle of interference comes into play, in virtue of which waves
    can alternately reinforce and destroy each other.      Were the distance
    passed over, by      the  two  corresponding rays   within  the drop, the
    same, they would emerge as they entered.          But in no case are the
    distances the same.       The consequence is that when the rays emerge
    from the drop they are in a condition either to support or to destroy
    each other.      By such alternate reinforcement and destruction, which
    occur at different places for different colours, the coloured zones are
    produced within the primary bow.         They are called " supernumerary
    bows," and are seen, not only within the primary but sometimes also
    outside the secondary bow.        The condition requisite for their pro-
    duction   is, that the drops which constitute the shower shall all be of
    nearly the same size. When the drops are of different sizes, we
    have  a   confused superposition of the different colours, an approxima-
    tion to white light being the consequence.        This second step in the
    explanation of the rainbow was taken by man the quality of whose
                                                  a
     genius resembled that of Descartes or Newton, and who eighty-two

Institution of Great Britain.         I  refer, of course, to the illustrious
Thomas Young.*
     But our task is not, even now, complete.          The finishing touch of
the explanation of the rainbow was given by our last, eminent,
Astronomer Royal, Sir George Airy.                 Bringing the knowledge
possessed by the founders of the undulatory theory, and that gained
by subsequent workers, to bear upon the question, Sir George Airy
showed that, though Young's general principles were unassailable, his
calculations were sometimes wide of the mark. It was proved by
Airy that the curve of maximum illumination in the rainbow does
not quite coincide with the geometric curve of Descartes and Newton.
He also extended our knowledge of the supernumerary bows, and
corrected the positions which Young had assigned to them.                Finally,
Professor Miller, of Cambridge, and Dr. Galle, of Berlin, illustrated
by careful measurements with the theodolite the agreement which
exists between the theory of Airy and the facts of observation.
Thus, from Descartes to Airy, the intellectual force expended in the
elucidation of the rainbow, though broken up into distinct person-
alties, might be regarded as that of an individual artist, engaged
throughout this time in lovingly contemplating, revising, and perfect-
ing his work.
     We have thus cleared the ground for the series of experiments
which constitute the subject of this discourse. During our brief
residence in the Alps this year, we were favoured with some weather
of matchless perfection ; but we had also our share of foggy and drizzly
weather. On the night of the 22nd of September, the atmosphere
was especially dark and thick.                    I
                                      At 9 p.m. opened a door at the end
of a passage and looked out into the gloom. Behind me hung a
small lamp, by which the shadow of my body was cast upon the fog.
Such a shadow        I   had often seen, but in the present case it was
accompanied     by   an   appearance which      I   had not previously seen.
Swept through     the   darkness   round   the  shadow, and far beyond, not
only its boundary, but also beyond that of the illuminated fog, was a
pale, white, luminous circle, complete except at the point where it
was cut through by the shadow.              I
                                        As walked out into the fog, this
curious halo went in advance of me. Had not my demerits been so
                       I
well known to me, might have accepted the phenomenon as an evi-
dence of canonisation.       Benvenuto Cellini saw something of the kind
surrounding his shadow, and ascrbied it forthwith to supernatural
favour.    I varied the position and intensity of the lamp, and found
even a candle sufficient to render the luminous band visible.                With
two crossed laths      I  roughly measured the angle subtended by the
radius of the circle, and found it to be practically the angle which
had riveted the attention of Descartes — namely, 41°.            This and other
facts led me to suspect that the halo was a circular rainbow.              A week

subsequently, the air being in a similar misty condition, the luminous
circle was well seen from another door, the lamp which produced it
standing on a table behind me.
     It is not, however, necessary to go to the Alps to witness this
singular phenomenon.         Amid the heather of Hind Head        I
                                                                 have had
erected a hut, to which     I   escape when   my brain  needs rest  or my
muscles    lack   vigour.   The  hut has two doors, one opening     to   the
north and the other to the south, and in it we have been able to
occupy ourselves pleasantly and profitably during the recent misty
weather.     Removing the shade from a small petroleum lamp, and
placing    the   lamp behind me, as      I stood in either doorway, the
luminous circles surrounding my shadow on different nights were
very remarkable.       Sometimes they were best to the north, and some-
times the reverse, the difference depending for the most part on the
direction of the wind.         On Christmas night the atmosphere was
particularly good-natured. It was filled with true fog, through which,
however, descended palpably an extremely fine rain. Both to the
north and to the south of the hut the luminous circles were on this
occasion specially bright and well-defined.        They were, as          I
                                                                       ha\e
said, swept through the fog far beyond its illuminated area, and it
was the darkness against which they were projected which enabled
them to shed so much apparent light. The " effective rays," therefore,
which entered the eye in this observation gave direction, but not
distance, so that the circles appeared to come from a portion of the
atmosphere which had nothing to do with their production.            When
the lamp was taken out into the fog, the illumination of the medium
almost obliterated the halo. Once educated, the eye could trace                it,
butit   was toned down almost to vanishing. There       issome advantage,
therefore, in possessing  a    hut, on a moor or on   a  mountain, having
doors which limit the area of fog illuminated.
 I     have now to refer to another phenomenon which            but rarely
                                                                 is
seen, and which I       had an opportunity of witnessing on Christmas
Day.     The mist and drizzle in the early morning had been very
dense ;   a walk before breakfast caused my somewhat fluffy pilot dress
to be covered with minute water-globules, which, against the dark
background underneath, suggested the bloom of       a  plum. As the day
advanced, the south-eastern heaven became more luminous            and the
                                                                      ;
pale disk of    the  sun was at length seen struggling through drifting
clouds.     At ten o'clock the sun had become fairly victorious, the
heather was adorned by pendent drops, while certain branching
grasses, laden with liquid pearls, presented, in the sunlight, an appear-
ance of exquisite beauty. Walking across the common to the Portsmouth
road, my wife and   I,    on reaching  it,
                                         turned our faces sunwards.     The
smoke-like fog had vanished, but its disappearance was accompanied,
or perhaps caused, by the coalescence of its minuter particles into
little globules, visible where they caught the light at proper angle,

 downwards, and from side to side.        Their extreme mobility was well

calculated to suggest a notion prevalent on the Continent, that the
particles of a fog, instead of being full droplets, are really little
bladders or vesicles.        Clouds are supposed to owe their power of
flotation to this cause.       This vesicular theory never struck root in
England ;    nor  has it,I   apprehend, any foundation in fact.
      As stood in the midst of these eddying specks, so visible to the
      I
eye, yet so small and light as to be perfectly impalpable to the skin
both of hands and face,      I    remarked, " These particles must surely
yield  a   bow of some kind." Turning my back to the sun,           I   stooped
down so as to keep well within the layer of particles, which          I     sup-
posed to be    a  shallow one, and, looking towards the " Devil's Punch
 Bowl," saw the anticipated phenomenon.                  A bow without colour
spanned     the  Punch     Bowl,   and,    though   white   and pale, was well
denned, and exhibited an aspect of weird grandeur.                Once or twice
I   fancieda  faint ruddiness could be discerned on its outer boundary.
The stooping was not necessary, and as we walked along the new
 Portsmouth road, with the Punch Bowl to our left, the white arch
 marched along with us. At        a      certain point we ascended to the old
 Portsmouth road,      whence    with a    flat space of very dark heather in
 the foreground, we watched the bow.                The sun had then become
 strong, and the sky above us blue, nothing which could in any proper
 sense be called rain existing at the time in the atmosphere.          Suddenly
                                "                                               "
 my companion      exclaimed, I     s ee the  whole  circle meeting at my feet
                                                                             !
 At the same moment the circle became visible to me also. It was the
 darkness of our immediate foreground that enabled us to see the
 lower half of the pale luminous band projected against it. We walked
 round Hind Head Common with the bow almost always in view. Its
 crown sometimes disappeared,             showing that the minute globules
 which produced     it  did not extend to any great height in the atmo-
 sphere. In such cases, two shining buttresses were left behind, which,
 had not the bow been previously seen, would have lacked all signifi-
 cance. In some of the combes, or valleys, where the floating particles
  had collected in greater numbers, the end of the bow plunging into
  the combe emitted   a   light of more than the usual brightness. During
  our walk, the bow was broken and re-formed several times              ;    and,
  had it  not been for our previous experience, both in the Alps and at
  Hind Head,   it   might well have escaped attention. What this white
  bow lost in beauty and intensity, as compared with the ordinary
  coloured bow, was more than atoned for by its weirdness and its
  novelty to both observers.
       The white rainbow (I'arc-en-ciel hlanc) was first described by the
  Spaniard Don Antonio de Ulloa, Lieutenant of the Company of
  Gentleman Guards of the Marine.              By order of the King of Spain,
  Don Jorge Juan and Ulloa made an expedition to South America, an
  account of which   is  given in two amply-illustrated quarto volumes to
  be found in the library of the Royal Institution.               The bow was
  observed from the summit of the mountain Pambamarca, in Peru.
  The angle subtended by its radius was 33° 30', which         is   considerably
  less than the angle subtended by the radius of the ordinary bow.

  Between the phenomenon observed by us on Christmas Day, and that
  described by Ulloa, there aro some points of difference.     In his case
  fog of sufficient density existed to enable the shadows of him and his
  six companions to be seen, each, however, only by the person whose
  body cast the shadow, while around the head of each were observed
  those zones of colour which characterise the " spectre of the Brocken."
  In our case no shadows were to bo seen, for there was no fog-screen
 on which they could be cast.       This implies also the absence of the
 zones of colour observed by Ulloa.
      The white rainbow has been explained in various ways. A learned
  Frenchman, M. Bravais, who has written much on the optical pheno-
 mena of the atmosphere, and who can claim the additional recom-
 mendation of being a distinguished mountaineer, has sought to
 connect the bow with the vesicular theory to which                I
                                                                 have just
 referred. This theory, however, is more than doubtful, and it is not
 necessary.*     The genius of Thomas Young throws light upon this
 subject as upon so many others.        He showed that the whiteness of
 the bow was a direct consequence of the smallness of the drops which
 produce it. In fact, the wafted water-specks seen by us upon Hind
 Head f were the very kind needed for the production of the pheno-
 menon.     But the observations of Ulloa place his white bow distinctly
 within the arc that would be occupied by the ordinary rainbow — that
 is to say, in the region of supernumeraries ; and by the action of the
 supernumeraries upon each other Ulloa's bow was accounted for by
 Thomas Young.         The smaller the drops the broader are the zones of
 the supernumerary bows, and Young proved by calculation that when
the drops have a diameter of ^o^th or ^oW* n °f an inch, the bands
overlap each other, and produce white light by their mixture. Unlike
 the geometric bow, the radius of the white bow varies within certain
limits, which M. Bravais shows to be 33° 30' and 41° 46' respectively.
In the latter case the white bow is the ordinary bow deprived of its
colour by the smallness of the drops. In all the other cases it is
produced by tho action of the supernumeraries.
      The physical investigator desires not only to observe natural
phenomena but to re-create them — to bring them, that is, under the
dominion of experiment.         From observation we learn what nature is
willing to reveal. In experimenting we place her in the witness-box,
cross-examine her, and extract from her knowledge in excess of that
which would, or could, be spontaneously given. Accordingly, on my
return from Switzerland last October,         I
                                              sought to reproduce in the
laboratory   the  effects observed among  the mountains. My first object,
    * The vesicular theory was combated very ably in France by the Abbe Rail-
lard, who has also given an interesting analysis of the rainbow at the end of his
translation of my ' Notes on Light.'
    t Had our refuge in the Alps been built on the southern side of the valley of
the Rhone, so as to enable us to look with the sun behind us into the valley and
acrossit,  we should,
                  I    think, have frequently seen the white bow whereas on the

therefore, was to obtain artificially a mixture of fog and drizzle like
that observed from the door of our cottage.             A strong cylindrical
copper boiler, 16 inches high, and 12 inches in diameter, was nearly
filled with water, and heated by gas flames until steam of twenty
pounds pressure was produced. A valve at the top of the boiler was
then opened, when the steam issued violently into the atmosphere,
carrying droplets of water mechanically along with                  it,
                                                               and condensing
above to droplets of       similar kind. A fair imitation of the Alpine
                           a
atmosphere was thus produced. After               few tentative experiments,
                                                  a
the luminous circle was brought into view, and having once got hold
of   it,
       the next step was to enhance its intensity.       Oil lamps, the lime-
light, and the naked electric light were tried in succession, the
source of rays being placed in one room, the boiler in another, while
the observer stood, with his back to the light, between them. It          not,is
however, necessary to dwell upon these first experiments, surpassed as
they were by the arrangements subsequently adopted.               My mode of
proceeding    was  this.    The    electric light being placed in      camera
                                                                          a
with condensing lens
         a                  in  front, the position of the lens was so fixed
as to produce     beam sufficiently broad to clasp the whole of my head,
                  a
and leave an aureole of light around it. It being desirable to lessen
as much as possible the foreign light entering the eye, the beam was
received upon      adistant black surface, and          was easy to move the
                                                          it
head until its shadow occupied the centre of the illuminated area.         To
secure the best effect         was found necessary to stand close to the
                               it
boiler, so as to be immersed in the fog and drizzle. The fog, however,
was soon discovered to be         mere nuisance.
                                    a                Instead of enhancing,          it
blurred the effect, and therefore sought to abolish it. Allowing the
                           I
steam to issue for     afew seconds from the boiler, on closing the valve,
the cloud rapidly melted away, leaving behind                  host of minute
                                                               it   a
liquid spherules floating in the beam. A beautiful circular rainbow
was instantly swept through the air in front of the observer.             The
primary bow was duly attended by its secondary, with              the colours,
as usual, reversed.      The opening of the valve for           single second
                                                                     a
causes the bows to flash forth.       Thus, twenty times in succession, puffs
can be allowed to issue from the boiler, every puff being followed by
this beautiful meteor.         The bows produced by single puffs are
evanescent, because the little globules rapidly disappear.            Greater
permanence        secured when the valve
                  is                               left open for an interval
                                                   is
sufficient to discharge      copious amount of drizzle into the air.*

in width, while the circular bow engendered by these rays may be, to all appear-
ance, fifteen or twenty feet in diameter.     In such beam, indeed, the drops which

produce    the bow must  be very  near the  eye, for rays from the more distant drops
would not attain the required angle.       The apparent distance of the circular bow
is often great in comparison with that of the originating drops.         Both distance
and diameter may be made to undergo variations.          In the rainbow we do not see
a localised object, but receive     luminous impression, which

  1884.]                           on Rainbows.                              465
      Many other appliances for producing a fine rain have been tried,
  but  a reference to two of them will suffice.          The rose of a watering-
  pot naturally suggests a means of producing a shower ; and on the
  principle of the rose     I  had some spray-producers constructed. In
 each case the outer surface was convex, the thin convex metal plate
 being pierced by orifices too small to be seen by the naked eye.
 Small as they are, fillets of very sensible magnitude issue from the
 orifices, but at some distance below the spray-producer the fillets
 shake themselves asunder and form a fine rain.               The small orifices
 are very liable to get clogged by the particles suspended in London
 water.      In experiments with the rose, filtered water was therefore
 resorted to.     A large vessel was mounted on the roof of the Royal
 Institution, from the bottom of which descended vertically a piece of
 compo-tubing, an inch in diameter and about twenty feet long. By
 means of proper screw fittings, a single rose, or, when it is desired to
 increase the magnitude or density of the shower, a group of two,
 three, or four roses, is attached to the end of the compo-tube.           From
 these, on the turning on of a cock, the rain descends.             The circular
 bows produced by such rain are far richer in colour than those
 produced by the smaller globules of the condensed steam. To see the
effect in all its beauty and completeness, it is necessary to stand well
within the shower, not outside of it. A waterproof coat and cap are
therefore needed, to which a pair of goloshes may be added with
advantage.      A person standing outside the beam may see bits of both
primary     and  secondary in the places fixed by their respective angles ;
but the colours are washy and unimpressive, while within the shower,
with the shadow of the head occupying its proper position on the
screen, the brilliancy of the effect is extraordinary.             The primary
clothes itself in the richest tints, while the secondary, though less
vivid, shows its colours in surprising strength and purity.
      But the primary bow is accompanied by appearances calculated
to attract and rivet attention almost more than the bow itself.          I  have
already mentioned the existence of effective rays over and above those
which go to form the geometric bow.              They fall within the primary,
and,   to use  the  words  of  Thomas     Young,
                                                   " would exhibit a continued
diffusion of fainter light, but for the general law of interference
which divides the light into concentric rings."               One could almost
wish for the opportunity of showing Young how literally his words
are fulfilled and how beautifully his theory is illustrated, by these
artificial circular rainbows.       For here the space within the primaries
is swept by concentric supernumerary bands, coloured like the rain-
bow, and growing gradually narrower as they retreat from the
primary.      These spurious bows, as they are sometimes called,* which
constitute one of the most splendid illustrations of the principle of
interference, are separated from each other by zones of darkness,
where the light waves, on being added together, destroy each other.
                      A  term, I confess, not to my liking.

I have counted as many as eight of these beautiful bands, concentric
with the true primary.         The supernumeraries are formed next to tho
most refrangible colour of the bow, and therefore occur within the
primary circle.        But in the secondary bow, the violet, or most re-
frangible colour, is on the outside ; and, following the violet of the
secondary,     I have sometimes counted as many as five spurious bows.
Some notion may be formed of the intensity of the primary, when
the secondary is able to produce effects of this description.
      An extremely handy spray-producer is that employed to moisten
the air in the Houses of Parliament.             A fillet of water, issuing under
strong pressure from a small orifice, impinges on a little disk, placed
at a distance of about one-twentieth of an inch from the orifice.                 On
 striking    the disk,  the  water  spreads laterally,    and  breaks  up  into   ex-
                                          I
 ceedingly fine spray. Here also have used the spray-producer both
singly and in groups, the latter arrangement being resorted to when
 showers of special breadth and density were required. In regard to
 primaries, secondaries, and supernumeraries, extremely brilliant effects
have been obtained with this form of spray-producer. The quantity of
 water called upon being much less than that required by the rose, the
 fillet-and-disk instrument produces less flooding of the locality where
 the experiments are made.          In this latter respect, the steam spray is
 particularly handy.         A puff of two seconds' duration suffices to bring
 out the bows, the subsequent shower being so light as to render the
 use of waterproof clothing unnecessary.               In other cases, the incon-
 venience of flooding may be avoided to a great extent by turning on
 the spray for a short time only, and then cutting off the supply of
 water.      The vision of the bow being, however, proportionate to the
 duration of the shower, will, when the shower is brief, be evanescent.
 Hence, when quiet and continued contemplation of all the phenomena
  is desired, the observer must make up his mind to brave the rain.*
       In one important particular the spray-producer last described
 commends itself to our attention.              With it we can operate on sub-
  stances more costly than water, and obtain rainbows from liquids of
  the most various refractive indices. To extend the field of experiment
  in this direction, the following arrangement has been devised: A
  strong cylindrical iron bottle, wholly or partly filled with the liquid
  to be experimented on, is tightly closed by a brass cap.                 Through
  the cap passes a metal tube, soldered air-tight where it crosses the
  cap, and ending near the bottom of the iron bottle.              To the free end
  of this tube is attached the spray-producer. A second tube passes
  also through the cap, but ends above the surface of the liquid.                This
   second tube, which is long and flexible, is connected with               a  larger
  iron bottle, containing compressed air. Hoisting the small bottle to
   a convenient height, the tap of the larger bottle is carefully opened,
   the air passes through the flexible tube to the smaller bottle, exerts

its pressure upou the surface of the liquid therein contained, drives
it up the other tube, and causes it to impinge with any required
degree of force against the disk of the spray-producer.                From this it
falls in a fine rain. A great many liquids, including coloured ones,*
have been tested by this arrangement, and very remarkable results
have been obtained.        I  will confine myself here to a reference to two
liquids, which commend themselves on account of their cheapness and
of the brilliancy of their effects. Spirit of turpentine, forced from
the iron bottle, and caused to fall in a fine shower, produces a circular
bow of extraordinary intensity and depth of colour.                   With paraffin
oil or petroleum a similar effect is obtained.
     Spectrum analysis, as generally understood, occupies itself with
atomic, or molecular, action, but physical spectrum analysis may be
brought to bear upon our falling showers.                I asked myself whether
a composite   shower  —  that   is to  say,  one produced by the mingled spray
                             —
of two or more liquids could not be analysed and made to declare
its constituents by the production of the circular rainbows proper to
the respective liquids.         This was found to be the case. In the
ordinary   rainbow   the   narrowest      colour-band is produced by its most
refrangible light.      In   general,   the   greater the refraction, the smaller
will be the bow. Now, as spirit of turpentine and paraffin are both
more refractive than water,          I  thought it probable that in a mixed
shower of water and paraffin, or water and turpentine, the smaller and
more luminous circle of the latter ought to be seen within the larger
circle of the former. The result was exactly in accordance with this
anticipation.     Beginning with water, and producing its two bows,
and then allowing the turpentine to shower down and mingle with the
water, within the large and beautifully coloured water-wheel, the more
richly coloured circle of the turpentine makes its appearance.                   Or,
beginning with turpentine,          and     forming   its  concentrated iris ; on
turning on the water-spray, though to the eye the shower seems
absolutely homogeneous, its true character is instantly declared by
the flashing out of the larger concentric aqueous bow.                   The water
primary   is accompanied by        its   secondary   close  at  hand.    Associated,
moreover, with all the bows, primary and secondary, are the super-
numeraries which belong to them ; and a more superb experimental
illustration of optical principles it would be hardly possible to witness.
It is not the less impressive because extracted from the simple com-
 bination of a beam of light and a shower of rain.
     In the 'Philosophical Transactions' for 1835, the late Colonel
 Sykes gave a vivid description of a circular solar rainbow, observed by
 him in India, during periods when fogs and mists were prevalent in
 the chasms of the Ghats of the Deccan.
     " It was during such periods that            I had several opportunities of
 witnessing   that  singular phenomenon, the circular rainbow, which,
    * Kose-aniline, dissolved   in alcohol, produces   a splendid  bow with specially
 broad supernumeraries.

 from its rareness, is spoken of as a possible occurrence only.       The
 stratum of fog from the Konkun on some occasions rose somewhat
 above the level of the top of a precipice forming the north-west scarp
 of the hill fort of Hurreechundurghur, from 2000 to 3000 feet per-
 pendicular, without coming over upon the table-land.        I was placed
 at the edge of the precipice just without the limits of the fog, and
 with a cloudless sun at my back at a very low elevation. Under such
 a combination of favourable circumstances, the circular rainbow
 appeared quite perfect, of the most vivid colours, one half above the
 level on which   I stood, the other half below it.   Shadows in distinct
 outline of myself, my horse, and people appeared in the centre of the
 circle as a picture, to which the bow formed a resplendent frame. My
 attendants were incredulous that the figures they saw under such
 extraordinary circumstances could be their own shadows, and they
tossed their arms and legs about, and put their bodies into various
postures, to be assured of the fact by the corresponding movements of
the objects within the circle ; and it was some little time ere the
superstitious feeling with which the spectacle was viewed wore off.
                                   I
From our proximity to the fog, believe the diameter of the circle at
no time exceeded fifty or sixty feet.           The brilliant circle was
accompanied by the usual outer bow in fainter colours."
     Mr. E. Colborne Baber, an accomplished and intrepid traveller,
                                            '
has recently enriched the £ Transactions      of the Eoyal Geographical
Society by a paper of rare merit, in which his travels in Western
China are described. He made there the ascent of Mount O — an
eminence of great celebrity.      Its height is about 11,000 feet above
the sea, and it is flanked on one side by a cliff " a good deal more
than a mile in height." From the edge of this cliff, which is guarded
by posts and chains, you look into an abyss, and if fortune, or rather
the mists, favour you, you see there a miracle, which is thus described
by Mr. Baber : —
     "Naturally enough it is with some trepidation that pilgrims
approach this fearsome brink, but they are drawn to it by the hope of
beholding the mysterious apparition known as the 1 Fo-Kuang,' or
' Glory of Buddha,' which floats in mid-air, half-way down. So many
                                                  I
eye-witnesses had told me of this wonder, that could not doubt ; but
I  gazed long and steadfastly into the gulf without success, and came
away disappointed, but not incredulous.       It was described to me as a
circle of brilliant and many-coloured radiance, broken on the outside
with quick flashes and surrounding a central disk as bright as the sun,
but more beautiful.     Devout Buddhists assert that it is an emanation
from the aureole of Buddha, and a visible sign of the holiness of
Mount O.
     " Impossible as it may be deemed, the phenomenon does really exist.
I  suppose no better evidence could be desired for the attestation of a
Buddhist miracle than that of a Baptist missionary, unless, indeed, it
be, as in this case, that of two Baptist missionaries.    Two gentlemen
of that persuasion have ascended the mountain since my visit, and

have seen the Glory of Buddha several times.      They relate that it
resembles a golden sun-like disk, enclosed in a ring of prismatic
colours more closely blended than in the rainbow. . . . The mission-
aries inform me that it was about three o'clock in the afternoon, near
the middle of August, when they saw the meteor, and that it was only
visible when the precipice was more or less clothed in mist. It
appeared to lie on the surface of the mist, and was always in the
direction of a line drawn from the sun through their heads, as is
certified by the fact that the shadow of their heads was seen on the
meteor.    They could get their heads out of the way, so to speak, by
stooping down, but are not sure if they could do so by stepping aside.
Each spectator, however, could see the shadows of the bystanders as
well as his own projected on to the appearance. They did not observe
any rays spreading from it.         The central disk, they think, is a
reflected image  of the sun, and  the inclosing ring is a rainbow.     The
ring was in thickness about one-fourth of the diameter of the disk, and
distant from it by about the same extent ; but the recollection of one
informant was that the ring touched the disk, without any intervening
space.    The shadow of a head, when thrown upon            covered about
                                                                it>
one-eighth of the   whole  diameter   of the  meteor.   The rainbow ring
was not quite complete in its lower part, but they attribute this to
the interposition of the edge of the precipice.       They see no reason
why the appearance should not be visible at night when the moon                    is
brilliant and appositely placed. They profess themselves to have been
a  good deal surprised, but not startled, by the spectacle.   They would
consider      remarkable rather than astonishing, and are disposed to
                it
callit    very impressive phenomenon."
         is a
     It to be regretted that Mr. Baber failed to see the " Glory," and
that we in consequence miss his own description of it. There seems
a  slight inadvertence in the statement that the head could be got out of
                                                      "

the shadow of the head must have occupied its centre.            Stepping
 aside would simply displace the bow, but not abolish the shadow.
     Thus, starting from the first faint circle seen drawn through the
thick darkness at Alp Lusgen, we have steadily followed and developed
 our phenomenon, and ended by rendering the " Glory of Buddha "                    a
 captive of the laboratory.    The result might be taken as typical of
 larger things.

                   WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                         Friday, February      1, 1884.
  George Busk, Esq. F.R.S. Treasurer and Vice President, in the Chair.
                        Professor F. Max Muller.
         Bdjah Bdmmolmn Boy,       the  Beligiom Beformer of India.
  Professor Max Muller began by reminding his audience               that he
  had in former years often spoken to them about the Veda, the sacred
  book of the Brahmans.      Many might have wondered why he should
  have devoted the whole or at least the best part of his life to the
  publication of the text and commentary of this one book ; but he still
 felt convinced that there was no book more ancient and more impor-
  tant in the whole literature of the Aryan race, and that it would con-
 tinue to occupy the attention of scholars and philosophers as long as
 men cared for their own history and for the early development of
 language, thought, and religion.        He wished, however, to show that
 the Veda was not only the most ancient, but, in one sense also, the
 most modern of books ; that, directly or indirectly, it still was the
 foundation of the religion of 163,000,000 of human beings, for whom
 we ought to feel the deepest sympathy.          He adverted to the state-
 ments of certain scholars and Indian tourists that the Veda was dead
 and forgotten, and that the real religion of the Hindus was nothing
 but the most hideous idolatry.
     After showing how difficult it is for travellers ignorant of the
ancient language and literature of India to understand what they see
 in that country, the lecturer proceeded to define what was really
meant by the religion of a country, and how it ought to be studied.
He quoted several misrepresentations of the true character of the
Hindus, among others, the statement lately made by a gentleman long
resident in India, that a Hindu would rather kill a woman than a cow,
a statement which was about as true as that an Englishman would
rather shoot his wife than a fox.         Instead, however, of dealing in
assertions and   counter-assertions,   he should  prefer to put the question
as to the importance of the Veda even in modern times to a practical
test, and he proceeded to do so by examining the life and works of
the greatest religious reformer of modern India, Rammohun Roy.
     In India, he said, there is no taste for history, still less for
biography.     Home life and family life are shrouded by a veil which
no one ventures to lift, while public life has as yet hardly any exis-
tence in the East.     What we know, therefore, of the external life of
Eammohun Roy is very little, and even that little often very doubtful.
Rammohun Roy was born in 1774.              His ancestors on the paternal
and maternal sides belonged to the Brahmanic aristocracy.           He him-
self was educated for secular life, as his father had been before him,

  and ho devoted most of his time as a boy to a study of Persian and
  Arabic rather than of Sanskrit. Through his knowledge of the
  Koran he was led from his early youth to entertain the strongest
 aversion to idolatry and polytheism, and his outspoken contempt for
 his family idols led to serious misunderstandings between him and his
 parents.   The story that at the age of sixteen he wrote a book " Against
                                "                                         But
 the idolatry of all religions     seems to rest on no good authority.
 there can be no doubt that at that early age Rammohun Roy had to
 leave his paternal home to travel for many years in India and even
 beyond the frontiers of India.
     After his return he entered the service of the East India Company,
 and began to acquire a knowledge of English, which was at that time
 a very rare acquirement for a Hindu gentleman.          His hatred of every-
 thing English   was  changed     into a feeling  of sincere respect through
 his acquaintance with members of the Civil Service, and he was filled
with admiration for some of the master-works of English literature.
After he had acquired a sufficient fortune, partly by his own exer-
tions, partly by inheritance, he bought a house at Calcutta and
settled there in 1814.      His house soon became the centre of the moro
enlightened native society of Calcutta.              The relations between
 Englishmen and natives were far more cordial at that time than they
are now, and even such subjects as religion and native customs were
freely discussed between them.            In these discussions Rammohun
Roy maintained that idolatry and polytheism were mere corruptions
of the ancient religion of India, and that the only book in which that
ancient religion could be studied was the Veda. He boldly denounced
the malpractices of the priests, published extracts from the Veda to
show that their teaching contravened the letter and spirit of their
own Bible, and thus gathered around him a number of followers who
tried to bring the religion of the people back to its original purity
and simplicity.      He opposed the burning of widows, and at last
succeeded in having that hideous custom put down by law.
     He then turned to the study of the Old and the New Testaments,
and learnt sufficient Hebrew and Greek to be able to read these books
in the original.     He afterwards published the ' Precepts of Jesus,
the Guide to Peace and Happiness,' and wrote in the preface : —
" This simple code of religion and morality is so admirably calcu-
lated to elevate man's ideas to high and liberal notions of one God,
who has originally subjected all living creatures, without distinction
of caste, rank, or wealth, to change, disappointment, pain, and death,
and has equally admitted all to be partakers of the bountiful mercies
which he has lavished over nature, and is also so well fitted to regu-
late the conduct of the human race in the discharge of their various
duties to God, to themselves, and society, that       I cannot but hope the
best effects from its promulgation in the present form."            But, with
all his admiration for the teaching of Christ, Rammohun Roy would
never become a convert to Christianity.             When Dr. Mitford, the
first Bishop of Calcutta, endeavoured to convert him, and in doing so

472            Professor Max Milller   on Rammohun    Boy.        [Feb.  1,
dwelt not only on the truth and excellence of the Christian religion,
but spoke of the honour and repute that he would acquire as the first
apostle of Christ in India, Rammohun Roy felt so offended at the
suspicion that he could bo moved by such motives that he never
called on the Bishop again. In all his discussions with missionaries
and others, Rammohun Roy took his stand on the Veda as the word
of God, divinely inspired, and, therefore, infallible. It was on that
foundation that he established the new Church which has since
become famous under the name of Brahma-Samaj, the Church of the
believers in Brahman, the Supreme Spirit.
     After he had built and endowed a house of prayer at Calcutta
in 1830, he proceeded on his journey to England, being sent as
Envoy by the Emperor of Delhi, and wishing himself to see what a
 Christian country really was. He was received with great distinction
everywhere, and all who saw him spoke of him with the highest
admiration.    He also went to Paris, where he was received by
Louis Philippe. After his return to England he went to pay a visit
to Dr. Carpenter and other friends at Bristol, and there he died
suddenly in September, 1833.
     The lecture closed with an estimate of Rammohun Roy's character.
The Rajah was represented as an unselfish, honest, and bold man.
Easy as it might seem to us to give up idolatry, it was a bold thing for
a boy of sixteen to say, " I  will not worship what my father worships ;
I  will not pray as my mother prays.     I will look out for a new God
and new prayers, if haply   I may find them."    In after life he incurred
the risk of the loss of his ancestral property, he was insulted, and
even his life was threatened in the streets of Calcutta.      In all these
 struggles he had nothing to support him but the Veda and the voice
of his conscience, and a man who could fight so good a fight as he
did, deserves to be ranked among the great benefactors of the
human race. In conclusion the lecturer alluded to the latter growth
of the Brahma-Samaj, and more particularly to that momentous crisis
 when the Veda was deprived of its divine right, and the Brahma-
 Samaj, under Debendranath Tagore, became a Church without a Bible.
 It was shown that this important change was brought about by the
influence of European scholarship on the minds of the prominent
members of the Brahma-Samaj.          The mere fact of the Veda being
 printed and published in Europe, and thus being rendered accessible
 to every student, was sufficient to convince every unprejudiced mind
 that it was a venerable, but not a sacred, a human, but not a divine,
book.    To Rammohun Roy the Veda was true, because it was divine ;
 to Debendranath Tagore it was divine, because it was true.         It will
 have to be proved by the future history of the Brahma-Samaj whether
 eternal truth requires always a miraculous halo, or whether she can
 rule human hearts, unadorned by priestly hands, clad only in her
 own simplicity, beauty, and majesty.

the 3rd inst., as well as the Resolution passed at the Meeting of Managers of the
Royal Institution of Great Britain in honour of my beloved brother William,
whose memory will ever be dear to us.
    The recognition of my brother's great worth, so warmly expressed in this
Resolution, proves a real consolation to the bereaved sorrowing family of him who
has been so prematurely taken away, and will henceforth form for them in itself
a memorial of him.     These tokens of grateful remembrance of services rendered,
shown by the learned and scientific Societies of England, and the mourning
honours which the cultivated classes of England, my brother's beloved adopted
country, have paid him since his death, afford that great country at the same
time a further title to fame, since they are a fresh proof that England values and
honours merit without enquiring whence it originates.
    I beg you, dear Sir, to convey to the Managers of the Royal Institution the
heartfelt thanks of my brother's bereaved family for the Resolution sent to me.

                       The Chemical  Work of Wdhler.
 The lecturer began by reminding his audience of the brilliant
 eulogy of Liebig which Professor Hofmann pronounced in the
 theatre of the Boyal Institution some nine years ago, and said that it
 seemed fitting that something should be said concerning one whose
 life-long association with Liebig has exercised an undying influence
 on the development of scientific thought. The names of Liebig and
 Wohler are inseparably connected.          No truer indication of the
 singular strength and beauty of their relations could be given than is
contained in a letter from Liebig to Wohler written on the last day
of 1871.
                                             " Munchen, 31 December,  1871.
      "Ich kann das Jahr nicht ablaufen lassen, ohne Dir noch ein
 Zeichen meiner Fortexistenz zu geben und die herzlichsten Wiinsche
fur Dein und der Deinigen Wohl im neuen auszusprechen. Lange
werden wir uns Gliick wiinsche zu neuen Jahren nicht mehr senden
konnen, aber auch wenn wir tudt und langst verwest sind, werden die
Bande, die uns im Leben vereinigten, uns Beide in der Erinnerung
der Menschen stets zusammenhalten als ein nicht haiifiges Beispiel
von zwei Mannern, die treu, ohne Neid und Missgunst in demselben
Gebiete rangen und stritten und stets in Freundschaft eng verbunden
blieben."
     The father of Wohler, August Anton, was formerly an equerry in
 the service of the Elector William II. of Hesse ; his mother was con-
nected   by marriage with the minister of Eschersheim,      a  village near
Frankfort, and it was in the minister's house that he first saw the
light, on the 31st July, 1800. When quite a boy, the bent of his
mind towards natural science was directed by Dr Buch, a retired
physician who had devoted himself to the study of chemistry and
physics ; and it was in the kitchen of his patron's house that he
prepared the then newly-discovered element selenium, of which an

478                             Professor Thorpe                   [Feb. 15,
account was afterwards sent by Dr. Buch to Gilbert's * Annalen,' with
Wohler's name at the head of it. In his twentieth year he entered
the University of Marburg as a student of medicine, but all his
leisure time was devoted to chemical investigation.          He discovered,
without knowing that Davy had anticipated him, the intensely poison-
ous iodide of cyanogen ; and in a little paper on cyanogen compounds,
communicated for him by Dr. Buch to Gilbert's * Annalen,' we have
the first description        of the remarkable behaviour of mercuric
thiocyanate on heating, which has led to its use in the so-called
" Pharaoh's serpents."
    Wohler, attracted by the fame of Leopold Gmelin, left Marburg
for Heidelberg, and in the old cloisters which at that time constituted
the University laboratory, he began the work on cyanic acid which
some four or five years later culminated in his great discovery
of the synthesis of urea. In 1823 he obtained his degree, and on
Gmelin's advice abandoned medicine for chemistry.             The masterly
analytical   skill  of the  great  Swedish  chemist  Berzelius no less than
his labours towards the development of chemical theory had, at this
time, made him supreme among the chemists of Europe, and to Stock-
holm, therefore, Wohler determined to go. He was warmly wel-
comed by the illustrious Scandinavian chemist, of whom he has left us
an interesting sketch in his " Jugend-Erinnerungen eines Chemikers "
(Ber. Deuts. Chem. Gesell., 1875). Whilst at Stockholm he dis-
covered, among other products, some new compounds of tungsten,
notably the monoxychloride             and the tungsten sodium-bronze
(Na 2 W 3 9 ) which twenty     -five  years later was introduced into the
arts as a bronze powder.
    After a couple of months spent in travel with Berzelius in
company with the two Brongniarts, Wohler, at the expiration of
his year's stay in Sweden, returned to Germany and prepared to
settle at Heidelberg as "privat docent."           On the recommendation
of Leopold von Buch, Poggendorff and Mitscherlich, he was, how-
ever, appointed to the teachership of chemistry in the newly founded
Gewerbe Schule in Berlin. Wohler was now twenty-five, and in
possession of a laboratory which he could call his own.          One of the
many problems which he at this time attacked was the isolation of
aluminium, which he succeeded in obtaining by the method which
nearly twenty years afterwards was worked out on a manufacturing
scale by Sainte-Claire Deville.         Deville caused the first bar of the
metal thus procured to be struck as a medal, with the image of
Napoleon     III.  on the one side and the name of Wohler with the date
 1827 on the other, and presented it to the German chemist.
     But of the twenty- two memoirs and papers which Poggendorff 's
' Annalen ' exhibits as the outcome of Wohler's activity
                                                              during his six
years' stay in Berlin, that on the artificial formation of urea is by far
the most important.        Probably no single chemical discovery of this
century    has  exercised    so great an influence on the development of

 1884.]               On the Chemical  Work of Wdhler.                  479
liberal thought in science, and the words with which Wdhler closes
his account of the molecular transformation of ammonium cyanate —
a body of purely inorganic origin — into urea, a substance which of
all that might be named is the most characteristic of the action of the
                                                 " This
so-called vital force, are full of meaning.              unexpected result,"
he says,   " is a remarkable fact in so far as it presents an example of the
artificial formation of an organic body, and indeed one of animal origin
out of inorganic materials."
     At about the time that Wohler made this great discovery he became
acquainted with Liebig.        When Wohler was at Stockholm, think-
ing and working on cyanic acid, Liebig was in Paris engaged with
Gay Lussac on the study of the metallic compounds of fulminic
acid.    The result of the investigations was to show that the explo-
sive fulminic acid and the innocuous cyanic acid were of identical
composition. The idea that bodies could exist of identical ultimate
composition and yet possess essentially different properties was then
new to science.      Berzelius, the great chemical law-giver of his time,
scouted the notion as absurd, until the discovery by his pupil Wohler
of the molecular transformation of ammonium cyanate into urea forced
him to realise the fact, and to coin for us the word isomerism by which
that fact is denoted.    On the proposition of Wohler, the two chemists
                                " Es muss wirklich ein boser Damon sein,"
engaged to work together.
wrote Wohler to Liebig, "der uns immer wieder unvermerkt mit
unsern Arbeiten in Collision bringen und das chemische Publicum
glauben machen will, wir suchten dergleichen Zankapfel als Gegner
absichtlich auf. Ich denke aber, es soil ihm nicht gelingen. Wenn
Sie Lust dazu haben, so konnen wir uns den Spass machen, irgend eine
chemische Arbeit gemeinschaftlich vorzunehmen, um das Resultat
unter unserm gemeinschaftlichen Namen bekannt zu machen . . . Ich
iiberlasse die Wahl des Gegenstandes ganz Ihnen."
     Their first work in common was on mellitic acid. Shortly after
its appearance, Wohler and Liebig undertook a joint investigation on
cyanuric acid, in the course of which they observed the extraordinary
transformation of that acid into cyanic acid and the reconversion of
the cyanic acid into cyanuric acid — one of the most remarkable
instances of polymeric rearrangement known to the chemist.
     In 1831 Wohler was called from Berlin to Cassel, and for some little
time he was wholly engaged in the planning and erection of his new
laboratory at the Gewerbe Schule in that town. In the spring of the
following year, he proposed to Liebig to attempt to clear up the con-
fusion respecting the nature and relations of the essential oil of bitter
almonds. This, as a piece of work, was perhaps their masterpiece.
The investigation on the radicle of benzoic acid will ever remain one
of the greatest achievements in the history of organic chemistry. It
was full of facts, and rich in the promise of new material.            The
immediate effect of the paper was to establish the doctrine of organic
radicles by demonstrating the existence of groups of bodies which had

480                           Professor Thorpe                      [Feb. 15,
 their analogues and prototypes in inorganic chemistry.              The con-
 cluding words of the memoir strike in fact the key-note of the whole
 investigation.    " In once more reviewing and
                                                     connecting together the
 relations described in this paper, we find that they may be grouped
 round a common nucleus which preserves intact its nature and com-
 position in its associations with other bodies.          This stability has
 induced us to regard this nucleus as a kind of compound element, and
 to propose for it the special name of benzoyl."
      A significant feature of the memoir was that each of the substances
 described and correlated was the type of a group of bodies, some of
 which were known, but of which the analogies and relations were
 unthought of ; others of these bodies had yet to be discovered, a
 matter of little difficulty when the modes of their origin had been
 indicated.    The effect of this memoir on the chemical world was very
 great. Berzelius indeed regarded it as the dawn of a new day in
 vegetal chemistry, and proposed that the new radicle should be named
proin (from -n-pm, the beginning of day) or orthrin (from opOpos, day-
 break.
      Wdhler remained in Cassel nearly five years. In the autumn of
 1835 died Stromeyer, Professor of Chemistry in the University of
 Gottingen, and the choice as to his successor lay between Liebig and
 Wohler. Eventually Wohler was selected, and he entered on his work
 at Gottingen in the early part of 1836.      He was succeeded at Cassel by
                                  "                  "
 Bunsen, who was at that time privat docent            at Gottingen.     In the
 October of 1836, Wohler was ready for fresh work, and he proposed to
 Liebig to work out the singular origin of benzaldehyde (bitter almond
oil) from amygdalin under the influence of a nitrogenised ferment,
termed by Liebig and Wohler, emulsin.            Amygdalin in presence of
 water is decomposed       into benzaldehyde, prussic acid, and sugar
(glucose).     Both the emulsin and the amygdalin exist together in the
almonds, but are contained in separate cells and are only brought into
contact by the rupture of the cell-w Talls and the solvent action of the
water. Amygdalin was the prototype of a large and important group
of substances classed together as the glucosides.
     At the instigation of Wohler the friends again returned to the ques-
tion of the chemical nature of uric acid, and the memoir which they
published on this subject is of the profoundest interest not only to the
chemist but also to the physiologist.       Uric acid, originally discovered
by Scheele, was shown in 1815 by William Prout, then a boy of nine-
teen, to be the main constituent of the solid excreta of reptiles ; other
chemists had succeeded in obtaining various derivatives from                it,
indeed Prout himself had prepared from           it  the so-called purpuric
ac id —a   substance which years afterwards, as murexide, obtained          a
transitory importance in the arts as    a   colouring matter.    But nothing
was known concerning      the  constitution  of the body  or  of its  relations
to its derivatives until Wohler and Liebig attacked the problem.
The extraordinary mutability of uric acid, which had baffled and

clue to a labyrinth which led to a veritable treasure-house, and the
marvellous insight and rare analytical faculty of these two great
men were never more clearly indicated than in the way in which they
trod this intricate maze.     No fewer than fifteen new bodies were
added to the list of chemical compounds, and these were correlated
with the same masterly perspicacity that was so strikingly exhibited
in the memoir on the radicle of benzoic acid. Some of the greatest
triumphs of modern chemistry are seen in the synthesis of organic
bodies ; that organic chemistry was about to advance along this line
was clearly foreseen by Wohler and Liebig.            In opening their
account of this, the last great work they did in common, they
say  :—
     " From this  research the philosophy of chemistry will draw the
conclusion that the ultimate synthetical formation in our laboratories
of all organic bodies, in so far as they are not organised (in so weit
sie nicht mehr dem Organismus angehoren) may be regarded as not
only probable but certain. Sugar, salicin, morphin, will be artificially
obtained. As yet we know nothing of the way by which this result
is to be attained, inasmuch as the proximate materials for forming
these bodies are unknown ; but we shall know them."
    Henceforth the friends worked but little in common; Liebig's
energies were spent in other directions, and Wohler turned his atten-
tion chiefly to inorganic chemistry.     In concert with Sainte-Claire
Deville, he investigated boron and its compounds with aluminium and
nitrogen.   The readiness with which boron unites with nitrogen, and
the mode in which the compound may be decomposed, led Wohler to
a conception of the origin of boric acid and borax in the volcanic
waters in which they are frequently found. In collaboration with
Buff, he discovered the spontaneously inflammable hydride of silicon,
the analogue of marsh gas, and thereby laid the foundation-stone of a
superstructure which in time to come may be only less imposing
than that built up of the compounds of carbon.          Many years ago
Wollaston noted the presence of lustrous copper-coloured cubes in
the slags from iron-blast furnaces which he assumed to be metallic
titanium.   Wohler proved this substance to be a compound of carbon,
nitrogen, and titanium, and showed how it might be obtained.
                                                                         s
                                                                      Of
all the elements known to the chemist up to the period of Wohler's
cessation from work, it may be safely affirmed that there was not one
but that had passed through his hands in some form or other, and the
number of minerals and meteorites he analysed is legion. In all, he
was the author of 275 memoirs and papers ; of these, fifteen were
published with Liebig.
    In philosophic contentment, happy in his work, in his home life
and in his friendships, Wohler lived out his four-score years and two.
He made Gottingen famous as a school of chemistry ; on the com-
pletion of the one-and-twentieth year of his connection with the

482       Professor Thorpe on   the Chemical Work of Wohler. [Feb. 15,
University, it was found that upwards of 8000 students had attended
his lectures or worked in his laboratory.    He was a man whom the
world has delighted to honour, and there was hardly an academy of
science or a learned society which has not in some way or other
recognised his services to science.  He was made a foreign member of
the Eoyal Society in 1854, a corresponding member of the Berlin
Academy in 1855, Foreign Associate of the Institute of France in
1864, and in 1872 he received the Copley medal from the Eoyal

  1884.]   Sir F. Bramwell  on London (below bridge) Communication.    483
                   WEEKLY EVENING MEETING,
                        Friday, February 22, 1884.
  Sir William Bowman, Bart. LL.D. F.R.S. Honorary Secretary           and
                        Vice-President,  in the Chair.

         London (below bridge)    North and South     Communication.
 Two towns A and B, situated on the opposite banks of a tidal river.
 The current even at springs never great. The width never more
 than 440 yards. These towns have river frontages of some six and
 a half miles. Not inconsiderable towns, therefore — far from it ; in fact,
 one of them has a population of 890,000, and the other a population
 of 655,000.     Each, therefore, greater than Manchester, or Liverpool,
 or Birmingham, as large as Dublin or Glasgow, larger than Dresden,
 Milan, Rome, and other capitals or celebrated cities; and, taken
together (the true way of considering them), more than half the size of
Paris, larger than Berlin or than Vienna; yet, strange to relate, no means
 are provided by which a carriage can go from one town to the other,
 or, indeed, by which a foot passenger can (with one trifling exception)
 walk from one side of the river to the other, unless the passenger, or
 the driver of the carriage, is willing to journey from whatever part of
 the town he may be in, to the extreme west, where he will find a
 bridge. Moreover, the inhabitants of these two towns are not at war,
 for they are the subjects of one Sovereign, — in fact, they are practi-
 cally members of one municipality ; they speak the same language, thus
 there is no frontier custom-house,     not even an octroi, and no need
therefore to keep up a separation either for the prevention of invasion,
or of smuggling, nor is intercourse limited by the necessity of an
interpreter.
      Where can these two towns be situated ? Large as they are, must
they not be the decaying remains of some two cities in the far east,
Persia or China, from which all energy is absent ? In the far east as
understood by the world outside England they are not, but they are
indeed cities in the far east, according to the views of most of the
audience    I  have the honour of addressing to-night.      The designa-
tions of their subdistricts and streets, although relieved at rare
intervals by such pleasant names as Cherry Garden Stairs and
Nightingale Lane, are, as a rule, barbarous and uncouth: Tooley
Street, the home of the three tailors ; Horselydown ; Dockhead •
Jacob's Island (see 'Oliver Twist'); Rotherhithe; Pickle Herring
Stairs, on the one side ; — East Smithfield ; Ratcliff Highway ; Wapping

(where the Claimant was born) ; Boarded Entry ; Limehouse ; and
the  Isle of Dogs on the other. Yet to attain this far east demands no
passage by a P. and 0. (Polite and Obliging) steamer, no traversing of
a Suez Canal : a Hansom cab and 5s. will take yon there in three-
quarters of an hour.
     I  am afraid you will accuse me of a levity, unbecoming as well
the importance of the subject as the gravity of the Royal Institution ;
but for years this condition of things, that the 890,000 inhabitants
on the 16 square miles to the north-east could only communicate
with the 655,000 on the 42 square miles to the south-east by going
westward to London Bridge, has struck me as something perfectly
ludicrous : a feeling that was intensified, when, not so long ago,         I
listened to the arguments and evidence laid before a Parliamentary
Committee, grounded on the petty details of how many waggon
loads a-day traversed the imperfect means of communication which
now exist, put forward with the object of convincing that Committee
that no better means were needed ; that is to say — Afford no
facilities for traffic, thereby keep it down to a minimum, and then
argue that facilities are not needed for a minimum traffic.             The
development of this argument might be as follows : — Stop up
Piccadilly from end to end for repairing, ascertain that only ten
carts a-day came up side streets to the houses that could be reached
therefrom, and then determine there was no need to be at the cost
of completing the repairing, because the returns showed so small
a traffic. You will say this is absurd.       I  agree, it is absurd, but it
is no more absurd than the arguments which are used in reference
to below-bridge communication.         I venture to suggest that the true
way to look at the question is the one which           I  have adopted to-
night — two enormous towns, with practically no means of communi-
cation, and separated only by a puny stream, for puny it really is.        I
have on the wall a large map of London.        I have temporarily covered
over the part to the west of London Bridge, leaving visible the
" Below Bridge " part only. Let us dismiss from our minds the
north and south of London above that bridge, districts (or towns, as       I
shall call them hereafter) which really have nothing to do with the
question before us, except, that   I  propose to refer to them directly, by
way of illustration ; and let us ask ourselves whether it is not
absolutely incredible, and a matter which, when stated, inevitably
appears to be ridiculous, that this condition of separation of town A,
from town B, should exist ?
     Is such a state of things exceptional ? To answer this question
we will consider what has been done in other cases — New York and
Brooklyn.      The well-known map is on the wall.            The 1,350,000
inhabitants on Manhattan Island (New York) are separated by the
 East River from the 585,000 inhabitants of Brooklyn ; but for
years past these two millions have made strenuous efforts to, as
 far as lay in their power, annul this separation. They have estab-
 lished numerous lines of steam ferries, starting many times in the

 1884.]   on London (below bridge) North and South Communication.     485
hour, making the passage in but a few minutes, and giving all
passengers shelter, warmth, light, and the most scrupulous cleanliness,
in a way that shames anything that we can show of a similar nature
on this side of the water.      Excellent as this ferry service is, and
carrying as    it does, 112,000 persons a day, it did not satisfy the
needs of the inhabitants of these two towns, and the result has been,
the construction of that magnificent engineering work, the East Eiver
High Level Bridge, opened on the 24th of last May ; to a rough
diagram of which     I  now point. Three suspension spans, the central
one being    1595 feet, the two side spans 930 feet each, the bridge from
abutment to abutment therefore, 3455 feet in length; the clear
height above high water 135 feet ; the width of the platform 85 feet,
giving accommodation for a central footway, a double line of rails
for a rope tramway, a double line of road for carriages. The
foundation of one of the piers had to be carried down to a depth of
78 feet below high water, and was executed by the aid of compressed
air (to Lord Cochrane's invention of which system reference will
hereafter be made), the men working (at the maximum) in a pressure
of 33 lbs. to the square inch above atmosphere.        This bridge with
its approaches, and the land for them, it is believed, has cost from
 14 millions to 15 millions of dollars— say 2,800,000Z. to 3,000,000Z.,
of which Brooklyn, the smaller town, contributes two-thirds, and
New     York one-third.
     Having established this communication across the East Eiver to
Brooklyn, the inhabitants of New York are not satisfied.           To the
west of New York runs the Hudson, cutting it off from the State
of New Jersey, and its thriving towns ; and although there is main-
tained across this stream, a splendid service of ferry boats, there is
now being driven below the Hudson (and again by the use of Lord
Cochrane's system) a tunnel, of about a mile in length, to effect a
communication that shall be independent of ice and fogs, and one
through which the railway trains, that are now compelled to stop at
the New Jersey shore, shall be able to enter the City of New York
itself.
     Another instance nearer home — Liverpool with its 552,000 in-
habitants on the one side of the Mersey, and Birkenhead, and the
neighbouring towns, on the other side.      Here is established a system
of steam ferries, which, so far as easy access from the shore to the boat,
notwithstanding a great rise and fall of tide, is concerned, are not
surpassed, even if indeed they be equalled, anywhere ; and the boats
themselves of late years have been good, though not up to the standard
of the ferries of New York. But the inhabitants of Liverpool and
Birkenhead have not been content, and, as you know, even since the
beginning of this year, the preliminary drift way of the Mersey
Tunnel has been completed from side to side.             This tunnel (of
which the engineers are Mr. Brunlees and Mr. Fox) is one mile long
from shaft to shaft (1232 yards being under the river), and its floor
at the lowest point will be 145 feet below the level of high water ;

486                       Sir Frederick Bramwell                   [
                                                                     Feb. 22,
there is a minimum thickness of 30 feet of rock between its roof
and the bed of the river.         The tunnel will afford accommodation
to two lines of railway, and there will be passenger stations close to
the river bank, fitted with hydraulic hoists.
    When on the 8th of January, 1884, the two parties who had
advanced from the opposite shores, made the junction of their respective
works, it was found that the error horizontally was covered by the
width of the ranging pole, and vertically was only one-eighth of an
inch.
     But there are two towns nearer home that appear to appreciate
the advantages   of other communication, than that which can be afforded
by ferries, or than can be obtained by a journey of several miles to a
single bridge at one of their extremities.       The towns to which    I  told
you I should have to revert — those which lie north and south of the
Thames to the west of London Bridge. One hundred and thirty years
ago, when, from the best information         I can obtain, the population
west of London Bridge did not exceed, if indeed it amounted to,
600,000, including both north and south, this population found out that
it was not convenient when it was desired to cross the river to be obliged
to go eastward to London Bridge for that purpose, and thereupon were
built, Westminster, opened in 1750, and Blackfriars, completed in 1770.
These were public bridges free of toll. As London grew, companies
were formed, who built successively Vauxhall Bridge, opened in 1816 ;
Waterloo (originally called the Strand Bridge), opened in 1817 ; and
South wark in 1819 ; while the Lambeth Bridge, the Albert Bridge,
and the Wandsworth Bridge, also provided by companies, and the
Chelsea Bridge, built by the Government, have all been erected within
the last few years, as have been the various railway bridges.                I
have omitted mention in this chronological list, of Battersea, and
of Putney Bridges, because at the time they were built they were in
fact rural, and not Metropolitan Bridges ; but the growth of London
has embraced them within its bounds.          Both these bridges were the
result of private enterprise. Putney Bridge, the really operative Act
for which was not passed till 1728, deserves notice, because it is an
instance of delay in giving sanction for a communication the need of
which was felt more than half a century before the Act was passed :
the proposition to build the bridge having been successfully resisted
on absurd grounds (notably in 1671), that the erection of this Bridge
would stop the growth of the prosperity of London, as the North
and South Traffic would pass the Thames at Putney, and would no
longer come through the Metropolis.
    It is not so long ago since   I had the honour of lecturing in this
room,  not  upon  the  means of  communication     from side to side of the
Thames, but upon those from side        to  side  of  the English Channel.
The arguments which were used before the Committee of last year,
which sat upon the Channel Tunnel, must,          I  think (judging from a
pamphlet    I hold  in my  hand,  but for  the  authenticity  of which doI
not vouch), have been taken from those used in reference to this

London, as         I

Herbert to the like effect.

                                                                            a
54 voting for the Bill and 67 against it.
    I   fear this Putney Bridge digression has withdrawn our minds
from the fact that our two towns were well supplied with bridges,
some free and some the subject of tolls.                   But their inhabitants
were not, however,           content    even   with   this   condition of bridge
accommodation          they determined to get rid of the tolls

wark first, and the various other bridges more recently, have been
purchased and thrown open for the use of these inhabitants, who in the
seven and      aquarter miles from London Bridge to Putney, have ten
road bridges and one foot bridge, while, as has been said, the two
eastern towns in practically the same number of miles, London Bridge
to Blackwall, have no means of communication whatever, except the
Thames Tunnel, which               now used for
                                      is            railway, and

for .about 1050 feet from the Surrey shore, and was then abandoned
in consequence of the inflow of water, and the want of funds.
    In 1826 the talented Marc Isambard Brunei commenced, from a
point a little to the east of Eotherhithe Church, the celebrated
Thames Tunnel. I have had lent to me by Mr. Law, who was an
assistant engineer in the carrying out of the Thames Tunnel, a
diagram of the work, as intended. It was proposed, that on each side
of the river there should be sunk a circular shaft 200 feet in diameter,
and containing a spiral roadway, having a rise of one in twenty-five,
by which vehicular traffic could ascend and descend.      At the bottom
the roads were to pass across two other shafts, each of 50 feet
diameter, provided with staircases, for the foot passengers.        The
tunnel itself had two separated roadways, with footways, and arches
of communication, from the one roadway to the other. There is no
doubt that this was a very wonderful work, and one that largely
occupied public attention. Forty years ago the particulars of its
construction were well known, and it would have been a waste of
time to have described them to an audience in this room; but now
the details are forgotten, and   I  think that  I  may be forgiven if  I
ask attention for a few minutes, while     I   relate how the work was
carried out.
     The ground on the Surrey side having been levelled, a wooden
curb provided on its exterior with a cast-iron ring, having a cutting
edge, was laid upon the levelled ground, and on a framework of short
piles to temporarily support    it, and upon this curb was built, in the
form of a   tower, the brick lining, that was to be, of the shaft.   The
outside of the tower was smoothly covered with Roman cement,
the material employed in the brickwork itself.          As soon as the
tower had attained some 20 feet in height, the earth was excavated
from within the ring, which then commenced under the weight of the
brickwork to cut its way into the earth, and, with the tower, to
descend into the excavation.      As the tower sank, more and more
 brickwork was added to the top, and, as need arose, the walls were
 weighted.     In this way the curb was got down to within 40 feet
 of the required distance, when it  stuck fast, and the remainder of the
 work   had   to be  done by the  process of underpinning.     The shaft
 being thus completed down to the required level, and the pumping-
 machinery having been fixed, an opening was formed in that side of
 the brick tower which was towards the river, and the driving of the
 excavation was commenced.      This excavation was perfect rectangle,
                                                    a
 38 feet wide by 22 feet high, filled with brickwork in Roman cement,
 but of course leaving the two holes constituting the double roadway.
 The work was carried out by means of the " Shield."
      Through the kindness of the Council of Trinity College, Dublin,
I  have been enabled to place on the wall enlarged diagrams of the
 tunnel.   The diagram shows that the shield consisted of twelve
 vertical frames, placed side-by-side like books upon     a   book-shelf.
 Each of these frames extended the full height of the excava-

1884.]   on   London (below bridge) North and South Communication.     489
tion, and was divided into three storeys, so as to afford in the
 whole shield working spaces for thirty-six men: in some cases it
appears that, under a dangerous state of things, as many as four men
 were needed in one of these spaces, which were technically called
 " boxes."    Each frame was in fact a girder, the top and bottom of
 which were supported by powerful screws, abutting against the end
of the already completed brickwork of the tunnel, while the
 weight was taken by a screw-leg, the foot being stepped into a shoe,
carried on a bottom plate, resting on 3-inch elm planks, which were
supported on the soil.         Radius bars were provided between the
frames, so that while one frame could be moved in advance of its
neighbours, it was prevented by the radius bars from rubbing against
them, and thus the friction was diminished.        The tops of the frames
supported cast-iron plates, which at the end next the brickwork were
continued by wrought-iron plates, that extended over it so as to
exclude the earth.       Plates of a generally similar construction were
carried by the sides of the shield.       Each frame supported at its front
a number of horizontal boards about 6 inches deep and about 3 inches
thick ; these were called poling-boards ; they were latched one to
another, so as to make a kind of flexible wooden blind.      Screws at the
ends of the poling-boards, supported them from their own frame,
except at the times when the frame was being pushed forward, and
then the supporting screws, abutted on the frames adjoining their own.
Assume, for example, the frames to be numbered from 1 on the
left hand to 12 on the right, and that numbers 1, 3, 5, &c, were
three inches more forward than numbers 2, 4, 6, &c. : the workmen
in these even-numbered frames, took down one poling-board in each
box, picked out the earth, which he found in front of    it, for   distance
                                                                   a
of 6  inches,   then  replaced  the  board,  took down  another  board, and
repeated the operation, until the earth in front of these even-numbered
frames, had been excavated the     6    inches. Then (their poling-boards
being, as already said, supported by the screws abutting on the
neighbouring, the odd-numbered, frames) the even-numbered frames
were screwed forward the     6   inches, that had been excavated, and thus
became   3  inches in advance, of the odd-numbered frames.        The odd-
numbered frames were then dealt with in the manner that had been
pursued with the even-numbered, and their poling-boards being sup-
ported from the even- numbered frames, the odd numbers were driven
on the   6 inches, so as once more to become the advanced frames.        As
the shield went forward the brickwork was added to, so as to be
always about     9 feet behind the medium position of the face of the
poling-boards,    and  in this way the sheet-iron tailpieces of the roof
and sides were kept supported by the brickwork.           The arches were
turned on narrow centerings, which travelled forward as the work
progressed.
    The openings in the intermediate wall between the two roadways
were not formed in this wall as     was built, but were cut through
                                    it
afterwards.   have described the operations in the shield as going on

very systematically and quite comfortably, but this was by no means
the case in practice.      The first 550 feet of the tunnel, it is true,
were driven without much difficulty, and were finished in about sixteen
and a half months from its commencement on January 1st, 1826, giving
an average rate of progress of from 7 to 8 feet per week, and for many
 weeks as much as 11 or even 12 feet of advance were made; but on
the 18th of May, 1827, the material through which the tunnel was
passing being little better than semi-liquid slush, and the then shield
 not being of the same excellent construction as the second one (the
one   I  have described), the water broke in and compelled the stoppage
of the works. Clay was lowered in bags, from above through the
 water, into the hole formed in the bed of the river, and by
September 28th of the same year, forward work was resumed.              On
January 12th, 1828, the water again broke in.            By May 6th the
 workmen once more mastered the water, but shortly after, the funds
failing, the ends were temporarily walled up, a length of 740 feet
having been driven, and this condition of affairs remained until 1835,
when, the Government having agreed to advance money, a new shield
was made, and the work was resumed.
     The Wapping shaft was prepared and sunk, in readiness for a
junction with the advancing tunnel, and in 1843, on the 25th of
March, the tunnel was opened for foot passengers.       The whole length,
from the side of the Kotherhithe shaft to the side of the Wapping
 shaft, is 1208 feet, of which 1014 feet are under the river at high water.
 It was stated by Mr. Brunei, that while the total weight of material
excavated was 63,000 tons, that of the brickwork put in its place was
only 26,000 tons, thus showing, that so far from an extra strain having
been imposed upon the soil, it had been relieved of 37,000 tons of
load. The Wapping shaft was got down the whole way by the
sinking process, and no underpinning was needed.           I saw this shaft
in course of execution, and Mr. Brunei took me into the shield when
                                                          I
it was about 130 feet from the Wapping shore ; and remember that
the blows of the pile-engines, which were driving piles, for the tunnel
wharf, were distinctly audible, although some 200 feet of earth inter-
vened at that time.
     The large shafts for the vehicular traffic were never sunk, and the
 tunnel, as you all know, is now part of the East London Eailway,
 affording a communication from the Liverpool Street Station in the
City, to New Cross, and from thence to Brighton, and to other places.
     I  cannot quit the subject of the Thames Tunnel, without alluding
to an important invention, to which it gave rise.        In 1830, you will
remember, the ends of the tunnel were walled up, and no work was
being carried on. In that year the celebrated Lord Cochrane (whose
locomotive    I helped to make when     I was an apprentice) had a grant
of a patent, No. 6018, for a method which he said was applicable to
the making of such a tunnel " as that now executing beneath the River
Thames at Rotherhithe," and to the sinking of cylinders for bridge
foundations,     This invention consisted in the application of air, com-

1884.] on London {below bridge) North and South Communication.          491
 pressed to such a point as to entirely, or partially, balance the pressure
 of the water, in the soil through which the work was being carried
 out, and thus to stop, or to greatly diminish, its influx.            Lord
 Cochrane showed the means of doing this — of passing men in and
 out of the work, by air locks — of passing materials in and out by
 the same means, or by tubes having their ends open but sealed by a
 column of water ; in fact, he described all that has ever since been
 found necessary, or even desirable, in compressed-air cylinder sinking ;
 but, so far as   Iknow, no use was made of the invention until 1850,
 when it was employed in sinking the cylinders for Rochester Bridge.
I     I
   felt   ought not to let this admirable invention, of so very remark-
 able a man, pass without a brief notice.
     The only other executed work, making communication from side
 to side of the river, below bridge, is that already referred to — the small
subway from Tower Hill. This consists of a cast-iron tube, about
 7 feet external diameter, and about 6 feet 6 inches clear internal
diameter.     The engineer was Mr. P. W. Barlow.            It was opened
for traffic in the beginning of the year 1871, the work being executed
in stiff clay the whole way, no difficulties of importance were met with.
 The authorised capital is 26,000/.        It was originally intended to
 use some mechanical means of transport, but this idea was given up.
 The toll is a halfpenny, and the persons using it are said to number
 1,000,000 per annum, or an average of about 3000 per day : a very fair
piece of evidence, in favour of the needs of increased communication.
 In the year 1877, a steam ferry for vehicular purposes was established,
just over the Thames Tunnel, and was opened on the 31st October of
that year. The rise and fall of tide were allowed for by counterbalanced
platforms, raised and lowered by means of chains, connected to hori-
zontal hydraulic presses. This ferry worked for a short time, but a
ship ran into the framework of the platform of the Surrey side, and
shattered  it, and for some time past the ferry has ceased to be used.
     With respect to projects    :   asuggestion that has been made on
more than one occasion     is  to construct    a duplex bridge. This   is   a
renewal of very old plan proposed as far back as the beginning of
              a
the century by Colonel Bentham and also by Mr. Dance, the architect,
whose bridge, however, was practically         double one. Each of these
                                               a
gentlemen intended his bridge as substitute for old London Bridge,
                                          a
and proposed to construct   it in this manner to allow seagoing vessels
to come up the river as far as Blackfriars.
    The diagrams on the walls are enlarged from the drawings in the
Eeport of Parliamentary Committee on this subject, which sat, off and
          a
on, for about five years, at the end of the last century, and at the
beginning of the present.       The intention was to have the bridge
double for    ashort distance, in one case, and for its whole length in
the other the distance between the two sections being sufficient to
          ;
accommodate      vessel, so that
                  a                  ifwere coming up stream
                                          it                      should

pass by   an opening    in the eastern  section of the bridge, the  road
traffic on that section being stopped, and then the traffic on the other

492                          Sir Frederick Bramwell                [Feb. 22,
section being stopped, the movable part of that section should bo
opened, and the ship should be allowed to come through.
    A Bill for a similar project was deposited in the present session
of Parliament by      a  private company.
     In  the Report of the Parliamentary Committee to which          I have
referred, is also to be found Telford's proposition for a one-arch
cast-iron bridge, to replace London bridge. A diagram of it is on the
wall.
    The Parliamentary Committee to whom this and other schemes
were referred took the advice of the scientific men of the day on the
subject ; among them was John Playfair, Professor of Mathematics at
Edinburgh College, who winds up his report of the 27th April,
1801, upon Telford's single-arch bridge, with words of modesty and
wisdom, which       I   think are well worthy of being repeated and of
being borne in mind :
       I
    " cannot, however, make an end of this report without observing
to the Committee that it is not from theoretical men that the most
valuable information in such a case as the present is to be expected.
When a mechanical combination becomes in a certain degree com-
plicated, it baffles the efforts of the geometer and refuses to submit
even to his most improved methods of investigation.            This holds
particularly of bridges, where the principles of mechanics, aided by
all the resources of the higher geometry, have not yet gone farther
than to determine the equilibrium of a set of smooth wedges, acting on
one another by pressure only, and in such circumstances as, except
in a philosophical experiment, can hardly ever be realised.            It is
therefore from men bred in the school of daily practice and ex-
perience, and who, to a knowledge of general principles, have added,
from the habits of their profession, a certain feeling of the justness or
insufficiency of any mechanical contrivance, that the soundest opinion
on a matter of this kind is to be obtained."
     Time will not admit, nor do         I think you would be interested,
were    I  to call your attention in the most cursory manner (even by a
list of names) to all the various schemes that have, from the days of
the Thames Tunnel up to this date, been proposed for below-bridge
crossings, but    I will at once mention some of the latest. These are —
the High Level Bridge, proposed by the Metropolitan               Board of
Works, to span the river from Little Tower Hill (the road imme-
diately to the east of the Tower) to Horselydown Old Stairs ; the
Low Level Bridge at the same spot, with opening spans for the
passage of vessels, advocated by the Corporation ; and the Bill of
last year promoted by a private Company, for the making of a subway
parallel with the small subway             I  have already mentioned as
extending from Great Tower Hill, on the west side of the Tower.
     The question forces itself upon one — If, as appears self-evident,
some means of communication below bridge is needful, and has been
needful for the last fifty years, why has it not been made before this ?
The answer is, the difficulties of suitable access, the difficulties of the

1884.]   on   London (below bridge) North and South Communication.         493
work, and above all, as regards certain modes of crossing, the magnitude
of the interests affected, or alleged to be affected.        With respect to
the difficulty of access.    The map shows that on the northern side of
the river, first a portion of the bank is occupied by the Tower, to the
east of which is Little Tower Hill, already mentioned (the point
from which so many projectors have proposed to start their bridge or
tunnel), then the bank is occupied by the St. Katherine's Docks, and
these are separated by nothing but a roadway (Nightingale              Lane)
from the London Docks, which extend down the river until Shadwell
is reached : that is to say, from the western side of the Tower down-
wards there are only two places where, for a length of about one
and three-quarter miles, there is not a barrier to the approach to the
river ; these two places are, Little Tower Hill and Nightingale Lane.
     After the eastern end of the London Docks is passed on the
north side, the south is found to be occupied by the Surrey Canal
Docks and the Commercial Docks down to Deptford, and moreover,
on the north the Limehouse Basin of the Eegent's Canal, which Basin
is in truth a collier dock, cuts off ready communication. These diffi-
culties of approach apply to bridges and to tunnels. With bridges the
difficulties are practically insuperable, as the approaches must needs
extend across the docks, cutting them in halves.           It is possible, no
doubt, to carry a tunnel under the docks, as has been done in the case
of the extension of the Thames Tunnel, to make a communication
with the East London Eailway, but the work is very expensive, and,
worst of all, the underground distance is most materially increased.
     With respect to bridges, another class of difficulties, not connected
with want of access, arises.     If  a fixed bridge having only such an
elevation above the water as that of London Bridge be adopted, i. e.
if a non-opening low-level bridge be resorted to, then obviously this
bridge becomes the head of the masted shipping navigation, as London
Bridge is at the present time, and its erection would result either in
a diminution of the space available in the Port of London, or else, in
the gradual extension of its business lower down the river.           If this,
the more probable result, took place, then obviously it must give
rise in time to the repetition of the present difficulty, viz. the existence
on the banks of two large towns, to the east of the bridge forming the
head of the port, without any means of communication from side to
side of the river, which separates them.     Moreover, the sum demanded
as compensation     for  existing interests, between the new bridge and
London Bridge, would be something that as regards its total would
have to be stated in millions, and as regards its increments, for every
few extra yards of distance between the two bridges, by thousands.
On the ground of first cost, therefore, the temptation would be great
to place the new bridge as near to London Bridge as possible,
notwithstanding that other considerations would urge that it should
be at a reasonable distance below it.     If  it be suggested, as it has been
over and over again, that these difficulties could be met by making
certain spans of the bridge to open, the answer           is, that ina   tidal

494                     Sir Frederick Bramwell                [Feb. 22,
river ? there would be great danger of vessels which intended to pass
through, drifting against a closed bridge unless some provision were
made to have their approach announced by telegraph, as no doubt
might be done, and at the same time the bridge were opened in
anticipation, so as to ensure a clear passage for the vessel when she
did arrive.    No argument founded on the ease with which vessels
can be got in and out of docks (generally at high water and always
in the absence of appreciable current in the passage through which
they pass) would be valid, as applied to bridge openings in a
tideway.      Moreover, experience teaches, that the Parliamentary
opposition of the persons interested in the traffic above the suggested
low-level opening bridge, would be as strenuous, or even more
strenuous, than in the case of a non-opening low-level bridge,
as in the latter instance these persons          would know, that if
the bridge were built, they must be fully compensated for that
which would be undoubted damage, while they would feel that
if an opening bridge were to be made, an arbitrator might believe
these openings would suffice, might think their apprehensions idle,
and might either refuse them compensation altogether, or give them
one of but very small extent.         That a Parliamentary Committee
would be strongly influenced by such opposition, is no mere specu-
lation.    In the year 1879, when the Metropolitan Board of Works
 bridge, to which  I   have already alluded, was considered by such
a committee, the persons occupying wharves above its site, objected
that if vessels were compelled to strike their topmasts, or even
their topgallant masts, to pass under the roadway of that bridge,
which it was intended to place so as to give a clear headway of
 65 feet above Trinity high water, or as much as 85 feet above low
water, it would form a ground of objection on the part of shipowners
and captains to take freights for the wharves above the bridge, and
thus their competitors below the bridge would be placed in an unfairly
 favourable position ; and although it was shown, that the great bulk
of the shipping which came above the site of the intended bridge,
could pass, without striking anything more than their topgallant
masts, or without      striking masts at all, the opposition of the
 wharfingers prevailed, and the bill was thrown out. A diagram of
 the bridge is on the wall, and a model of the bridge and of the neigh-
bouring districts, with an enlarged model of the circular approach,
300 feet in diameter, and having a spiral road with an inclination of
 1 in 40, is on the table before you.
     From a wharfinger's point of view, it appears to me that a duplex
bridge, such as proposed in 1801, would not remove the difficulty,
but on the contrary, would add to    it, as there would be two bridges
to pass instead of one, doubling the dangers attendant upon the
passage of one bridge.
     But the other question remains to be considered supposing the
                                                       :
wharfingers satisfied, would the public who had to use the bridge be
satisfied?    Wouldit   be tolerated that the traffic across  a   single

  1884.]  on London (below bridge) North and South Communication.     495
  bridge, should be interrupted at unknown times, to admit of the
  passage of vessels ? and if the duplex bridge were resorted to, matters
  would be but little improved. It is of the very essence of the success
 of a means of important communication, that there should be perfect
 certainty of passing at all times.
      Two other modes of crossing from side to side deserve notice, as
 instances of ingenious contrivance : one, the dredging of a channel
 across the river, the bed of which channel is to be perfectly hori-
 zontal, and is to support several lines of rails.      On these rails a
 subaqueous carriage is to be placed, having a framework tall enough
 to carry a platform at the height of the level of the shore.    A steam
 engine on the platform, by appropriate connection makes the wheels
 revolve, and thus the carriage travels from side to side of the river ;
 such a contrivance is in use at St. Malo, and a drawing of one is
 upon the wall.     It need hardly be said, however, that, having regard
 to the danger to the rails from ships' anchors, and from the chances
 of vessels grounding on them, this cannot be looked upon as a feasible
 plan to be employed in the Thames. The next scheme is the
 converse of the St. Malo plan, viz. a platform at the shore level
 suspended by a framing from an overhead girder placed at such
 height as to be clear of the tallest masts.    It will be seen that both
 these plans result in a platform moving like the deck of a steamer
across the river, but, unlike the deck of a steamer, not affected by
 changes in the water-level.
      We now come to the question, What plans are really open for
consideration, bearing in mind that the object to be attained is the
maximum of accommodation, coupled with the minimum of interference
 with other interests, and (most closely allied to this second con-
sideration) the minimum of cost ? In arriving at the cost, there has
to be borne in mind, the acquisition of property, the expenses of
the work, and the annual charges for maintenance or for working, as
the case may be.      In my view the possible plans resolve themselves
into three : high-level bridge — a tunnel — ferries.
     Leaving ferries on one side for the moment, as being rather very
valuable supplementary means, than principal means, the choice really
lies between a high-level bridge and a tunnel.
     I  have stated the objections that were successfully urged by
wharfingers and shipowners, against the Metropolitan Board high-
level bridge proposed in 1879.       It is clear that nothing short of
raising the bridge so high that no masts, not even the topgallant
masts, need be struck, would put an end to the opposition. The ques-
tion may be asked, Why not make the bridge of this height ? and this
brings into consideration the difficulties of the work.   I do not mean
to say that, in the present state of engineering knowledge, a bridge at
a level high enough for the Monument to stand under, could not be
built with the most absolute certainty as regards safety, and success
as a structure, if money enough were spent upon it. Let me instance
the magnificent work of the Forth Bridge, with its 1700 feet spans

 and its clear headway of 150 feet above high water.        Thanks to the
 kindness of Messrs. Fowler and Baker, the engineers,          am enabled    I
 to show you a diagram of the bridge, and to give a clear conception
 of the vast dimensions of this work, there are drawn on the same
 sheet the Menai, the St. Louis, and some other well-known large -
 span bridges.    So far as the efficiency of the structure is concerned,
 it is a simple question of money, but a bridge high up in the air,
 although it may satisfy those who pass under, will be of no use to
 those who wish to pass over, if it cannot be readily reached from the
 ground level. Although on the north the ground at Tower Hill rises
 some 31 feet above high water, the shore on the south is practically
on a level with         it,
                       and thus on that side the whole height from high
water to the level of the bridge would have to be climbed.
      Formerly, no mode would have been open, to get the traffic on and
off such  a  bridge, other than inclined roads.    These, for heavy traffic
ascending, could not have been made successfully at        greater inclina-
                                                                        a

joins the road leading on to Blackfriars Bridge,             made with  is                    a

bridge could not be less, to avoid all fancied interference with
shipping, than 150 feet above Trinity high water an inclination of ;
even  1   in 30 would demand therefore        length of 4500 feet for the

                                  1

lifts answer both for the ascent and the descent), and the cost of the
establishment of these lifts, render the abandoning of inclines, for
certain portions of the traffic, very undesirable.

as 745, 0002., while the annual charges would probably be 18,000Z.
If   no other mode       were available, then the importance of the
matter    is so great that, large as these payments are, they would be
more than justified, and the money would be well laid out               but,             ;

                    a
difficulties met with in the execution of the Thames Tunnel, brought
subaqueous tunnelling into disfavour       but there are more ways than

 one of making a tunnel, or rather of making a covered way, be it
 under the land or under the water. Moreover, engineering appliances
 have become developed,      I  need hardly say, in the sixty years since
 the Thames Tunnel was commenced, and better materials exist at
 cheap rates.    Brunei had a shield made of cast iron; then steel
 would have been an impossible metal for the purpose — it was sold
 not by the ton, but by the pound ; in these days the shield would be
 made of steel, at no greater cost than was then needed for one in
 cast iron. Screwjacks, demanding a great expenditure of manual power
 to be exerted in a confined space, would now be replaced by hydraulic
 presses worked by a steam-engine on the surface ; and the pumping of
 the water which made its way in at the shield, instead of demanding
 the labour of forty men, costing for the day and night work 150Z. a
 week, could be effected with ease by an hydraulic engine, by a com-
 pressed-air engine, or even by electricity, which latter agent would
 also afford the means of illumination without heat or contamination of
 the air.
      These would be the means by which (even if the covered way were
 truly a tunnel — that is to say, a "burrowing through the earth ") such a
 work could be carried out with a cheapness, an expedition, and a cer-
 tainty that were not possible sixty years ago. But, improved as the
means of tunnelling are, it is still desirable, that there should be some
 considerable thickness of earth, between the bed of the river, and the
 top of the hole, that is being tunnelled.      Therefore, if the process of
 tunnelling be followed, it is seen there would have to be allowed first,
the depth of the river, next the minimum thickness of earth over the
excavation, and then the depth, from the top of the excavation to the
surface of the roadway.        If  the minimum thickness were employed,
that ought to be allowed, the result would be, with the height of
roadway it is proposed to give in the tunnel         I  am about to mention
to you, to put its floor 80 feet below Trinity high water.
      Now we have considered the question that we must have an ascent
to reach from the ground to the roadway of a high-level bridge, it is
equally clear we must have a descent to extend from the surface of
the ground down to the roadway of a tunnel ; and if that roadway
were 150 feet below the surface of the ground, the difficulties of the
descent would obviously be as great as the difficulties of the ascent.
But as has already been said, even if tunnelling be resorted to, the
depth of the roadway below high water need be no more than 80 feet ;
but by following a process in making this subaqueous road which is
pursued in corresponding cases on land, the depth can be so much
reduced, as to be only 60 feet.       I mean the process technically known
as
    " cut and cover." The name expresses quite clearly what is done,
and tells us that the excavation is cut down from the surface, and
that then (the brickwork and covering arch being put in), earth is
filled over the top, and the surface is restored.      This plan is one that
can be perfectly well followed for a subaqueous road, and can be
carried out in the following manner : — A cofferdam of a certain

498                       Sir Frederick Bramivell               [Feb. 22,
length is raised to a few feet above high water, the water is pumped
out, the bed of the river is exposed, the earth is excavated down to the
required depth, and the concrete put in, and the brickwork of the tunnel
including its covering arch is completed.     The cofferdam is then pro-
longed for another length, which is similarly treated, leaving, it
will be seen, the front end of the original cofferdam as a mere
partition in the middle of a longer cofferdam pumped dry on both
sides of this partition.      Under these circumstances it is easy to
make the partition tight against the executed work.       Then the upper
part of the sides, and the hinder end of the first length of dam, can be
removed, and with the requisite new parts, be formed into another
length, in front of the portion being executed, and thus step by step the
work can be carried across the river with absolute certainty.         The
remark may be made, supposing bad ground is met with, why won't
the whole structure sink ?     Bad ground means in this case quicksand
full of water, and under this condition of things there would be no pres-
sure, forcing the tunnel to sink, greater than that which the bad ground
had already borne ; for, as seen in the case of the Thames Tunnel, after
allowing for the openings, the tunnel as a whole is lighter than the
earth, which it replaces. With respect to the nature of the cofferdam,
it may be urged by those acquainted with these subjects, that the
depth is too great for piling, but piling is not the only mode of making
a cofferdam.
    Sir Joseph Bazalgette, for that portion of the Victoria Embank-
ment between Westminster and some one hundred yards to the east
of Waterloo Bridge, employed a succession of oval iron caissons,
which were sunk in a continuous line and were united by grooves
and tongues. These caissons have the advantage of being sinkable,
to any needed depth, by internal excavation, and of forming by their
lower parts an admirable protection to the completed work, while
the upper parts are readily unbolted by the aid of a diver, and are
used over and over again, in the successive stages of the cofferdam.
     There is another mode, however, by which, without any cofferdam
ordinarily so called, cut-and-cover work can be executed, and that
is by employing an enormous diving-bell, and using compressed air.
Some years ago Mr. Fowler and Mr. Baker proposed an application
of this system for the Humber Tunnel. A sketch of the apparatus
is shown upon this diagram.
     An open bottom vessel some 160 feet long, by 42 feet wide, by
 12 feet deep, immediately below, and made in one with an air-tight
vessel of exactly equal size, forming a float.    On the top of this last-
named vessel there was a framework 45 feet high, carrying a working
deck 160 feet long by 55 feet wide, on which was to be placed the
whole of the machinery.      The framework supported a certain number
of screw piles on each side.     The apparatus was to be used in the
following manner :— It was to be towed over the place where the
tunnel was to be made, and then, the machinery being set to work, the
screw piles were to be driven into the earth on each side of the vessel ;

1884.]   on   London (below bridge) North and South Communication.       499
water was then to be admitted into the float so that the vessel would
gradually sink, until the edges of its open bottom cut their way into
the soil ; then air was to be driven into the open vessel, expelling the
water, and enabling the workmen to descend through shafts provided
with air locks, and to carry on the work of excavation within this
chamber of 1G0 feet long, 42 feet wide, and 12 feet deep. As the
excavation was continued, the vessel sank lower and lower, until the
desired depth was attained, the sinking being guided by the screw piles.
At this, the lowest point, the working stage was still sufficiently raised
above high water.        When the lowest point was reached, the work of
building the tunnel proper was begun, and was carried on till the
lower half was finished, thereby nearly filling the chamber to the
top.     Then the water was pumped out of the float, allowing the
whole apparatus to rise to a certain distance, admitting the water to
flow over the lower part of the finished work, but permitting this to
be added to ; and in this way it is possible to build a tunnel of some
23 feet total depth by the aid of an air chamber of but little more
than half that depth.        The 160 feet length having been finished, the
float was entirely emptied of water so as to come up to the surface,
the screw piles were withdrawn, and the apparatus was moved forward
to make the next length of the tunnel.            There was an extremely
ingenious provision by which the junctions of the successive lengths
were effected, but time will not admit of my going into that detail.
     Last year Mr. Law, whom we have already had to thank this
evening for the diagram of the Tunnel, exhibited to a Parliamentary
Committee the model which he has kindly lent me to-night, showing
how " cut-and-cover
                         "
                            could be executed by a compressed-air appa-
ratus.    This model represents the manner in which it is intended to
 construct, under the Thames, the tunnel of the Charing Cross and
Whitehall Electric Eailway, and here also for the purpose of saving
                           "
depth " cut-and-cover        is resorted to.  The tunnel has its sides and
roof made of wrought iron, lined with concrete. On a staging prepared
in the river, a 50-feet length of the tunnel is riveted up and lined,
 and then from this staging, it is lowered on to the bed of the river
by hydraulic apparatus ; the ends of the length are first temporarily
 closed, but the bottom is left open, and thus the length becomes a
diving-bell ; air is pumped into    it,  and air shafts and air locks being
provided,     men   descend    and  carry out the excavation.      As this
done the length sinks further and further, until the desired depth          is is
reached  ;   recesses in the ends of the length contain flexible tubes,
into which    a   water pressure can be put, so as to expand the tubes,
 and thus make     a   provisional joint against the length already com-
 pleted.    The   temporary closing of the end    is  then removed, and the
permanent attachment of the one length to the other            made.
                                                              is
     In any one of these ways the tunnel may be made, but when made,
 people have      a   sort of feeling that after all       tunnel  is  an ill-
 lighted,  ill- ventilated,  damp, unpleasant   sort  ofa a
                                                            place.   There  is
 not the slightest reason why this should be     ;   and
                                                       I   will undertake to

  500                         Sir Frederick Bramwell                 [Feb. 22,
  say it would not be.      Having regard to the avoidance of interference
  with existing interests, to the cost, and to the diminished length of
  the approaches, it does appear that the tunnel is preferable to a
  high-level bridge.      I told you a little time back .that     I would for
  the moment dismiss the question of ferries, and        I ought then to have
  given a few particulars connected with the traffic, to show that some-
  thing more was needed for the principal means of communication.
  Let me supply that omission now.          In the year 1882 careful obser-
  vations were taken, and it was found on a Monday in the month
 of August, that in twenty-four hours there passed over London
  Bridge 22,795 vehicles and 117,451 foot passengers. It need hardly
 be said that these did not traverse the bridge at a uniform rate,
 throughout the twenty-four hours.           The table on the wall* shows
 the allocation of the traffic to the various hours, giving a minimum
 of 7 vehicles and of 130 foot passengers per hour between two and
 four in the morning, and a maximum of 1846 vehicles per hour
 between the hours of 10 a.m. and noon, and a maximum of 13,037 foot
 passengers between the hours of 8 a.m. and 9 a.m., while the average
 per hour between the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. is as much as 1578
 vehicles and 7644 foot passengers.        Assuming that the new mode of
 communication were only to get a fraction of this traffic, and that
 the total traffic was not increased, even then it would not be well to
 attempt to pass it by ferry boats traversing a crowded river, but
 there can be no question that the existence of a new communication
 will largely develop traffic. Notwithstanding these 22,795 vehicles
 over London Bridge, 3554 were found to pass over South wark, only
 500 yards above London Bridge, and with its very bad gradient on
the Middlesex side, while 13,288 were found to pass over Blackfriars,
only 1288 yards above London Bridge. Moreover, the freeing of the
 toll bridges may be cited in support of this development of traffic by
 increased accommodation.        Before the toll was removed, there passed
over Waterloo, Charing Cross, Lambeth, Yauxhall, Chelsea, the
Albert, Battersea, and Putney Bridges, during 24 hours, 46,960 foot
passengers and 8077 vehicles.         Four to five years after the toll was
removed, there passed over the former toll bridges         I have enumerated
 114,760 foot passengers per day, and 22,621 vehicles, being practically
two and a half times the number of foot passengers, and two and
three-quarter times the number of vehicles. Part of this increase
was no doubt due to the natural growth of London in the five
years, but that part must have been but a very small proportion of
the whole.
     With respect, however, to this increase in the population, the
table f on the wall shows you (to go back for fifty years) that in 1831
there were within that which is now the Metropolitan area a total
population of 1,655,200, divided into — north-west of London Bridge,

890,000, the south-east was 655,000, making for the eastern towns a

Metropolitan     area  had  been   2*31 times; west of London Bridge it
had been only 2'14 times, while east of London Bridge it had
been as much as 2*62 times; and in those fifty years new Black-
friars Bridge and new Westminster Bridge had been built at the
public expense ; Chelsea Bridge had been built at the public expense ;
Hungerford, Lambeth, the Albert Bridge, and Wandsworth Bridge
had been built by companies, but had been subsequently acquired by
public money ; while the condition of communication, or rather of
want of communication, to the east of London Bridge had remained
as it was.    Moreover, the rateable value is shown by another table *
to have been in 1881 for the whole of London in which the above-
mentioned population lived, the sum of 27,970,552/.,             divided as
before into north-west 15,819,758/., south-west 3,665,229/., making a
total for the west of 19,484,987/. ; north-east 5,224,924/., south-east
 3,260,641/., making a total for the eastern district of 8,485,565/.

the east and to the west, the western section has had provided for         it,

 1,332,025/., to which has to be added the cost of new Putney, new
 Battersca, and new Hammersmith bridges, the underpinning of
 Waterloo, and the repairs to other bridges, 848,304/.      :making   a total
 that has been paid or will have to be paid for the bridge accommo-
 dation west of London Bridge of 4,014,829/., or, taking the population
 of that district, of 11. 15s. per head.   While the only money, so far as
I   know, which has been contributed by the public purse to afford
 means of communication below bridge has been the sum for the com-
 pletion of the Thames Tunnel — believe, but am not certain, about

Stairs and St. Saviour's Dock on the south side.
     The access on the north side will be from East Smithfield by
a widening         of Nightingale Lane, situated as          I have already said
between      the     St. Katherine and the London Docks.                  On the
large map       is shown     the  position   of  the approaches.   At  this point
there is excellent communication to Tower Hill and the Minories
northward ; and by Trinity Square, and the New Street above the
District railway, westward ; Dock Street aDd Leman Street afford
access to the Commercial Road and Mile End Road ; while Ratcliff
Highway, leads down to Shadwell and Limehouse. The ascent from
the tunnel will be made by an open cutting in the middle of New
Nightingale Lane, and on each side of this there will be roads at the
present level of the surface, affording access to the St. Katherine
Docks on the west, to the London Docks on the east, and on the
south to the widened street of Wapping.                     On the Surrey side
the ascent will be forked, terminating westerly in New Tooley Street,
and easterly in Jamaica Road, affording excellent communication with
Bermondsey, Rotherhithe, and Deptford.                 It is proposed to have a
single archway 36 feet wide, having two 4-feet footpaths, for carters
to lead their horses, and a clear roadway therefore of 28 feet, with a
headway of 17 feet in the centre.               Parallel with this and forming
part   of  the    work,   there   will  be a  passage for the foot traffic, kept
separate from the roadway.             This  will  be 14 feet high, and 12 feet
wide.     The roadways will descend to the deepest part of the tunnel
by an inclination of 1 in 26 on the Surrey side, and 1 in 25 on the
Middlesex side ; but near to each shore a lateral roadway will be
provided which will have a rise of only 1 in 40, and this roadway
will lead to a group of hydraulic lifts, by which the whole of the
heavy traffic will be raised, these lateral roadways being on the
              "        "
respective near sides.             By this arrangement, while all the traffic
will go     down      the   inclines,   and the light traffic — such as cabs,
carriages, tax-carts, and matters of that kind — will go up the inclines
(the steepest of which is at a much less pitch than parts of Ludgate
Hill, or, as has already been stated, parts of St. James's Street),
the heavy waggons will avoid these inclines, drawing off to the lifts,
and w rill be taken to the surface without any exertion or hindrance,
thus rendering the passage through the tunnel far easier for such
traffic than that over London Bridge ; as to pass this bridge a
waggon, however heavily laden, coming from Tooley Street, has to
make an ascent of as much as 33 feet, while it would traverse
the tunnel and find itself upon the high ground of East Smithfield
without having had to do any climbing whatever.
    Provision of lifts will be made at once, for taking up all the heavy
traffic, assuming it to be one-half of that which now passes over
London Bridge at the busiest hour of the day.               The approach to the

 1884.]   on  London (below bridge) North and South Communication.         503
 tunnel on both sides being open, as already said, to the sky, the covered
part will not be more than 1200 feet long ; a person walking three miles
an hour will pass through this in less than five minutes ; but having
regard to the fact that it will be lined with white tiles, will be lighted
by incandescent lamps, will be kept thoroughly clean, and will be
well ventilated, no one need hurry with the desire of getting out of
an unpleasant place.        The roadway of 28 feet wide is sufficient for
four vehicles abreast, and thus quick and slow traffic can both be
accommodated.       It is estimated that the total cost of this work
including acquisition of property, embracing that taken from the
Docks, will not exceed the sum of 1,800,000Z.        The estimate being one
put forward by the Engineer of the Metropolitan Board, is entitled
to the confidence of the public, as that Board can point to a large
number of works executed within the estimated amounts.
     I had put on one side for a time, the question of ferries.         I will
now say a few words upon them.           It is proposed to at once establish
two : one on the site of the old horse ferry, from the Isle of Dogs to
Greenwich, the other from Woolwich to North Woolwich.
   These ferry services will be conducted by steamboats probably pro-
pelled by paddles, and having deck accommodation for carriages and
horses, and cabin accommodation for foot passengers.         I have said pro-
bably propelled, because there is always the alternative of the floating
bridge arrangement, where chains are laid in the bed of the river, and
being hauled in over properly shaped wheels, the bridge is drawn along
as is practised at Portsmouth, Southampton, and many other places.
With respect to the difficulty occasioned by the variation in the height
of the water, this may be met in a variety of ways.
     If  a floating bridge be used, its rising and falling gang-board
effects a connection at all times of the tide with a sloping " hard."       If
steamboats be employed, then there are the following modes avail-
able  : —
     1.  By the vessel coming alongside a float connected to the shore
by hinged bridges, as at all our steamboat piers.
     2. By the float being raised vertically by hydraulic power to the
required level.
     3. By the deck of the vessel being lifted the whole height, as is
done in Stephenson's floating bridges on the Nile.
     4. With a view to the diminishing of the angle made by the hinged
bridge at extreme low water, a combination of No. 1 with No. 3. By
any of these modes thoroughly satisfactory results can be obtained.
     In conclusion,   I  trust  I  have caused the audience present here
to-night   to wonder  how   it is that the two towns A and B have been so
long cut off the one from the other by a stream which never attains
to a quarter of a mile wide, to agree with me that this is a state of
things which should no longer be suffered to continue, and also to,
agree with me that in common honesty we, at the West End of
London, are bound to do our best to ensure that those at the East
shall obtain the much-needed accommodation.
