representatives of the          British     Government        at the International
 North   Sea Conference on Northern               Fisheries.
    We have had, at the request of the Council, three Addresses,                       of
which the first was given by Admiral Mnkaroff on the construction
of   a ship, said      to be the      strongest      in the world, made          for the
 Russian Government for the purpose                  of breaking up the ice which
 for several      months of the year blocks the Russian ports, and he
insisted on the desirableness           of ascertaining the temperatures             and
 currents of the ocean.
    Mr Andrews, of           the    British      Museum, delivered          the   second
 special Address, in which         he described        tho Geological Structure of
 Christmas      Island, with its rich deposits of phosphate               of lime, and
 several new genera and species of animals which ho found there.
    Professor     Knott     gave   the third      Address, which was on Earth
 quake Vibrations, their Propagation                through tho Earth, and their
 bearing on the Earth's internal stuto.
    Dr Muir      and  Lord M'Laron         have    given Papers developing that
 branch of Mathematics known               as  Determinants, and Professor Tail

    George James Au.man                was     born at Cork in 1812,           and   was
educated       at   the   Belfast    Academical         Institution,     lie   took   his

degree of   M.D. in the University of Dublin, and           also   in the Uni
versity of Oxford in 1847.         During the year of his graduation he
was appointed      Kegius   Professor    of Botany in Dublin University,
and ten years later ho resigned the Dublin chair for that of Regius
Professor   of   Natural History in the University of Edinburgh,
with which     was incorporated the Keepership of the        Natural History
Museum.       He resigned his Chair in        1870.    Allman's first Paper
was    a botanical   one,
                           " On the Mathematic        Relations     of Cells of
Plants."     He wrote on the Crinoids,          but his greater reputation
rests upon his investigations into the Classification and Morphology
of the Coelenterata and Polyzoa.           His magnum ojrus was on the
" Gymnoblastic or Tubularian Hydroids." This monograph ranks
among the most perfect and philosophic of all modern zoological
treatises.    Ho   was   one   of the most prolific      of naturalists,     and
between the years 1835-1873,            and apart from his monographs,
produced more than 100 papers.             He was   elected a    Fellow of the
Royal Society in 1854, and in 1873 received the Society's Gold
Medal.     He was elected a Fellow of our Society in 1856, and in
1877    was   awarded the Brisbane        Gold Medal.       In    1878   he was
awarded the Cunningham Gold Medal of the Royal Irish Academy,
and in 1896 the Gold Medal of the Linnean Society, of which he
had been President.        He died    on 24th November       1898.
    Sir Jambs Bain was       a native of Glasgow, and was born            in the
year    1818.    He started ironworks        at  Whitehaven,        but always
retained    his  connection     with Glasgow.        He    was    elected   Lord
Provost of Glasgow in 1874.           Sir James interested himself much
and successfully in extending the dock accommodation of Glasgow.
 In  1891 he was returned       Member     of Parliament     for Whitehaven.
 In  1877 ho received     the honour of knighthood.         He took      a great
 interest in scientific matters, and was       a Fellow of     the   Royal Geo
 graphical    Society and    a  Fellow of the Scottish Society of Anti
 quaries.    He   was  elected   a Fellow of this Society in 1875, and
 died on 25th    April 1898.
    Dr Campbell Black           was  born in Oban about fifty-five          years
 ago, and loved the Highlands,        being at his death President of the
 Glasgow    Gaelic    Society,   and a member       of    many     other   Celtic
 bodies.     He held opinions        antagonistic   to   those    of  the great
 majority   of medical men, and lost no opportunity              of making     an

onslaught on what he called Listerism            and   on Koch's    discoveries.
One of his favourite sayings           was that   "Medicine     is no more     an
exact science than millinery."           For  some years     he was    Professor
of Clinical Medicine in Anderson's College, Clasgow, hut owing                 to
his  scorn    for   theories     which  were   held   by his colleagues      and
medical scientists,       he   was   not reappointed in       1897.     He was
elected   a  Fellow of this Society in         189G, and died on the        20th
December 1898.
   Emeritus     Professor     Blaikie   was the son of James         Blaikie   of
Craigiebuckler, Aberdeenshire, advocate, and was born at Aberdeen
in  1820.     His father      was Provost    of Aberdeen, and inaugurated
the scheme for rebuilding Marischal College.                The lute Professor
was educated at the Aberdeen Grammar School and in Marischal
College.     He   was one of the famous Melvin's most brilliant           pupils.
In his twenty-third       year he was ordained minister of the Parish of
Drumblade, but in 1844 he undertook the founding of                 a new   Free
          '          '
Church      charge     at  Pilrig, of which   ho was the successful       pastor
for twenty-four     years.      In 1864 the University     of Edinburgh con
ferred on him the degree of D.D., and in 1872 Aberdeen honoured
him with the degree of         LL.l).   In   1868   he was appointed to the
Chair of Apologetics and Pastoral Theology in               the New     College,
 Edinburgh,    a position which he held for twenty years.              He is the
author of numerous works on theological and philanthropic subjects,
among others of Heads and Hands in the World of Labour, and
Better Days for the Working Glasses, of which nearly 100,000
copies   were    sold.     From similarity     of name    he   was   frequently
mistaken for Professor Blackie, the Professor of Greek, and on one
occasion,    after  a speech     by the Greek Professor in praise of the
Drama, ho received         a  letter from an Irish female       correspondent,
saying that    as he had recommended         his divinity students to attend
the theatre she would henceforth leave             his  publications severely
alone.    He kept      up his scholarship to the end, and after his retire
ment from his chair spent           part of his leisure    in translating into
Latin  verse some of our modern         hymns.      He   was elected a Fellow
of this Society in 1862, and died on 11th June 1899.
   Mr David Chalmers of Redhall                 was tho son of      Mr Charles
Chalmers, the founder of Merchiston               Castle Academy, and was
born at Glasgow in 1820.           He  was proud of being        the nephew    of

the   great  Dr Chalmers.         lie attended his father's school, and
afterwards completed his education at Edinburgh University,                 lie
entered   into   partnership     with the Messrs Cowan, papermakers,
and subsequently took over the business.            He was   a  Fellow of the
Scottish    Society    of   Antiquaries,    antiquarian    research,   indeed,
occupying much of his leisure time.             He died   on 2nd May     1899.
He   was elected   a  Fellow of this Society in     1866.
   Robert Cox, M.P.,          was born at Gorgie       House in May 1845,
and was educated at Loretto            School, afterwards      at the College
Hall, St Andrews,        and the University of Edinburgh.             In 1892
Mr Cox stood       as   candidate for the Kirkcaldy         Burghs,   but was
unsuccessful.     In   1895 he stood as candidate for South        Edinburgh,
and gained the seat.          He  was a man of wide culture, had a con
siderable knowledge        of mechanics, and his love of music induced
him to present St Cuthbert's           Church with      a magnificent    organ.
He took    a deep  interest in the development         of the City of Edin
burgh    Observatory,      and presented it with a valuable          reflecting
telescope   of 13 inches aperture, equatorially mounted.           He married
the daughter of Dr Hughes Bennett, Professor of Medicine in the
University of Edinburgh.           He died on 2nd June        1899.    He was
elected a Fellow of this Society in 1879.
    Dr John Duncan          was   educated at the High School of Edin
 burgh, and thereafter graduated with distinction in the University
 of Edinburgh in 1862.         He   became a   Fellow of the Royal College
 of Surgeons in 1864, and eventually filled the presidential chair of
 that body.     He     was   in charge of wards in the Infirmary for
 twenty years.      He   gave courses of systematic lectures      in the extra
 mural school, and finally attracted one of the largest classes of
 surgery there.      He died    on 24th August     1899.    He   was elected   a
 Fellow of this Society in 1870.
    James Simpson Fleming.             Born   at  Forfar in   1828,   he began
 business as a solicitor in Glasgow.      In 1854    he accepted   the appoint
 ment of Law Officer of tlio Western         Bank, and subsequently, when
 only twenty-nine years of age, he was appointed manager pro tempore
 of the bank, which had to close its doors in 1857.             He was   one  of
 its four liquidators.       From    1853 to 1871 he was a partner in the
 legal firm in Glasgow         of M'Gregor,      Stevenson & Fleming,       and
 during nearly the whole of that period he was Secretary of the

Glasgow Chamber of Commerce.                  About the end of          1871   the
Directors of the Koyal Bank of Scotland invited him to                     become
their    Cashier    and General     Manager.       In 1892 he resigned this
office.     He died on 8th      July  1899.     He was     elected   a  Fellow of
this Society in      1876.
    Sir John Fowler         was the eldest son of the late         Mr Fowler of
Wadsley Hall, Sheffield.          His earliest important appointment was
on the Stockton and Hartlepool          Railway, of which       he was resident
engineer.       At the   age of twenty-seven he was selected          as engineer
for constructing the large group of railways known                  as the    Man
chester,     Sheffield   and Lincolnshire line, which         includes tunnels,
viaducts and bridges, in addition to a dock, floating pier, largo
 hydraulic works and steam ferry. Of these vast and multifarious
 works    he had the sole engineering          charge.    A   mere   catalogue of
 the works      executed by him from          this date would occupy more
 space    than    can   be  afforded   here.    The    Forth Bridge      was his
 preatest work, in the construction of which            he was assisted     by Sir
 Benjamin Baker.          He must have been gratified in his old age in
 seeing this and his other works, in full operation, ministering to
 the social and commercial needs of the country.
     In  1866 he was elected       President     of the Institution of Civil
  Engineers.      In 1885 he    was created a    K.C.M.G., and in        1890   he
  was promoted to a baronetcy.         In recognition of his      services  to the
 science of engineering, the University of Edinburgh conferred on
  him the     degree   of  LL.D. in     1890.     He died on the 20th of
  November      1898.   He  was elected   a  Fellow of this Society in 1887.
     Dr John Moir        was born in the French prison of Verdun,            for it
  was there that his father, a naval surgeon,           taken prisoner during
  the Napoleonic      wars, was joined by his mother, who remained in
  captivity   with her husband until such time              as an exchange of
  prisoners was effected.       He graduated       as  Doctor    of Medicine     in
  Edinburgh in 1828, and became Assistant              to Professor    Hamilton,
  predecessor    of Sir James Simpson, and conducted the class of mid
  wifery in the University between the death of Hamilton and the
  appointment of Sir James.         He was successively President of the
  Obstetrical Society, the Medico-Chirurgical          Society, and the Royal
  College of Physicians.         He died  at the age of ninety- two on 14th
  May 1899.        He  was elected a  Fellow of this Society in        1865.

    Professor     William Rutherford was born at Ancrum Craig,
Roxburghshire, on 20th April 1839.                He was educated at Jed
burgh Grammar School, and went through                  the medical course of
study     in   the    University of Edinburgh.          After   a   distinguished
career    as  a   student, he graduated with honours              in   1863,   and
obtained     a  gold medal for his thesis.         He taught Anatomy for a
year in Surgeons' Hall under Dr Struthers.               Thereafter he studied
at the great Medical Schools of Berlin, Leipzig, Vienna and Paris.
In 1865,      at the age of twenty-six,       he was appointed         University
Assistant to Professor       John Hughes Bennett.           In 1869, when     only
thirty years old,      he was  appointed Professor of Physiology in King's

that chair he was Fullerian Professor of Physiology in the Royal
Institution, London.          When Professor Bennett resigned the Chair
of Physiology        in the University of Edinburgh, Professor Ruther
ford was appointed his successor.            He will probably        be judged   in
the future by his ability as a teacher rather than by devotion to
original research,       though    his work    on striped      muscle attracted
attention both in this country and on the Continent.                   His know
 ledge   of all branches of physiology        was encyclopaedic.         His prin
 cipal work was entitled AHions of Drugs on the Secretion of Bile.
 He was also the author of Oidlines of Practical Histology and a
 Text-book of Physiology.          He died    on   21st February       1899.    He
 was elected     a  Fellow of this Society in     1869.
    Sir  John Struthers         was born in 1823 at Brucefield,         near Dun
 fermline.      He attended the medical          course   in the University of
 Edinburgh, and graduated there in 1845.                 He   was Demonstrator
 of Anatomy        in the University, and was subsequently appointed
 Lecturer     on    Anatomy     in the Extra-mural       School.      In  1863   he
 became Professor of Anatomy           in the University of Aberdeen.           In
 that capacity he succeeded in increasing the anatomy accommoda
 tion  ; he  had new dissecting-rooms built, he secured           a  new building
 for an anatomical museum.             He prepared and collected museum
 specimens,     dissections, casts,   models, and animal skeletons.          In his
 more advanced course of Osteology he expanded his human into
 comparative anatomy.           In  1889 a  failing voice and general weak
 ness induced him to        give up his professorship.        He then returned
 to Edinburgh,        and took a prominent part in the management of the

Anatomy are numerous. In 1885 Glasgow University conferred
on him the degree of LL.D., and in 1898 the Queen conferred on
him a knighthood.        He died on 24th February 1899.         He was

On       Swan's      Prism       Photometer,         commonly        called

                          (Read December  19, 1899.)
    In  1849   William Swan, subsequently Professor of Natural       Philo
sophy in the University of          St Andrews,      read  a paper  on the
" Gradual Production        of Luminous    Impressions on the Eye and
other Phenomena of Vision       " before the Royal Society of Edinburgh
(see Transactions, Vol. XVI.).        This paper contains some results
of high interest, but     I have no recollection of ever having seen       it
referred to in modern literature on the subject.
    On April 4, 1859, Professor Swan gave a second paper on the
same subject,      much briefer than the first, and entirely       occupied
with descriptions of greatly improved forms of apparatus (see
Transactions, Vol. XXI.).          Among the forms of apparatus de-

form of photometer described in 1889,          exactly thirty years later,
by Lummer        and Brodhun,     and named     after them in all recent
literature (see Zeitschrift fur Inst rumentenkuwle, Bd. 9). I cannot
do better than give Swan's own description in full, and reproduce
his own diagram.

together two                 equal         and similar rectangular glass               prisms ABC,
BCD,       so as to form               a    parallelopiped, by means of            a   small portion
of Canada Balsam, which, when the prisms are pressed together,
expands into                a     circular thin film E.            The illuminated            apertures
C, D', in         the screens are placed opposite                   to the faces       AC, CD, and
the observer looks through the face                              BF.         The light transmitted
through AC, and falling on BC, will                           be   totally reflected, except the
portion which falls on the film of Canada Balsam at                                    E,   which will
be    nearly all transmitted to the eye of the observer.                                     The light
which       is   transmitted through the face CD will be totally reflected
to the eye by the face BC, except what falls on the Canada Balsam
at    E,   which will be nearly all transmitted.                          The spot     E    will   appear
of    a   different brightness from the rest of the surface, BC, except
when the light totally reflected                         by BC     is   equal   in intensity to the
sum of the lights transmitted and reflected at E.                                  The spot        E    will
then disappear,                   owing to the whole surface of BC, including                           the
spot, becoming uniformly bright.                           Assuming that the light partially
reflected        at   E     has    a   constant ratio to that totally reflected                    by the
rest of the surface BC, and to that transmitted by AC,                                  it   is    obvious
that the squares of the distances                           of the flame from the aperture
JJ'    when the spot               E   disappears    will    give the ratio of the intensities
of the lights transmitted by                      the aperture          C."
      Swan's intention was to publish the results                                obtained with his
improved apparatus                     ;   but we can find no record of the continuation
of the work.                  Probably he obtained nothing that materially added
to or in any way affected                       the accuracy        of his earlier results          ;   and
it was not his habit                   to write for mere writing's sake.
      But whatever                 may have been the real reason for his subsequent
silence, there              is    not the least doubt that Swan invented, described,
constructed, and used, thirty years before the scientific world was
ready for             it,   the prism photometer which                    Lummer and Brodhun
 had to re-invent.                     One of the photometers                 constructed by Swan
 himself         is   now among the apparatus of the Physical Laboratory of
 Edinburgh University,                        having been purchased              by Professor Tait
 some years ago along with the best part of Professor Swan's private
 collection.            This photometer             is   in regular use in the Laboratory.

    In the same collection were also two other small prisms intended
for the   same purpose but not made up.             The lid of the small box
containing them still bears the inscription          in Professor Swan's own
handwriting: — "Pair of fine plate-glass prisms                made    for me by
Cooke (1870) for my prism photometer."                This inscription, written
fully ten years after the first published description, shows that
•Swan   was in the habit of using his photometer.
    The fact that Swan had forestalled             Lummer      and Brodhun         in
the invention and construction of an ingenious form of photometer
has,   of  course,   been   familiar   to  all officially connected with the
Edinburgh University Physical Laboratory                  for some years past.
 Recently,    having occasion     to inquire     somewhat       closely into the
 history of photometric methods,         I determined to make a systematic
search    through    Swan's published       papers,   which for the most part
 treat of    optical subjects.      I  had not far to search ; for on the
 plate illustrating    the second     paper named above        I  recognised at a
 glance the prism photometer, and immediately thereafter discovered
 the descriptive     paragraph.      My expectation at most           was   to  find
 some    incidental   reference to the instrument.            To my surprise        I
 found as complete      a description of the essential instrument as any
 one could desire      to find.    It will  remain always a matter of no
 small astonishment that such an important              contribution     to  know
 ledge should have escaped          the notice of      the myriad      workers     in
 photometry.       In Swan's day there was not the           same great interest
 taken in the subject     ;  but that is no excuse for present neglect.
     Swan's    photometer     was given to a world not              ready for its
 reception.     Let us now who know its value not forget that it is
 "Swan's" photometer.

On the Thermo-electric Properties of Solid and Liquid
    Mercury. By Dr "W. Peddie and A. B. Shand, Esq.
                             (Read January 8, 1900.)
                                    (Abstract.)
   By   means   of   a  large   quantity    of solid carbonic acid, obtained
from the University Chemical Laboratory, it was found possible                   to
solidify, and maintain in the solid form for a considerable time,                 a
large mass of mercury.            Preliminary experiments          made   about a
year ago, in the usual manner, by means                of a triple circuit (iron,
german silver, mercury), did not give results of a satisfactory kind.
This was apparently due          to the difficulty   of maintaining steady, or
steadily varying, temperatures.
   Having obtained another supply of carbonic                acid about a month
ago, the authors made         a second    attempt.       A single iron-mercury
circuit  was used, and      junction temperatures were found by             means
of iron german-silver thermo-electric           circuits.      Very much better
results were got   ;   and the same arrangement was used to determine,
relatively to iron, the thermo-electric position of the mercury when
in the liquid state.
   The thermo-electric        line of the solid metal seems to be very
nearly,   if not absolutely, continuous with that of the liquid.                 It
intersects the line of 0° C. at           a  point   a   little below the inter
section of that line by the copper line.              It is fairly parallel to the
iron line, but intersects it       at a point corresponding        roughly to the
temperature —550* C.
   No more definite details           are given    at   present,  as the authors
intend to repeat the experiment            in such     a way that the tempera
tures of the hot and cold junctions can be read simultaneously.
In  this way they hope to arrive at a very accurate result.

         The Torsional Constants of Iron and Steel.
                            By Dr W. Peddie.
                            (Bead January 22, 1900.)
                                   {Abstract.)
   This paper    gave details of a series       of experiments made on the
same iron wire as was used         in experiments described in previous
papers.    This   series was   made on the wire after it had been heated
to redness and allowed        to cool.    A  linear relation was again found
to  hold between log. b and n, where b and n                 are the quantities
(constant in any one experiment) symbolised                    in the equation
y"(x + a) = b, y being range of oscillation and x being number of
oscillations of the wire which have taken place since the com
mencement of        the experiment.         It  was    further   found that the
line representing that relation passed (as did all other such lines
previously obtained with this wire) through the point log. b = 2*3,
n= 1. Thus the quantity provisionally called the Oscillation Con
stant in the preceding paper, and regarded as characteristic of the
material of the wire, retains its old value even after the wire has
been heated to redness.
   The    present     paper    contained     also   a   description      of  a  new
apparatus now used for the investigation                of the phenomena.
   It  further contained        an  account of two series         of experiments
made     upon   a  steel  wire.     In   each   series   a linear    relation held
between log.     b   and n, and the lines representing                the relations
passed through      a  point log.   ?; = 3'12, n =   \.    Thus the oscillation
constant for steel has a larger value than that for iron.
   The theory sketched in last paper was developed                a  little further,
and it was shown how numerical measurements of the elasticity
of metals may be obtained from the observations.                    The deviation
from perfectness of elasticity is about six times             as  great in iron as
in steel.    The    theory shows also that, in all wires of the same
material and pifrh (i.e., ratio of length to radius), the Oscillation
 Constant has the same value.            This indication      of theory has not
 yet been    tested    experimentally.       It   is shown also from theory
 that the Oscillation     Constant      has an   explicit connection with the
distortion at which the strongest molecular groups break down.

    It is    only within      a   few months that my attention has heen (at
 first accidentally) called to this matter.                    For, though I owe to the
 kindness of Prof. Klein            a copy    of his and Sommerfeld's Tlteorie              des
 Kreisdit,     I  had passed over, in reading the work, the                    " Digression
 on Quaternions
                        " which it      contains.       But Prof. C. N. Little, in          the
 course      of correspondence           about    his remarkable         paper     on   Knots
 (whose passage through the press                  I  was looking after), referred me
 for a numerical detail to an article by Prof. Klein on the progress
 of publication         of Gauss'      Gesamnwlte         Werke.       Shortly    afterwards
 Prof. Joly called          my attention        to the same         article from another
 point of view.          These     references       have led me to write the present
paper     ;   whose     somewhat puzzling title is explained in the first
section below.
                                                 1.
     In  1894      a paper    by Prof. Cay ley was read before the Society,
under the        title  "  Coordinates versus Quaternions."                  In this paper
the gain in compactness               and    expressiveness        secured    by the    use   of
the quaternion            method      was     allowed     ;    but   the   concession      was
virtually nullified by          the implication          that, to be of any        use,  these
simple       expressions      must be degraded               into the vile elements          of
r,  y,  2   or t, j,  k, which were looked upon               as their necessary basis.
    In reply, I       allowed that this statement               was to a certain extent
warranted,         provided the quaternion were regarded                    as Hamilton's
brilliant Invention of         1843    : — a splendid       system of imaginaries       ;  but
insisted that it had no application whatever to the quaternion of
the latter half of the century             : — a Discovery of        the highest order, in
which       the    Real    took     everywhere        the     place   of the Imaginary.
From that point of view, of                   course, the discovery was the great
thing,      the invention       merely an exceedingly elegant                  trifle.    Still
both were regarded           as due exclusively to Hamilton.

      Hence, of course, the claim made for Gauss to at least a share in
the invention of quaternions.
      Unfortunately for such                    a conclusion,             a Drelistreckung           is not a
Hamiltonian quaternion at all, hut                              a totally different            kind of con
cept.       It   is obviously only a very limited form of linear and vector
operator (kinematically     strain) depending upon four constants
                                            a
instead of the usual nine ; and might, perhaps (but on that account
solely), have heen designated by the name quaternion, had the
name not been already more worthily bestowed.
      A   quaternion,         as    Hamilton          gave      it,   forms an indispensable               part
of any conceivable complete theory of vectors. It expresses the
relation of one vector to another, or supplies the factor required to
convert         one    into     the other.            It   is   completely determined                 by   these
two alone,          and       is    thus    a   conception as real as either.                        Iu this
sense     it   was     called by Hamilton                  plane (or
                                                           a    Biradial.           It   has   a
rather an aspert), an angle, and the ratio of the lengths of its two
legs  j    and all biradials                characterized by like conditions                         of these
kimls      are regarded              as     equivalent          to one another.                [Equality of
angles implies that they are to be measured in the same sense.] A
quaternion, therefore, when applied to any vector in or parallel to
its   wen plane, turns              it    through      a   given angle    in or parallel to that
plane, and alters its length in                         a     given ratio.   When the legs of
the biradial           are equal, and its angle                   a    right angle, the quaternion
(as Hamilton showed)                      is   fully represented by the unit- vector per
pendicular            to its plane.             All   these      particular statements are con
tained in the general expression
                                    q   =   pia =    - (cos   A  +    €   sin A),
where      /3    and a are the vector legs of the biradial,                               b    and a their
lengths,        A     its angle,          and    c    the unit-vector               perpendicular       to its
plane.         Obviously, when this                   is   applied to         a     vector which       is    not
perpendicular            to    e,   the result        is
                                                      a     new Quaternion, not                a   vector.

     In its initial conception                            the quaternion had no direct connection
whatever with rotation.                                   But, of course,                   as an organ      of expression
capable of dealing with all space- problems,                                                  it   can be employed to
describe       the effect of rotation.
     Thus, if we are to represent                                         the       effect of turning                 a    vector    p
(conically) round an axis                                 c   (a unit-vector) through an angle                                   A, it
is obvious           that      p must                be       resolved into components                           parallel and
perpendicular to                 c.          Of      these the first is unaltered, the                                    second    is
made to rotate round t through the angle A.                                                         Hence,       if       <j>   be the

     The utter difference                in kind between the two concepts                                   comes
out    even more        clearly when wo consider the vector data necessary
to specify them respectively.
   To determine, fully,              a   Quaternion, requires but two vectors.                               This
would ordinarily involve six                     scalar conditions                  ;   but two of these are
not required,          because       the      aspect and             angle          and      the ratio of the
legs of the biradial are the sole essentials                                  : — the       orientation of the
biradial in its own           plane,       and its scale of size, being immaterial.
     To determine         a       Rotation        we must            have two               pairs of      vectors,
but there         are other specifications,                     or necessary                limitations,     as to
their lengths,         etc., which reduce the number of really necessary and
independent scalar data to three.                               These will be obvious from the
results of the subjoined analysis.                              [What              is essentially requisite
amounts to two pairs of points on the unit sphere, those of each pair

we consider the nature of the possible displacements                                           of a cap which
fits   a sphere,      and which has, therefore, three degrees of freedom only.

the       multiplication        of     quaternions            can          be       identified            with the
superpositionof two Drehstreckungen in the same (erroneous) sense
only as that in which a quaternion itself is identified with a
Drehstrecknwj.
     It   is most specially            to be observed                 that Prof.                  Klein    does        not
claim for Gauss any knowledge of how to aihl quaternions, simple

Drelu>i 'rechung ; though              it    is,   of course,   a     linear and vector operator.
To add two Drelistreckungen they must first                                be embodied, separately,
in any common vector, and the resulting vectors geometrically com

duces the resultant from the original vector must be found.                                                       Take

vector p.           The right    is   not an embodied Drehstreckung but                                       a   linear

quaternion (even as invented                       only) "there            is      a   great gulf fixed";

      Klein and Sommerfeld call              the     quantities    A, B,      C,   D  the
  Quaternionengrbssen (p. 21), and speak of them                   as   supplying     the
 transition     to Hamilton's       Theory of Quaternions.              This .seems to
 be, at first reading, correct enough ; for undoubtedly the quantity
                                   Ai + Bj+Ck + D
 is a Hamiltonian        Quaternion when          i,j,  k are used in the Hainil-
  tonian    sense.
      I3ut now let us pass to § 7, pp. 55-68, and consider carefully
  the authors' Exeurs iiber die Quaternionenthporie.
      In the first place the " Drehstreckung " is introduced, being
  defined as " an operation which is compounded of                   a  rotation about
  the origin 0, and an isotropic expansion with                    reference      to  0."
  If   the length of every line is changed            in the ratio      T:  1,  then the
  Drehstreckung        can be symbolised by the four magnitudes A, It,
   V,   D, which, however,       instead   of having the sum of their squares
  equal to unity, satisfy the equation
                                A2 + B? + C- + D* =        T
      Two Drehstreckungen            acting in succession       produce     a   resultant
  Drehstreckung,       and the equations connecting the twelve quantities
  of   the type A, B,     V, D, are obviously the same as those                that hold
  when the       Drehstreckungen         are simple      rotations (7'=1).          These
  are given, and then the authors say:                 ''The primitive (ursjtruny-
  liclte) definition of the word quaternion we base on our conception
  of the Drehstreckung        :   A quaternion signifies       nothing   else    than  the
  operation of the Drelistreckuny.             It is completely determined by
   the magnitude of the Streckung (7"), by the axis of the rotation
   (a, b, c) and the magnitude of the half-angle of rotation
                                                                             \  ™tf'
      The    Drehstreckung        U,    determined       by  the    four    magnitudes
   A,   B, C, D, is then written in the form
                                U = iA +j/!     +  kO+D

in which I,         j, k    are carefully              described        as   three imaginary units               ;
their introduction               being "etwas rein conventionelles."                                 Further,
" The magnitude T is called, after Hamilton, the Tensor of tJte Quater
nion.  Therefore we may say : An ordinary rotation is a writ
quaternion (i.e., a quaternion of tensor unity)."
  Already Klein and Sommerfeld have parted                                               company           with
Hamilton;           for, although, with Hamilton's                           meanings of           i,j,    k, Q
is        quaternion,       the tensor of the quaternion                           Q is not T, but is

     The geometrical               meaning             of    the     quantity        Ai + Bj+Ck             +   D
we know,          provided         i,   j,    k are used            in the Hamiltonian                 sense     ;
and, as      will      be    seen       later, Klein              and    Sommerfeld,            in spite of
guarded statements about their purely conventional                                            character, do
really      use     them in          Hamilton's              sense      whenever          there       is    any
analytical work to be done.                           Then, again, the operation called the
Drehstreckung              we    also     know,           for it is     a    simple modification                of
an ordinary           rotation.           But to          assert     the identity            of quaternion
and rotation, and to symbolise the latter by means of an expres
sion appropriate             to the former,               — that surely is           a    misuse      of     the
mathematical term identity, and                              a     playing     fast and loose              with
the recognised principles of mathematical symbolism.
     It   is important           from         the outset to recognise                    this duality           or
ambiguity         of significance attached to the symbol                                  £2.     For some
purposes       it     is    treated          as   a       quaternion,        and     for others            as   a
Drehstreckung.               The avowed aim of the authors is to show that
Hamilton's          quaternion          is nothing else than a Drehstreckung,                                the
name given by them to a conception which, as we learn from                                                   the
last page of Part            ii.   of their Treatise, was first distinctly described
by Gauss.             Yet no       one       who really knows                 what       a   quaternion         is
could for         a   moment            admit         the    identity.         To find anything at
all comparable              to     this      attempt     identify two fundamentally
                                                             to
different conceptions, we                     should havo to go to old literatures in
which the uncritical                editor            has pieced         together        into    a    kind of
historic mosaic two traditions                         from quite different sources.                       As   a
foundation on which to build                          a   mathematical superstructure,                     Klein

succeeding chapters to return to quaternion calculation."
   Meanwhile, having                      asserted         the identity of                   quaternion                and
rotation, the authors                    proceed        to adopt Hamilton's                      nomenclature,
calling      Z>   the scalar part and                  (iA +jB + kU) the vector part of                                 the
quaternion (Drehstreckung                        ?).
   They then consider                   a   quaternion which                is   reduced to its vector
part, and which             is   identified with               a   Drehstreckung             whose angle of
rotation      is   u>=tt, that            is,   two right angles.                    This    special           kind of
Drehstreckung, this semi-revolution about                                      an axis, combined                     with
isotropic expansion,                is      called     a       Wendestreckung.                Regarded                 as    a
Wendestreckung the vector                         is    assumed           to take the analytical                     form
                                                V=iX+jY+kZ
      But   if     this     be      a    Wendestreckung,                   so    also       is    the quantity
iA +JB        +   kC, which,             on their assumptions,                   is     an    important                part
 of the Drehstreckung                     Q.     This no doubt                  is   the Wendestreckung
 to which the Drehstreckung                                Q    is   reduced when                 ui   = tt.           But,
 when       associated      with the so-called scalar in the complete expression
 for the Drehdreclmng,                      the so-called vector cannot be interpreted
 in any       sense        as   a   Wendestreckung.                       The most elementary con
 siderations        in the geometry of rotations show that, in its                                                 effect
 upon     a   body, the assumed                        analytical          expression            for the          Dreh
 streckung         must be treated                as       a   whole.        The expression, in fact,
 is   rum-'Hstrihutive.              Thus v(iA             +jB + kC + D),               where      v    is    a   vector
 line and the part in brackets                         a   Drehstreckung, cannot bo expanded
 in the form viA            +    vjB + vkC         +    vD.        Nevertheless the authors assert
 (p. 59) that two quantities                      of the form              Q    may bo added together
 as    Hamiltonian quaternions                         are added — i.e., the distributive                              law,

              holds                      assumed to hold also for    is
  Drehstreckungen.    But this assumption    inadmissible for, as           is                           ;                   a

springs from the attempt              to make a quaternion            mean a rotation.
A    mathematical       Janus     has     come    into heing.        Had the authors
realised    or   distinctly stated that their i,              j,   k are    not always
associative,    so that    Bi.i  is not the same         as   B.ii, they might have
saved their      readers     considerable confusion         ;   but then their i,    j, k
 would no longer have been the same as Hamilton's, and they
could not, with any show of propriety, have used the term
 Quaternion at all.
     Cayley showed in          1845     (see Phil. Mag.) that the four scalar
 quantities in      the   quaternion       iA+jB + kC+D            were the quantities
 symmetrically involved            in     Rodrigues'     expressions       defining   the
 rotation
              (iA    +JB + kC+ D)(               ){iA +JB + kC+D)-\
 and    some   further     investigations      are given in a later paper          (Phil.
 Mag., 1848).         The question is also treated in Tait's paper                  "On
 the Rotation of        a   Rigid Body" (Trans. Boy.                Soc.   E.lin., 1868;
  Scientific Papers, vol. i. p. 99).           Klein    and Sommerfeld's innova
  tion is to make iA +jB + kC+              D symbolise        the   rotation, or, more
  generally,   the Drehstreckung.
      Passing on now to the analytical part of their discussion, we are
  introduced    to the vectors
                       v=ix+jy      + kz and      V=iX+jY+kZ
   which   are such      that   the turning        part   of the Drehstreckung          Q
   changes the direction of         v   into the direction of V, while its tensor
   part (T) changes the length of            Kinto the length of          v •
                                                                              in symbols
                                          vQ=VTi,
   where for simplicity        V is understood        to have unit       length.    Here
   v and   V are   simply directed lines.
      The next      step, however, is to consider v and              V as   Wendcstreck-
   ungen and to combine them in                a   particular    way with the Dreh
   streckung    Q.     The result of the investigation, which extends over
   nearly two pages, is the demonstration of the formula
                             (       )»r->-(           )QVQr\
    where the empty bracket represents any system acted upon by the
    operators v and Q.
       But this equation is simply equivalent              to a quaternion identity.

       It   is   well to note hero                          that,        although     v    and a are the same
vector*,         a(          )Ka           and    Klein and Sonimerfeld's Wendcstreckuhi:
r    are     not quite the                      same operator*. Their tensors differ, the
Wcndestrockung                 r        being equivalent to (Ty)~-u(                                  )Ka.
       Immediately             following                the demonstration of the equation                          just
discussed         there       is       given on pp. GI-65 an analytical investigation
essentially the same as that given long ago by Cayley, from which
the direction cosines of the new positions of                                              a   set of rectangular
axes with reference                        to the original                positions are expressed in terms
of the quantities A, It,                           U,   I).       This investigation             is   of course quite
eorrect,         because,          for       the monvnt, the                     authors use the quantities
 <l,   r,   V    really in their true quaternion significations and not as
I   )rehstreckui)gen.
       Thus, in the analytical part of their work, Klein and Sornnier-
feld simply reproduce                              long known               results     and      follow accurately

for       a Drehstreckung                        is not a very practical dynamic                                conception,
although               the rotation is of                      fundamental importance.                           It    has, of
course, been long recognised                                    by workers in quaternions that the
quaternion              method lends itself powerfully to the treatment of all
kinds of strains                       ;    but because                  it is peculiarly            fitted       to attack
general problems in the rotation of                                        a   rigid body, it does not neces
sarily follow,                  as    Klein       and       Sommerfeld seem to suggest, that its
value in other directions is insignificant.
      Regarding Hamilton's                            definition of              a   quaternion        as    the quotient
of two vectors, Klein and                              Sommerfeld remark : — " As                               the basis of
a    theory this definition is scarcely                                    adapted         to the end aimed                   at   ;

for       the        expression                  quotient           of    two vectors             requires first an
explanation                  of itself,           and,          unless         that be given,*                  diverts       our
attention wholly                           to a vague  (ivnklar) analogy with the rules of
ordinary algebra.                           Tho definition may, of course, bo theoretically
justified,           and has                indeed         certain advantages,                   to     be       mentioned
immediately                 ;   but it does not seem appropriate to begin with it."
      To this           expression                of an opinion — and            it is little else — the
natural            reply             is,   Why not          1       Is Hamilton's " Quotient of two
Vectors"               the          only     expression             in mathematics    that requires to
be        explained             ?          guarded his readers

against reading into the meaning of tho word
than          is   essentially involved in                          it,   namely, the operator ajb, which
changes            b   into a.              The laws of its operation depend on the kind
of       quantities represented                           by    b    and a.           If     and       a are ordinary
numbers,               the quotient               is      the    ordinary            fraction    ;   if     b    and    a are
vectors,           the quotient                  is   a    quaternion.                What       can    be       simpler in
conception or more complete                                     in statement           ?    On tho other hand,
it       is   very questionable indeed                              if     the       profoundest meditation on

that Hamilton had erred in not sufficiently explaining his meaning.     On tho
contrary, Hamilton's explanations are always full — almost prolix at times.

ignorance of what Hamilton                            has done, seem to                            think it necessary

course, again             an identity in quaternions.                               The assumed                 condition
means that           \i   and therefore              a are      perpendicular to VU'/, and hence

Hence, multiplying                  Kq into both                sides of
                                                7aK2 = j8(T7)«,
we got
and multiplying                into   q    we have finally
                                             a = Pq- =             Pq,      say.
The rotational equation                     then becomes
                q(            )lv/=r(                  )K7-         =

     But, strictly and therefore mathematically                               speaking,       their defini

Drehstreckung and two Wendestreckungen, whose axes are subject
to   a   particular limitation.                 A   so-called     quaternion Q' is represented

v/V.
  In short they              use Q', Q, v and               V, each and all, in a double signi

follow Hamilton and Tait — that                          is,   their analytical           work     is    purely
quaternionic.              But when there             is    no direct question of establishing
fundamental relations among the scalar                                  quantities involved, they

Gunther and            the     author         gave      an        account of the             results         ob
tained from the examination of two samples of water taken from
Lake Urmi, and             amongst       other determinations of                     a     chemical          and
physical nature, were those                   of the refractive indices,                    which were
performed with the aid of the Royal                               Society's large quartz prism
and spectrometer, the latter reading by means of micrometers to 2"
of arc.       On comparing the values obtained for the refractive indices
of the two samples               of water with those obtained for the relative
densities,     it   was      at once      apparent that the former differentiated
the two samples quite as distinctly                      as the       latter.
     Krummelf         attempted an optical method for the examination
of    various samples            of sea-water,           by measuring their refractive
indices with the aid of an Abbe refractometer.                                      The chief objec
tions to the use of this instrument are — (1) Its sensibility                                           is   not
sufficient when the waters to be examined differ but slightly from
                                      (2) the drop of water placed
each other in their degrees of salinity                      ;
upon the fixed prism must necessarily undergo     certain although              a
small amount of evaporation before                       it       can be covered by the second
or movable prism           ;   (3) there      is   a   considerable degree of uncertainty
as to the true temperature of the liquid                                   contained between                 the
prisms, even when the refractometer                                is   supplied with             a    water
jacket.       The thermometer indicates the temperature                               of the water in
the   jacket,       but, owing           to    the      unavoidable massiveness                        of the
prisms,   and the bad conducting power of glass for heat,                                    it   is   highly
improbable          that     the temperature observed                        is     also    that of tho

  In order to determine how far the optical method proposed
by Krummel might be relied upon, Mr H. N. Dickson very kindly
supplied the author with five samples of sea- water marked 1T,                               2T,
3T, 4V,   and 5", which           differed but little from each other as regards
" total salinity."        The samples were first examined as follows                         :   —
Using     a   Sprengel tube having a capacity of about 48 c.c., two series
of determinations of the relative densities at 24° C. were made.
The tube was first washed out with fuming nitric acid, then with
distilled water, and finally with absolute alcohol                  ;   it was then dried
by keeping it thoroughly heated whilst a current of air was passed
through       ;   when the tube had become quite cold, it was wiped and
hung from one arm of the balance, and after an interval                               of five
minutes its weight was determined.                 The tube was then charged with
recently re-distilled water, and suspended centrally in a large water
bath, furnished with          a   rocking stirrer which was kept moving by a
small water motor; the temperature of the bath was indicated by a
standardised thermometer reading to 0°-l C.                    "With this apparatus
the   maintenance of a constant temperature, which                              differed very
little from that of the room, was                  an extremely             easy matter, the
momentary application of              a   small Bunsen      flame       from time to time
being     all that     was    necessary.      It    was observed that the tube,
together with its contents, assumed an almost constant temperature
in about ten minutes after immersion in the bath                        ;   an approximate
adjustment of the contents was then made.                       In every           case, how
ever, the tube was allowed to remain               in   the bath for twenty minutes,
when the liquid was finally adjusted in the usual manner by the
application of bibulous            paper to the capillary.          The tube        was then
removed from the bath, carefully wiped, again suspended from one
arm of the balance, and weighed after five minutes.                             The contents
were then discharged, the tube repeatedly washed out with por
tions of the sea-water to be examined, and then filled with                            it,   and

      The refractive indices of the five                   samples      of  water, together
   with that of recently re-distilled water, were next determined with
   the aid of the above-mentioned large spectrometer and hollow
   quartz    prism.      Two     series    of   measurements            were made        at   the
   ordinary    temperature of the room, on two different                           days.    The
   bottles containing the waters to be examined were placed upon a
   shelf, close to the spectrometer, the day before any measurements
   were proceeded        with  ; on the     day of examination             the water would

therefore be at almost,       if not quite, the    same temperature     as that
of the room itself, and any change in the temperature of the             liquid,
would be due chiefly to          the slight though unavoidable handling,
and to the proximity         of the observer.       The actual temperature      of
the water undergoing examination in the prism, was found                 by the
standardised       thermometer,      which    was used    in connection      with
the density determinations already described, the reading being
taken immediately         after the position of minimum          deviation    had
been found.        The point of intersection of the cross threads        in the
telescope     was  in every   case made      to coincide with the right-hand
edge     of the image of the     slit of the collimator,  as it was found that
far    more   concordant     and trustworthy       readings were obtained       in
 this way, than by bringing          the point of intersection upon the esti
mated centre of the image         ; successive  readings of the same quantity,
 when effected by the latter method, were sometimes             found to   differ
by    as  much as 6" or 8" of arc, whereas by the former, or edge-of-
 slit method, the various readings rarely differed by            more   than 2',
 and were generally identical.
     To find the value for the minimum deviation of the D line by
 a sample of water, the       following method of procedure       was adopted.
 (1) The prism was        washed out twice with portions of        the water to
 be examined, then filled, and the thermometer inserted; (2) the
 direct reading for the edge of the slit was made ; (3) the prism
  was    placed upon the spectrometer, and the position of minimum
  deviation    found; (4) the temperature of the water in the prism
  was   noted ; (5) the position of minimum deviation was read ; and
  (6) the prism was removed from the spectrometer, and the direct
  reading for the edge of the slit again taken.          If the direct readings
  (2 and 6) differed by more than 2" of arc, the whole process                was
  repeated; this, however, was only found to be necessary                 in one
  instance.      With  a little practice the whole of the above operations
  may be performed in five minutes.

      Before     the values obtained        for the minimum       deviations     or
  refractive indices could be compared with each other, it was neces
  sary to study the effect produced upon them by              a change   in tem

perature     ;  for this purpose, the waters denoted by lv and                            5V were
selected.        The water having been introduced into the prism, the
minimum deviation for the               I) lino       was found in the manner already
described;         the thermometer         was then removed,                and the aperture
in the prism closed with            a stopper.          A Lunson burner            was then        lit
in the closed room, in order to raise the temperature                            ; after    a time,
th? minimum deviation was again determined, the process being
repeated       for two other and still higher                       temperatures.         In this
manner were obtained the minimum deviations at four different

calculated.
   By     the first or relative deviation method,                            a    number of samples
of water can be examined far more                                   quickly than by the relative
density method which                  is       so generally adopted               ;   this    is   due to the
ease     and rapidity          with          which       a   minimum        deviation observation
may be made, and to the fact that the calculation                                          is   of the same
simple order as that used for obtaining the relative densities.
   Let      SD    and     W       represent              the minimum             deviations of the               1>

the waters under examination, and expressing the several minimum

     If   we now compare            the relative deviations given in                      this table
with the relative densities given in Table B, we at                                 once    observe
that the differences in the former                           are     of practically       the same
magnitude         as those     exhibited in the latter ; therefore, if we proceed
to arrange the waters according to their degrees of total salinity
or " total salts " per kilogram, the value obtained for the several
relative        deviations      will enable          us     to differentiate       the waters as
sharply and decisively as the corresponding values for the relative
densities, and the use of either method would lead us to arrange
the waters according to the following descending order of                                  salinity    :
lv,   5V, 2V, 4T, 3V.         The waters           2T     and    4T are     practically identical,
as both methods place                the former in the higher position                     by only
•00001.
      The second or refractive index method for comparing waters,
requires, in addition              to     the minimum                deviation   observation,     an
accurate determination of the refracting angle of the prism                                 :   when
these         are known,      the refractive            index fi may be calculated from
the well-known formula
                                             Bin|(A + D)

A     being the angle of the                 prism      and      D    the   minimum       deviation.
This method would, however, probably prove to                                    be far less     con
venient in practice than the relative deviation method                                ;   and since
the value for           //.   increases      or decreases            with the deviation,         one
would be led to adopt the simpler or relative deviation                                    method,
rather than the other.                  It   should also be observed that when the
refractive indices for similar samples of average sea-water are com
pared with one another, the
                               " total salinity " of one water gener                       is
ally distinguished            from that of another by                  a    change in the value
of the 5th decimal figure only                 ;   occasionally the 4th figure changes
by    1   ;   the relative deviations, on the other hand, may and do show
well-marked differences in the 4th decimal.
      In Table      G    the relative densities, relative deviations, and re
fractive indices of the five samples of water examined are grouped
together, so that the results obtained                             by the     different    methods
under consideration may be conveniently inspected and compared.

    The costliness of the refractometer which                  baa been      employed
 for the measurements detailed              above,    might possibly       incline   an
 individual observer       to  choose      the usual specific gravity           method
 rather than the    one advocated here ; but where a large number of
 samples of water have to be examined (as, for instance, in                   a central
 laboratory), the optical method would undoubtedly prove to be
  the most economical and convenient one, on account of the rapidity
  with which the determinations could             be effected.
     The author    hopes     that in a future communication               he may be

  intends   to carry out      with  a special form of refractometer, which

    In the " Report on Investigations          into the Life-History      of the
Salmon in Fresh Water," published             in 1898, the       changes   which
the fish undergoes between the months of                May and November
were dealt with,       but there was no material          available to enable
the observations to be         extended throughout          the remaining    five
months of the year, from December to April.
    The difficulty of getting an adequate supply of fish during these
close months is very great, but through           the energetic co-operation
of   Mr Archer and his      successor   in the post of Inspector of Salmon
Fisheries,     Mr Calderwood,      a certain    number of fish have been
procured during these months from the estuaries of                the Spey and
the Dee.
    To the Duke of Richmond and Gordon, through his commissioner,
George Muirhead,        Esq., and to the District Fishery Board (Aber
deenshire) of       the River Dee, our thanks are due for generously
 supplying us with material.
    In   spite of    the earnest endeavours        of   Mr Archer and Mr

    Such    a table fully confirms the conclusion previously arrived at —
 That    the salmon goes to thb sea to feed and returns to
 the    river    when     it has accumulated            its   full    store of
 nourishment        irrespective      of the condition         of thb repro
 DUCTIVE      ORGANS.     The     FACTOR     DETERMINING      MIGRATION     FROM
 sea   to river is not the nisus generativus, but the state of
 NUTRITION.

     The number of male salmon examined in the                    course  of the
  previous investigation     was so small that     it was   considered unsafe
  to form any definite conclusions.
     During the    past two years every effort has been made to procure
  a supply of male fish, but without much success.              The very small
  number of males which have been procured seems to indicate that
  they must be greatly outnumbered by female fish.
     The following tables give the results of our examinations and
  analyses of the male salmon sent to us.

    The slightly lower figure in May and June is due to the fact
that the two fish examined in 1896 were much below the average
as   regards muscular development.
    The two fish examined in October and November                        show a very
 small     amount of       solids in the muscles.           The average    figure for
the total solids from January to August — 2191 grms. — is based on
 the examination        of  1 1  fish,   and the divergence from this mani
 fested in these two fish must be accepted                  with caution, and does
 not justify      the formation        of any conclusions.         Further data are
 required.
     From the tabic given above it will            be seen that the male       salmon
 coming from the sea closely resemble the female fish in the amount

  examination of female fish,           as to  the factors determining migration.

    Comparing the upper water male fish taken in 1898 with those
taken in 1896, it is seen that the June fish in the former group re
semble the      July   and August rather than the June fish in the latter
group.       What the explanation           of this may be is not manifest.
Possibly     an earlier migration        to the river may have induced an
earlier development of the           testes and a greater loss of substance
from the muscles.
C. Ox the Nature              of the Phosphorus           Compounds      of the
       Muscles of Salmon, and the Synthesis of the Organic
        Phosphorus Compounds of Testes and Ovaries.
    From the study of the phosphorus compounds in the muscles
and in the testes and ovaries at various seasons (Eeport, p. 143 et
seq.), we came to the conclusion that the nucleic acid in the testes
and the ichthulin in        the ovaries — both complex organic phosphorus
compounds       — are built up from simple inorganic phosphates stored
in the     muscles.
    The recent      researches   carried on in Bbhman's        laboratory (Berl.
 klin.    Wochensch.,     1898,    p. 789)    tend   to show   that, in dogs at
 least, inorganic phosphorus compounds are not used in the body to
 anything like the       same extent as organic compounds ; and the fact
 that in our previous investigation we             assumed  all the phosphorus
 extracted by acidulated water to be            inorganic in nature, rendered it
 necessary to make further observations.                Especially   was  this the
  case   since Siegfried       (Ztseh. f. phys. Ohem., Bd. xxi., p. 360,
  1896)     has  shown     that in the flesh of mammals some of the
  phosphorus thus extracted is in organic combination, being linked
  to a substance which he has described as carnic acid.                 He   states
  that carnic acid     has the formula C10HlsN8O5,        and that it is identical
  with antipeptone.
     If  this is so, the phosphorus compound — which he calls phospho-
  carnic acid — must      be nearly allied to the pseudo-nucleins.         If such
  a body occurs      in the muscle of     the salmon in sufficient quantity to
  yield the phosphorus of the nucleic acid of the               testes and of the
  ichthulin and lecithin of the       ovaries, the conclusion as to the extent
  of synthesis may have been erroneous.
     In   the previous Report it was shown that the average amount of

phosphorus in the muscle of the salmon                            is   0-215 per cent.,            and
that of this about 0-109            is   soluble in water.
     To determine how much of this                      is   in organic combination                and
how much in such compounds as phosphocarnic acid, the following
observations were made              :—
     1.   100 grm. of the flesh of            a    fresh sea salmon in March 1899
were extracted repeatedly with over                          2   litres of water and acetic
acid.      The watery      extract         was boiled and the precipitate                         well
washed.         The inorganic phosphorus was precipitated with ammonia
and chloride of calcium. In the precipitate the phosphorus                                         was
estimated in the usual way, calcium being washed out of                                                the
molybdate         precipitate       with      10       per   cent,     nitrate       of    ammonia
solution.

     The filtrate containing any phosphocarnic acid was evaporated,
burned and treated with molybdate of ammonia, and P. estimated
as above.

     2.   135 grm. of the flesh of         a       kelt (32) captured in March,                        was
analysed in same        way —   :
          Mg2P2O7 = -330, P206            =211, P206%              = 156,   P    =

  The filtrate, containing any phosphocarnic treated                             as above, gave
no precipitate with ammonia-magnesia mixture.
     The phosphorus extracted by water from the muscle                                     is   almost
entirely in simple inorganic combination.
     The evidence thus supports the view that the ovarian ichthulin
and the testicular          nuclein        are         built up from simple inorganic
phosphorus compounds derived from the muscle.

     It   is   well known that the salmon when in the                        sea feeds          largely
on herring, and that these in turn prey upon small free swimming
Crustacea,       many of which have                a   bright red colour.             It   therefore

 1S99-1900.]      Dr Noel Paton and Mr Newbigin on Salmon.                        53
 seemed of interest to compare             the pigment of such Crustacea with
 the colouring matter of the muscles and ovaries of the salmon.
     During last      summer,       Sir John Murray      sent   to the Laboratory
 of the Royal College of Physicians, collections of Crustacea obtained
 by tow-netting in Loch Fyne, in order that the pigments might be
 investigated.        The Crustacea sent were all of        a red   colour, and are
 believed to constitute the chief food of the herring.                The object of
 the investigation was to find what relation, if any, the pigments of
 these crustacea bear to those of the salmon.
     "When received the Crustacea were preserved in methylated spirit
 or in alcohol of various strengths.             In  no case was    the  preserving
 fluid markedly coloured, most of the pigment being still retained by
 the organisms.         As   to the Crustacea sent, there were separate bottles
 of Pandalm annuliconiis and Iliji/iolyte scurifron*, and                 also large
 bottles labelled " contents of tow-net                 in  upper     Loch   Fyne."
 These last contained chiefly copepoda               intermixed     with colourless
 organisms such        as  Sagilta    and also various Euphausidae,       species of
 I/ipptJyte,    etc.     The larger Crustacea were picked out from among
 the copepoda,       and the pigments investigated in two sets — (1) those
 of the copepoda, (2) these of the other Crustacea.
     1. The copepoda contained a large amount of fat in which the
 pigment was dissolved.           It  was found possible by squeezing to extract
 from theirbodies drop3 of fat deeply coloured by the reddish pigment.
 Both fat and pigment dissolve in boiling methylated spirit; but on
cooling, the coloured fat separates out at the bottom of the vessel.
 Loth fat and pigment dissolve readily in ether, which is thus a
much better solvent for the pigment than alcohol.                     When the fat
is saponified either by heating with an alcoholic solution of caustic
soda, or by adding metallic sodium to a solution in ether, a red
soap    is formed from which the pigment may be obtained after
treatment       with      acid.    A small amount        of   a   yellow   pigment
remains in solution in the caustic             solution after saponification,     as
in the case of the salmon pigment.
    The   red   pigment is      a lipochrome, and exhibits the same general
characters      as the      red   pigment of the salmon,          but it was not
obtained      in   sufficient      amount     for   detailed    investigation.    It
especially recalls the pigment of the salmon in its close association
with fat.

   2. The  pigments of the other Crustacea    sent closely resembled
those  of the Norway lobster.     The most distinct  difference from
the copepoda  lies in the fact that the red pigment is chiefly found
in the chitinous cuticle and in the epidermis  ; the occurrence of  a
coloured oil was not obvious.

   (From    the Lahyralory      of the Royal      College    of Physicians of
                                  Edinburgh.)
   The so-called rectal gland of Elasmobraneh             fishes claimed notice
early in the history of scientific research,         as  might indeed ho ex
pected from the obviousness        of its appearance      and the invariability
of its occurrence.        But, in spite of this fact, the rectal gland
remains one of those organs          the   knowledge       of the structure of
which    is unsatisfactory, and the conjecture as to the function               of
¦which  is consequently hazy.
   As far    as can    be ascertained,     Professor     Monro     of Edinburgh
(the second of that well-known name) gave the earliest descrip
tion of the rectal gland in his work upon the Structure and
Physiology of Fishes, published in 1785.              He refers to the organ
as the "appendix digitiformis,"         the "appendix vermiformis," and
in one place     as  the  "ciccum."       Dumeril (4), in Suite* a liuffon,
amplified Monro's description, and various other writers on zoology
have   taken    the   subject into consideration, the          latest  structural
description being that of Blanchard, published in 1880 (7).
   I have been unable to find any description of the microscopical
appearances     of the structure of specimens           prepared by the later
and   more satisfactory methods          of investigation,      and it seemed
therefore of interest to make an attempt to elucidate the structure
by a study of sections      prepared by such methods.             I shall accord
ingly first give   a short account of the characteristics observed,          and
afterwards consider briefly the various theories              which have been
advanced regarding the possible function of the organ.

    To the naked        eye   the  rectal gland presents         an appearance
varying somewhat in the different genera in which it occurs, the

principal difference being that in Batoids the duct which leads
from the gland proper to the rectum is short and comparatively
wide, and opens into            a  posterior dilatation of the rectum,        while in
Selachians        the duct is longer           and narrower,       and opens       more
directly      into the rectum (Howes).                The opening of the duct,
which is usually guarded by a fold of mucous membrane, is upon
the dorsal wall of the rectum, about midway                       between the anus
and the termination             of the spiral valve.        The gland is connected
to the posterior         abdominal wall by          a  fold of peritoneum, and is,
according to Howes,               supplied by the superior mesenteric artery.
 Its  size varies in proportion           to that of the animal, and        in a skate
of two feet in length from tip of snout to tip of tail may be about an
inch in length         ;  its colour is usually a reddish-brown.              A longi
tudinal section shows that there is a central smooth- walled canal,
irregular       in calibre and giving off numerous short branches, sur
rounded by a firm glandular tissue, which is in its turn compassed
by    a whitish      ring of fibrous tissue       ;  surrounding    all is the coat of
peritoneum.           Along the lumen can          be seen the mouths of severed
vessels,      and it contains          some   dirty-yellow secretion of        a viscid
 consistence and         a  neutral reaction.         Practically nothing more can
 be discovered by the unaided eye.
                               Microscopic Appearances.
     For the microscopic examination of the organ, specimens ob
 tained in the freshest possible state were hardened in corrosive
 sublimate, formal           in    8 per   cent,  solution,   and in alcohol     ;    and
 though        good    results      were    obtained     by  each   method, it was
 noticed that the gland cells seemed to be best preserved by the
 alcohol    ;  there was, however, considerable shrinkage.                  The speci
 mens were then embedded in the usual way in paraffin, cut by a
 rocking       microtome, and stained either by haematein                   and eosin,
 Ehrlich-Biondi triple stain, picro-carmin, or methyl-blue.                     Heiden-
 hain's iron and hematoxylin method was also tried.
     The organ may          be described as consisting of three regions           :
         (1) An outer fibro-muscular layer covered by peritoneum.
         (2)   A  middle glandular layer.
         (3)    A central region, consisting of ducts and blood-vessels
                 arranged round         a  central lumen.

 1899-1900.]   Mr Crawford       on Rectal Gland of Elasmobratwhs.                    57
     1.  The outer layer,     on which      appears    externally      a  coating of
 somewhat cubical peritoneal cells, is made up of bands of white
 fibrous tissue interwoven irregularly           with   a   considerable      amount
 of non-striated muscle-fibre running in           a  circular and longitudinal
 direction.    In  this tissue are to be found at intervals largo sinuses
 of an irregular shape, lined with endothelial cells, and containing
blood-corpuscles.      Towards the inner part the muscle-fibres                become
 closer, forming a definite band resembling               a  muscularis mucosa:
external to the glandular tissue of the middle layer.                 Under     a  higli
power there is nothing further to bo remarked.
    2. The middle or glandular          layer is composed        of   a  number of
few-branched      tubules, radially arranged,        separated      by capillaries,
which     are usually gorged      with blood.       Under     a  high power the
gland cells are seen to be cubical, mono-nucleated,               ill defined from
one another, and of        a  granular appearance.          This latter     is due to
the protoplasmic network and not to the presence                   of any foreign
substance.      The iron and hematoxylin             staining     method recom
mended by Heidenhain           for showing zymin granules              gave,   here a
negative result.      The nuclei of the cells are large, possessing                  an
evident nuclear membrane and nuclear network, and showing three
to five nucleoli.    The fibrous tissue of this layer is slight, consisting
of thin septa passing        inwards from the outer fibro-muscular layer
first described.
    3.  The central layer       begins    at a   varying     distance     from      the
periphery     by  the   sudden transition        of the gland cells into the
epithelium     of ducts,     which open       after  a   short course       into the
central lumen.
    Between these ducts and immediately external to the epithelium
of the lumen are seen very large irregularly-shaped                  sinuses     lined
with endothelial     cells, and tilled with blood-corpuscles.
    The lumen of     the organ     is large, though it is often compressed
so as   to seem almost valvular      ; in many cases it contains         a  granular
substance of indefinite        structure, which       was    unaffected       by    the
staining reagents employed.
    On examining the layer under           a  high power, the epithelium of
the ducts and lumen is seen to be of the type described as transi
tional, showing several layers of polygonal            cells, flattened as they
approach the free surface.           In many      cases the      more    superficial

58            Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                   [sess.
cells have undergone a mucoid change, and a band of clear                    cells  is
visible lining the duct.         This   appears   to be a degeneration, since
in other cases no such cells are to         be seen.
     The blood filling     the    sinuses   was often      remarked to contain
many large and very coarsely granular eosinophilous cells.
     The general system        of the organ      recalls,    therefore, that   of    a
compound tubular gland with short secondary                  ducts opening into      a
main central one.         It   might also be considered,           more   correctly
from     a developmental point of view,          as a   blind tube having        the
samo goneral      structure as that of the intestine, and presenting                 a
lumen bounded by walls of             a  constitution comparable to that of
the intestine, though widely differing            from that part of it in the
near neighbourhood.
     The cells of the gland acini present            no very peculiar feature        ;
they resemble      in general      character the cells of the kidney,           and
 suggest an excretory function rather than a secretory.
     But what cannot fail       to be noted     in the structure of the organ
 is the richness of its blood-supply           and    the pecidiar arrangement
of that supply.       There is     a peripheral and a central arrangement
 of large blood-sinuses connected         by  a copious     network of capillaries
 which bring the blood into intimate relation with the cells.
     And though this has been remarked, attention seems never to
 have been arrested      by the position of the central sinuses,           directly
 in relation with the epithelium of the lumen             ;   a condition which    is
 surely uncommon.
                                      Chomical.
      ])r Noel Paton    has been kind enough to make for me a chemical
 examination of the gland and its secretion,                and has given me the
 following    particulars   : — The contained        secretion    of several  rectal
 glands was preserved        in absolute alcohol.       The alcohol was evapor
  ated off, and    the residue      extracted with water.          A considerable
  amount of insoluble matter remained.              The aqueous solution when
  treated   with an   alkaline solution of hypobromite of soda, gave                 a
  fine effervescence   ; and on the addition        of oxalic acid as it evapor
  ated, yielded a crop of crystals, some with           the characteristic shape
  of oxalate of urea, some long and acicular.             The secretion from the
  gland undoubtedly contains          a considerable amount of urea.

                          Consideration of Furuium.
    With    reference   to the     probable function of the organ              I  have
attempted to describe,         several   theories,   more    or less vague, have
}>een   presented.     Monro, in the original notice, was of opinion that
the organ was      a secretory    one, and Dumeril calls it
                                                                      " a true secre
tory organ     ";  but neither offers any suggestion           as to the     probable
nature of the supposed          secretion.      Leydig (5) compared its struc
ture to that of the glands of Brunner in other animals, pointing out
that in the genus Chimaera, in which                a  true    rectal gland, as       a
separate viscus,      does not exist, glandular         tissue    is present in the
wall of    the intestine at a corresponding situation, while                 in those
fishes which possess        a  rectal gland the intestinal wall is in that
region devoid of such tissue.
    Home      (2) compared      the organ      to the ceecal     pouches     of birds,
 and Retzius on that account suggested the title Bursa Fahricii.
    Blanchard,     while    apparently       demonstrating         the    hypoblastic
 origin of the organ, is of opinion that it is analogous                 to the anal
or circumanal glands of some vertebrates,                 and prefers       the name
 " glandula                  "
                                   "rectal"
               superanalis     to               or "digitiform."
    But,   as Howes points out, such an analogy is probably fallacious,
 since the circumanal glands are almost              certainly derived from the
 epiblast.
    Hyrtle,    as  quoted    by Howes, supposed           that   the    function was
 one accessory      to reproduction, basing         his belief upon         a  fancied
 increase   in size of the organ in animals whoso oviducts contained
 eggs, and upon      his failure to detect food stuffs within              the organ.
 Howes      could find no evidence          to   support Hyrtlo's theory, and
 observes    that the identity of the structure in each sex is                a  strong
 objection to it.
    Howes,      who notices      and    discusses    these     suggestions       in an
 exhaustive paper, upholds the view that the function of the rectal
 gland is a secretory one, and concludes            from this belief, and from
 its development and          position, that it is to be compared                to the
 vermiform      appendix of other vertebrates.              In   the conclusion of
 his paper he     writes : — "In     the fact that the organ           is a secretory
  one, we have, in the long run, a further            point of agreement           with
 the   caecum coli and appendix            vermiformis.        The fact that the

60         Proceedings        of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                        [skss.
latter becomes adenoid in its most highly differentiated form, whiie
the  processus       digitiformis     is not known         to be thus constituted,
would appear to be of minor significance               by analogy with Weldon's
discovery that the suprarenal body in the Icthyopsida                         (Bdellos-
                                                                                           1
toma)    probably represents          a metamorphosed          excretory blastema
The theory seems          a plausible one, but      as  Howes nowhere refers            to
any actual work upon the structure of the organ,                    it is  conceivable
that he may not have thoroughly appreciated the distinct histo
logical difference of the rectal gland from the vermiform appendix.
The case of analogy            he   cites  seems scarcely conclusive, and              he
seems to      take for granted that the gland is secretory and not
excretory,     a  view which is upheld by no direct evidence.
   On taking       a general    view of these suggestions,        none of them are
entirely satisfactory.        It  seems unlikely that the gland is concerned
in reproduction,        as  Hyrtle supposes.       If,  as   Leydig   thinks, it is of
a  nature resembling          that of the glands of Brunner,              its glycerin
extract might bo expected              to show some digestive          action.
   The    rich blood        supply, the character of the             secreting     cells,
resembling      so  closely   as  they do the cells of the kidney, and the
occurrence       of urea in considerable         amount       in the    secretion,     all
point to the structure having an excretory function, and playing
the part of a supplementary kidney.
   When      the    peculiar richness of the blood and tissues                   of the
elasmobranchs         in urea is remembered,            this action of the rectal

       on Physiology, University           College, Cardiff.
                             (Read December       18,   1899.)
    In connection with       some investigations dealing with the velocity
of muscular       contraction under different                conditions,  I   found       it
necessary     to design     a special      apparatus       for certain experiment.-.
 It subsequently occurred          to me that, with some modification,                 this
instrument could with advantage                 be   used for various     myograpmV
purposes.       I was    thus induced to make               the  necessary    addition?
and    alterations — adapting        the instrument         for some special, as well
as   for most of the ordinary experiments in which                    a  myograph         is
 used.
                       A, Description of         the Apparatus.
    The instrument has          a   T-shaped lever          (A) turning    on   a   short
 axle   passed through the centre of the head                  and so pivoted       as to
 admit of free horizontal movements                of the lever.     To the long arm
 (if the lever is attached         a   piece of straw provided with a writing
 point which       records    its history       on    a   horizontal  cylinder.       The
 short arms have        a  number of holes into which S-shaped                    muscle
  hooks can bo inserted.          Al    a. little distance      from the support of
  the lever — at about the middle of the ebonite, plate (G) that form?
  the base or floor of the instrument there is a fixed block of ebonite
  (C) forming     a  small support for two strips of brass (B) that are
  used as clamps.       The two pieces of brass are insulated from one
  another  —  each being held on the top of the ebonite block by means
  of a pair of milled-head screws.             Just behind      the clamps there is        a
  small upright rod (F) carrying a pair of electrodes (E) that can be
  held at any level.         >Still further back and near a corner                  there
  stands   a firm     pillar (II) supporting           an electro-magnet      (M) with
   adjustments for movements              in two directions, i.e.,         the    electro
   magnet    can   be  raised    or lowered and also moved               backwards       or

hinged at the top,        and its lower end — which is provided with               a
 hook — can,       when not held by the electro-magnet,             freely swing
 forward.       The small pulley       (P) on     the opposite side    has a hole
 passing right      through the centre of the support, so that           a thread

  attached to the proximal            end    of  the   lever, stretching over the
  pulley can pass through this hole and suspend, below the instru
  ment,    a  very light scale-pan      carrying    a small weight.     The pulley
  being made on the principle of a caster, readily adapts its position
  in accordance with the movements              of the lover.    The four binding
  screws     on the top of the ebonite          plate are respectively connected

with four corresponding binding screws below the instrument ;
thus all necessary connections can be easily made even when the
upper part is covered by           a glass   moist chamber.        The   instrument       is
supported by a strong brass bracket which can be firmly clamped
on the stand by means of              a  screw (N), and is also provided with
coarse    and fine      (K) adjustments for inclining it              at a   convenient
angle.
                                          B.   Uses.
    1.   The chief purpose for which                the instrument       was    designed
was to obtain       a  method of graphic representation of the character
and velocity         of the contraction          of    frog's   muscle immediately
following       an   absolutely     isometric     stimulation.       If   a   muscle    is
stimulated — say electrically — in the ordinary                  course    of events, it
contracts.       But when         a  muscle is prevented            from     shortening
during stimulation         it undergoes       a change    of tension.      This change
of tension while the length of the muscle remains unaltered                           has
been designated by         Fick*    as isometric condition.        In my instrument
a simple contrivance has been              made for the rapid contraction of a
muscle immediately            after    its   tension     is raised under        absolute
isometric condition, or in other words, by means of single induction
shocks     I  have produced in frog's muscle a condition                     resembling
what in the       case of rapid voluntary         contraction, has been        called by

                                           method.
   For this purpose           a nerve-muscle         preparation     of frog's gastro
cnemius is supported horizontally,                 its femoral     end being firmly
clamped and the tendo Achillis fixed to the lever by means                          of   a
hook as indicated          in  fig. 2.     On the other side of the pivot the
lever is held by means of             a  very thin elastic band        (0) clamped at
one end like the muscle and attached to the lever at the other.
Although the elastic band               is able to     hold the lever in position,
keeping,      on the other side, the muscle suspended without any
laxity, it    has only a small amount of              initial  tension ; so that even
when it is fully extended, due to the movement of the lever during
contraction of the muscle, the elastic tension of the band does not

connects the armature of the electro-magnet with the lever, on the

when the armature is held in contact by the electro-magnet, any
contraction of the muscle immediately exerts                    a  pulling force on it.
   The muscle can be stimulated by its nerve placed on the
platinum electrodes (E), or directly by sticking in two pieces of

the  secondary coil.

tion of the drum the pin S touches the spring                 T and thus closes
the circuit.        The duration of the contact between the pin and the
spring can be altered by adjusting the position of the spring,                or in
other words, the time-interval between the closing and the opening
of the circuit         can thus be regulated.         The secondary coil is so
adjusted        as  to   obtain  maximal      stimulus  both    on making       and

 as soon as the pin S touches the spring             T, the circuit being com

contract, but is prevented owing, at the same time, to the arma
 ture    (K) being firmly held by the electro-magnet.              Thus isometric
 condition of the muscle is attained.             Quickly following this raising
 of the tension of the muscle the circuit is broken, and the " break

 shock again stimulates the muscle,              which   rapidly contracts with
              "
 freedom, the electro-magnet having               now ceased     to act.
     Thus we         are  able to record       on the smoked       surface of the
 revolving       drum the character and velocity of the contraction               of
 the muscle under such modified condition.                Detailed account     of   a
 series of observations        will be published    in a subsequent paper, but
 it may      be briefly     mentioned    here that by this means         a greater
 velocity of contraction          is obtained and the rate of work is also
 increased.
      2.  For isotonic contraction the electro-magnet is thrown out of the
  primary circuit, and the lever is freed from the armature by taking
  out the hook attached to the string.             The muscle is fixed as in the
  former case, and the end of the elastic band which is attached                   to
  the lever is brought        very close to the pivot, so that during con
  traction    of the muscle there will be very little extension              of the
  elastic band.         The muscle is stimulated       by  "make" or "break"
  shock — preferably         the latter — using     an  ordinary     key   for this
  purpose,    and the characteristic myogram is obtained on the smoked
  surface.
      3.  For isometric contraction the elastic band (O)          is replaced by a
   steel (spiral) spring, fig. 2,     III.,  one  end of which is fastened         to
   the brass clamp B', and the other hooked on the lever so that the
   muscle, when stimulated,           shortens against great resistance.          By
   adjusting     a screw connected with the spring the initial tension of

the     muscle     can      be varied.     The amount of tension at different
stages of contraction of the muscle can                be estimated by noting         the
extent of deviation of the writing point from the ahscissa produced
by known weights placed on a scale-pan suspended below the
instrument hy         a string tied to the muscle hook and passed over the
pulley (P).
     The pulley can be similarly utilised in experiments on elasticity
and extension of muscle, etc. Then besides most of the common
experiments on the physiology of muscle, e.g., fatigue, tetanus,
etc., the instrument can with some manipulation be used to
illustrate the action of antagonistic muscles by using                         a pair of
gastrocnemii of            the frog.
                                      0. Advantages.
     It  seems to me that, apart from the special use of the apparatus,
this form of myograph, with horizontal movements of the lever,
 has some advantage over the usual form where the lever                         moves  in
 a   more or       less     vertical  manner.       In the first place, here the
 influence      of    gravity      on    the movements           of   the lever   is nil.
 Besides, in the          case of vertically    moving levers we find that, even
 when the lever is very light and the weight attached to it is small,
 the lever, owing to its mass and moving with great rapidity, gathers
 momentum        :  in virtue of which not only             the lever tends to move
  upwards even when the contraction of the muscle has stopped, but
 also the tension of the muscle is diminished, thus seriously inter
  fering with the isotonic condition of the latter. The same thing
  happens in the opposite direction during the downward                        excursion
  of the lever,    i.e.,   it continues    to  pull down the muscle beyond its
  initial extension.           Thus the so-called isotonic curve is rendered
  untrustworthy,         as has been strenuously urged by             Kaiser.*
      In  a horizontally       moving lever, where a very thin elastic band is
  used, and the point of its attachment is close to the fulcrum, the
  slight increase of tension of the elastic band, due to its extension
  during the contraction             of the muscle,        tends     to  neutralise   the
  influence   of the momentum of the lever.

The Presence of Enzymes in Normal and Pathological
         Tissues.       By John Souttar M'Kendrick, M.D.*
                              (Read December   18, 1899.)
   The unorganised ferments or enzymes which are present in                     the
digestive juices       have    for many years occupied the attention              of
physiologists.        Although      their chemical nature is still doubtful,
yet most of their physical and chemical characters are known, and
there are methods        by which they may be extracted from the tissues
and digestive juices.             They are generally believed           to play the
most    important      part in the digestive process,          and within recent
years    physiologists and        pathologists    have    speculated as to       the
existence     of similar       substances   in   other    tissues,   and so    have
endeavoured      in many instances to offer a hypothetical explanation
of some of the changes              that occur in      tissue    cells themselves.
During     the last eighteen months         I have   endeavoured to ascertain
the    presences     or    absence    of   these   enzymes        in  normal    and
pathological      tissues    generally.      Before    describing      the  method
adopted     in carrying out this research, with the enumeration of the
tissues   examined and the results obtained,              I  shall briefly refer   to
our present knowledge of the existence of these enzymes in tissues
other than those of the digestive tract, as well as to their presence
in plants.
                 Do Enzymes Exist in other Tissues?
    Zymolysis, one of the manifestations of the digestive process,
occurs    in plants     as  well   as in animals.      We know from the           re
searches of Bernard         t that digestion in plants         is in most cases an
interstitial    one.      By that term      he meant the chemical changes
 that take place in the food stored          up in the tissues for purposes of
nutrition.      For   example,     the starch that exists in the tuber of the
potato undergoes        conversion into sugar at one period of its growth.

Many other instances could                     be cited, which      show that an inter
stitial      digestion    is being carried on in the cell structure of the
plant, presumably by enzymes                      of a nature identical with those
that exist in the digestive juices of the animal.                          The zymolysis
then of plant life is the process                  of conversion of stored up food
stuffs into new substances.                   These new substances           are formed by
the activity of the soluble unorganised ferments or enzymes.                               The
zymolytic         processes     in plants have been investigated by Green,*
 Hansen,       t Wortmann, and            others,   and it is now generally believed
 that in most plants there are at work                         enzymes      of proteolytic,
 amylolytic,        and inversive          powers.     The     papaw plant contains            a
 proteolytic        enzyme,     papain, which is very similar in its action to
 trypsin, and moreover the action of the enzyme compares favourably
 as   regards activity with those of the proteolytic ferments of animal
 origin.
      Again, it is generally admitted that the inversion of cane sugar
 (as, for example,          beetroot sugar into inverted sugar), during the
 inflorescence       of the plant, is due to an inversive enzyme.                        Many
 examples could be cited which                     show the       presence     in plants of
 enzymes similar in their nature and action to pepsin, ptyalin, and
 invertin.
      The question        presents      itself — since we are aware           that in plant
  life a zymolytic         interstitial     digestion is constantly at work — is it
  not     possible, and indeed probable, that in animal tissues as well,
  enzymes are in action             :  they may       be   of the same or        a   different
  nature, taking an active part in the metabolic processes                         occurring
  in  the individual cell        1    If  such were the case, it might account for
  the    conversion of glycogen into sugar in certain circumstances                          —
  the     conversion depending upon the activity of                    a  soluble enzyme,
  liberated,     it might    be, from a parent zymogen                existing in the pro
  toplasm       of the hepatic           cell.     Again,    it might account for           the
   abnormal       sprouting      of a parent tissue,           depending upon the in
   creased     activity of an enzyme in that tissue.                 When     a sarcoma       or
   a  carcinoma grows, is          it not possible that an interstitial digestion
   is  at -work, altering          the nutrition of the parent tissue?                    This

might account for the greater rapidity in growth of tumours                              in
certain tissues       than in others.
     The only reference in literature which                 I have   found bearing on
this subject can         be   found in Halliburton * and Sheridan Lea's f
books,      which     refer to       the   work      of   Nasse    and Briicke       more
especially.         Halliburton       says,    "Briicke has shown that muscle,
in common with most of the                 tissues   of the body, contains a small
quantity       of  pepsin   ;
                               " and

                                                  " 0. Nasse showed that muscle
juice also contains           an  amylolytic ferment, which he supposes                  to
act in the transformation               of glycogen into sugar after death.               I
 (Halliburton) have made a few experiments on this subject, and
can fully confirm Nasse's statement of the existence of this fer
 ment ; " and again, ho says, " "We have already seen that such a
ferment (diastatic ferment) can be obtained from muscle, and it
 seems that diastatic activity is present in all living proteids."
     Sheridan Lea, when writing of ptyalin, states                   : — " While occur
 ring chiefly and characteristically              in saliva,  a similar    enzyme may
 be obtained       in minute amount, but fairly constantly from almost
 any tissue or fluid of the body, more particularly in the case of
 the    pig."
      In  an article by Briicke, % entitled "Beitrage zur Lebre von der
 Verdauung," there is              a    paragraph     at the close        entitled   " Die
 verdauende Substanz im Fleische."
      This is     the   subject       evidently      referred     to    by  Halliburton,
 although       Briicke    may have described              his results more       fully in
 other papers.         He showed that the juice of flesh when treated
 with water,        and subjected           to   the same      ether and      cholesterin
  process     that   he used      in carrying        out his     experiments       for  the
  isolation    of pepsin from          the mucous membrane of the stomach,
  had decided digestive            properties.       The digestion       was noticeable
  in from five to six hours, and in the                  course   of the next day all
  fibrin had been completely digested. He confirmed his results
  by a slightly different method.                    He obtained the juice from
  4 lbs. of ox beef, and treated this               with phosphate of lime. The
  filtrate was dissolved in weak hydrochloric acid. He obtained

but even in an               ordinary         atmosphere.             This experiment proved

glycerine extract of                it,   to ascertain      whether any particular enzyme,
or enzymes, exist in the different tissues.
          Description            op       Method Adopted               in this Research.
     In    consideration              of the fact that Von Wittich's                              method of
making        glycerine extracts of tissues                     dissolved in most cases, at
least,     the enzymes            which were present                  in the tissues,             I     adopted
his method             with      slight       modification.            My object                 was     not to
determine the amount of the enzyme                                   in the tissue, but to                    see   if
it   were actually present.                      Otherwise,         the task would                    have    been
an exceedingly             difficult and laborious one, as various methods of
extraction          would have necessarily had to be followed                                          in order
to      obtain      the    enzyme           in its purest            form,        when           it   might         be
expected to show its greatest                         activity.
     All    tissues       were      subjected to the same process.                              The)' were
all fresh, except in the case of                            those      obtained             from the post
mortem           room.           The   (normal and pathological) were
                                            tissues
macerated           and put in alcohol before any putrefaction or other
 change       could       occur.            The    only      tissues     in       which           putrefaction
 might have occurred                      were    post-mortem tissues.                           The    greatest
 care      was taken in               thoroughly       cleaning         the       vessels         into which
 the tissues          were     placed,        so as    to     get     rid of extraneous germs.
 The      tissues     were     minced in           a   mincing machine, and                           afterwards
 pounded         in   a   mortar with powdered glass,                         until they              were     in    a
 fine    state of division.               They were immersed              in absolute alcohol for
 twenty-four hours.                 The alcohol was then allowed to evaporate at

 the ordinary        temperature of the room, the evaporation                    occurring
 in   a    large bell jar,      in order to prevent dust falling into the
 vessel.        The    tissues   were frequently         powdered       a   second      time
 when dry,         and they were covered over with strong glycerine,
 the quantity         of glycerine     being much in excess           of the bulk          of
the tissue.         The     vessel   was then covered with a             glass lid, and
the extraction allowed to go on for a period of six to eight weeks.
 At the expiry of that time ihe contents were filtered through
 fine muslin, pressure being exerted to squeeze out any of the
juice that remained in the               tissue,  and occasionally         a  little more
glycerine        was added to increase the quantity               of the fluid.          The
 fluid so obtained was              a perfectly    clear homogeneous fluid,              and
 was now ready for experimental                  purposes.      This method, as has
been shown by Von Wittich, is                a  satisfactory one for demonstration
purposes,       but is by no means         reliable   for research,    as the    solutions
contain enzymes            in  a far from      pure state.      Still, we know that
most enzymes are soluble in glycerine,                     and, moreover, whether
we      are    dealing     with the pure enzyme or not, glycerine does
extract it in sufficient quantity to give at all events qualitative
results when used in digestion experiments.
    The       experiments      were carried on in an incubator                  with heat
regulator, so that any required temperature could be maintained.
    The material consisted of fresh fibrin, starch solution, solution
of cane sugar, solution of 0-2 per cent. HC1, solution of                     1  per cent.
 Xa2COs,        and     the   usual    chemicals      employed     as     tests     in such
 researches.        The     starch solution      was freshly      prepared       for    each
set     of    observations.        It  consisted    of   1   grm.    of    the best      rice
starch dissolved in 50 c.c. of water.                 The cane sugar solution con
tained       1 grm. of sugar in 50 c.c. of water.               The fibrin was fresh,
and washed in running water for at least twelve                             hours before
use.
    If X       be the     name     of the extract      used,   then    X    was divided
into the following portions, and submitted to certain tests                       : —
     1.   10 c.c. of     X  were added to 20 c.c. of starch solution.                 These
                two fluids were shaken in            a  test tube.       The     test tube
                was plugged, and placed in the incubator at a temperature
                of 38°    C,  for twenty-four      hours.
                   The mixture was then tested with Fehling's solution,

              and any        reduction      was   noted.       If    there was any re
              duction, then the probability             was that sugar           had been
              formed, and the           fluid was submitted to further tests.
              To    5 c.c. of the mixture          were    added       1   decigramme      of
              phenyl-hydrazine         hydrochloride,        and     2   decigrammes       of
              sodium acetate.           The mixture        was     heated     for half-an-
              hour,    and the deposit which              formed        on   cooling was
              examined         microscopically        for      crystals       of    phenyl-
              glucosazone       and phenyl-maltosazone.*
     2.  10 c.c. of   X  were    added to     1 grm. of fresh fibrin in beaker.
              The extract was diluted             up to 40 c.c. of cold water.
              The     beaker was       covered with        a   glass lid,     and placed
              in   the   incubator      for   twenty-four        hours,     at the     same
              temperature (38° C).
                 The appearance of the              fibrin     was     noted,    and to     a
              portion of the filtered fluid was added an equal quantity
              of sulphate of ammonium, and the presence                        or absence
              of a   precipitate was observed.
     3.  10 c.c. of   X, diluted up      to 40 c.c. with a 0'2 per cent, solution
              of hydrochloric        acid, were added         to   1   grm. of fibrin in
              beaker.        The    beaker was       covered       and placed        in in
             cubator as before.
                 The    appearance        of the fibrin        was     noted, particular
             attention       being    paid to     see   whether          there was      any
             appearance        of digestion.        The biuret test was applied
             to the      filtered    solution,   and the presence              or absence
             of   a rose     pink   hue    observed.
    4.   10 c.c. of X, diluted up        to 40 c.c. with a         1  per cent, solution
             of carbonate of soda, were               added to         1   grm.   of fibrin
             in beaker.          The     beaker    was     covered        and placed in
             incubator as before.
                 The appearance         of the fibrin was noted to           see   whether
             any erosion         of   it had     occurred.           A portion of        the
             filtered     fluid   was     examined       by      the    biuret    reaction,

                The     mixture      was    tested       with    Fehling,        and     any
           reduction        noted.      As in the         case    of    1,   the phenyl-
            hydrazine       test   was frequently         applied.
   6. 10 c.c. of     X   were added to 50 c.c. of fresh milk diluted to
            100 c.c.     with water.        The mixture was stirred, covered,
            and placed in incubator.                Any special curdling of the
            milk     was noted.
   7.  10 c.c. of    X   were placed in a test tube, and put in incubator.
            The      extract    was    then    tested     with Fehling's solution,
            and any reduction            was noted.
   In order    to   compare the results of the action on fibrin by the
extract in alkaline        and acid media, with the results in alkaline
and acid media alone, confirmatory                tests    were frequently          applied
(the strengths of the solutions           of hydrochloric acid and carbonate
of soda being the same).
   By means of these tests one was able to note                   : —
   1.  The conversion of starch by               X    into a reducing           agent, and
            this probably by an enzyme similar in its action to ptyalin
            or amylopsin.
   2.  The    change      in fibrin when acted               on  by     X    in   a  watery
            solution, and the presence or absence of proteoses.
    3. The change in fibrin when acted on by                     X   in    a 0 2 per cent.
            hydrochloric        acid solution, and the presence or absence
            of peptones, the result of               the     activity of an enzyme
            similar     to pepsin.

   4.  The change       in fibrin when        acted   on by      X   in    a 1 per cent.
             carbonate of soda solution, and the presence or absence
             of peptones, leucin, or tyrosin, the result of the activity
             of an enzyme similar to trypsin.
   5.  The inversion of      cane     sugar by X into        a  reducing sugar, and
             this   probably     by an     enzyme      similar     in    its action to
             inversin.
    6. The curdling of milk, and this by               an enzyme         similar in its
             action to rennin.
    7. Whether the extract itself had any reducing properties.
      Socrces of      Error in the        Experiments,          and how these
                                  were avoided.
    1.  Length of time for extraction by glycerine —
    We know that enzymes, when present in small amount (and
they are likely to be so in the tissues), require considerable time
for their extraction by glycerine.                   Consequently, little or no
reaction might be obtained from tissues, although an enzyme                           was
present,    if the tissue were not a sufficiently long time in glycerine.
To avoid this      source of error, in all cases the tissues were immersed
in glycerine for six       weeks,    and in many      eases    for  a   longer period.
    2.  Length of     time  required for enzymic action —
    It   is of importance         to   subject    the    solutions containing the
                                                           J
 supposed enzyme         to  a   temperature of 38            C.  for   a   considerable
 time.     While     enzymes     may     exist    in   the     glycerine extract        no
 reaction may be obtained, owing to                a  deficient exposure           at the
proper     temperature      of the      mixed fluid under observation.                 To
avoid     this   cause   of error,     I  allowed     the action to go on for a
 period of from eighteen to twenty-four                 hours.
    3.  The purity of the solutions used —
    The solutions of starch and               cane    sugar      must be fresh,       and
 possess    no   reducing     properties.       Consequently,          they must        be
 always     tested    before any       observation      is   made    ;    and,   further,
 these   solutions must be         tested    after remaining in the incubator
 for twenty-four        hours.     I   have    found, in regard to this latter
 point, that a pure starch or cane sugar solution, when submitted to
 a  temperature not exceeding            40J C. for twenty-four              hours (with

76            Proceedings          of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                           [sess.
the vessel      or    test       tube    in   •which      the   solution         is contained
plugged), should possess no reducing properties at the end of that
time.     Fehling's solution must            be pure, and not alter               in colour on
boiling.     With      these      precautions we          are able to say,           definitely,
if the starch solution, plus X, reduces Fehling's fluid, that the
extract itself has reducing properties, or that the starch has been
converted      into    a    substance       that     reduces Fehling's fluid.                 The
first point is settled by testing the extract itself.                        If    this has no
reducing property, we may conclude that the starch solution                                    has
been altered by a substance which is present in X, which can
reduce Fehling's fluid.
    4. The presence         of organisms in the tissues — ¦
    This question presents itself               as we      are aware        that organisms
and their ferments              are   capable of creating            changes in         starchy
and     proteid    foods in         a   closely     similar    way      to     those      caused
by     the   unorganised           ferments      or    enzymes        that      exist    in    the
tissues.      There        are     many     chemical       tests   by     which we may
distinguish     between the two classes of ferments, such as the use
of    peroxide of hydrogen,              borax, salicylic        acid     (0-l      per cent.),
thymol      (0-5 per cent.), carbolic acid (0'5                          to    1    per   cent.),
chloroform, and others, yet we are compelled                            to admit        possible
results    depending           on    the    existence       of   an      organised         which
may be       confused         with    those     due    to   an   unorganised           ferment.
It   is necessary        to make         sure that        no organisms enter during
the preparation         of the tissues.            There must be            no putrefactive
change      in    the     tissues      under     investigation,         or    in the        fibrin
itself.    All   beakers and test tubes must be sterilised, and before
submitting their contents to the action of heat they must be sealed
and plugged.
    The    organisms         themselves        are    killed during          the     process of
 extraction and immersion in alcohol, but we have not to consider
only the organisms, as they may be capable of liberating ferments
or enzymes,        which will          be   taken up by          a   suitable        extractive.
 By the     use of antiseptics          we    avoid this difficulty.
    Although     I never        used antiseptics (as        I intended        to observe the
results on the tissues             unaltered),     I   hope in     a   future research to
compare the results           I have    obtained with those in which antiseptics
such as thymol or salicylic acid will be used.

    The only      tissues where such a difficulty       really arose were those
of the intestines of the rabbit and child, certain of the pathological
tissues,    in sputum and in the post-mortem               tissues.     In   sputum,
no doubt, pyogenic organisms exist in great numbers.                       The post
mortem tissues were removed in less than twenty-four                     hours after
death, and were at once placed in absolute alcohol.                        The other
tissues     were fresh, and were removed,            powdered, and placed in
absolute      alcohol within a few hours after their removal.
     In the    intestines putrefactive bacteria are always present,                but
 the greatest care was taken in stripping off the mucous                   membrane
 of the bowel,        and in washing it freely in running water before
 mincing and placing it in alcohol. The fibrin which                        was used
 was fresh, and contained no putrefactive organisms.
     I   admit that     no means     in the way of antiseptics have been
 used to distinguish         whether the results depended             on the    action
 of the unorganised or organised ferments             :  but    I  consider that in
 most     cases   the   results have not depended            upon the organised,
 but upon the unorganised ferments or enzymes, which play such
 an important part in the process of digestion.
      5.  The  cleavage of proteids by acids alone         —
     Fibrin    is unaltered by the action of pepsin alone,                but in the
 presence      of hydrochloric       acid rapid    digestion takes         place.     A
  weak     solution    of the acid itself has the power             of   causing    the
  fibrin to swell up and          become    translucent,      and    to   produce an
  acid albumin,        or even albumoses      and peptones.
      Do we know, then, whether the               peptones       that are produced
  in various experiments depend upon the activity of                   an enzyme      in
  conjunction with HC1, or from HC1 itself?
      The biuret reaction      is a fairly distinctive    test.
      If  pepsin has been at work, then a rose-pink coloration                 results,
  but,   if not,  a  violet coloration is produced.
      6.  The coagulation of milk —
      A    certain amount       of coagulation occurs from heat alone, but
   the coagulation which thus occurs is very different from the form
   of clot produced by the action of rennin.

    I  have drawn   out the following table to show a comparison of
results obtained in the conversion of starch into sugar by the
extracts of normal tissues.      I   have used the terms " abundant,"
"considerable," "distinct,"     etc., to denote relatively     the density of
the precipitate formed by their action in the reduction           of Fehling,
so as to give a clue to the amount of sugar formed, thus indicating,
roughly, the activity of enzyme in the       tissue extract or presumably
its amount.

     A     glance at this table shows that most of the succulent organs
and tissues            yield an extract which                    rapidly converts starch into
sugar      ;    while the drier tissues,               such as bone, cartilage, etc., yield
extracts which have no such power.                                   In       comparing the various
tissues obtained from the rabbit, child, and adult, there                                           is,   on the
whole,         a   similarity in their action.-
     Many of the           tissues        have an       X    marked           opposite.        These tissue
extracts had the power of                         reducing       Fehling themselves.   Many
tissues containing               glycogen yield          a    sugar after their death.  This
fact may account for these extracts reducing Fehling, but in most
cases the reduction      Fehling by the extract itself was slight
                                     of
as   compared with the reduction by the starch solution previously
acted on by the extract.
     The following table shows the comparison of results obtained in
the conversion of starch into sugar by the pathological tissues                                           :   —

           No Reaction,
     All       the   pathological          extracts          have    the power of               converting
starch into sugar.               Cancers and sarcomas                     do this markedly,               while
the various extracts of tissues that were examined from the patient
who suffered and died from eclampsia have                                 a    very powerful action
in this         respect.     One cannot                say    definitely        that    cancerous             and
sarcomatous            tumours            yield    extracts         which        invariably convert
starch into sugar,           as      a   sufficient number have not been examined.
The probability            is,   however, that this             is   so   ;   and, moreover, soft or
medullary carcinomata, and soft, round, or giant-celled sarcomata
will probably have               a   greater power in causing this conversion than
the hard scirrhus cancer or spindle-celled                            sarcoma.
     Why should the               tissues    in eclampsia yield extracts which have
such   a       powerful action in the conversion of starch                          1     It   is   not that
they contain more                glycogen,        as    the extract itself would                    have in

that case reduced Fehling.                  Again, it is not probable that putre
factive organisms have had to do with this result,                       as  in that case
one    would have            expected      something akin        to  tryptic    digestion,
which was           always       absent.     Is there    a  special   organism in this
disease      which     has such      a   power,   or, do the results depend           upon
the   liberation of        enzymes from the tissues in            a greater    abundance
than exist normally            ?   The tubercular sputum has            a   faint reaction
in the conversion of starch.                  This result probably        depends     upon
an    organised         ferment      that is liberated        after   death from        the
pyogenic organisms which are present                       in  such   a    sputum,    or it
may      depend upon           ptyaliu    in the saliva.

    All     tissues (normal and pathological) behave alike in yielding
 extracts which, with water alone, cause no change in fibrin ; and
 when the solution is filtered and tested with sulphate of ammonium
there is no precipitate which shows the presence of proteoses.

    All    the normal and pathological tissues have the power of more

   It will    be seen that those tissues        which have the greatest power
in digesting fibrin correspond pretty closely in the different groups,
and moreover correspond in great part to those tissues which
yielded an extract that caused abundant conversion of starch
into   sugar.

                            Liver
    These results open up two questions             : —
   (1) As the reactions are so uniformly present in the intestines,
               and in no other tissues except pancreas and liver, do the
               results depend on organisms with their liberated ferments,
               or on an enzyme that is present in the tissues of a nature
               similar to trypsin of the pancreatic juice         1
    (2) Is the proteolytic         ferment of the pancreatic juice soluble in
               glycerine, provided that the results do not depend upon
               organisms      ?
    I  do not intend           to discuss these questions here.          Still, with
 the exception         of    the large    intestine   obtained    post-mortem,       in
 which     tissue    organisms are       likely  to be    present,   I  do   not   see
 how     the other        results   can   depend    on bacteria, as      the tissues
 were in every instance cleansed in running water before extraction,
 and were absolutely fresh.             The question might have been settled
 had antiseptics been used;             consequently,    I  am unable to       oppose
 the views of Kuhne,* and his school, or to agree with those of
 Hufner, but       I  think it probable that         even   with the    use  of anti
 septics the same results would have probably occurred.
    With regard        to the second question, there is not the slightest
 doubt     that    the     glycerine    which    was    used    extracted    a  small

quantity of trypsin,         as the   extract of the pancreas dissolved fibrin
with the formation             of    peptones and       crystals     of  leucin      and
tyrosin.       Glycerine,     however, extracts trypsin          in small amount,
and    the     solution    obtained      when    placed    with fibrin       produces
only    a small quantity         of peptones,    and rarely     crystals of leucin
and tyrosin.         To obtain      a  strong solution of trypsin         one   would
have to adopt another method for its extraction, or to use a very
watery solution of glycerine.
    I do not think that it is at all likely that trypsin exists in many
of the    tissues,   and the probability       is that the proteolytic        enzyme
of the tissues is      one which is similar      in nature   to pepsin.

    In   most cases, then, the extract itself reduced Fehling and in
 almost all cases the reduction of Fehling depended on the extract,
 and not on an inversive ferment.
    The extract of the pancreas of the rabbit, however, undoubtedly
 caused inversion of the cane sugar.             This is strange, as the pancreas
 is not supposed to contain an invertive ferment.                   In no   case did    I
 obtain reactions proving the presence of inversin in the intestines.
    The tubercular        sputum rapidly inverted          cane    sugar, an action
 due probably to an organised ferment.               The result is similar to that
 obtained from yeast.            When the yeast is killed          an organised fer
 ment is liberated, which may be extracted by glycerine, and which
 inverts cane sugar into dextrose, as in the present instance.

    /, in    no instance,      obtained      a rewtion       showing      the presence     of
inversin in the intestines of the rabbit or cliild.
    Is it possible that such an enzyme is not present in rabbit or
child's intestines     ; or again,      is   it  possible    that glycerine failed         to
extract the enzyme           inversin    ?    Again, all the intestines examine,!
 yielded extracts which with 0                2   per   cent.    HC1      had a marked
 action    on fibrin.      The      same      extracts had         no   action,    or only
 doubtful action,      in alkaline solutions.            If  we lay aside the action
of organisms,         which,     if they        had   been      present,     would     have
caused digestion of fibrin in alkaline solutions, we have to conclude
that the digestion is due to               a   ferment of the nature of pepsin
 which acts in an acid medium.
    Is it not probable, then, that              a  proteolytic      ferment is secreted
by the intestinal        mucous      membrane         which      is   related closely      to
pepsin    1
    Of   course,  in physiological conditions, pepsin                  would not exert
its influence in the process of digestion, as the intestinal juice                         is
alkaline.
    We know that         a   juice is secreted        from the upper part of             the

duodenum which contains pepsin.                I  think it probable that          such
an enzyme may exist along the whole intestinal mucous tract.
    Again, it was     easy to obtain, by glycerine extraction, the enzyme
corresponding       to ptyalin    or amylopsin.       In all    cases this enzyme
was extremely active.           It is possible that in the child there is more
use   for this    enzyme    than in adults, as ptyalin          of the saliva and
amylopsin of the pancreatic juice may not                 be present in sufficient
abundance at such an early age, while in the case of the rabbit
there is a greater necessity for such         a  ferment,    as   the diet contains
so   much starch.
                       II. Extracts of tub          Stomach.
     Glycerine extracts of       the stomach     of both rabbit and child not
 only   gave    reactions showing presence          of pepsin     and     rennin, but
 also ptyalin or amylopsin.           The conversion of starcli into sugar in
 both   these cases was very marked.          I  have not noticed in any text
 book mention of ptyalin having            been obtained by extraction of the
 mucous membrane of the stomach.                This   also may be a peculiarity
 of the stomach of      the   rabbit and that of the child, but it will be
 important in future to        see  what effect   a  glycerine extract of       a well-
 washed mucous membrane of an adult stomach has upon starch.
                      III.  Extract of Rabbit's Lung.
     A very interesting result was obtained from the extract of the
  rabbit's lung.      With 40 c.c. of 0"2 per cent. HC1, the extract
  caused   1  grm. of fibrin to become totally dissolved in             a  short time.
  The same result, although in         a manner less marked,            was obtained
  from the extract of the child's lung.
     It seems strange that the lung of the rabbit should possess this
  power so markedly.          Fibrin   was digested by the           extract of the
  lung as completely     as by the extract of the stomach.            Does the lung
  then   contain pepsin in almost as active a form               a«  it exists in the
  stomach    1  The significance of this result is not apparent.
                      IV. Extracts of the Pancrkas.
     Glycerine extracts of the pancreas          of rabbit and child, and also
  of  the    pancreas from the eclamptic           case,   gave    reactions    which

86             Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                    [ses*.
showed the presence of pepsin in considerable amount.                       The fibrin
was always totally dissolved in the acid solution.               Does the pancreas
then     also   contain   pepsin?        The pancreatic juice destroys the
action of pepsin, as it is alkaline          ;  and, consequently, even though
pepsin be present, it has no influence on the digestion of food stuffs
in the intestines.       Still, it may    be prosent in the pancreas           all the
same, and only        exert its influence in certain forms of disease, or
possibly when the intestinal juice becomes acid.
                         V. Extracts         op  tiie Liver.
     Glycerine     extracts   of    the    liver    invariably      reduce    Fehling,
probably      from the conversion of glycogen into                a   reducing sugar.
In all      cases,  however,       the   reduction      obtained      by   the starch
solution, previously       acted upon by the extract, was greater than
that from the extract itself.             It   would    appear that in the liver
there is present an enzyme that corresponds to ptyalin.
     There is also present an enzyme that corresponds to pepsin.                     In
two instances, viz., liver of rabbit and human liver post-mortem,
 there was curdling of milk, produced by the action of the extract.
 In no    cases was there a reaction suggesting            tryptic activity.
                           VI. Extracts of Blood.
     A glycerine extract of the blood of the rabbit, physiologically
 normal, had no reaction in the conversion of starch into sugar.                    On
 the other       hand,   the    extract     obtained     from    the blood      of the
 eclamptic very rapidly          converted starch into sugar.
                   VII. Extracts of            Eclamptic Tissuhs.
     All  the extracts obtained from the tissues of the eclamptic had
  the power of converting starch into sugar very markedly, and also
  of   partially   digesting     fibrin,    while,   with the exception of the
  pancreas, they had no action in alkaline solutions.                  These reactions
  must depend upon an altered condition                 of tissues     in this disease,
  producing a greater quantity of active enzymes.
                  VIII.   Extract of Tubercular Sfutum.
      It is interesting   to note that a glycerine            extract of tubercular

issw-wo.]          Dr   J.  8.  M'Kendrick on Enzymes in Tissues.                        87
sputum has         a marked inversive action.               It  has a     faint power in
the    conversion of starch into               sugar    (probably      from     ptyalin    in
saliva), and in        the digestion of fibrin          in an acid medium.             Both
these reactions are slight,            as   compared      with the inversive power.
As     I    have mentioned         before,    the   result is probably due to the
liberation of an           organised      ferment from the pyogenic or other
organisms which exist in sputum after their                    death.
                    IX. Extracts of Malignant Tumours.
     The few carcinomata and              sarcomata     that were examined yielded
 extracts which converted starch into                sugar, and also which digested
 fibrin slightly in       an acid medium.
     do the        above    results depend then on the activity                         op
                                          Enzymes     ?
     This problem naturally           presents    itself, but     I fail to  see  how any
  other explanation would account for the results.                         The glycerine
  extract itself has no reaction on starch or fibrin                    unless heated to
  the proper temperature,           and kept at this temperature for                 a suffi
  cient length of time.          The extract must          he   treated    in exactly the
  same      manner     as   a solution      containing      a  pure   enzyme.        In all
  respects there is proof that when              a reaction      occurred it depended
  upon enzymic activity.             When      starch     was converted into sugar,
  this depended upon the enzyme ptyalin or amylopsin, or                          a similar
  enzyme.         When fibrin     was dissolved, and peptones were formed in
  an acid solution, then         the   enzyme     pepsin was at work          :  or, again,
  when fibrin was dissolved, and peptonos wore formed in an alkaline
  solution,      then   trypsin    was     in   action.     When       cano    sugar    was
  inverted      into dextrose, this depended             upon     the   enzyme inversin
  or a   similar   enzyme    ; and lastly, when the milk curdled, an enzyme
   similar in its action with rennin was at work.*
      To    go a step farther,     it   is probable that enzymes             do not exist
  in the tissues     as such,    but in their parent zymogens,               the enzymes
  being set free by       a suitable extractive and in suitable media.
          *
             In my original paper,   I  have discussed the questions      more fully.

88            Proceedings          of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
                                              Summary.
     In   the foregoing paper            I    have mentioned how the experiments
were performed, and how certain difficulties                                   which might lead to
fallacies could he        prevented.                  I   traced       the connection        between
enzymic activity of plant and animal life, showing                                    that probably
in the animal          as well    in the plant an interstitial digestion
                                    as
was       constantly     at work.   Although our knowledge of this
question      is still doubtful          and obscure,                 one   hopes that with the
advancement          of chemico-physiological                        science    such a result may
be confirmed, and may throw fresh                             light on the pathology of many
obscure diseases.         I    then described the results of experiments on
upwards of sixty extracts obtained by the glycerine                                    process   from
the tissues        of the rabbit,            child,       and the adult, both before and
after death.         Tables were next given of extracts of organs obtained
in   disease, and of tumours (sarcomata and caTcinomata) and tuber
cular sputum.          My results showed : —
     (1) The presence of pepsin, or a substance analogous to                                     it,   in
            all the tissues, normal and pathological.
     (2) The presence of           a   diastatic ferment in the larger proportion
              of    the tissues          examined — probably                     of   the nature       of
              ptyalin.
     (3) The absence of trypsin in the tissues, except in the pancreas.
              Reactions        which           may            have     depended       upon    trypsin
              occurred in the intestines and in certain of the organs
              obtained post-mortem.
     (4) That tissues which normally contained much                                          glycogen
            formed an extract which reduced Fehling.
     (5) That pepsin     present to
                              is       marked extent in the lung and
                                                          a
            liver of the rabbit as well as in the stomach.
     (6) That the intestines contained    proteolytic ferment of the
                                                                a
            nature of pepsin.  This result differs from that of most
               authorities.
      (7) That an inversive ferment was not obtained by the glycerine
               process of extraction              from the intestines of the child or
               rabbit.
      (8) That an inversive            ferment was rarely present in the tissues.

               It   was    distinctly   present in the extract of tubercular
               sputum.
     (9) That      a  milk ferment, apart from          those tissues    in which it is
               known to exist, was rarely present.
   (10) That        the cancerous        and sarcomatous         tissues   which   were
               examined had proteolytic and                distinctly    diastatic  pro
               perties.
   (11) That rabbit's blood contained                no diastatic enzyme,      whereas
               eclamptic blood did.
   ( 1 2)  That      all the tissues      from the     case   of eclampsia      yielded
                extracts which had marked diastatic properties, although
                these themselves       did not reduce Fehling.
      In  conclusion,      I  may add that only a limited           number of tissues
 have been examined,             and that, before any final conclusions can be
 made     as to the wide distribution          of pepsin and ptyalin or amylopsin
 in physiological and pathological tissues, it would be                    necessary  to
 examine similar tissues of many animals of the same                      and dill'erent
 species to      see  if all  behave alike.
      I  cannot     but entertain the hope that the examination of the
  blood in      obscure      diseases, and of carcinomatous and sarcomatous
  growths (with         a view of ascertaining the presence              or absence of
  enzymes),       may throw         light   on   the   pathology and aitiology of
  certain   diseases      and morbid growths.

                         (Read February 5, 1900.)
                               (Abstract.)
   In this paper a discussion of the mode of description of the linear
paths in the (log    6, n) diagram
                                    — described in previous papers —
was given.     It was shown that the assumption that fatigue was
induced by oscillation of a wire enabled one, in almost all cases, to
predict accurately the mode of description         of these   paths.    In a
few cases, however, when the condition        of the wire was such that
the critical angle fell within the range of experimentally        observed
angles of oscillation,  the mode of description       of the linear paths
agreed with the supposition      that  oscillation    diminished   fatigue.
The truth of this supposition     seemed   also to be confirmed by the
observed rate of decrease of oscillations in these cases; but further
experimental evidence is required to fully test the point.

Observations on some Nemerteans from Singapore.
       By B. C. Punnett, B.A.                 Communicated by Dr A. T.
       Masterman.
                              (Read May 7, 1900.)
    The Nemerteans which form the subject of this communication
were    collected   by Messrs F. P. Bedford           and W. F. Lauchester
during    a   year's stay in      and  near Singapore.         The number of
species   procured     is ten, nine     of   which have not hitherto        been
described.       These    are  Eupolia     pholidota,     Gerebratulus    nutans,
 C.  brunneus, C. robustus,        C. insignis,   C. erythrus,      C.  sordidus,
C. vlatiformius and C. b&lfordii.           The species previously known is
Eupolia      quinquelineata     (Burger),     but  for   reasons   given it has
been considered desirable to change          the name to    E. melanogramma.
A   careful examination of these forms has led to tlie following facts
and conclusions of more general interest:          —
    (1)  In    one  form    (E.   melanogramma)         the excretory     system
possesses    ducts which place its cavity in communication             with that
of the alimentary canal.         The usual ducts       to the exterior are also
present.      Consequently     the alimentary     canal in this region (i.e.,
shortly behind the mouth) is placed in communication with                     the
exterior by means of the excretory system and its ducts.                  Such  a
condition     seems   to find its closest parallel     in  the gill slits of the
Chordata.
    (2) In Eupolia plwlidota the excretory ducts reach back into
the intestinal region, thus co-existing in the same region as the
series of gonidial ducts.        Such  a condition has not previously been
noted in the group, and, taken in conjunction with the fact that the
histology of the two ducts is different, seems to show that they are
not serially homologous.
    (3) In the genus Eupolia, the lateral nerve stems may either
form a commissure above the anus, or else below, or even may
terminate without forming a commissure at all.               Such a fact tends
to make      one cautious in accepting the         primitive   nature, in such

92           Proceedings   of Royal Society of Edinburgh.               [skss.
forms as Peripatus and Chiton, of the supra-anal commissure upon
which some writers have laid considerable stress.
    (4) In the Lineidae examined considerable variation occurs in
the range and topography of the excretory system, as well as in
the number of ducts.      In none of the forms studied is to      be   found
 that incipient metamerism in the arrangement        of the ducts which
 some observers claim to have demonstrated       for other   species.
    (5) The vascular system of the Lineidas shows but very little
 variation in the different species, except in so far as in the p> e-
 cerebral region there may be either a well-marked head loop, or else
 a vascular network   — a fact already pointed out by Burger.            It  is
 worthy of note that there appears to be some correlation between
 the caudal extent of the excretory system and the point of exit of
 the dorsal blood-vessel from the proboscis sheath.         This   vessel   in
 all the   species here examined     (with the exception of one case
 where the preservation was unsatisfactory for the determination of
 this point) leaves the sheath within    a  few micro-millimetres     of the
 hinder termination   of the excretory system, wherever that may be

    The first    traces    of the special functions         now known as alter
nating functions are said by Cauchy to be discernible                        in certain
work of Vandermonde's ; and if we view the functions                        as origina
ting in the study of the number of values which                       a function    can
assume through          permutation      of its variables,*      such an early date
may    in  a certain sense be justifiable.         To all intents and         purposes,
however,      the theory is a creation of Cauchy's,                and   it is almost
absolutely certain that its connection with determinants was never
thought of until his time.

    It  may be remembered that Schweins'                      large volume        contains
seven    separate    treatises, that the third treatise deals with deter
minants (Producte mit Versetzungen), and is divided into four sec
tions (Abtheilungen).          The first of the four almost entirely concerns
general determinants, and consequently an account of                       it has already
been given.        The second section (pp. 369-398) now falls to bo
undertaken, its heading being

which is seen to be an extension of one of Cauchy's                       ;  but, besides
this, in the first chapter there is practically nothing worth noting.
    The remaining four chapters, however, are full of interest, and
deserve every attention, as until the present day they have been
utterly lost sight of and contain a theorem or two which are                           still
quite new.
    The   second    chapter concerns the multiplication of an alternant

variables in their //"' power.             In Schweins' notation this product

      The third is where the                series   of indices consists of two pro
  gressions proceeding by the common difference h, and where, of
  course, there are fewer vanishing terms in the product.
      In  the next chapter the subject matter is quite similar                     :  in fact,
   the only difference is in the constitution                 of the multiplier,         which
   is more extensive           than     before      by   reason   of  the fact that] in
   forming the p-ary combinations                  there is now no restriction as to
   non-repetition     of an element.            Thus, instead of the example

Each result is     seen,   as in the preceding       case,    to be a sum      of
alternants differing     only in the indices from the alternant            which
is the subject of multiplication.        Further, it is observed that        this
difference is a difference in excess, the indices of the multiplicand
appearing    in   all the terms of the product,             so   that  the  only
difficulty is to ascertain what addendum is to be made to each.
The next observation is that the addendum is a multiple of h, and
that in the three cases the multiples are the following : —

 The law of formation seen by Schweins            in   these   coefficients of fi
 is to be gathered from the sentence        :

 is nothing    more nor less      than   the solution       of the problem     of
 putting   p things in every possible way into n compartments.

 coefficients would    be

           The fifth and last chapter (pp. 395-398) concerns the simplest
       form of alternant above met with, viz., that in which the indices
       proceed throughout by a common difference, the main proposition
       being regarding the resolvability               of the alternant          into binomial
       factors.       The property with which Cauchy and almost all later
       writers start is thus that with which Schweins ends.                            The mode
       of proof is interesting          from its farfetchedness and ingenuity,                  but
       need     not be given in        full generality or in the original notation                  :
       the case of laWcrd3] will suffice.
           The first step, then, is to select         a  row, say the last, and express
        the alternant        in terms of the elements of this row and their
        complementary minors.              In this way we obtain
                  \a°bWcP\
                                = (P\a°bh2\    -  d*\aWcS\    +   rf|a°W|

    As has     been    already shown,        Sylvester's     first approach to the
subject of determinants           was similar    to Cauchy's, the bases of both

where    £-r implies that after 'zeta-ic' multiplication the subscripts
are   all to   be diminished               by r.
     His attempted generalisation of this theorem has likewise been
spoken of, its validity, however, being left undecided upon.                                                            Instead
 of the multiplier Sr(abc .                  . .   I)   he proposed to take any                                       symmetric
function whatever of o,                      b,    c,   .    .       .,       Z,

been a most noteworthy                      extension which Schweins                                         had not fore
seen, but unfortunately                    there are grave doubts as to the truth                                                 of
it,  — indeed,     one may go so far as to say that there would                                                              be no

take the case where the multiplier of                                                 la'/A-VI         is   the symmetric

question as to what amount of truth                    there      is in the       theorem      as
enunciated, and whether an amendment of the enunciation would
not give something not merely unexceptionable                            but of important
value.
      In  trying to pass from symmetric functions like 2a, 2«&,                           'S.abr,
.   .   . which    are linear in regard         to each of the             variables,    and to
extend the theorem to any symmetric function, Sylvester probably
 thought     — at  least it would    be quite natural              for him to do         so — of
expressing the latter in terms of the former and then applying the
theorem already obtained.              It   is desirable,        therefore,      to see what
 such a process        may   lead  to.    Taking         the case        of the multiplier
 2a2/>c we have
       tftW|     . 2a2^c   =
                               |aWd4|      .  {2a    . Xabc     -  iSabcd}       ,

 At this point       we encounter a difficulty,            for the previous theorem,
 although it teaches us to multiply               ;a162f3a'4|     by    2a/>, does     not help
  us in     the case where the multiplicand                 is ]a]b-c:'d:''.     Proceeding,
 however, with other assistance we find the product
                       =
                          |a2&w-| +    i«v,w;         - iyvcwi            ,

                          |aWd«l    - 3|aWds;          ,
  agreeing of course       with what has already                been found.            Now the
  difficulty referred to would present             itself to .Sylvester           also, but in
  a   slightly different form by reason of the periodicity which                              he
  assumes in the elements.          Thus, instead of writing
                      {\aWchI*\.2a}%abc
                                                 =

  he would write
                                                   = t{£-iPD(Qal>cd).%(,tbrd)}
    £{£PD(0a&cd). Seabed) }.S3(abcd)
  and there pause for a little, not having specifically provided for the
  'zeta-ic' multiplication       of such an expression as                 £_iPD(0aW)          by

single term

which in modern notation is
                                    |as6W|      .
In the  course of the work, therefore, the term la'&Vd6!                  would   be
dropped altogether out of sight.           The     cause of this is    undoubtedly
the  imposition    of the condition                               —
                                          just mentioned ; indeed, if we
take the result of the work as above performed                      in the modern
notation, viz.  : —

                         cfi,be,<*,d«   =  a\b\c\cP,
the first alternant will vanish by reason of having two indices alike,
and we shall be left with a result agreeing with Sylvester's.
   The conclusion, therefore, which we              are tempted to draw is      that
if Sylvester's    general theorem         be   correct      it is only when the
elements are subjected to periodicity.

 rather hurriedly, he consequently               finds that the development                   of

 interchange of any pair causes the aggregate                      of all the terms to

    In  passing,    he remarks on the large number                 of vanishing         terms
in the development of the product, viz.,                      2Wn-1)-n!,            and the
consequent desirability          of obtaining this development                from that of
the determinant and not vice versa.

the preceding by cyclical permutation of the suffixes, and that the
signs are all + when the number of elements                                         is odd, and alter
nately + and           -   when the number of elements                             is even.          The        case
of Laplace's expansion-theorem, which is                                 here used, is easily seen

 than Jacobi's above referred to,              say    the case where there are sur
elements,     a0,  av a2, . . ., a6.           According to the rule, what we
have got to do at the outset is to form the term

    From    this general theorem regarding the difference-product                          of

 in all probability        the same      as  before,   viz., Laplace's expansion-
 theorem.       The most general form of the latter theorem,                 it will    be
 remembered,       gives an expansion in terms of products               of more     than
 two minors.        Jacobi   was familiar with this, for in his famous funda
 mental memoir regarding general determinants a whole page (pp. 298,
 299) is devoted       to an illustration     of it.   Now,   if  we take the case
where the number of minors is three, and apply it to the determi
 nant which is the equivalent of the difference-product,                   we obtain a
 result which is transformable without difficulty               into

to.
    Jacobi then      proceeds to the consideration of alternating functions
in general.
    The    definition      which     he    gives,   and to    which       he   attaches
Cauchy's name, is somewhat different from Cauchy's, being                         to the
effect that   are   alternating function in one which, by permutation of
its variables,      is either not changed at all, or is changed only in
sign.
    In   the matter of notation           he also introduces a variation, but
this time with more success.               It will   be remembered          that, when
Cauchy denoted           a  determinant       by prefixing     S+      to the typical
term, he was simply following             his practice in regard        to alternating
functions in general, which he denoted by
 where P stands for the product of the differences               of a,b,c,      .  . .,1;
and    as the  P   which is inside the brackets is subject to permutation
of its variables, and         therefore automatically,        as   it   were, changes
sign    with every      interchange of       a  pair of variables,       while the      P
which is outside         the  brackets remains        unaltered,     it is   clear that

This is the last result of the memoir, the few additional lines
used being merely for the purpose of showing how the deter
minant      just mentioned                may be         simplified.            The    simplification
consists in leaving out the element a„ in forming                                    the C's of the
second     row from the end, the elements n„, an_, in forming                                      the
C's of the third row from the end, and so on.                                    The reason in the
first case is that this             will   have    the same effect as subtracting from
each    element of the row aa times the corresponding                                     element of
the last row, and the reason                    in other         cases is similar.           If C    be

      As    has before been pointed out, the preceding                                                        paper of Jacobi's

noted in this connection that the degree                                                                 on        the one side is                            - n,

symbol of summation and the mode of determining the sign of each.
     Jacobi's answer                       to this            is      to the effect                 that he would prefer                  to

 As has     been stated       Jacobi confined himself              to a mere enunciation
 of his theorem      :   in fact, the two Latin            sentences   just given contain
 all that    he has said      in regard to it.
    The object of the present paper                is to draw attention to a            totally
different mode of formation of the terms of the expansion, and to
establish the accuracy of both modes.
    (3) Each term of the expansion, it will have been noted, consists
of two parts, (1) a set of linear binomial factors, (2) a single non
linear factor.        "What we therefore require is                 a rule for finding the
various     sets of    linear factors,       a rule      for deriving the single non
linear factor from the           set   of linear factors to which it is attached,
and a rule of signs.
    Now to find the various              sets of linear       factors we have only to
                                                                                                    /

write out in the usual triangular          form the £n(ra     - 1) differences of
the elements, view        the    differences thus arranged as being the
elements of     a Pfaffian, and then take the terms of this Pfaffian.
For example, in the      case of Q(abcd) we form the Pfaffian
                           | b -a c-a d-a
                                       c-b      d—b
                                                d-c
the expansion of which is
            (b-a)(d-c)        - (r-a)(d-b)          + (d-a)(c-b):
and this is exactly Jacobi's expansion with the non-linear                 factors
left out.    Again, in the case of Q(abcdef) we form the Pfaffian
                   \b-a c-a d-a e-a                      /- a
                              c-b      d—b       e-b f—b
                                       d-c       e-c f—c
                                                 e-d     f-d
take the expansion of      it
   [b -a)[d -«)(/-*)   -  (b-«)(c-c)(f-d)        +  (b-a)(c-d)(f-c)
and all that remains in order to obtain Jacobi's expansion is to
annex to each term the appropriate non-linear factor.
    No separate rule of signs, it will         be observed, is necessary,      the
signs of the expansion of the auxiliary Pfaffian being exactly the
signs of Jacobi's expansion of the difference-product.
    (4) Let us now look at the mode of formation of the non-linear
factor.
    In the  case of Q(abcd) and the case of Q(ahcdef) the types are
                         cW    +  aV?,
                         cW/* + c4ci4es/2        +  ....;
and these, we fortunately        observe,    resemble determinants, and are,
in fact, found to   be the permanent.?

  When, therefore, any one of the sets of linear binomial factors has
  been obtained, we have only to take the product of the elements in
 the first factor, the product                 of the elements in the second factor,
 and so on     :   raise these products in order to the 0th, 2nd, 4th
 powers and form an alternant-like                     permanent having these powers
 for the elements of the diagonal.
    (5) The theorem in its new form thus is                          : —
    Tlie difference-product of 2n                  elements         may       be expressed         as an
 aggregate of (2n - 1) (2n - 3) ... 3                  . 1 terms,         which are obtainable
 by  taking      the     ordinary expansion of               the     Pfaffian whose elements
 are   the    n(2n     -   1)   differences      arranged          in tfie usual triangular
fashion, and           then    annexing to each             term       of this expansion an

      The theorem is thus fully established.

ascending order.
      (7) On account of the co-existence                               of two rules for obtaining the
same        development, one of which                          is   the rule for the expansion of                            a
Pfaffian,           it      follows    that the           other rule, Jacobi's,                    must contain
within         it    the substance         of the Pfaffian definition.

    (8) A similar definition of       a determinant          is at once suggested,
 viz.,
    One term of the determinant           j a,b2c3   . . . zn [   it  + ajb2c3   . . . zn :
this is increased    to two by the        cyclical permutation              of n   - 1,   n
accompanied by change of sign : these two are increased to six (i.e.
2 x 3) by the cyclical permutation of n            -  2, n   -  1, n icithout altera
tion of sign   :  then   these six      are increased           to   ticenty-four     (i.e.
2x3x4,      by the   cyclical     permutation        of n    - 3,     n  - 2,  n—   1,    n
accompanied by change       of   sign : and so on.
    Thus, the first term of    |  alb2cidi   | is
                                   + «A<y74<

                                    - a1bic4d3    ;
then by cyclical permutation          of 234 without change of sign we
derive from the former
                          + afi.jC^d.,    + a^bjCjJs,
and from the latter
                          -  a^sCslj       -   aj?)4c3(f., ;
and lastly by cyclical permutation of 1234 and change of sign there
is derived from these six the remaining eighteen                   :
    As before, the total number of                 terms,     viz.,     l-2'3 . . . n,    is
brought   very clearly into evidence.

         On certain Aggregates of Determinant Minors.
                     By Thomas Muir, LL.D.
                                                   (Read     March      5,   1900.)
  (1) Two curious identities have been established regarding
certain aggregates of minors of special determinants ; the firs:,
which concerns antisymmetric                                 determinants, having been discovered
by Kronecker                     in 1882,* and the second,                                which concerns       centp>
symmetric               determinants, having been published by me in                                           1888.7
When         we come to                      think of the possibility of generalising                            these
identities, it is readily seen that there are at least two lines                                                       of
attack which suggest themselves on reading the mere description
of the       kind of identity ; for, in saying that the                                                     identities
deal     with " an aggregate of minor determinants of a                                                  special     de
terminant,"              we are conscious                        of two points of limitation                   in    the
description, the one signalised by the word                                               "minor" and       the other
                 word        " special."              If, therefore,             an identity         were
by the                                                                                                       obtained
regarding an                     aggregate           of which           the      terms        were     determinant-
unrestricted by                      a   family relationship, we might have one form                                   of
generalisation               ;    and        if,   while retaining the family relationship,                           we
succeeded in removing the restriction as to the form of the parent,
a   generalisation of                    a   different type might                    be   the result.
     The former of these lines of attack                                              have     followed up       on
                                                                             I I

previous occasion                    ;   in the present paper                        take the latter line.
  (2) Kronecker's theorem,                                 it    will   be remembered,            is   to the effet;

difference.            This being grasped, there then only remains to                                                                be

triangle of elements we at once observe that in each of the left-
to-right      lines of the triangle the signs are alternately positive and
negative, and that so also are the first signs of the various rows
taken       in order.                  If       in addition               to this we only note the fact
that as we thus move from place to place in the triangle, there
is a corresponding                          alteration           in the sum of the indices of the
binomial          factors,              we          see     that          the determination                        of the sign
of any term can be made dependent                                                         on the difference between
the sum of                  the    indices of               its binomial                       factor and the sum of
the indices of the first binomial factor of all.

    This       theorem,       in so far          as       it    concerns the present subject,                                             may

   The investigation     was undertaken to find out in what way the
activity of the salivary ferment varied in different             diseased    con
ditions of the body.
   In   order to eliminate     the   fallacy which might arise from the
hourly variation in the diastatic power of the secretion, the experi
ments    were always     performed       at  the same     hour each     evening.

slightly warm water, and, during the succeeding half hour, all the
saliva which he secreted was received into             a vessel and measured.
Two cubic centimetres of the saliva were then mixed with               ten cubic
centimetres of starch mucilage at the temperature of 38°                  C,  and
the mixture was then kept at this temperature for ten minutes.
At   the end of this period the condition of the starch present was
noted, and further action of the ferment was prevented by rapidly
boiling the mixture.       The amount of sugar which had been formed
by the ptyalin was then estimated by titration against standard
Fehling"s solution.
    Above   one   hundred     cases    of   disease   of  various   kinds were
investigated,   in order   to see if the activity of the salivary ferment
had undergone any change.
    Gastro-intestinal  Disorders.   — Twenty-one        cases were examined.
The average amount of sugar formed in               these was 0*089     gramme
(the normal average being taken as 0-080).                  In chronic gastric
catarrh this figure varied from 0078 to 0"1                 gramme.      In acid
dyspepsia the amount of sugar formed is above the healthy average,
while in ulceration of the stomach, the amount is generally only
slightly below the normal       average.       In dilatation of the stomach,
the salivary ferment was found            to be almost     absent, or at least
inactive.     In cirrhosis of the liver the amount of sugar is not
reduced, and in some cases it is greatly increased.
   Pulmonary     Diseases.  — In   these    diseases   generally  the salivary

ferment is fairly active, and on an average 0"087 gramme of sugar
is formed.      In phthisis the ferment is present in normal amount.
and in pneumonia the amylolytic          power of the saliva is ahove the
normal during the period preceding the crisis, but lower after this
•event.
    Heart   Diseases. — In  the large group of heart cases the saliva
retains its usual composition,        and the amount        of sugar formed
hovers at or about the normal limits.
    Nervous    Diseases. —A    larger    proportion     of  subnormal      cases
occurred in this group, fully 41 per cent., giving a proportion                of
sugar lower than the normal          average.      In  one case of     cerebral
tumour, the saliva, though copious in amount, contained practically
no converting      ferment; whereas in       a   case  of locomotor     ataxia,
though     the secretion was equally       copious,    the salivary    enzyme
produced the large amount of        O'lll  gramme.
    Havrwpoietic System.    — Of   three cases of Addison's        disease   ex
amined, the saliva of two showed marked               deficiency in diastatic
 power, while the third exceeded the normal limit.
    Renal Diseases.   — The group of      diseases    of the kidneys     shows
 generally a lower average than the normal.            In  55*5 per   cent the
 quantity of sugar produced was considerably below the average.
    In  diabetes the saliva has a very active converting          power.      In
 three out of four cases examined, the average              amount of sugar
 formed was much above the standard figure.
    In simple aiiivmia the converting ferment         seems to be present      in
 the saliva in its normal       amount.      If,  however,    the anaemia     be
 associated   with dyspepsia, the average is subnormal.
    In  Sub-acute and Chronic Rheumatism           the ferment exists    in its
 normal amount.
    In   general febrile   conditions   the secretion of saliva is greatly
 reduced in amount, and this reduction increases             pari passu with
 the increase in temperature.       This scanty secretion     seems, however,
 to possess increased amylolytic power.

    Gastric Diseases.  — In most    cases of acid     dyspepsia   the amount
 of saliva secreted is above the normal.         In  chronic   gastric catarrh

the quantity is hardly up to the average,           and the same is seen in
ulceration of the stomach.         In  those cases associated      with  diarrhoea
or ascites the secretion is often far below the normal.
     Pulmonary     Diseases.  — In bronchitis and in        the early stages      of
pneumonia the secretion           of saliva   is   generally up to the          full
average, and may even exceed it.            In chronic phthisis         the secre
tion of saliva is always very scanty.
     Cardiac Diseases.    — The salivary secretion        is almost constantly
diminished when the heart affection is of           a grave    character.
     Nervous Diseases.    — In affections of      the   cord,   the quantity of
 saliva secreted reaches, and even         surpasses, the average         amount.
 In the case of cerebral tumours the reverse is found, however.
     Renal Diseases.   — In chronic Bright's         disease,   the   secretion   is
 generally    scanty.
     In simple     anaemia,   in the  chronic    forms of rheumatism            and
 in Addison's     disease, the amount of saliva secreted         is subnormal.
     In fevers generally, when        the  temperature is at all high, the
 secretion   is lessened    in amount, though the amylolytic              power is
 increased.
     In many    cases where the secretion is scanty the diastatic power
  is  likewise   feeble,  and, on the contrary,       whore the secretion is
  copious its proteolytic power is also great.

On Tetrdbothrium torulosum and Tetrabothrium auriculatum.
       By Dr O. von Linstow, Gottingen.                      Communicated by
       Sir John Murray, K.C.B.

   In                                                                " Challenger "
        my report on the Entozoa, brought home by the
expedition,     I described    two new species as Tetrabothrium           torulosum
{from Diomedea bracliyura) and Tetrabothrium                 auriculatum (from
Thalaweca glacial is and Daption capensus).*                    My descriptions
have recently been subjected           to adverse criticism       by Fuhrmann,t
who maintains that these two species do not belong to the genus
Tetrabothrium,       but to the genus Prosthecocolyle          ;    that Tetraboth
rium auriculatum          is  identical   with    Tetrabothrium        (Amphotero-
cotyle) elegang-heteroelitum,       Diesing  ;  that these    two Cestodes are
not TetrabothHa        but typical Tamiw     ;  that my drawing of the scolex
of Tetrabothrium         torulosum does not correspond with the actual
relations   ;  and that      my representation      of   the masculine       genital
organs of Tetrabothrium           auriculatum is inaccurate.
    With reference to the genus to which the two                 species are to be
referred,    I certainly   could not place them in the genus Prostheeo-
cotyle,   for my description         appeared     in the year         1888,     while
Prosthecocotyle       of Monticelli, and       the synonymous          genus Both-
ridiotomia      of Lcinnberg,      were   founded      in  1896.        The    genus
Tetrabothrium        was known to me by two species               :  Tetrabothrium
cylindraceum, Bud., and Tetrabothrium               macrocephalum, Bud., the
two typical       species   upon which Budolphi, about a hundred                years
ago, founded       the genus Tetrabothrium,        and as the two species           in
question      agreed    in all essential      points    with the two          species
described by Budolphi,          I placed  them in the genus Tetrabothrium.

 Tcenice;   the scolex carries four large sucking cups,                which touch
each other     with their      edges completely or partly, and are drawn
in front or behind into an angle             ;  the proglottides     are short, the
genital    openings are        marginal     and      unilateral, and pass into a
genital sinus with         strong muscular walls, on the inner                 side    of
which lies the round cirrus-pouch.                 The vas deferens is rolled up
in numerous coils;         the   parenchyma muscles, especially the longi
tudinal     muscles,     are strongly     developed, and on each side               two
longitudinal      vessels   join together       ;  the ovarium     is strongly       de
veloped,     the   small oviduct      lying before it. This is briefly the
diagnosis of the genus, as          given by me * when describing Tetra
bothrium cylindraceum, and it corresponds perfectly with Monti-
celli'8 genus Prosthecocotyle and with Lonnberg's Bothridiotcenia;
the genera Prosthecocotyle,         Monticelli,       and Bothridiotcenia,       LiJnn-
berg,   are thus synonyms          of Tetrabothrium,        Rudolphi,     and as the
last-mentioned name has priority, Fuhrmann                  is mistaken in believ
ing that the two species           described by me           belong to the genus
Prosthecocotyle,      for they must be placed in the genus Tetrabothrium                 .
    Fuhrmann,       in his description        of Tetrabothrium,       says  : — " The
interpretations of the male sexual apparatus given                 by Linstow        are
inexact," yet my description of the male organs is limited to the
sentence: — "The cylindrical            cirrus is protruded        to   a  length of
0-082    mm., and is 0 016          mm.     in breadth,"       which    is  perfectly
correct.     Fuhrmann        further   says that my representation              of the
scolex    of Tetrabothrium torulomm               does not correspond with          the
actual relations, but      I  maintain, on the contrary, that having pre
pared my drawings          carefully with the aid of the drawing appa
ratus,  it must    be assumed     that they really show the actual relations.
I  forbear to express an opinion regarding Fuhrmann's                  drawings.
    Fuhrmann      finally says that my drawing of Tetrabothrium                   auri-

                                (Abstract.)
    This part of my memoir on the crania of the people of India is
especially occupied with a description of the hill tribes in the
Lower provinces of Bengal and the                Central   provinces.      It  is
based on an examination       of a number of crania, the majority of
which were placed at my disposal by the authorities of the Indian
Museum,      Calcutta.    Some   belonged to tribes speaking dialects
of the    Kolarian group of      languages    ;   others of the     Dravidian
group.
   The Dravidians were represented         by skulls of the Gond, Oraon,
Paharia, Kharwar, Khand, Nagesar, Korwa and Bhuiya                     tribes    ;
the   Kolarians by skulls of    the    Munda or Ho, Bhumij and Turi
tribes,
   In addition,   a few skulls of the Ahfr-Goala,         Kamar, Lohar and
Teli castes, and two crania ascribed        to the tribe of Juangs came
under observation.      A  number of skulls from Orissa, belonging to
Uriya-speaking people, were also described.
   The skulls of the Dravidians and Kolarians           were compared      with
each other,   with the object of testing their bearing        on the opinion
expressed    by   Mr H. H. Risley,     based    upon observations on, and
measurements      of, about 6000    living   persons,    that the differences
between these two groups are only linguistic, and do not represent
differences   in physical type.      The comparison was based on the
study   of seventeen Dravidian skulls and nineteen belonging to
Kolarian tribes, and the conclusion was drawn that                they corre
sponded   in essential particulars.    In both, the form     and proportions
of the    cranium    were  dolichocephalic     ;  the anterior nares       were
platyrhine,    or in the higher     term of the mesorhine group          ;   the

upper jaw was orthognathous, only one specimen was prognathous ;
as a rule the orbit was low or microseme      ; the palato-alveolar    arch
 was brachyuranic,    and the face was short in relation     to its width.
The cranial characters therefore supported the conclusions drawn
by  Mr Risley from the examination of living       persons.
   The skulls of the Kamar,        Ahfr-Goala and Teli    castes also  pos
sessed  Dravidian characters.        The Lohar skull again, from         its
leptorhine nasal index, showed an Aryan feature.
   The crania of the Uriy&-speaking       people had mixed characters,
as if there had   been   an intermingling of Aryans with Hinduised
aborigines, and possibly traces of a brachycephalic stock.
   A comparison was made between the Dravidian skulls and those
of the aboriginal Australians.       Although both   are  dolichocephalic
and platyrhine,    yet   in   many other respects,   more especially      in
their greater absolute length,      their more roof-shaped     crania, the
degree of    projection   of the glabella,   the depressed    nasion,   the
prognathic    upper jaw, the elongated palate, and the coarse, large
teeth, the Australians     differed from the Dravidians in important
character.0.

                                      (Read    February 5, 1900.)
   Although               the action of potassium            persulphate on silver nitrate
solution was one of the first persulphate reactions                                observed
                                                                                (vol.
xviii. p. 64),            I   had not until lately paid any special attention to the
behaviour of the ammonium salt in this respect.                               It    appears, how
ever, that           in       the latter case there         are additional        actions of great
interest, not possible with the potassium salt.                         A general description
of these will be given now, but there are still some points deserving
of further investigation.
   When solutions of                   potassium      persulphate and silver nitrate are
mixed, a black precipitate slowly forms, and this precipitate exhibits
all the characteristics of silver peroxide.                           Apparently          silver per
sulphate(which we may assume to be formed, to a certain extent,
by double decomposition) is decomposed by water, like so many
other silver salts of sulphur acids, by abstraction of S03 to form
sulphuric acid.
                                Ag2S208 + 2H..0 =       2   H,S04 + Ag.,0,.
In    course of time the precipitate decomposes                             and    dissolves          with
evolution        of oxygen.
     When ammonium                     persulphate solution            is   mixed        with     silver
nitrate solution a similar result is seen, but only to a slight extent.
 Although there is very little deposition of peroxide,                              there       is,   how
ever,      a    considerable amount of decomposition,                        as    shown by the
formation            of sulphate and free acid in the liquid.                       If   ammonia        is
 added to the mixed salt solutions there                       is   no separation        of peroxide,
 but there       is
                 a            much more rapid formation of sulphate accompanied
 with brisk           effervescence.          These reactions can be easily                 followed
 by     starting          with    a   pure persulphate solution and adding barium
 Ditrate along                with the other    reagents.
      As   it   is   known that silver peroxide oxidises ammonia to nitrogen,

the above-mentioned               effervescence    was    presumably     due     to   the
escape of the       latter gas.        To  test this, ammonium persulphate              in
considerable quantity was dissolved in strong ammonia solution                            ;
a   small flask was filled almost completely with the solution,                     some
silver nitrate added,            and an     india-rubber stopper with delivery-
tube fitted to the flask, so that the evolved gas might be collected
in   a vessel   over water.          The evolution of gas began at once              and
increased     rapidly    ;   at the same time the        temperature of the liquid
rose, and soon the action became                violent.    Ultimately    the stopper
and fittings were driven out, and most of the liquid blown out of
the flask.
     The first quantities of gas had              been allowed      to escape,     after
which sufficient for examination was secured                 before the unexpect
edly sudden termination of the experiment.                   The sample contained
a mere trace     of oxygon, the presence of which was almost certainly
due to the method            of collection.
     The quantity of silver salt employed in this experiment woukl
amount to only         a   few centigrams, and it is therefore evident that
the silver must         oscillate very rapidly        between the two stages of
oxidation in order to cause such rapid decomposition.                     Apparently

we have       here    an     admirable example of a            catalytic    action,' in
which the part played by the                 catalytic agent may be considered
as   definitely known.           The final result is expressible by the simple
equation —
                  3(XH4)JS;,Os + 8NH3 = 6(NH4),S04 + N2
leaving the silver compound entirely                  out of account, but         there
seems no reason to doubt that the action takes place in the manner
 and stages indicated.
     The experiment is one very well suited for class demonstration,
 and is exceedingly            simple.    Dissolve    a considerable     quantity of
 ammonium        persulphate in concentrated               ammonia solution,        and
 place the solution in         a  tall beaker or jar.     Add   a small quantity of
 silver nitrate solution         ;  the  evolution of nitrogen begins at          once,
 and soon the temperature rises so high that large                      quantities    of
 ammonia gas also escape, causing the liquid to boil over                 ;  the result
 is  not nearly    so  striking if dilute ammonia solution is employed.

persulphate      in   presence     of silver salts is much slower than the
ahove, and     it appeared interesting           to get some idea of the rate at
which it took      place as compared         with that of       a   solution free from
silver.     So far   it had   heen assumed that the products would simply
be oxygen and ammonium hydrogen sulphate.
    Twelve grams of recrystallised, but not quite pure, ammonium
persulphate were dissolved in water at 20°C, and, after the addition
of 0-0425 gm. of silver nitrate (corresponding ultimately to                        a milli
gram equivalent per litre of solution), the solution was diluted to
250 c.c.      The solution was kept in           a  thermostat at the temperature
stated.      From time to        time,    5  c.c. were      withdrawn       and titrated
with fifth-normal alkali solution, using methyl                  orange      as  indicator.
In the earlier titrations, when there still remained                     a good deal of
undecomposed persulphate, the indicator became                       rapidly bleached,
and in each of these cases             it   was found advisable to repeat                the
determination, adding the indicator                 only when the neutral point
 was nearly reached,        as  known from the first determination.

    These results are plotted in the                figure (see Plate),         the   curve
 showing the increase          of acidity     as   the   experiment progressed.
     It soon  became evident that the reaction was not taking                         place
 in the way imagined.           Allowing for       the small quantity of sulphate
 in the sample of salt employed, the persulphate solution was slightly
 over 0-4 normal.          Therefore it should ultimately have produced                    a
 slightly more       than 0-4 normal acid solution, assuming                      the  final
 decomposition      to be expressible by the           equation —
            2(XH4).,S2Os + 2H20 = 2(NH4):iS04 + 3H2S04 + O,.
     The quantity of      alkali solution required for 5 c.c. of the liquid
  should   therefore have approached a limit of slightly over 10 c.c.

166           Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                   [
Instead of that, the limit was clearly considerably higher, about                 12
or 13.     (The number actually obtained was 12-75.) Further, at
no stage was there any evolution of gas observable, even on shaking
the liquid, notwithstanding         the large quantity of salt decomposed.
   The only reasonable assumption           to be made was that the oxygen,
instead of being liberated, was being used up to oxidise the hydro
gen    of ammonium,        probably     also the nitrogen     —otherwise       there
should still have been      a  considerable evolution        of gas, as shown by
the equation —
                                 =
                3(NH4)2S208         2(NH4)2S04    +

This would give an increased acidity of one third, making                        the
limit about 13'5.        On the other hand, assuming nitric acid to               be
the oxidation product,       as  shown by the equation
                                   =
        8(NH4)2S208 + 6H20            7(NH4)2S04 + 9H2S04 + 2HNOg,
the increased acidity would           be only one fourth,       giving   a limit of
slightly over 12"5.*        As   a  matter of fact, the liquid was found to
give a very well marked             nitric acid reaction, although the pro
portion of silver nitrate originally added was far too small to                   be
appreciable in     a  small quantity of the solution            by means     of  the
usual test for nitric acid.          The matter was put beyond all doubt
by heating about       a  gram of ammonium persulphate               with solution
of silver    sulphate.      There     was only a slight evolution            of gas,
although the liquid was heated nearly to boiling, and the resulting
liquid contained      so much      nitric acid that there was         a quite con
siderable     evolution    of   nitric oxide    on     treatment     with ferrous
sulphate and sulphuric          acid.
    The quantitative      experiment was commenced merely to obtain                 a
rough idea of the increased rate of decomposition,                   and was not
 carried out in a very strict manner, the titrations being performed

at varying intervals of time.                A more systematic             series of experi
ments, under various conditions, may be expected to yield inter
esting    results.     The results expressed               by the above           curve are
nevertheless such as to            show that, for moderate                  concentrations,
the quantity of salt decomposed                in a given time is practically pro
portional to the quantity of persulphate present.                          As the reaction
is not    a   unimolecular     one,      this would seem to indicate that one
of the intermediate stages takes place much more slowly than the
others.
     The spontaneous decomposition of                   an aqueous         solution of am
monium        persulphate     takes place at a far slower rate than                        the
above-noted one.         After the        lapse   of four weeks, under the same
conditions of concentration and temperature,                   a pure solution of the
salt had decomposed           to such        an extent that     5     c.c. required only
0-5 c.c. of    alkali solution.         In   this case the bleaching of the methyl
orange indicator was also much less rapid, and caused no practical
inconvenience.
     By employing solutions of greater concentration                       (as regards    both
persulphate  and silver) and a higher temperature, considerable
quantities of nitric acid may be produced in this way.   If the
temperature is kept very high                   there     is a fair amount of other
decomposition,        oxygen mixed            with    ozone   being evolved in con
siderable quantity      if   the   liquid    is boiled.
     There are probably many other reactions which may be either
brought       about or accelerated            by the      catalytic      action   of silver
compounds in presence              of persulphate.            We      have     such   a   case
in   the oxidation     of methyl orange, already noted.                      A similar    one
is presented      by the oxidation of indigo.                 If    a solution of         am
monium        persulphate is coloured by means of indigo, then divided
into two portions, and             a   drop of silver nitrate solution added to
one of them, that one         will      be found to be decolorised much faster
than the other.
     A still more remarkable            example      is provided by the oxidation of
 a chromic     salt to chromic acid in acid solution.                 If   solution of, say,
 chrome alum is heated with pure ammonium persulphate no change
 is observable       beyond the usual one from purple colour to green.
 If,   however,   a   drop of silver nitrate            solution    is     also added,    and
 the   mixture gently warmed, the colour changes                      to green     and then

to bright yellow,       and ultimately the solution          is found to contain
chromic acid and no chromic salt.
    Ammonium       persulphate is now made and employed technically
on a considerable scale.          Possibly the employment of small quan
tities of silver compounds in conjunction                with it may extend its
applicability   as an oxidising      agent to cases where by itself it would
be ineffective.
    There is another point of interest in connection                 with the use
                                                   '           '
of ammonium persulphate solution as a                 reducer     in photography.
A solution which has          been     once used     for this purpose is bound
to contain sufficient silver salt to accelerate           enormously the rate of
decomposition       and render the solution            very soon    unfit for   use,
although     in its unused condition        it might      be kept   for a consider
able time without undergoing             decomposition       to a serious extent.
It   is also possible      that the metallic       silver of the film is more
rapidly attacked        once  there is some of the peroxidic            compound
present in the solution.            It  has been stated, indeed, that pure
solution     of  ammonium         persulphate     does     not   attack  the film,
and that the       action    only commences          once   a small    quantity of
ozone has been         formed    by    decomposition.         If  that is so, then
probably the addition of        a  small quantity of silver nitrate solution

Hyperbolic         Quaternions.          By       Alexander         Macfarlane,
      Lehigh University, South Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.                     (With
      a  Plate.)
                            (Read   July  16, 1900.)
   It is  well known that quaternions are intimately connected with
spherical trigonometry, and in fact they reduce that subject to a
branch of algebra.        The question      is suggested       whether    there   is
not a system of quaternions         complementary to that of Hamilton,
which is capable of expressing trigonometry on the surface of the
equilateral hyperboloids.      The rules of vector-analysts are approxi
mately complementary to those of quaternions.                    In this  paper    I
propose    to show how they can be made                 completely complemen
tary, and that, when so rectified, they yield the hyperbolic counter
part  of the spherical quaternions.
   The celebrated rules discovered by Hamilton are : —
                 r-=-i            /-=-i                  k-=  -   1
                 ij =    k        jk =      i            ki =   j
                 ji=   -k          kj=   -i              ik=   -j.
This is the statement of the rules         as     enunciated by Hamilton        ; it
supposes an order of the symbols from right                 to left.  When      the
order is changed to that from       left  to right, they become        : —
                  x2=  -  1        j2=-l                 k-=-\
                  y=   -k          jk=    -i             ki=   -j
                 ji=     k          kj=       i          ik=     k.
The rules used by vector-analysts are           : —
                 t-2=+i           ;2=    +  i            ifi=  + \
                 ij=     k        jk =      i           /¦('=    /
                 ji= -k            kj =  -i             ik=   - j,
and they suppose an order from left to right.                 They lead to pro
ducts   in which   the manner of associating the factors is essential,
in this respect differing   from the rales of quaternions.               Can they
be  modified so that the order of the               factors will be preserved,

     I    proceed now                  to    apply these principles                     to the investigation
of the fundamental                          theorems of hyperboloidal                       trigonometry.                  I
shall consider only the hyperboloid                                       of equal axes,        but the results
can easily be extended to the general hyperboloid.
     On account of the symmetry of the sphere with respect to its
centre, spherical quaternions                               are independent              of rectangular axes.
It   is otherwise with hyperboloidal                                     quaternions, for the equilateral
hyperboloid               has         an axis          of revolution.                  In order         to       treat    of
trigonometry               on the hyperboloid,                          it is   necessary     first to treat the
trigonometry               of      the sphere with reference                            to the same               axis of
revolution.               In the figure (fig.                     1)      OA is the axis of revolution,
and the surfaces considered are those generated by the circle and
by the equilateral                     hyperbolas.               From this point of view the circle
appears as consisting of                         a    real partPQ corresponding to the real
hyperbola            PQ', and               an       imaginary part QR corresponding to the
imaginary                hyperbola              Q'R'.            Consequently            the sphere appears
broken up into a double sheet traced out by                                                 PQ and ES, and
a    single sheet traced out by QR.
     The algebraic expression for                                a circular angle is          e6   v'   -'   .    As the
axis of the plane is not specified, the denotation of the expression
is necessarily limited                       to angles in a constant plane.                                  Let    /3    be
introduced to denote the axis, then                                      eb^~1^    is the proper expression
for      an angle         in any plane.                  We have

   The plane of OA and OV passes through OR, which is normal
to the piano POQ             ;   hence    these        planes cut orthogonally in a line
OX, and the angle between OA and OX is equal to that between
OV and OR, for OV is perpendicular to OA and OR to OX. Let
6 denote the angle AOX ; then

   The figure (fig. 3) represents               a section         through the plane of OA
and OV      ;  MX       represents       sin   6.       Hence the axis                £   can be        put
in   the   form cos 9-t         — sin 0-a, where               c  denotes        a    unit     axis    per
pendicular to       a.    The unit axis         «   may be expressed                 in  terms of two
axes   j  and     k,    forming      an orthogonal                system       with       the     axis of
revolution,      which       may be denoted by t.                            Hence        a     perfectly
general   expression        for any spherical versor is en^_1f, where

     The first and second components                      of the directed sinh (denoted
 by Sinh) are perpendicular to the axis of revolution, hence their
 resultant cosh c sinh b'fi + cosh b sinh c'y is also perpendicular to the
 principal axis.           Let it    be represented           by   OV in      the figure.         The
 difficulty consists         in finding the true direction of the third com
 ponent      J  —  l   ginh b sinh c sin /3y"a on account                  of the presence of
  <J  - 1. It     will   be found that          V-      1  has here nothing            to do with
 the direction      ;   and as the term is otherwise in the positive direc
 tion of    a, we represent it by            OU in      the figure.        In   the case of the
 sphere    OU is drawn in the direction opposite to a. Let OK be
 the   resultant of OU and OV ; it represents the directed Sinh both
 in magnitude and direction.
     The square of the length of OR is
   cosh  2c  sinh -b + cosh -b sinh -c +           2 cosh c cosh b       sinh   c sinh    b  cos  fiy
                        +  sinh   -b  sinh   2c sin   2/3y.
      But the square         of the modulus of OR is the same with                            a nega
  tive sign before the last term              ; added to the square of cosh e^e0?                    it
  yields 1.
      The directed sinh         OR     is not normal to the             plane     POQ      ;  how is
  it related to that plane?                If   we draw        OU'=       - OU     and find OR'

from which         it follows that S(OR')(OP) = 0 and S(OR')(OQ)                       =- 0.
 Hence OR' is normal to the plane of POQ.                     How is the direction
of OR related to that plane ? The plane of OA and OV (fig. 5)
 cuts the equilateral hyperboloid            in an equilateral hyperbola            ;  and
 as  it  passes   through      the normal     OR', it must cut the plane POQ
orthogonally.
    Let OX      be the lino of intersection.          Draw    XM     perpendicular        to
 OA, draw       XD     a  tangent to the equilateral hyperbola at            X   (fig. 5),
and     XA'   parallel to OA.         Let 6 denote the hyperbolic         angle    AOX.
As OR' is normal to the plane POQ, it is perpendicular                          to    OX     ;
but    OV is perpendicular to OA, therefore the angle AOX is equal
to the angle VOR'.             Now the angle AOR is the complement of
ROV, and A'XD the complement of AOX ; therefore the line OR
is parallel to the tangent XD.             Thus the direction of the directed
sinh is that of the conjugate axis to the plane of OP and OQ.
This idea of conjugate instead of normal              also applies to the spherical
case, from      which it follows that          ij=\J~lk       means that k is the
axis conjugate to         i and j.

    The    above    analysis shows that the product versor               POQ may        be
specified by the following three elements                  : —First,   c,  a unit axis
drawn      perpendicular to       0 A in the plane of OA and the normal to
the plane     POQ ;      second,  6, the hyperbolic angle determined by OA
and    OX, which is drawn at right angles to the normal in the plane
of OA and the normal ; third, a, the angle of the hyperbolic sector

OPXQ, which              is a sector        of the hyperbola having                  OX for       semi-
major axis, and for semi-minor axis OB which                                 is equal to      OA and
perpendicular to OA and OV.                         This hyperbola           is not an equilateral
hyperbola ; PXQ is the curve of intersection of the hyperboloid
with a plane through the points 0, P, Q. An angle of this hyper
bola is specified by the ratio of the sector to half of the rectangle
formed by         OX and OB.                Thus a is the ratio of the sector POQ to
half of the rectangle formed by OX and OB.
    Hence the product versor may be expressed by                                       means       of    a
hyberbolic angle a and a hyberbolic axis of the form

 from which it is constructed are cosh 6't and sinh 6'a                                      It  is not

       In the      case when the two versors are equal, we can verify that
it is the line of intersection of                                     the      central plane with the                     equi

this would    not be at all difficult.             For example, if we wish              to

of the unknowns              in the preceding                       case,      Jacobi would have little

   It  is then pointed out that when the first coefficient has been got
in   one of the numerators,          the others are         arrived at by circular
permutation, the elements permuted                   being   12345 in the case         of
the first numerator, 02345 in the case of the second, 01345 in the
case   of the third, and       so on    ;  also that the first coefficient in one
line is got from the last in the preceding line by changing 012345
into 123450 and then transposing the first two elements; and that
these laws hold generally.
   A general       mode of finding        the ordinary expression for the new
functions here introduced and symbolized by
                             (1234), (123456)
is next explained.          It  is first stated that the number             of term-
represented by
                                   (2,3,4,   . . . , p)
where    p is necessarily     an odd integer is
                                1.3.5            0-2),
and that one of them is
                        (23).(45).(67)                (P-I.P).
We     are   then told to permute cyclically the last p                 -2  elements
3,4,5,   . . . , p, and we shall obtain from              this  p-2    terms in     all  ;
thereafter to permute cyclically the             last p - 4   elements 5,6,7,   . .  .  p
in each of      the p - 2  terms just obtained, and so on.             For example,
   (234567)=          (23)(45)(67)       +   (23)(46)(75)       +  (23)(47)(56)
                   + (24)(56)(73)        +   (24)(57)(36)       +  (24)(53)(67)
                    + (25)(67)(34)       +   (25)(63)(47)       +  (25)(64)(73)
                    + (26)(73)(45)       +   (26)(74)(53)       +  (26)(75)(34)

    It is important      to note in conclusion,          that the case of an od/l
 number of equations is not neglected by Jacobi,                 a proof being given
 by him that in that case the determinant of the system vanishes.
 In   his own words — which            are interesting       in view    of what has
 been said elsewhere regarding the evidence                which the paper affords

   As is well known, this long and exhaustive                      memoir of Jaccbi's
is broken up into         three chapters,— the first giving the definition
and various properties of the new multiplier,                  the second explaining
the application of it to the integration               of differential equations, and
the   third illustrating this application                 by   means    of   particular

the equation       associated       then, and still more since, with the name

 So far  as  can be ascertained, the English equivalent            skew,' although
 it probably was the first of the two in order of thought, did not
 appear in print until      a  few years later.
    As has been pointed out elsewhere, the title of the paper is
 quite misleading, the real subject being the construction of a linear
 substitution    for  the transformation       of xf + x.,2 + x82 +    ....    into
 £f + £22 + fg2   4- ....        All   that can be said in defence of the
 inaccuracy is that skew determinants are made use of in obtaining
 the desired substitution.         The proper place for giving an account
 of the contents of the paper is thus under the heading of 'orthogo-
 nants,' if we may      so name the determinants         of an orthogonal substi

    All this   is in itself comparatively unimportant, serving                       perhaps
only to recall to us Cauchy's famous paper of 1S12, where                           we have

where n =         3,    the theorem                   is    self-evident            ;    therefore, " Tout deter

How the said latter portion         — that     is to say, the deduction from
this —can be justified is     a  mystery ; but of course             if it   be granted
there is no objection to the cogency of the next step in the reason
ing, which is worded       as follows    : —
         "But since it is found on trial that for n=l,                       3,  . . .,  A
      vanishes, while for        n = 2, 4,   .  .  .,  it  does   not, the following
      theorems may be       enunciated : —
         " Theorem XIV. A symmetrical                 skew determinant          of an odd
      order in general vanishes,          and the system lias            for its inverse
      an unsymmetrical skew system.
         "Theorem        XV. A      mjmmeti-ical         skew   determinant         of an
      even order does not        in general vanish,          hut tlie system has        foi
      its inverse a symmetrical skew system."
    The  name, however, given to the
                                                 " inverse system " in the first
       when, as we have seen,                =
case                                    [rs]     [«r] is clearly inappropriate ;
and   it is not improved        in the second edition by alteration into
" quadratic skew," the fact being that the system is not skew at
all, but is symmetric with respect to the principal diagonal, or, in
later phraseology, is axisymmetric.
    The treatment of the next theorem taken up is happier than the
foregoing, and is after the outset no less fresh.                     Taking     an even-
ordered skew determinant with zeros in the principal                        diagonal he
develops    it according to products of an element of the first row

     By this time the widened definition of                  a determinant       which
 Cayley had given in his paper of                  1847 had    been    exploited   to a
 certain extent, and had been found                   profitable     both  by himself
 and his fellow-worker Sylvester.                  The paper we have now          come
 to, however, is the only            one of the series        that for    the present
 concerns      us.*    In it he implicitly discards his former usage of
 the word       " determinant

                                    in any wider sense than that employed
 by his predecessors; adopts instead the word "permutant" as
 suggested       by Sylvester,      and in working         out the theory       of the
 general     functions     under    this name assigns to determinants               and

    The development with which his paper of                     1847 closes    is here
recalled and repeated for the              case where      the skew determinant
is of the 5th order and the elements of the diagonal                       are special
ized, the form in which the identity appears being
    *  All of them fall to be dealt with when giving the history of the develop
ment of the theory of determinants in general.

Naturally enough it is noted by Cayley that the writing of a. = 0 =
5 gives us the less general theorem with which we started ; but he
does not explain why          a    third way of arranging the terms of the
development      is adopted.          Stranger     still, he   does     not remark   on
the fact that by making           11, 22, 33, 44       all vanish there is obtained
the identity

It will   be    remembered, however,             that in the statement of               this
                                                                           '          '
latter theorem, the peculiar narrow                use of the word           borde       did
not occur.
   Although what may            be  called Part Second of the paper (pp.
301, 302) may seem at first sight to concern something else, it
really only draws attention to the fact that the minors (by which
he means those afterwards named              primary minors) of a            skeic deter
minant are themselves skew, being             " gauchts ordinaire*"          when     their
cofactor in the original determinant is of tlieform rr, and "gau--h*s
hordes" when their cof actor is of the form rs.                   Considerable space
is occupied in verifying        by two examples that the same result 'will
be reached whether we apply the theorem of                    Part First directly to

    What may be called Part Third                 (pp. 303-305) is very forbid
ding,   by reason      of the defective mode of exposition                   and of the
awkwardness       of the notation      employed.          Probably this accounts

   In   this, the second text-book,          the same importance              is given to
skew determinants         as in Spottiswoode, the first part of the eighth
section (pp. 55-72) being devoted to them under the heading                         " Dei
determinant gohbi," which Schellbach translates by ilberschlagen.
The arrangement and treatment of the matter, however,                          are much
more logical, zero-axial skew determinants                   being taken first, then
the functions        connected with        these,     viz., Pfaffians,       then   skew
determinants      which    are not zero-axial,       and lastly the use of skew
determinants       in the consideration of the problem of orthogonal
transformation.
   The precedence given to determinants which are "gobbi sim-
          "
mctrici over those which are " puramente gobbi " is explained at
the    outset     by   reference      to  Cayley's        theorem      regarding      the
expressibility of the latter            in terms of the former,                the quite
general     theorem from which Cayley's immediately                      follows    being
carefully enunciated thus : —

   The proof given of Jacobi's theorem regarding the value of an
odd-ordered skew determinant with zero, in the principal diagonal
is essentially the same as Cayley's proof, but fuller and clearer.
The proof of the corresponding theorem for a determinant of even
order resembles Spottiswoode's, the difference lying mainly in the

This will     be  recognised     as    a   third     mode     of writing    an already
well-known       result, and,     as    Brioschi       notes,   gives  a  property     of
the function      H similar     to a property of determinants               (" la quale
equazione     contiene una proprieta della funzione                 H  analogs ad una
nota dei determinant        ").
   From this ho passes to what he calls the characteristic                     property
of H,   viz., its change of sign         consequent       upon the transposition       of
two indices.       Calling   H' what H          becomes when         r and  s are inter
changed,     he notes    that in those terms of            H in which     the element
an occurs there can be no other element with the same indices,                       and
that therefore

Then since the same interchange made in P leaves                         P in    reality
unaltered, — that     is to say, since H2        = H'2, — he obtains
                                h?h        =   H,ppr.

and,  it having     been shown that the two differential-quotients                  hen'
appearing are of opposite            signs,    it follows       that so    also are H
and H'.

attention to the case      in which        the skew determinant             submitted to
                      '               '
the  operation of       bordering          has    zeros   for the elements          ot    the
principal   diagonal.
            "Un     determinant,"          he now       says,     "de   cette    espe.ee    se
         reduit toujours au produit de deux Pfaffuns.                         En effet en
         ecrivant dans les exemples 1 1 = 22 = 33 = 44 = 0, on obtient :

   To this there is added the suggestive commentary                      : —

          déterminant d'ordre impair, le coefficient du terme a/3 ne se
          réduit pas à zéro ; en supposant donc que le déterminant

    Following his two          predecessors     Baltzer also assigned a separate
section of his text-book         to skew determinants, but             without giving
them any special designation of his own or even taking over that
used by Schellbach.            The title of the section           (§ 8, pp. 29-34) is
thus    a  little lengthy, viz., " Déterminante            eines    Systems     von Ele-
menten,      unter denen      die correspondiremlen a,* und               a^,  entgegen-
gesetzt gleirh sind."
    It  must be noted, however, that before this section is reached
some     theorems which strictly belong to the subject of the section

1399-1900.]    Dr Muir       on the Theory         of Skew Determinants.               211
have    been already dealt with.             These are in the first place       (§3,      8 ;
p. 12)     Jacobi's theorem regarding the vanishing of                      a zero-axial
skew      determinant      of     odd     order,   and    Spottiswoode's       theorems
regarding conjugate         elements of the adjugate or inverse of a zero-
axial skew determinant, the mode of proof for                      all being that     used
by   Jacobi for his own theorem, viz., the multiplication of all rows
or all     columns    by    -  1,   and then comparing            the resulting deter
minant      with the original.           In the second place (§3, 10;               p.    13)
we have      Brioschi's theorem regarding the differential-quotient                      of a
zero-axial skew determinant               of even order, and        a  suggestive proof
of the same       which it is desirable        to note.       It  is as follows   : — Let
the determinant
 be denoted      by A  ,  and the cofactor of a^ in A by              A„.    Then, bear
ing in mind that         A is   a  function of     a,., and that a„ is not indepen
 dent of Ora we have

 But when n is even we know from Spottiswoode,                           as above,       that
 A„   =   - A„. ;  consequently we have in this case
                                     3A_    = 2A
                                     dar.
 as   Brioschi affirmed.*          In   the third place (§ 7, 5        ; pp. 28, 29) he

       It ought to be noticed also that Baltzer uses the equation
                                  O&rs
  to verify  Spottiswoode's theorem for the case where A is odd-ordered, the
  reasoning being that as A is then known to be zero, so also must 8A/8ar<, and
  that therefore  An = A4r.

as    Brioschi did,            to the case where                    A is zero-axial skew and of                   odd

and he takes the further step of deducing from                                          it the result
thus showing, as he says (1) that the ratios on the left are inde
pendent of r, and (2) that, when the sign of one of the roots has
been fixed, the                others are known                      (" dass durch das Zeichen einer

   Turning now to the section specially                                     set apart       for the considera
tion of skew determinants,                             we find            that    it opens with Cayley's
theorem            regarding            a   zero-axial           determinant           of    even order,          the
requirement being, as here worded, to prove that such a determinant
is the square of                     a rational                integral      function of           the     elements.
The proof is essentially the                           same as Spottiswoode's and Brioschi's,
and differs from Cayley's                            merely in that              it   does not begin         with   a
determinant of a more general form than is necessary,                                                     — a point
which it is desirable to insist upon, as Baltzer                                       ignores the fact, and
then does not hesitate to say in                                     a    footnote      that Cayley's proof
" leaves manifold doubts unrelieved."                                        In fact the theorem which
Cayley proves                 is,   that    if   a zero-axial            xketo   determinant          of odd onler
           bordered            the      resulting          determinant            is   the product           of   tico
                        '
lie
      '
Pfaffians          :   whereas what the three others prove,                                  is   the particular
case of            this in which                 the skewness               extends         to    the bordering
elements.
      The development with which the proof begins Baltzer writes in
the form
                                    A       =

                   ,     n.         He then uses                the fact that           An       is   a   zero-axial
skew determinant of odd order, and that therefore by                                                  a   preceding

those     possible for        s,  he concludes (without knowing                        the signs of
the   terms of the aggregate,                 be    it observed) that it is resolvable
into two factors, viz.

It is    then argued that the two factors are identical                                  even in the
signs of their various terms
                                              " da durch          das Zeichen einer             Wurzel

 r  are     2,    3,  .  . .  , n.       The next step consists in pointing out
 that A'^ being a              determinant similar to A but of order n 2,                            -
 it must follow that ^A'„ can in the                           same       way be expressed as
 an aggregate of n           - 3 terms,      and that this process can be continued
 until the minor under the root-sign is of the 2nd order, when
 manifestly         its value is the square of one of its elements.                                  The
 final result thus is that            J  A is expressible as an aggregate of (n 1)                   -

    By way of corollary              to this    it is pointed out that

the square root of A             ,  changes signs when two suffixes,                      r and    s, are
interchanged            is a simplification           of Brioschi's,           the operation          and
 even     the     notion      of    differentiation           being dispensed with.                   The
function resulting             from the change being                      H'    he    concludes like
Brioschi that
                                            H2     =    H'2;
 also the aggregate of the terms in                     H which           contain     ars being a„ B,
 say,    he infers as Brioschi does that                      B cannot         be affected by the
 change, and that therefore                ars   B will      be altered into          a„ B or    - a„   B.
 Here, however,             he brings       the demonstration                 quickly to         a  satis
 factory end by saying that since some of the terms of                                     H'   are thus
 seen to differ         in sign only from the corresponding terms of H, the
 equation H2 = H'2 shows all of them must so differ ; and this is
 what was to be proved.
     Jacobi's notation             for the function              H      is then introduced,            the
  formal intimation            being that (1, 2, 3                           n) is used to denote
  the    aggregate         whose   first term is al2au . . . a„_u „ and tchose
  square is A         .    The other value of V A is thus of course represent-
  able by (2,      1,   3, ... , »),  (2, 3,   . . . n,  1 ), or  . . .   As this implies       also that

  we have now the means,                     so far as          symbolism          is concerned, of

    § 1.The title of the present communication describes a pure
problem of abstract mathematical dynamics, without indication of
any idea of a physical                 application.          For    a merely mathematical
journal it might              be    suitable, because         the     dynamical           subject     is
certainly interesting both in itself and in its relation to waves and
vibrations.           My      reason    for occupying          myself      with       it,   and for
offering     it   to the Royal Society of Edinburgh,                     is   that   it   suggests     a
conceivable explanation of the greatest difficulty hitherto presented
by the undulatory                  theory of     light;      the motion         of    ponderable
bodies through infinite                space    occupied by an elastic solid.*
    §   2.       In consideration of the confessed object, and for brevity,
I   shall use the word atom to denote an ideal substance occupying
a   given portion           of solid space, and acting on the ether within                            it
and around            it,   according to the old-fashioned               eighteenth         century
idea of attraction and repulsion.                     That   is    to say, every infinitesimal
volume       A    of the atom acts on every infinitesimal                     volume        B   of the
ether with        a   force in the line         PQ joining the centres of                 these   two
volumes, equal to
                                           A/(P, PQ)PB                                              (1),
where        p    denotes the density of the ether at                     Q,   and   /      (P, PQ)
denotes      a     quantity        depending      on    the position of        P     and on the
   * The so-called "
                     electro-magnetic theory of light" does not cut away this
foundation from the old undulatory theory of light. It adds to that primary
theory an enormous province of transcendent interest and importance                               ;   it
demands of us not merely an explanation of all the phenomena of light anil
radiant heat by transverse vibrations of an elastic solid called ether, bnt also
the inclusion of electric currents, of the permanent magnetism of steel and
lodestone,  of magnetic force, and of electrostatic force, in    comprehensive  a
ethereal dynamics.

pB of the ether at Q, is the resultant of all the forces calculated
according to (1), for all the infinitesimal                             portions        A into which        we
imagine the whole volume of the atom to be divided.

known            mathematical             theory     of attraction, we                  find rectangular
components of this resultant                         as   follows : —

where        x, y,     z    denote co-ordinates of                    Q     referred        to    lines fixed
with reference              to the atom, and               <f>     denotes   a function (which we
call the potential             at    Q     due to the atom)                found by summation as

    § 5.    As   a  first and very simple illustration,            suppose    the atom
to be spherical, of radius unity,            with concentric interior         spherical
surfaces     of equal      density.    This    gives,   for the direction of           the
resultant force on any particle of the ether, whether inside                             or
outside the spherical boundary of the atom,                      a line  through       the
centre    of the atom.          The further assumption of (7) may now                    be
expressed     by
and     this,  as  we are       now supposing         the    forces   between       every
particle of the atom and every particle of the ether to                     be subject
to the Newtonian          law, implies, that the resultant of its attractions
and repulsions         is   zero   for  every    particle     of ether outside         the
 boundary of the atom.              To simplify      the   case to the    utmost, we
shall    further    suppose      the distribution        of positive and        negative
 density of the atom, and the law of compressibility of the                         ether,
 to be such, that the average density of the                  ether within the       atom
 is equal to the undisturbed density of the ether outside.                    Thus      the
 attractions and repulsions of the atom in lines through its                       centre
 produce,    at diiferent distances        from its centre, condensations              and
 rarefactions of the ether, with no change of the total quantity                          of
 it within    the boundary of the atom             ;   and therefore produce              no
 disturbance      of the       ether outside.       To     fix   the   ideas,     and      to
 illustrate the application          of the suggested         hypothesis    to explain
 the refractivity       of ordinary     isotropic transparent bodies such                  as
  water or glass,     I   have    chosen   a definite particular        case   in   which
 the   distribution       of the ether when at rest within the atom                         is
  expressed    by the following         formula, and partially          shown in         the
 accompanying diagram, and tables               of calculated numbers: —

Hence,     if we denote the disturbed and undisturbed densities of
the ether by p and unity respectively, we have

the     atom.     In order that the disturbance may suffice for

for some cases be about equal to 100, and for others must be con
siderably greater.         I have    therefore taken         K=    100, and calculated

   § 6.     The diagram (fig.                  1)    helps     us   to understand            the dis
placement       of    ether       and      the resulting           distribution         of   density,
within the        atom.         The        circular       arc    marked        l'OO      indicates     a
spherical     portion       of     the      boundary          of   the atom        ;    the    shorter
of the circular arcs marked -95, -90,                                           -20,    -10 indicate
spherical     surfaces of undisturbed                     ether of radii equal              to    these
numbers.       The position               of    the spherical           surfaces of        the    same
portions     of      ether     under          the     influence       of the        atom,      are   in
dicated    by the arc marked                      l-00, and the longer of the                      arcs
marked      "95,     -90,   .  .    .   "50,     and      the    complete         circles     marked
'40,   -30,    -20,      -10.         It    may       be   remarked          that      the    average
density    of the ether within any one                         of the disturbed             spherical
surfaces, is equal          to     the cube           of   the ratio of the undisturbed
radius    to   the      disturbed          radius,       and is shown             numerically         in
column      2   of      Table         I.    Thus,        for    example,         looking       at   the
table and diagram, we see that                           the cube of the radius of the
short    arc marked           *50       is   26     times the cube            of the radius of
the   long     arc     marked          *50,     and      therefore        the average         density
of the ether within the spherical                          surface corresponding               to   the
latter is 26 times the density                       (unity) of the undisturbed                  ether
within     the       spherical           surface       corresponding           to      the    former.
The     densities       shown          in     column         4    of     each     table      are    the

     §   8.     The diagram of                  fig.    2     is   interesting,                as showing            how,
 with densities of ether varying through the wide range of from
 •35 to 101, the whole mass within the atom    distributed among                     is
the concentric            spherical          surfaces of equal density.                           We see by             it,
interpreted           in conjunction with col.                       4   of the tables, that from the
centre to "56 of the radius the density falls from 101 to                                                      1.     For
radii from           -56 to   1,   the values of               (p    - 1)r2     decrease           to   a   negative
minimum              of -525 at r="93, and rise to zero at                                 r=\.          The place
of      minimum          density        is      of course            inside      the radius               at        which
 (p   - l)r*    is   a   minimum        ;    by cols.         4    and    3   of Table           I., and        cols.    4

and at distance approximately                           -87 from the centre.
  §      9.    Let     us suppose           now our atom to be set in motion through
space         occupied by          ether, and kept                    in motion                with     a   uniform
velocity        v,   which    we shall first suppose                       to be infinitely small in

to the relative            motion of ether and the atoms constituting                                                 the

the position of every particle of the ether at any instant                                                      is   the

     §   1 2.        The first dynamic question that occurs to                                  us, returning
to the supposition of moving atom and of ether outside it at rest,
is : — What is the total kinetic energy («) of the portion of the
ether which               at any instant          is •within        the atom?                 To answer                 it,
think of             an   infinite circular cylinder of the ether in the                                        space
traversed            by the atom.            The time-integral               from any era                  t   =   0    of
the total kinetic energy of the ether in this cylinder                                        is    tic
                                                                                                      ;     because
the ether outside the cylinder                     is    undisturbed               by the motion of the
atom according to our present assumptions.                                     Consider any circular
disk of this cylinder of infinitely small                                 thickness           e.          After the
atom has passed                 it,   it   has contributed           to    tf/c,   an amount equal to
the time-integral               of the kinetic energies of all the orbits of small
parts into which we may suppose                           it   divided, and              it   contributes               no
more in subsequent                     time.       Imagine          the     disk divided                  into con
centric rings of rectangular cross-section                             e   dr.           The       mass        of one
of   these rings           is   2irr dr     e   because its density                is   unity   ;    and all its
parts move in equal and similar                            orbits.         Thus we find that the
total contribution               of the disk amounts to

particle of ether whose undisturbed                            distance from the central line
is   r   (because         ^ds2/dt2

integral        <t   is   wholly made up by contributions                               of successive disks

 implies taking              dt =    1     throughout the three orbits corresponding                               to

 portions next the corner, which correspond essentially to intervals

 accompanying                Table         III.,     which shows            the whole             process          of

the    effective   inertia    of its motion          through      space      occupied       by
ether     will  be   ~

now denoted by          a  (instead of 2 as hitherto), and the inertia of
unit bulk of the ether being still (as hitherto) taken as unit of
inertia.     In all   that follows we shall suppose               I   to be very great,
much greater than 106; perhaps greater than                     1012.
   § 15.      Consider     now,     as    in   § 11   above,     our      atom at rest;
and     the    ether   moving        uniformly       in    the     space      around       the
atom, and through           the space         occupied    by the atom, according
to the curved         stream-lines        and    the    varying      velocities       shown
in   fig.  5.    The effective inertia           of any       portion      of     the   ether
containing     the atom      will    be    greater than       the simple          inertia   of
an equal volume           of   the ether        by   the amount         J6
                                                                            s3-634.      This
follows from the well-known                 dynamical       theorem        that the total
kinetic energy of any moving body or system of bodies is equal to
the kinetic energy due to the motion                 of its centre of inertia, plus
the sum      of the kinetic energies of the motions of all its                          parts
relative to the centre of inertia.
   §   16.    Suppose      now     a    transparent       body — solid,          liquid, or
gaseous — to consist of         an assemblage         of atoms all of              the same
magnitude and quality as our ideal atom defined in §                          2,   and with
I  enormously great as described in § 14.                    The    atoms      may be all

thermal motions of the molecules of a solid, liquid, or gas at any
temperature not so high but that the thermal velocities are every
where small in comparison with the velocity of light.                        The effective
inertia    of   the ether per unit volume of the assemblage                           will    be
exceedingly         nearly the same as          if the atoms were all absolutely
fixed, and will therefore, by § 15, be equal to

where     N denotes the number of atoms per cubic centimetre of the
assemblage,        one centimetre being now our               unit of length.          Hence,
if we denote by V the velocity of light in undisturbed                              ether,    its
velocity through the space occupied by the supposed assemblage                                 of
atoms     will be
                                   V/(l+Ng*-634)*                                         (16).

difficulty in admitting            so     great    a   condensation                of ether by the
atom,   if   we are to regard our present problem as the basis of                                       a
physical hypothesis worthy of consideration.

by    an admirable       experiment            designed by Michelson,                     and carried
out with most searching care to secure                            a   trustworthy             result, by
himself and Morley.*            I     cannot see any flaw either in the idea or
in the execution of this experiment.                        But    a   possibility of escaping
from the conclusion which                 it   seemed       to prove may be found in                    a
brilliant    suggestion made independently                          by       Fitzerald    t     and    by

would not disprove the free motion of ether through                                   space occupied
by the earth.

          The Total Solar Eclipse of 28th May 1900.
                           By Thomas Heath, B.A.
                                 (Read   June    18, 1900.)
    The Scottish Expedition             to observe       the  Total Solar Eclipse         of
 May 28 consisted         of Professor Copeland and             Mr J. B. M'Pherson,
 Engineer to the Royal Observatory,                    Edinburgh,     who were         sent
out    by the     Joint Eclipse Committee of                 the   Royal and        Royal
Astronomical         Societies;     Mr      Franklin-Adams,         who     joined      the
party    as  a   volunteer observer       ;    and myself, who had the honour
of being sent          out by this       Society.       The    special object       which
 we had set before ourselves          was, of course, the attempt,           if  possible,
to add something, however little               it might    be, to the sum of known
facts    concerning       the   constitution        of   the solar     corona.        This
 problem,     as   I   need   not   remind        this  Society, has occupied           the
minds of all students of solar physics for many years, and                              has
formed the chief object of all eclipse                expeditions since the middle
of the century now drawing                to a close,      and   I  believe    it  is safe
to say that every one of the                 short and fleeting opportunities             of
observing the corona with modern instruments and under modern
conditions which          have    been    afforded by the recurrence of total
eclipses     has    been    made    the most         of   by an     earnest band of
observers      since the famous eclipse of            1812    presented    the problem
as   a   burning      question to      the     attention     of astronomers.           The
introduction        of the spectroscope           and the      possibilities    which it
presented       of   throwing      new      light    on   the   subject still     further
increased      the    interest   taken ill       the   observation     of   the corona
at the time        of total eclipse,      this being the only time at which
such    observation is possible.
    It  is not my intention          now to         enquire into what         additional
facts     have     been     gleaned     from      the   observation      of   successive
eclipses, but     if anyone     were to enquire whether the great problem
has yet been solved, it would be almost sufficient to point,                    in   reply,
to the      ever-increasing      number        of observers       who are      attacking

1899—1900.]           Mr Heath       on the Total Solar Eclipse                           237
the problem.          The    Indian Eclipse of            189S     must have held the
record for the         number of men and the extent of instrumental
equipment taking part in the work                  ;    but   I  should think it more
than probable, without            presuming to say that              I  have    made       any
estimate       of numbers, that the eclipse of 1900                     has    beaten      the
record     once    more.     The path of totality, crossing,              as  it did, both
the    New       and Old worlds        in   regions easily accessible              both      to
the traveller       and to his heaviest baggage,                 rendered the        various
expeditions more like pleasant holiday                      tours than serious          scien
tific undertakings.          The whole line, from its commencement on
the shores of the         Pacific    Ocean     to its termination          in Egypt, was
more      or les3 thickly studded with astronomical                       parties,     armed
with     telescopes,     spectroscopes,     cameras,         etc.   The western part
of the     path of totality,        where the        line crosses from the Pacific
coast     of   Mexico     to   the States of Louisiana              and Virginia, was
manned         almost    entirely     by American            astronomers,       ever     keen
in the pursuit of science.            So far as       I  am aware only one English
party — that under         the leadership of the Rev.             Mr Bacon — ventured
to cross the         Atlantic    to assist   our American             cousins.      On the
other     hand,     a  largo number         of    English        expeditions      stationed
themselves        on the line where     it  crossed the peninsula of Spain and
Portugal.         The Astronomer-Royal           and assistants from Greenwich
were at       Ovar, some       twenty miles south of                Oporto, where the
shadow track first enters European soil.                   The interior of Spain was
occupied       by at least three English              parties — at Placencia, Xoval
Moval, and Manzanares — while the Scotch party found                             a  resting-
place at Santa Pola on the south-east coast, twelve miles south
of   the     port   of  Alicante.      At this station Sir Norman Lockyer
also organised a camp, manned by three                        scientific assistants       and
 a large body of officers          and sailors belonging to H..M.S.                Theseus.
 Inland from Santa Pola about              ten miles, the old Moorish              town of
 Elche was taken possession             of for the time by a numerous con
 tingent      of   French     astronomers       and       one     or two     Englishmen.
 After passing        Santa Pola the shadow crossed                 the Mediterranean
 Sea and struck land again at Algiers.                    Here quite     a  large number
 of   astronomers were          stationed, including            many members           of the
  British Astronomical        Association:       representing Oxford            and Cam
 bridge Universities        were Professor Turner             and Mr Xcwall          ;  while

    To turn   to the special affairs of the       Scotch party.       The instru
mental equipment consisted of the 40-foot telescope,                   which was
undor the special care of Dr Copeland, and was manipulated with
great    success   by  Mr M'Pherson.           To   me   Dr Copeland kindly
assigned    the use of a new triple         object-glass of 6-iuch aperture,
fitted    with   a  whole    plate   camera     and    mounted       on  a  heavy
equatorial     stand.     Mr   Franklin-Adams         was   armed     with   three
portrait lenses, mounted in cameras             to take plates      of large size,
with which he hoped to obtain photographs of the corona, showing
the   streamers    to their utmost extent, and perhaps to find some
trace of an intra-mercurial       planet,  if  such   has any existence.        He
was also provided with several ordinary cameras and a pair of long
sensitive thermometers.
    Dr Copeland's 40-foot telescope is well known                to members      of
this Society, as it has already made its appearance              at two previous
eclipses, at one of which     —  the Indian Eclipse of 1898 — a fine series
of photographs of the corona and of spectra was secured.
    The 6-inch Cooke triple object-glass is         a  newer instrument, and
the desirability    of trying the suitability of such an instrument for
the production of photographs of the corona was the inducement
which     led to my joining        the   expedition     to   Santa    Pola.    The
object-glass and camera         were constructed         by Messrs      Cooke    of
York,     and   were  fitted to   a brass    tube in our own workshop            at
Blackford     Hill.   The triple,     or photo-visual, object-glass is made
up of three lenses of      Jena  glass, combined in such a way as to bring
the focus of the visual rays into practical coincidence              with that   of
the   photographic rays, so that the telescope can be used either for
visual or photographic purposes without alteration.                The combina
tion is almost truly achromatic for all visual rays, the images of the
moon's limb, or of such stars as Vega, showing no trace of the blue
secondary spectrum so conspicuous in all other forms of so-called
achromatic object-glasses.         The instrument was completed only a
few days before it was       necessary to pack it up for transit to Spain.
The interval,      however,    during    which     it  was     mounted     at the
Observatory      was  sufficient to allow of the position of the focus
being determined with great care.              Several    trails  of stars were

photographed,     amongst them       that    of the double     star   f   Ursfe
Majoris, and the definition     was found so good that the       trail of the
primary     image was distinctly double all its length, though              the
components of the star differ in declination         only by 12-6 seconds
of   arc, and the interval between the lines of the      trails on   the plate
is only about    y^  of an inch.      The focus    was, of course, redeter
mined in Spain      by means of trial photographs           of the crescent
moon, and its position was found to have remained unaltered.
    Early in May the whole of the instruments were packed and
forwarded for shipment on board the Orient Line Eoyal Mail
Steamer      Oruba.   On May       11,    three  of the members of          the
party forgathered     on the platform       of St Pancras    Station, bound
for Tilbury Docks (Mr Franklin- Adams had preceded us by the
P. and 0. steamer). Here we met Sir Norman Lockyer and his
party, who were, like ourselves,    en   route for Gibraltar by the Oruba.
The journey out was distinctly uneventful.           The wind was in our
favour, and the Bay of Biscay was in such a gracious mood, that
even unseasoned travellers      like myself felt inclined to think that
the discomfort    popular  report had prepared us for was           a  libel on
the character of this smooth and smiling           ocean.    On our return
journey it was again smooth, but        I  am assured by people who have
crossed   it more often than   I have     that it is not always in such a
benign temper.
    We reached Gibraltar on Wednesday, May 16, where we found
 H.M.S. Theseus awaiting our arrival. Mr Franklin-Adams joined
us here and informed       us that     he had    made    all the necessary
 arrangements for our immediate transference on board the Theseus.
 This was accomplished with very little delay. Our heavy baggage
having been placed in charge of Mr Daniells, one of the officers of
the   Theseus,  we were thus relieved of all anxiety so far as           it was
concerned, and by noon of the same day the Theseus               steamed     out
 of harbour with Sir Norman Lockyer's party and ourselves                  com
fortably settled on board.        The voyage from Gibraltar          to Santa
Pola occupied just twenty-three        hours, and was perhaps the most
delightful part of our journey. The Theseus is a first-class cruiser,
armed with twelve guns, and attached to the Mediterranean
 Squadron,     and the kindness     and attention     paid us by Captain
Tisdall and the officers     soon   made us feel quite at home.             We

 240         Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                     [sess.
 were   shown all over the ship, had the working of the guns, from
 the two big 9 '2 -inch to the comparatively           little Maxim-Nordenieldt,
 ably explained to us,      till we seemed to know           all about them.        The
torpedo chambers,       both above the water-line and below, where the
great torpedo tubes lie ready at any moment to launch these dread
engines of warfare at England's           enemies, were specially interesting.
The ship's engines and boilers, capablo               of working      up to 10,000
horse-power, were explained to us in all their detail, from the great
cylinders to tho tiny speed indicator,           a  marvel of ingenuity in itself.
 But perhaps not        the   least   interesting sight in this part           of our
journey was the view we             had of the       Sierra Nevada       mountains,
stretching along the south coast,           still covered with snow and lit          up
by the bright southern sun.              We     cast anchor off Santa      Pola     the
following day, Thursday,          the   17th,    in the forenoon, and       here we
experienced one of the few minor difficulties which fell to our lot.
The big ship could not approach nearer the shore than about                     li    to
2  miles, and our landing was arranged to be carried out                   with    the
aid of the steam pinnace.             In it    we accordingly placed ourselves
and our light baggage, including             a  certain leather bag containing
two chronometers which had been entrusted to my special                          care.
Under ordinary circumstances            the    steam    pinnace as used by H.M.
Navy is a most useful and seaworthy boat; on the present occasion
wo were    all right till   we approached the           pier, and found ourselves
in tho thick of the surf          caused      by the stiff breeze        which     was
blowing off    sea.    Fortunately       our able coxswain at once           grasped
the situation, and seeing         the impossibility        of lying alongside      the
pier with any safety, he turned the boat's head to sea again                      and
steamed    out into comparatively smooth water.                   Here we awaited
tho arrival of a Spanish surf boat manned by two local fishermen,
sent to us by the inhabitants            of Santa Pola, who were waiting             to
welcome lis on shore.            In   the    end    we    were   landed in safety,
chronometers and         all, with no worse experience than                a   slight
shower-bath of salt water, which soon dried under the influence
of the bright sunshine.            As    soon     as possible after landing, we
proceeded    to look      out for     a   site   for   our camp.       Sir Norman
Lockyer's    camp    had already been             fixed upon by Sir Payn,              a
member    of his party, who, travelling            overland, had arrived       a day
or two earlier.     It   was situated on a flat piece             of ground by     the

1899-isoo.]          Mr Heath      on the Total Solar Eclipse.                     241
sea-shore, and would have afforded ample room for our camp also,
but as the soil      was sandy,    Dr Copeland considered it unsuitable for
the heavier instruments we had to erect.                 "We therefore fixed on
a   slight eminence overlooking the town, where we found a suitable
field from which a crop of barley had recently been cut and was
then being thrashed by the primitive                process   of treading out by
mules and donkeys dragging stone-cogged                 rollers over      a thrashing
tloor.      The farmer-tenant of        the   field willingly placed         it at our
disposal,      and we      were  fortunate     enough to get        possession     also
of an       old disused     and half tumbled-down            stable   in which      we
stored our instrument cases when they were sent ashore the morn
ing after our arrival.         The old stable also afforded us most grateful
shelter from the hot sun in the middle of the day, and we even
 attempted to use it for a dark room for developing photographs at
 night.     Owing, however, to the scarcity of water and the abundance
 of dust, as well      as to the  short time at our disposal after the eclipse
 for re-packing       the instruments      and sending them once more on
 board the Theseus, it was found impossible to develop any of the
 eclipse plates.       The room, however, was found useful for developing
 a   few less important        photographs      taken    for focussing purposes.
 It   is known in Santa Pola as         " la casa del pleito," or the house of
 the lawsuit, on account of certain chancery proceedings,                    in which
 it has been for     some years and is      still involved.     Our camp proved
 to be     well suited for its temporary           purpose.     It   commanded        a
 good view of the western sky, and we found a rock foundation not
 far from the surface ;       it was only    a   short distance from the hotel
 we lived at, a matter of no small importance, as the adjustment of
  the instruments       involved   a good    deal   of night work       ; it was also
 in an elevated healthy situation,            though    at the same time well
  sheltered    from winds likely to disturb the instruments.
      On the 18th the instruments were landed, and the real work
  of laying out the ground, determining             the meridian      line, building
  the cement piers for the instruments to stand on, was commenced.
  This and the mounting of the instruments               occupied us for several
  days, and by      Friday, the 25th, everything may be said to                  have
  been ready,     with the exception of the final adjustments. The               week
   referred to, the 18th to the 25th, was thus a period of continuous
   work   for every     member    of the expedition,       broken, however, by

at least one incident,        the receipt by telegram from Gibraltar of
news of the relief of Mafeking.              When we left home the strain
of expectancy of this happy event was still dominating the public
mind, and news of the relief was hourly looked for.                       The first
enquiry on our arrival at        Gibraltar was —"What        news of Mafeking       1
and the reply was — No news yet.             Arrived at Santa Pola we were
still in a state of some anxiety,        till at last, on the 19th, we found
the good news awaiting           us on our appearance at the hotel after
the morning's       work.     As British subjects sojourning            on foreign
soil, we found       it impossible    to   restrain    our feelings,     and    even
thought it necessary to show our loyalty to the glorious empire
to which we belong.           The news was received with three hearty
cheers,   much to the amazement of our host, the people of the
hotel, and the passing natives who happened to be loitering about
the hotel door       to look    at the English        astronomers.        Whether
they understood at the moment what it was all about,                   I know    not,
but they were not long in finding out that we were rejoicing over
one more victory for British pluck.            So far as    I could understand,
the sympathies of the Spaniards in the present Transvaal war are
quite on the side of the Boers, and            I   presume there are reasons
why     Spanish      human      nature    should     entertain     such    feelings.
During our stay        at Santa    Pola, however, this feeling was never
allowed    to show itself, and all through we were treated                with the
greatest   courtesy and kindness,         which manifested itself on more
than one occasion in distinctly practical form.
   I  have now brought my narrative              as far as    May 25th.       There
 were still two clear days, the 26th and 27th, before                   the day of
the eclipse.       These    were    occupied      partly in      drill,  partly in
putting final touches to the adjustments              of the instruments, and
generally in making final arrangements.                On the 26th our camp,
now    completed, had the honour of              being    visited    by the    Civil
Governor      of the Province of Alicante,          in which province Santa
Pola is situated.        A   number     of   the French        astronomers from
Elche    also   visited   us,   and   were    received     and    entertained     by
 Dr Copeland.        The   state   of the weather naturally           at this   date
engaged     some   of our attention, but       I  am bound to say, it never,
at   any time,     caused    us much concern.          In the earlier days of
our   stay, there were on one           or two occasions a few drops of

rain, and at least one night was cloudy.                                As the 28th approached
the    weather        seemed,              if anything,         to     improve, and        culminated
at    the time of the                  eclipse     in    weather          conditions     which      were
everything       that          could         possibly be        desired.         The brightness of
the skies at night, indeed, formed                        a     subject of comment amongst
us all.    The shorter duration of twilight than we are accustomed
to at this season in this northern                             latitude    enhanced the beauty
of the evening sky.                          Evening      after        evening     showed us         the
planet     Venus,          a        strikingly beautiful              object,    then just at her
position      of greatest              brilliancy.        The         brightness    of     the    Milky
Way    also struck us all as very remarkable, especially a detached
portion of it forming a little cloud not far from the constellation
Scorpio.       Scorpio              itself    seemed      to    remind us night after night
how far South we had                         come from     the scene of our regular work,
for Antares, its chief                  star, only rises         about 8° above           the horizon
at Edinburgh, whereas, at Santa Pola, it .stared                                   at us from         the
goodly     elevation of over 25°.
     The   scene at our camp                    on the    28th was somewhat remarkable.
We had fortunately                   enclosed     the ground on which our instruments
stood with      a     light wire             fence, and, acting on the             authority of the
chief magistrate, or Alcalde of the town, had erected notices with
the legend, " Se prohibe el paso."   This we found quite sufficient
to restrain      the       crowds of townspeople                       who daily        assembled      to
watch our proceedings from                          encroaching            on the space allotted
to us.  Every day, and all day long, the greatest interest                                           had
been taken in our work by crowds of people, who, I must                                              say,
conducted       themselves in the                       most     quiet      and orderly          fashion,
and never in               one         single     instance        was      the   slightest       attempt
made to interfere                    with      us in     any way.           It   would     have     been
cruel, however,            if not impracticable                   on    our part to attempt to
restrain for ten long days the natural volubility of the Spanish
tongue, and accordingly we                         heard enough of                the    language      in
the    days preceding                   the eclipse        to        have made      us    all perfect
masters of      it, if     we could only have taken reasonable                           advantage of
the daily lessons we received.                          This    was all very well before the
eclipse, but    it    is   evident that during the sevonty-five seconds of total
ity, nothing would suit us better than that silence which                                    is   known
to    be   golden.             It    was      therefore arranged with the authorities,

 244          Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                    [sbss.
 and,   I   believe, published      by the town       crier, that      at the    call,
 " silencio,"    as  totality   was    approaching,     silence    would    be    the
 best compliment         our friends    could    pay us.      The    effect  of this
 arrangement was most remarkable,               and most      creditable     to   the
 courteous character of the people.            Before the eclipse and during
 the partial     phase the volume of         sound which reached our             ears-
 can be adequately        compared only to the Tower of Babel, or the
 Falls of Niagara.       But the moment       one of our party,       in stentorian
 tones, shouted the single word        "silencio," the effect was like magic.
 Not    a  sound was heard from           all the crowd        of perhaps 2000
 people   till totality was    passed,   and we announced by our cheers
 that   the great event was over           and our programme successfully
 accomplished.
    I would    now like to say    a  word or two as to what the nature of
our observations was, though, as my own negatives are still un
developed,     I  am unable to say any more about them.                   Dr Cope-
land had arranged for        a long series     of exposures with the 40-foot
telescope,    and   these   were successfully       made    by    Mr M'Pherson
securing a series       of ten short     exposures on a sliding plate im
mediately      before and after the beginning            of totality,     with the
object,   if possible, of obtaining the spectrum of the              flash.    Then
three exposures on 18-inch plates of the corona, the prism being
removed at the proper moment by an assistant.                      Xext, another
sliding plate received ten exposures with the prism as totality was
about to end, and further five exposures on separate                18-inch plates
of the spectrum of the returning crescent.
    My own programme was             less ambitious.       All  I  attempted was
four photographs of the corona during               totality,   with the 6-inch
triple object-glass referred to before.           The plates      are whole-plate
size, 8£ x 6J inches, and are of the triple-coated Sandell type on
Chance's glass.       I  regret that I have not yet had time since my
return home on Tuesday night to get these              plates developed, but        I
hope to do so immediately,        and to lay them before this Society at
the earliest possible opportunity.
   Mr Franklin-Adams' programme was made up of long exposure
photographs of the corona with his three portrait               lenses.     Two of
these were mounted on an equatorial             stand belonging to the Royal
Observatory, Edinburgh,         and the third was mounted on the stand

to say, as they had not been developed when             I last saw Mr Franklin-
Adams.        He also arranged for thermometric              observations      to   be
recorded      by two of the midshipmen            of the Theseus,       who were
regularly     drilled at the camp in the details of their work.                   Mr
Franklin-Adams          had   also  several    ordinary     cameras     of   various
apertures and focal lengths fixed on stands and adjusted to the
sun's place at totality.       These were manipulated for him by officers
of the    Theseus.     The shadow bands were attended to by two of
the junior officers.        The end wall of our old stable, " la casa del
pleito,"   dressed    up in a new suit of white plaster, was made use of
for this purpose, and though the conditions of the eclipse were not
favourable      for the purpose, the darkness never being great at any
time, some       success attended their efforts, four lines having been
laid down in red and blue paint representing the direction                          of
movement of the bands before and after totality.
   I  have now      a few words to say as to the arrangements made for
our reception by the astronomical and the civil authorities in Spain,
and the assistance       rendered to us by the officers and men of the
Theseus.        Before    starting    from    home     our    plans    were     much
facilitated     by the kindness       of  the Director of the Madrid Ob
servatory Sefior Ifiiguez, who supplied us with              a series  of beautiful
maps showing the path of the eclipse, as well as that of 1905, over
Spanish and Portuguese territory.             This enabled us        to determine
 with certainty the precise latitude            and   longitude     of our chosen
station,     and allowed     of the computation        before    starting     of   the
exact times of the eclipse, its duration at Santa Pola, and the sun's
 azimuth      at the moment of eclipse.           This last was       a matter       of
 considerable importance, in view of the proper laying down of the
 40-foot telescope.       Sefior Iniguez     also  arranged with the Customs
 Authorities      to admit   our cases free of examination            and without
 the   annoyance       of having     to open them        on landing,       and    also
 with the police authorities to give us every help possible.                      The
 assistance     we received from the police was very great,                though     I
 must say that as guardians           of the peace the necessity for their
 services     was    not   very    apparent.       However,      our    camp      was
 placed     in   charge of two       members of the force known as the
  Guardia     Civil, who, armed with Mauser rifles, and relieved at

 246         Proceedings         of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
suitable intervals, kept watch over us and our instruments, night
and day.      Their duties        were not of a very onerous            description, but
they left us free from anxiety as to the safety of the instruments
mounted in the open and protected only by waterproof                                  sheets.
Too much praise cannot be given to both the officers and men of                            the
 Theseus for the great services            they rendered to us, first in assisting
in the work of mounting the instruments and putting                              our    camp
into order, and secondly in the                    actual work       of observing          the
eclipse.   Every     assistance        we asked of them was given                 with     the
utmost enthusiasm and willingness.                     The     navigating      officer sup
plied us with      a    daily time        signal, by dropping         a   ball on board
the ship, giving      us in this way a most               satisfactory check on            the
going of our chronometers, of which we availed ourselves to                                the
utmost extent.        As    I   have     already mentioned, two of the junior
officers undertook charge           of the shadow band observations.                     Two
midshipmen read off the thermometers, and other officers exposed
the numerous cameras under                Mr Franklin- Adams' directions.                The
services  of six or eight of the men we found invaluable.                                The

   handy man         proved himself as capable
telescope   stands      as  he     is   of manipulating          4'7-inch      guns.      His
cheerfulness     and willingness             to    undertake       any    piece of      work
allotted to him was         a   constant source         of pleasure      to those      of   us
who had to direct his energies.
    By Thursday,       the 31st, we had all our cases ready packed with
the help of the sailors,         and    once more on board the Theseus.                  The
same evening we bade farewell to our numerous Santa                           Pola  friends,
and before     nightfall     we were        steaming down the east coast and
leaving   Santa      Pola      far    behind      us.     Arrived at Gibraltar              on
Saturday morning, June                2,   we    found     the    Mediterranean          fleet
assembled     there,     and     took     up our place          amongst them.            Our
homeward hound            Orient       Liner    the    Cuzco was not expected                in
Gibraltar till the 5th       ;   we had therefore a few days to wait, which
 we employed     in   seeing something of the great fortress of Gibraltar.
One day   I  and   a   companion spent            at Eonda, an old Moorish town
in the highlands       of Malaga.           The journey from Algeciras, on the
bay   opposite    Gibraltar,       took us by a new railway,                 to 2500 feet
above sea-level,    in about three hours.               It  is situated    in  a charming
country, abounding in olives, which appears                       to be     the   principal

A    study of these            two determinants, which are both functions                                             of

by

is   thus desirable.
  :(4) Taking D first we see that    may be defined as a determinant
                                                      it
in which all the elements     the principal diagonal are unity and
                                          of
in. which no two non-diagonal element*                               situated in the same column

 are different ; and the property of                    it which lies nearest the surface
 is that it is a symmetrical function of all its variables.                                 In proof
 of this we have only         to note that the transposition                      of the pth and
 q%h  rows, followed hy the transposition of the pth and qih columns,
 has the effect of interchanging                 the two variables           dp and o, and yet
 makes no alteration in the value of the determinant.                                This       means,
 of course, that the order of the variables in                           D (al,a2)...,an) is of
 no consequence.
     (5) From this and the fact that, as the determinant form shows,
 the function D is linear in each of its variables, we should expect
 that D must      be expressible in terms of the fundamental                            symmetric
functions     2aj  , ~a{a., ,  ^ala.,a.,     ,     .  .   . .     As  a matter of fact              it is
 found that

As the paper                in question               has      so much             to      do with                        Symmetric
Functions, the following                         simple method of obtaining their expan

Oj.      Now       a.2

must contain a, again, since by taking                                       <i4   from the first column we
are prevented from taking the constituent                                          1   from the fourth column.
This term          is    also linear in any other variables.                                         Finally, there                         is
no term independent of the variables.

Note on Pairs of Consecutive Integers the Sum of whose
     Squares is an Integral Square.                               By Thomas Muir,
     LL.D.
                                (Read January 21, 1901.)
    (1) The solution of the problem of finding such pairs of integers
is not a thing of yesterday, as may be seen by consulting Hutton's
translation of Ozanam's Recreations, i. pp. 46-8 (1814).                            It  may
be enunciated thus :—
    If  pr/q,
are consecutive
                be   the rtb convergent
                                   and the sum
                                               to    J  2,   then    prPr+l and 2qrqr+,

                     integers,                         of their      squares                 to
(qSr + qVi)2or(q»+!)2                                                                      (1)
    (2) By introducing         the idea of     a  continuant,       —which       enables us
to leave out any direct reference to ^2, — we have the alternative
form of enunciation         : —
    If the continuant         (2, 2, 2,   ...  )  be denoted         by a, b, c when       the
number of 2's is       r-1 ,r,      r+   1 respectively,        then (a + b) (b + c)     and
2bc are consecutive integers, and the sum                  of their    squares is equal to
the square    of  b2 + c2.                                                                 (2)
    (3) Neither of these enunciations, however, indicates which of
the two consecutive integers is the less;* and the merit of Mr
 Christie's    enunciation       {Math.     Gazette,       L p. 394) arises from the
fact that he has hit upon a general expression for the less of the
two.     The most striking way of putting his result is                     as follows   : —
    The solution of the equation            x2 +  (x +     1 )2 = y2    in integers is
                       x =      20 + 2J +   2J+    .  ..    + 2fc._1  >
                       y   =     2*                                   /  ,
where     2, is the simple continuant            of    tlie r"1 order whose        diagonal
elements are     all  2's.                                                                  (3)
    (4) By way of proof of (2) we note that two properties of con
 tinuants give ac—b2= ±1 and c = lb + a ; that consequently
        *                                                                    r
           The first is less when    r is even, and the second when            is odd.

 therefore for the next two, and so on                                              ;   and as its validity for the
 case      r= 2       is readily verified, the proposition                                       may be considered to
  be established.
    (7) When we have got one instance of an integer whose square,
 together with the square of the next higher integer, gives an
 integral square, there is a very simple means of getting the next
 instance.                The theorem is : —
      If   & be       an integer such that                            a2   + (a + 1)J =           zs,   where     z    is   integral,
 then 3a +            1   +    2z    is      the next integer               of this kind.
 To establish this we have                                to show that
3(20 +     21    +
                      22+      .    . .      +2^.0         +     1    + 2-2^            -    20   +     2!
                                                                                                         +    22   +   . . .   +    2^t,
 that      is,   that

 Now,      if     we know one case of this to be true, we can immediately
 prove the next case                             ;   for, suppose that
 2(20    +       21   +   2,+       .   .    .   +2^.,)          +    1     +    2*.     =       2^;
 then by adding 2^                               +   2^+j we obtain
 2(20 +          21   +   22   +    .   .
                                        .        +2to)     +      1    +     2^          =       2-2^.,       +    2„       = 2*,+,.
 It   remains only to show that                                       it   is    true when m =                  1,   and this         is
 self-evident.
      (8) From the foregoing we have
                          20   +    21   +       22

                                 (Read March 4, 1901.)
   For     a   number of years a very serious nuisance has arisen from
the      'sloblands'      of the upper        reaches     of Belfast          Lough during
the summer          and early autumn          — the stench at low tide being
often     quite overpowering,           and     the    air     heavily        charged       with
sulphuretted hydrogen.
   A     precisely similar    nuisance, though not of the same magnitude,
arises    from the sloblands           in    the northern           portion       of    Dublin
harbour.
   This nuisance, in Belfast at all                 events,    has been supposed by
many people to be due to sewage matters actually deposited on the
slobland, but it requires but slight observation to prove that this
can scarcely        be    the true      explanation,          for without doubt the
nuisance is intimately         associated with deposits of green seaweed,
consisting       almost     entirely    of    the     Ulva latissima,          or,     as   it is
commonly called, the 'Sea Lettuce.'*

and the shore weed.    Tluxt weed is never sren on any shore unless setpage runs
into the water.    The stronger the sewage and the greater its volume, the
more luxuriant its growth.        have observed this during the last twenty
                                  I
years in England, Wales, Ireland, and Scotland.       About eight years ago                      I
washed some of the weed in fresh sea water and placed        in    bottle of the
                                                                     it       a
same.    In about twenty-four hours the bottle was opened and the contents
found to be in an exceedingly offensive state.
   "A paper of mine in the Proc. Soy. Soe. Edinburgh, session 1895-98,
touches upon this matter."
   Nothing, however, appears to have been published on the subject, and we
are under the impression that most botanists consider Viva latissima                             u
characteristic rather of brackish than of polluted sea water.

   In    the upper    reaches   of  Belfast  Lough this weed grows in
abundance, and during high winds or gales it is washed ashore,
often in enormous quantities, forming banks which are frequently
two or three feet thick, and extend at times for miles along the
coast, especially on the southern shore.
    Once deposited, these layers of weed often remain more or less
stationary in the shallow bays or pools of the neighbourhood                for
months, and under these circumstances, and particularly              in warm
weather, rapid       putrefaction    occurs, and   a  perfectly    intolerable
stench arises, which is perceptible over a wide area, and seriously
affects,   not only the comfort of the inhabitants       of the district, but
the value of their property also.
    The investigation,     the results    of  which we describe in the
following     pages, was  originally undertaken      with the view merely
of ascertaining      the  cause  of the nuisance arising from the slob-
lands of Belfast.       But we were gradually led into      a more extended
inquiry, which has embraced not only a study of the chemical
changes which occur when Ulva latissima ferments, but in addition,
an    examination      of the   composition   and characters of the weed
itself, the isolation of the products of its fermentation, and attempts
to isolate the particular       organisms giving rise to these products ;
and finally we have endeavoured          to ascertain, both experimentally
and by an examination         of localities in which the weed is either
present in quantity or is virtually absent, the relationship          of Ulva
latissima    to the  pollution of  sea water by sewage.
    For the     sake  of clearness   and convenience we shall        give the
results of our inquiry into these different questions in         a  somewhat
different order from that in which they were obtained.
  The Chemical       Changes  which occur when Ulva latissima ferments.
    A  quantity of the fresh weed was carefully           washed in several
changes of ordinary tap water until free from shells and debris of
various     kinds,* and it was then distributed         between two flasks,
one of which was filled with tap water and the other with                   sea
   *
     The weed, as obtained by us from the Belfast foreshore, was nearly always
infested with minute spiral shell-fish, which feed upon it and eat out circular
holes.

 water, care being taken to get rid of all air adhering           to the weed.
 A  well fitting (paraffined) cork was then attached to each of the
flasks, and through         the cork   a gas  delivery    tube passed,     which
 dipped into a small         mercury   pneumatic     trough    and under       an
inverted test-tube full of mercury.          The flasks, with their attach
 ments, were then left in the laboratory at ordinary (winter) tempera
tures.
    After  some    six weeks the contents of the flask containing             the
viva and    sea water began to evolve gas, and a few days later they
blackened, while those of the flask containing viva and tap water
gave off gas some days later, and no blackening subsequently
occurred.
    Some of the liquid from the first flask was driven              over along
with the    gas, and when the test-tube became          full of the latter, the
liquid  escaped     on to the surface of the mercury in the pneumatic
trough.     It  was found      to be strongly   acid, and as it evaporated,
smelt of butyric      acid.    The  gases from    this flask were examined
after an interval of about three months had elapsed              since starting
the experiment,       and were found      to consist mainly of hydrogen,
carbonic anhydride, sulphuretted hydrogen, and nitrogen.
    These preliminary      experiments gave a distinct clue to the nature
of the chemical changes which the weed suffers when                  it rots on
the foreshore in a moist condition, as well as to the cause of the
nuisance to which it then gives rise.
    It is clear that an acid is produced in the first stage of the
fermentation     process,    while  at a later  period, and probably by a
distinct fermentative act, sulphides and sulphuretted             hydrogen are
formed, either by the reduction          of the sulphates present in the
weed itself or in the sea water, or from the albuminoids              contained
in the former, — these sulphides reacting on the iron compounds in
the tissues     of   the weed to give ferrous          sulphide.    The latter
would no doubt be attacked by the acid, with evolution of sulphur
etted hydrogen,       and thence the nuisance.          As   a result of these
preliminary    experiments, we decided to investigate the quantitative
composition of the gases evolved from the fermenting                  u-lca, and
also to isolate and    identify the butyric acid.
   To obtain the       gases,   the same arrangement        was employed       as
before, only the flasks were placed as soon         as   charged in an incu

    No sulphuretted hydrogen was present in the                   gases,   which,   as
 their analyses indicate, consisted entirely of carbonic anhydride and
 hydrogen        Owing     to the solubility of carbonic anhydride in water,
 it was to be expected that the gases collected at first would                    con
 tain  a lower      proportion     of   this constituent       than    was actually
 evolved.      Only when the liquid in the flask had become saturated
 with carbonic anhydride would the             gaseous products of the fermen
 tation   make their way into the collecting                tube in their     proper
  proportions, and this state appears to have been reached when the
 second analysis was made.          Its results show the carbonic anhydride
 and hydrogen         to be present practically          in the same proportions
 by volume or in equi-molecular proportions.

and, as we have already mentioned, before we had made any gas
analyses, the production of butyric acid had been indicated.

fermentation gave further evidence of the production of the acid,

sulphuric    acid, the distillate boiled with excess of calcium carbon
ate, filtered, and evaporated to dryness.          Weighed portions of the
carefully   dried    residue were then ignited with strong          sulphuric
acid, with the following results        :—

 These results indicated that propionic and not butyric acid had been
produced, and the matter seemed worth further investigation, as there
 appears to bo some doubt as to a propionic fermentation from crude
 vegetable substances,      and it is certainly not mentioned in modern
 chemical or bacteriological text-books.          On the other hand, in the
 older chemical works such a fermentation is mentioned.               Thus in

    While in Richter's Organic Chemistry (English translation, 1900)
none of these methods are mentioned, the only process of a similar
kind for the production           of the acid         there alluded     to being the
fermentation of calcium malate and lactate.
    We therefore decided to prepare             a quantity      of the acid or acids
which the fermenting ulva gives rise                to, and to submit        them to     a
careful examination.
    Accordingly,     a considerable     quantity of the well-washed             seaweed
was fermented with sea water at 37° C. in large flasks until no
further evolution of        gases occurred,     which required about fourteen
days.     The resulting fluid was drained off from what remained of
the seaweed and distilled with dilute sulphuric acid until traces of
hydrochloric       acid    began     to   come       over.     The     distillate    was
neutralised      with caustic potash and evaporated               to dryness, when
about 25 grms. of solid residue were obtained.                    Experiments       with
weighed       quantities    of a known         sample      of   potassium butyrate
indicated      that the best method for extracting                 the acid was        to
treat a strong aqueous solution of the salt with sulphuric acid, and
then to extract with ether         ;  distillation     of the dry salt with con
centrated sulphuric acid leading to considerable charring and loss.
    The dried residue      was therefore dissolved         in  80 c.c. of water, the

phosphoric anhydride and separately fractionated.
     They       yielded      three fractions,           which       were      collected       at     the
following temperatures                :—

     The main portion of the distillate                       from the first fractionation
weighed 4-7 grins., and had an odour which closely resembled                                       that
of   a    known sample of propionic acid.
     It   was boiled with water and barium carbonate                          until   neutralised,
the resulting         solution filtered and evaporated on a water-bath                                to
a    syrup.       Its behaviour now              was curious.        Some of the syrup              was
dissolved in a little alcohol and ether was then added, when it                                     was
reprecipitated apparently in the same condition.                                 A drop        of the
syrup exposed              for several hours also dried up to                   a   gummy          mass
which refused            to crystallise.           But the main quantity                of syrupy
liquid suddenly solidified                 ou     stirring.        The   resulting      crystalline
mass was          washed with cold alcohol two or three times                             and was
then       dried.     It    behaved in precisely the same way as                          a    known
specimen of barium propionate.                       Thus it readily dissolved in                  cold
water      ;   and on adding alcohol to a concentrated solution                               thus ob
tained,        brilliant crystals          separated        out,    which,     when      examined
under the microscope,              had      very characteristic forms,                being     either
quadratic octohedra or combinations of the octohedra with                                       quad
ratic prisms.           Its analysis, however, showed that it contained                         small
quantities of an impurity which obstinately adhered to                                  it,    as the

    It  is evident from          these    figures    that some butyrate clings           ob
stinately to the propionate, and owing to its relative insolubility                        is
precipitated first, the bulk of the propionate being found in                            the
mother liquors.
    A qualitative reaction           was next employed for the identification
of the propionic acid.
    If  this acid is boiled with excess of litharge and the solution
allowed to remain in the cold for some time in contact with the
litharge,    a basic lead      salt is produced, which is more soluble in cold
than in hot water, and hence is precipitated on boiling the solution.
    Comparative experiments tried both with a known                           sample      of
propionic acid and with some of the fraction mentioned                              above,
boiling between 125°-150°, give precisely similar results when sub
mitted to this test,       a white powdery salt being precipitated from               each.
    The three fractions obtained from the lower boiling portions                           of
the    acids   obtained from          the    fermenting      ulca were examined            as
follows.
    A roughly graduated pipette was made, and with it                           the same
volume — about 0'2 c.c. — of each of the fractions was                          removed,
weighed, diluted          with water, titrated with — baryta,               the   titrated
fluid evaporated to dryness, and heated at 100° C. until of constant
weight, then ignited with sulphuric acid, and the resulting barium
sulphate weighed.
    The    following        table contains         the   results, calculated      in   such
manner      as   to be comparable both with                 each other and with the

     Although        these       results are           not entirely              satisfactory    or con
cordant, they certainly point to the occurrence of acetic as well as
propionic and butyric acids among the products of the fermenta
tion of ulva in sea water, but the identification of the former
with certainty        was not possible,                owing to the smallness of the low
boiling fraction and the difficulties attending the separation of a
given acid of the fatty series from a mixture with its homologues.
But the boiling point and higher specific gravity of                                             the    low
boiling fraction,          as   well as the percentage                 of barium found in the
barium salt obtained from                   it,   can scarcely be accounted                   for except
on the assumption that               it    contained acetic acid.
     Our experiments on               the fermentation               of Ulva latissima             in    sea
water thus afford evidence that at least three members of the fatty
series of acids are produced                  :     of these, however, propionic acidity
formed in by far the largest quantity.
               The Composition              of    the Tissues        of Ulva        latissima.
     The occurrence of               the    ulva in two localities (Dublin                       harbour
and Belfast Lough) in considerable quantities where crude sewage
makes its way into the sea, and the experiments just recorded on
the products          of its fermentation,                raised      several         questions which
rendered       it    advisable to make both an ultimate and proximate
analysis of its tissues.              Thus,       if   the growth of the weed in quantity
is   induced by pollution of the sea water by sewage, the weed itself
 might possibly be found to contain                       a    higher proportion of nitrogen
 than    is   present in other seaweeds which luxuriate only in pure                                     sea
 water.

   Proximate analysis. — The attempts            which      we have made to
isolate   any definite     compounds     as proximate       constituents of the
ulva have not been very successful, but it is only fair to ourselves
to say that we have not had time to study the matter exhaustively.
   Various experiments were tried with different solvents.
    When boiled with water the          seaweed  does not soften nor suffer
apparently any considerable change, and no blue colour is produced
when the infusion is treated with iodine.
   A   special experiment was made to ascertain whether any carbo
hydrate was present capable of ready hydrolysis               into   a  sugar, and
for this purpose     a  quantity of the washed ulva was treated for a
week in the cold with water containing 5 per cent, of sulphuric acid.
The extract was then drained away from the                   seaweed,     excess     of
barium carbonate added, the solution filtered and evaporated.
    During the evaporation, white amorphous matter                 separated       and
oily globules     also.   The dried residue      was   treated with         a    little
¦water,  the solution filtered and heated on      a  water-bath with          2 grms.
of crystallised      phenyl-hydrazine      hydrochlorate,       and    3 grms.       of
sodium     acetate,   but no trace of a crystallised          osazone     could be
obtained.       For the   sake  of comparison,     a  mixture      of   1  grm.      of
ordinary dextrose with the           same   quantities of      phenyl-hydrazine
hydrochlorate       and sodium acetate and water was heated               and gave
abundance of the yellow osazone.
    The amorphous matter turned out           to be magnesium           carbonate,
 with practically no organic matter.
    The remainder of the ulva, after treatment with acid, was well
 washed with distilled water, and then digested in the cold for a
 week with 5 per cent, caustic soda solution.           The resulting brown

liquid was coloured green by          a   slight  excess   of hydrochloric acid,
 and a brownish flocculent precipitate was produced.
    By treating the ulva with alcohol or ether, the chlorophyll, eta
are only very      slowly dissolved.       In a preliminary      experiment some
of the dry seaweed        was submitted         to the boiling reagent in an
extraction     apparatus for a    week    —  ether first, and alcohol later —
but at the end of that time it was still green in parts.
   In    a later   experiment,    14    grms. of the ulva — washed, dried,
and roughly powdered        — were boiled in        a flask with inverted        con
denser for a week with alcohol.              Each day the alcoholic extract
was filtered off and distilled         from     the same       (tared)   flask,   the
distillate being again employed for the extraction.
   The dried alcoholic extract weighed            2"35 grms., or about 17 per
cent, of the weight of the original dried seaweed.
   What remained of the latter was then dried and digested in                     the
cold for eight days with a 5 per cent,             solution    of caustic potash.
The liquid was then filtered off through              a weighed filter, and the
residue     of   seaweed   collected     on the latter,        well   washed and
weighed.       It amounted to about 7 grms.
   On     the supposition   that alcohol        removed all the chlorophyll,
fat, etc., and the caustic potash the albuminoids,                 the composition
of the dried seaweed may be          represented thus : —

   If   the percentage amount of nitrogen               found     in the ulva      be
multiplied     by the factor 6"25 (often employed for calculating in
such cases the 'Proteids'), the result is 38-6, which is not very
different from 33, and it must be remembered that the experiment
was only roughly quantitative.
                        Bacteriological     Examination.
    From the chemical examination of the products of the                    ferment
ing ulva, it seemed probable that it was attacked by at least two

1900-1901.]   Prof. Letts and      Mr Hawthorne        on    Ulva latissima. 281
different    species   of micro-organisms, — the first             producing fatty
acids together with hydrogen and carbonic anhydride                    ;   the second
causing the formation of sulphides.
    The evidence     on this point     was tolerably        clear,   for on several
occasions no sulphides were produced at all, and,                as a consequence,
no blackening      of the weed occurred, and no evolution of sulphur
etted hydrogen, although fermentation had been active, and fatty
acids had been plentifully         produced, together with hydrogen and
carbonic anhydride.         And in all our experiments in which                    the
weed     blackened,     the acid-producing        phase      of the    fermentation
preceded that of the sulphide formation by              a  considerable interval.
    Also, when     the ulva was allowed      to ferment in tap             water and
not in sea water, the production of sulphides was always delayed,
and very often did not occur at all.
    Numerous      attempts have been made            to    isolate the organisms
causing the two changes,           but not with absolute success             ; and we
may take this opportunity           to express    our thanks to          Dr Lorrain
Smith and Dr Tennant for the assistance                 they have        given us in
this branch of the investigation.
    Stained preparations of the fermenting ulva showed that spore-
forming     bacilli similar in appearance      to B. tetani were abundant,
but    all  attempts    to  isolate them by        Koch's       plate method or
Esmarck's       roll  tube   (anaerobic) cultures, either with ordinary
gelatine or agar media, failed, practically no colonies appearing.
    A  special culture fluid was then made with sea water containing
 1 per cent, peptone and       1 per cent, glucose,      and (after sterilisation )
flasks of this were inoculated        (A) with   a droplet of the liquid from
a  tube containing fermenting ulva and           sea   water,      and    (B) with   a
minute fragment of the ulva itself from the same tube after its
contents had been heated for twenty minutes to 80°                    C,    to destroy
 all but spores.
    These    cultures    when     incubated   grew,       and     showed,      it  was
 thought,   some signs of gas evolution.
    After five days    agar plate cultivations were made from both, but
 no colonies     appeared.       Similar  cultivations        were made with         a
 medium containing       1 percent, peptone and         1  per cent, glucose with
 sea  water and agar, both under aerobic           and anaerobic           conditions,
 but again without obtaining any definite growth of colonies.

   On the other hand, the glucose peptone sea water medium which
had been inoculated with a fragment of the fermenting weed,
heated to 80°       C,   developed acid, the amount of which was deter

   An experiment           was then        made on a larger       scale    with this
culture fluid, which was sterilised and inoculated with some drops
of the liquid from a test-tube containing              sea water,    glucose,     and
peptone, and a fragment of the fermenting viva.
   The flask containing           the inoculated    fluid was provided        with  a
cork and an arrangement for collecting               any gases   which might       be
evolved, and was placed in an incubator, where it remained for two
or three weeks, but no appreciable quantity of gas came off.                      The
contents of the flask were then distilled with sulphuric                    acid, the
distillate boiled with excess of barium             carbonate, and the filtered
solution      evaporated       to dryness.     A   small quantity of a gummy
barium       salt remained,        which qualitatively     resembled      the   crude
barium salt obtained from the fermentation                  of the weed, but its
amount was not sufficient for any quantitative experiments.
    Attempts were next made to obtain colonies of the micro-organ
ism by employing a substratum of the weed itself.                 Some fronds of
the viva were pressed and dried, and then attached to glass plates
by    weak gelatine solution.              The plates   so   prepared     were next
sterilised by heat, and three of them treated as follows                : —
    On No.      1, some   sterilised gelatine solution was poured, previously
inoculated with        a  droplet taken from a tube containing             sea water
and    a  fragment of viva which had fermented                but had not black
ened.       On No.     2 some     sterilised agar was poured which had been
similarly inoculated         ;  and on No. 3 the same medium, inoculated
from the same source,            which had previously been heated           to 80° C.
 for twenty minutes.
    Of   these three plate cultivations,        well-marked     colonies appeared
 on Nos.     1  and   2.    No.   3, was   doubtful and too much dried up.

1900-1901.]           Prof. Letts and   Mr Hawthorne             on     Ulva latissima. 283
      Two colonies from No.             1   and four from No. 2 were planted                       out
in tubes containing              fragments         of ulva and sea water previously
sterilised.            In three days the tubes inoculated with No.                            1   had
given off a good deal of gas, and one of those inoculated                               with No.
2     had      also    given off gas and its contents were turbid.                       It   seems
probable, therefore, that by this method the organism causing the
acid fermentation was isolated.
      Regarding          the second or sulphide-forming                   phase    of    the fer
mentation, as we have already said, it always occurred much later
than the first or acid             phase, and frequently               did not take place           at
all   ; and although the presence                 of sea water does not appear to be
absolutely            essential to its occurrence, yet undoubtedly                it materially
assists        it,   and for that reason we are inclined                 to believe that the
sulphides            owe their origin chiefly to sulphates in the water, and
possibly in the ulva itself, and not to the albuminoids                             present in
such abundance in the weed.
      There      is    also some   evidence to show that the organisms con
cerned in the process occur in the mud of the foreshore where the
ulva      is   found, and not in the sea water.
      The following experiment brings out                  these facts.
      A   number of test-tuhes were partly filled with sea water, and
others         with tap water, and in               each   a   piece     of ulva was placed
previously well washed in tap water, and all air bubbles adhering
to the weed wore got rid of by pressure with   glass rod.            a
      A   cotton-wool plug was then inserted in the mouth of each tube,
which was made              to support a strip         of paper moistened with lead
acetate, which hung about an inch above the surface of the liquid.
    In    addition to five such tubes containing                  the washed weed and
sea water, and five containing the washed weed and tap water, two
similar tubes were prepared containing unwashed weed,                                   one       with
sea water and the other             with tap water.            All     the tubes were then
placed in tho incubator.                    In    24   hours    the acid phase            of       the
fermentation            had commenced in all the tubes,                   indicated      by the
inflation of the weed by the evolved gases.
    In    48 hours the lead paper                in the tube containing the unwashed
weed and sea water had begun to blacken distinctly, and that
containing            the untcaslied weed and tap water was also tinged,
though faintly.             In   72 hours the lead papers              in all the   sea water

tubes were strongly blackened, but those in the fresh water tubes
remained unaffected, except the one in the tube containing                          the
unwashed weed.            In  168 hours the       unwashed     weed in sea water
was itself beginning to blacken, but the contents of the tap water
tubes had still only faintly blackened                 their lead     papers.    Even
after a month, the difference in the appearance of the contents of
the two set of tubes was very noticeable.
     Zelinsky * has described         an organism     which he named Bacterium
hydrosulfureum         potdicum, and obtained from the ooze of the Black
Sea,    which reduces sulphates          to sulphides, and evolves sulphuretted
hydrogen.         He employed       a special culture fluid    for its growth, con
taining     1  per cent, solution of ammonium tartrate,              1  to 2 per cent,
solution      of grape sugar, £ to         J per cent, of sodium hyposulphite,
 O'l per cent, of potassium phosphate, and traces of calcium chloride.
     "We prepared some of this fluid and inoculated                (sterilised)  tubes
of   it with minute fragments of the following :—
     1.   Ulva which had fermented with             sea water   for     12 months     in
 a  stoppered bottle.
     2.   Ulva which had       been fermented       with tap water for the same
 time and under similar conditions.
     Lead papers were suspended in the upper part of each tube by
 cotton-wool plugs, and the tubes then placed in the incubator.
 Wc     also prepared a similar set of tubes containing                J  per cent, of
 ferrous sulphate instead of the hyposulphite,               and inoculated       them
 in the    same way.       The first    series we shall call   A and the second B.
     In   99 hours the lead papers            in all the tubes were blackened
 except B       2,  and    a filmy growth was beginning to form on the
 surface of the liquid in two of the tubes.              After   a  further interval
 of 24 hours,      A  1  was covered with a        pink growth, and        A 2  with    a
 white growth.         A   1 was plated out in ordinary          agar medium, but
 it  gave no colonies, but       A   2,  similarly treated,   gave plenty      of well-
 defined colonies.         Three of the latter were again plated out and
 inoculation from the resulting              colonies made in tubes containing
 sterilised ulva and sea water, when after 5 days a whitish growth
 began to appear        in the  tubes, and 2 days later their           contents were
 giving off sulphuretted hydrogen.

190O-1901.]  Prof. Letts and Mr Hawthorne on Ulva latissima. 285
   We   have not had time to pursue the bacteriological       investigation
further, which very possibly in more experienced hands might have
given more definite results, but we believe that the following con
clusions are warranted from our experiments        : —
   (1) When the Ulva latissima         ferments in water, it is attacked
by a species    of micro-organism, which is a spore-forming        bacillus,
and   which probably infests the weed itself.        The products of this
fermentation    consist mainly    of   propionic   acid, but    other fatty
acids are formed    in smaller quantities, together with carbonic         an
hydride and hydrogen.        This micro-organism probably attacks the
albuminoids of the seaweed.
   (2) The fermenting ulva is attacked later by a second species of
micro-organism, with the production eventually of ferrous sulphide
and sulphuretted hydrogen.        It seems probable that these sulphur
compounds are produced from the sulphates of the sea water (or
those contained in the tissues of the ulva), and not from the
albuminoids     of the seaweed,     and   that the micro-organisms        are
derived from the mud of the foreshore where the ulva grows.
    Our experiments     so far do not enable      us to decide definitely
whether the sulphuretted       hydrogen is produced directly from the
sulphates    (or possibly the albuminoids), or indirectly from the
ferrous sulphide, by the action of the organic acids.         We are, how
ever, of the opinion that some of the gas at least owes its origin to
the second of these two causes.
              Ulva latissima in relation   to Sewage   Pollution.
    The evidence which we have collected tending to prove that the
 occurrence of Ulva latissima in quantity in any locality is asso
 ciated with the pollution of the sea water by sewage            is of three
 kinds.
    First, that afforded by the composition of the weed itself, or
 rather by the proportion of nitrogen it contains. Second, from
 experiments     made on the assimilation of nitrogenous         compounds
 by the growing       ulva  from   sea water     purposely   polluted  ;  and
 third, from an examination        of the localities   in which    the   weed
 occurs    in abundance, and of       those   from   which it is virtually
 absent.

    We shall discuss each of these separately.
    1.    The proportion of nitrogen in the Ulva. — The most interest
 ing and important result of our analyses of the tissues of the weed
 —and       certainly the most surprising one to us — is the extraordinary
 proportion of nitrogen which they contain.                    In the following table
 the percentage of nitrogen             in some    other (dried) seaweeds is com

   Not only is the proportion of nitrogen in ulva extraordinarily
high compared with that present in other seaweeds, but also with
vegetables generally.             Indeed, in nitrogen       content    it resembles an
animal rather than a vegetable product, as                  will   be seen from         the

1900-1901.]     Prof. Letts and           Mr Hawthorne                    on Ulva latissima,                   287
     The farmers on the shores of Belfast Lough have discovered the
value      of the ulva      as a manure,         and large quantities are carted away
by them and used on their land.                           It   no doubt fails              in   phosphates,
but contains the necessary                    potassium salts.                 It   is probable that             it
would be greatly              improved          for    most          crops by the addition                      of
calcium phosphate or basic slag.
     2.    Assimilation      experiments.        — Our         first idea was to contrast the
extent of growth of the tdva in pure                           sea      water and in polluted                  sea
water       respectively      ;    and accordingly,                as    far       as possible,      similar
tufts      of the growing           weed,      adhering to stones,                   etc.,      and freshly
removed from the sea-shore, were placed in two glass aquaria, one
of    which was filled with the                 pure       sea water of the                Irish Channel
and the other with the same water to which 2h per cent, of Belfast
sewage        had been added.                 Photographs                were       then taken of the
 two tanks,        with     the object of contrasting                     them with photographs
 on the same scale to be taken later.
      The result of this experiment was, however, curious,                                       as the weed
 in both tanks soon               became unhealthy                 and died in         a   month or two.
 We believe that the explanation was that in both cases the ulva
 was       killed by the strong sunlight                           to    which        at     times    it       was
 exposed,       as    the    two     aquaria          containing              it    were        placed     in     a
 window facing south-west, and the experiment was made in the
 spring-time.
      Since then we have had a specimen                              of the seaweed               growing in
 a    glass dish placed near              a    window          with       a    northern          aspect    ;    for
 months,       and as we write, it is still in                 a   perfectly healthy condition.
 It    is a mere     frond of the ulva, and was picked                               up on the shore,
 unattached          to any support, and indeed, when we commenced                                              our
 experiments with            it,   we were       afraid that             it   would be of no use to
 us.        But this frond          has       remained in perfect                     health for seven
 months, during             which time         it   has been             treated with several                   dif
  ferent specimens           of foul      sea    water, and in the intervals                         has not
  been supplied with any pure sea water;                                for after the failure of our
  first experiment          it     occurred to us that                   a     far better method of
  investigation would be to examine the water in which the weed
     was growing, and not the weed itself.
          The methods of water analysis are delicate, and by contrasting
     the composition        of samples of           sea   water both before and after the

288           Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                  [nsa.
ulva had been allowed          to grow in them, it seemed to us that the
information     we desired ought to be readily obtained.
   The following experiments were therefore made : —
   The frond of ulva employed was well washed for about an hour
in running tap water       to free it from debris.        It  was of large size,
its area being 147 square inches, or about              1  square foot, and its
active surface therefore twice that amount.
   The dish in which it was placed was           a circular glass vessel,     with
flat bottom and vertical sides, S inches in diameter and 3 inches
high.     It was provided with a cover similar            to itself, and it con
tained in our experiments 1600 c.c. of water.               In order    to get the
frond of    seaweed   into the dish, it was folded across the middle.
   Experiment     1. — Assimilation of        Ammonia.     —A      sample of sea
water was employed which was collected from                 a locality in Belfast
Lough where several small sewers discharge directly into the                   sea,
and was therefore       presumably     polluted.     The frond of viva was
rinsed in the dish with some of this water, which was thrown away,
and the dish then filled with more of the same                    water, the air-
bubbles entangled in the folds of the seaweed               being got rid of by
gentle pressure with a glass rod.         Some of the water was analysed
before this was done, while after a week had elapsed a quantity of
the water was removed from the dish and also analysed.
   The results of    the two analyses were as follows          : —
                                                           Parts per 100,000.

                                                   Ammonia.          Ammonia.

The   seaweed    had therefore absorbed every trace of free ammonia
from the water, a result which was quite unexpected and highly
interesting.     On the other hand, none of the albuminoid                 matter
had been absorbed, which, however, is quite in accordance with the
known facts regarding         plant   nutrition.    In    order to verify this
result, the ulva was allowed          to remain in the same             water for
another week, when        a second analysis was made with precisely the
same results as before.

    Experiment      2. — Assimilation     of Ammonia.      — This      experiment
was made with the view of getting some idea of the rapidity with
which the ulva can absorb free ammonia from                 sea water, and also
to ascertain whether it can thrive in a very highly polluted water.
The frond of ulva had remained in the             sea water of the last experi
ment an additional         four days, making eighteen days in all, and
appeared to be quite healthy.
    A   sample of sea water was collected from the same locality as
before, and to it     1  per cent, of sewage      was added (obtained from
the pumping station at the Belfast Main Drainage Outfall).                     This
mixture gave, on analysis, the following results : —

But    as it contained   less free ammonia than was expected, a standard
solution of ammonium           chloride was added, sufficient to bring up
the   free ammonia      to 0'050 parts per 100,000.
    The frond of ulva      was drained from the first sample of sea water
and rinsed with this mixture,            again drained,     and the dish then
filled with the     same mixture.
    It   was intended     to make a series       of analyses of the contents
of the dish at intervals         of about twenty-four        hours, but to our
astonishment       we found      that   practically   the whole      of the free
ammonia had been absorbed after            a period of only seventeen hours,

   Experiment     3. — Assimilation    of Nitrates. — The result         of these
experiments, as well as other considerations           to be mentioned         pre
sently, induced      us to extend     our   inquiry somewhat further, in
order to     ascertain whether the ulva can absorb nitrogen in the
form of nitrates, with the same ease and rapidity as it assimilates
that element as ammonia.
   The   same   frond of ulva was again used, which had now been
under    observation in the dish for six months.               In  the interval
from the last experiment, the water in which              it was growing had
been changed only        once.    On examination,         it was found that,
owing to the inflation       of some    of its   under surface by evolved
oxygen,    a portion of the frond had become quite dry and almost
bleached.       We thought it highly probable that it was no longer
in  a sufficiently    healthy  condition     for further experiment         ;   but
having no other specimen at hand, we decided to test its vigour
by its power of absorbing ammonia.
   Some fresh sea water was therefore obtained and examined                       as
follows : — 200    c.c. were  distilled until    100   c.c. had    passed     over,
and 50 c.c. of this distillate were Nesslerised for the free ammonia.
The residue left in the distilling flask was then diluted to the
original   volume (200 c.c.) with ammonia free water, and treated
 with zinc-copper couple for twenty-four hours at ordinary tempera
tures, then poured off, again distilled,      and the distillate Nesslerised.
The results of the analysis were       as follows  : —
                                                        Parts per 100,000

  Sufficient         ammonium chloride was added to this sea water to
bring up the nitrogen                as free     ammonia to 0'042 parts per 100,000,
and this strength was verified by a determination                                   made as before.
  The frond of ulva                 was now drained from the sea water in which
it had been immersed for some months, rinsed with the new sample
prepared        as   just described, and            the dish then filled with the latter.
  After twenty-four                  hours,      200    c.c. of     the       water were          removed
from the dish, distilled,                     and the distillate          Nesslerised, when no
free ammonia was found, proving                         that the seaweed                was still       in    a
perfectly vigorous condition.                      This     was also shown by the copious
evolution of oxygen which had occurred from                                   it,   the gas remaining
entangled in the folds of the frond.
      The water in the dish was next poured off, and sufficient of                                           a
standard solution of potassium nitrate added to                                   it   to bring up the
nitric nitrogen            to   0   05    parts per 100,000, when                      it   was   emptied
back again.           The frond of ulra was now in contact with ammonia-
free sea water containing nitrates, and was allowed                                     to remain thus
foT 70    hours, when            a   portion of the water was removed from the
dish, and the             nitrates determined by the same process as before.
The water was found                      to contain 0-005 parts                   of nitric nitrogen,
showing that the ulva had absorbed                             90    per cent, of the amount
originally       present.
      The results of the preceding experiment leave no doubt                                      as to the
energetic power which                Ulva latissima           possesses of absorbing nitrogen
from polluted sea water, both in the form of ammonia and of nitrates.
They also        clearly demonstrate that this seaweed                                 can flourish in
highly polluted water               j    and in addition, they lend                    a    good deal        of
support       to the theory which we had gradually been                                     led to form,
that the occurrence of the ulva in quantity in                                a   given locality may
be regarded          as   a   sign of sewage pollution.
      From the results of these experiments                         it   is   possible       to calculate
the rate of growth of the ulva under the existing conditions                                      ;   for,   as
its tissues contain 6"18 per cent, of nitrogen,                           it
                                                                          is         obvious that the
nitrogen      lost by the water in which                      it   was placed,             multiplied        by
the    factor   ~,        gives the weight of the seaweed formed.
      Thus,   in experiment              2,   the water lost 0-049 per 100,000 of free
or saline      ammonia in 17              hours.       This   is   equivalent to 0-0404 parts
 of   nitrogen per 100,000;                   and as   it   was removed             from 1600 c.c. of

water, its actual weight          was 0-0000404 x 16 = 0-0006464              grm.,
and this, multiplied       by the factor ~g, gives 0-0104 grm., or about
1   centigram, as the actual weight of seaweed formed.
    A   series of determinations showed that        1 square inch of the dried
ulva weighs on an average 0*009 grm., so that in this experiment
£2£, say,     1-1   square inches, of the ulva        were formed,       which is
equivalent to nearly 0*8 per cent, of the original frond.
     "We hope to       make further experiments         in order to ascertain
whether the rate of nitrogen assimilation is constant, or varies                with
the concentration, and also          to what extent the rate is affected by
differences in illumination.
     3. The localities    in   which     Uiva latissima     occurs in quantity
contrasted with those from which it is virtually absent.              — "We may
first of all draw attention to two particular            localities which have
come more        immediately under our observation where this seaweed
is abundant,        and  one   from    which it is almost       entirely   absent,
because an examination of the conditions obtaining                in  these,   offers
some very       striking evidence in favour of the view mentioned above,
viz., that the occurrence of the viva in quantity is an indication                 of
sewage      pollution.
     The first two localities       we refer to are Belfast        Lough and a
 part of Dublin Bay, and the second is Strangford              Lough.
      Belfast Lough.
                        — According to the statements of             some    of the
 older inhabitants       of the neighbourhood,        Ulva latissima was not
 present in former times in the very large quantities in which                     it
 now occurs in the upper reaches             of the Lough,       but the Zostra
 marina, or       sea grass,   now    found   only in    small quantities,       was
 abundant.
      Up   to the year     1889    the bulk of the sewage          of the city of
  Belfast was allowed to flow directly into the Lagan river.                 But in
  that year a new main drainage system was inaugurated by which the
 greater part of the sewage is collected in two main channels, and
  from them pumped           into a tank,    the contents of which are dis
  charged      (on the ebb-tide only)         through    a   submarine       culvert
  opening some distance seawards.              Belfast,  as every      one knows,
  has grown with remarkable rapidity, and there can therefore be no
  question that for that reason alone very much more sewage makes
  its way into the Lough now than formerly, and this amount has

1900-1901.]       Prof . Letts and Mr Hawthorne on Ulvalatissima.                       293
undoubtedly           been    increased       since   the introduction       of the main
drainage scheme,            the Lagan river no longer acting                as  a settling-
tank in which the bulk of the sewage solids were deposited.
    The tides in the upper reaches                 of the Lough        are sluggish, and
from      float     experiments       made      by    the engineer to the Harbour
Board,      it would     seem that the greater part of the sewage                 does not
make     its way out of the Lough on                the ebb-tide, but having drifted
a   certain       distance seawards,         is washed backwards            by the flood-
tide   in   a bifurcating      stream,    which distributes it over         a  wide area.
    In Dublin Bay the conditions under which Ulva latissima
occurs in quantity are both interesting and significant.
    Broadly speaking, the upper                   reaches    of the Bay are divided
artificially       into two portions by the so-called Pigeon House wall,
which        extends for more than              a   mile and     a half in     an  easterly
direction,        and    terminates       in     Poolbeg     lighthouse.        A   second
wall, called the North             Bull wall, juts out from          the northern shore
of    the     Bay     at   Dollymount,        and extends in        a. S.E. direction     to
within       about 1000 feet of Pool Beg lighthouse, terminating                       in  a
 second       lighthouse      called     the    Bull.     The    northern     part of    the
 Bay    thus almost enclosed by the two walls forms the harbour.
 On the other hand, the southern portion of the Bay is quite open.
    The harbour           receives    not only       the waters of the Liffey river
into which the major portion of the city                     sewage     at present flows,
but also those         of the Tolka river,            which    is polluted     by  a  large
sewer       running      into    it  close    to   its mouth, while        another large
sewer discharges directly on to the northern shore close to the city,
as   well as a considerable number of smaller sewers                      the whole way
thence to       Dollymount.
     On the other hand, no sewers                 of any magnitude (if indeed any
 at all ? ) discharge their contents into the southern portion of the
 Bay until Blackrock and Kingstown are reached, which are quite
 at  its mouth.          Thus, broadly         speaking, the northern           portion of
 Dublin Bay consists of            a polluted area, while the southern portion
 is unpolluted.          Now, plenty of the ulva           is found     on the northern
 shores of       the harbour, and is washed up along the Clontarf fore
 shore,     where, as in Belfast           Lough,      it rapidly putrefies in warm
  weather, and gives           rise to    a  nuisance.       On the other hand, the
 southern       portions     of the Bay          seem    to be quite clear of the sea

weed  until Blackrock and Kingstown                         are    reached, where it is
found in fair quantity.
  On Plates 2 and 3 we give charts of these two localities (Belfast
Lough and Dublin Bay), on which we have marked in black those
areas     over     which     the ulva       is chiefly      distributed.           It   must be
recollected that much of this seaweed                  is unattached by any stalk,
and drifts about from place to place.                       Hence no chart can                  be
drawn     to represent where          it will   be found on        all    occasions,    and the
Plates must therefore, in respect of the occurrence of the weed, be
regarded merely as diagrams.
   Strangford       Lough,     which is quite          close      to Belfast       Lough,       re
sembles the latter in extent of area, and also in the large surfaces
uncovered in its upper reaches at low water.                             It   differs from      it,
however, in that no large town               is   situated on its banks.                In this
Lough Ulva latissima           is   practically absent.
  The above-mentioned                facts seem       to offer strong irrima               fade
evidence that the growth of                  Ulva latissima          is       associated    with
sewage     pollution of        sea water,       and    as   a     consequence that              its
occurrence in quantity in            a   particular    locality may be regarded as
an indication of sewage pollution.                 There can, at all events, be no
doubt as to the nuisance which this seaweed                          can at times           give
rise to, which closely resembles that                  proceeding             from very foul
sewage.     And there can also            be no doubt          as to the       extraordinary
powers of nitrogen assimilation which                 it   possesses.

Solar Radiation and Earth Temperatures. By Professor
              C. G. Knott. (With a Plate.)
                            (Read January   21   and February 4, 1901.)
      At   a recent meeting of the Society,                  Dr Buchan read           a paper
based on certain observations of the temperature                           of the waters of
the Mediterranean,                 which had been made by the staff of                        the
Austrian ship Pola.                These indicated that the direct effect of solar
radiation was felt to a depth of over 150 feet.                            At   any rate,     the
facts were that the temperature of the upper stratum                             of water of
this thickness          was perceptibly           higher    at    about 4 p.m. than at
8 a.m., and that the difference was about                        l°-5 Fahr. or 0°-8         Cent,
at the surface,              diminishing fairly         steadily     to value zero          at a
depth of fully 150 feet or 50 metres.                       It   may easily be calculated
that this excess of temperature at the afternoon                            hour means        the
accumulation           of    an amount of heat equal to               1   460 units in every
column         of    water     1   square       centimetre in section;          and    this     is
accomplished           within the eight hours from                 8 a.m.     to 4 p.m.        It
must be noted that this accumulation of heat is a daily occurrence.
  The whole process of the heating and cooling of any portion                                  of
the earth's surface is a very complicated one.                            Doubtless    there is
constant        radiation       into    space    going on steadily          day and night.
During the day the solar energy enters the atmosphere and                                    part
of it reaches the earth's surface, heating the matter there.                                  At
night this direct heating               effect   is absent        There must, therefore,
result     a   steady periodic         state of temperature change, a daily                   see
saw, as much on the average being lost every night as is gained
every day.            This daily fluctuation is of         course subject to a seasonal
variation, depending primarily on the declination                           of the sun, but
also, as       Langley has shown, on atmospheric                     conditions,      the true
nature of which is at present a matter of speculation.                             But      what
ever these           conditions        may be, and         whatever       may be      the    real
physical        process       by which       the see-saw         of temperature        is pro
duced in the Mediterranean                  waters, we must regard this resultant
accumulation of heat during the day as due to solar radiation, direct
and indirect.           And the first question which demands                       an answer
is,   what fraction          of the whole heat supplied by the sun                    is    repre

seuted by this quantity which gets stored up in the surface waters
of the Mediterranean           ?    Making       a rough calculation,      I  found that
this stored-up heat was more than could be reasonably accounted
for   if  we accept      Langley's         estimate     of the solar constant.           Ac
cording to Langley's                measurements,          the    solar energy       which
flows     every minute normally                across   a square     centimetre of the
earth's     surface,    after     a  portion       has   been     absorbed   by    a   clear
atmosphere, is about           2 calories.        In  otber words, if     a  cubic centi
metre of water were set with one face pointing to the sun, and                             if
the solar energy crossing that face were all transformed into heat
within the cubic centimetre of water,                  the temperature of the water
would      be raised    1°  Cent, in one minute.              Hence an accumulation
of  ] 460 calories under each square centimetre of the surface means
that with      a  steadily vertical sun, and with no loss in other direc
tions, the sun would require to shine for 590 minutes, or nearly
six hours.        But six hours of         a   vertical sun is an impossibility,        and
it is certain that the solar radiation               incident upon the face of the
 waters     is   not  wholly transformed into                 heat   within the water.
 A definite fraction       is reflected,       and  a  definite amount must always
be passing out        by convection, radiation,             emission,    and other pro
 cesses.     Taking all       these conditions          into account,    we have      great
difficulty in believing          that, between the morning and afternoon of
each day, heat to the amount of 1460 units can be accumulated in
 the surface waters of the              sea,   unless we can discover some other
source of heat than the direct radiation of the sun.
    To make       the comparison more complete,                I  have  made a detailed
calculation of the amount of solar heat supplied to each square centi
 metre of the earth's surface in the latitude of the Mediterranean,
 the calculation being based on Langley's                    broad results.       To  make
 an   accurate      calculation       is at present        an    impossibility  ;  for the
 necessary     data are not yet to hand.            Langley has shown indisputably
 that selective absorption in the atmosphere                       makes   it impossible
 to treat the absorptive            action of the air         as a  whole. That is to
 say,   if the radiant energy of               the sun is reduced        from    E   to  aE
 after transmission through             a given mass of air, we cannot assume
 that it will be reduced to            a"E after transmission through              n times
 the given mass of air.            The assumption may reasonably enough bo
 made for each       individual ray          ;  but, since tho coefficient of trans

mission varies greatly            with the wave-length             and according      to a
law which experiment alone can discover, the use of                        a mean    value
of a for the whole radiation              will necessarily give too great          a value
for the transmissibility         through increasing masses of air.                Bearing
this in mind, we may for the present purpose assume                              the   law
mentioned, although we know that                     it is only  a first rough   approxi
mation and      will give too high          a value     for the transmissibility     when
the altitude of the sun is small.
   Langley's broad result is that the energy of the solar radiation,
which reaches        the earth's surface after transmission                  through the
vertical    depth of atmosphere, is about two-thirds                      of the energy
which would reach the surface if the air were absent.                         Calling this
coefficient of transmission a, we               see    that if £ represents the zenith
distance of the sun the mass of air traversed is roughly propor
tional    to sec £.      The radiation         falling normally on unit surface is
therefore proportional to a             sec C.     Hence the radiation         falling on
each square centimetre of the earth's horizontal                      surface is propor
tional to cos    £.  a  sec   C.  If   we multiply this by the element of time
and integrate from sunrise to culmination,                      we shall get half the
quantity of solar energy which falls on each square centimetre of
the earth's surface during one day.                    Let X    be the latitude     of the
place and     8 the sun's declination            at the time considered, then the
zenith     distance    £    is connected with the time by means of the
formula

   These numbers are shown             graphically in the Plate, fig. 2 (upper
curve).
    Multiplying    the numbers in the second column by twice the
value of the solar constant, we get in absolute units the amount of
heat supplied daily by the sun to unit area of the earth's horizontal
surface.    According      to  Langley's elaborate researches the value of
the solar constant may be taken as 3 calories per square centi
metre per minute.          Hence, multiplying by 6 we find that                  there
fall on  each   square centimetre of the earth's surface, in the lati
tude of the Mediterranean,             950 units of        heat during the mid
summer day.
    To compare with the data furnished                by the Pola observations,
which were made          during     the months       of   July, August and Sep
tember, we should however              take, not the midsummer value, but
the average value during these months.                 This average is      less  than
850 units      per day.       But, further,       the temperature        observations
were made in the morning               and    afternoon,     say, at     8 a.m.     and
4  p.m., an interval    of only eight hours.            Evaluating the        areas   of
the curves through        an interval       of   four hours from culmination
instead of through the half day, we get in place of the first four
numbers in the small table above the values                   136,    131,   120, 97.
The mean of      these   is 121, giving a total supply during the eight
hottest hours of the day of only 730 units of heat to each square
centimetre of surface.
    Let  us now consider the data            which Dr Buchan has extracted
from the Pola observations.            They    are contained      in the following

temperature means an accumulation during the eight hours of 1460

in   the same time.        We know, moreover, that all the incident solar
energy cannot be absorbed by the water, but that                      a  considerable
fraction is reflected or        escapes     in other ways.      It  therefore seems
impossible      to explain      the afternoon       temperature excess       down to
 these depths        in the Mediterranean            as  a  result  of direct     solar
 radiation.      The only other way out of the difficulty is               to suppose
 that there is     some considerable         error in one or other of the sets of
 experimentally        ascertained facts on which the present discussion is
based.      To make the facts compatible we should have either                        to
 diminish by      at least one    half the temperature differences observed
 by the officers and crew of the Pola, or greatly to increase                       the
 value of the solar constant.               I  do  not think that the broad re
 sults   obtained       by Langley can          be  seriously  called    in question,
 or that there is any ground for believing                 that the true value of
 the solar constant can be much greater than the value estimated
 by him.
    A careful study of Langley's measurements and reductions leaves
 on the mind little doubt as to the main accuracy of his conclusions,
 which differ from the conclusions of previous investigators                         by
 assigning a somewhat greater value to the solar constant.                     A very
 careful scrutiny of the conditions under which the Pola observa
 tions were obtained and the methods employed, supplemented by
 similar    series    of observations        carried   out in wide oceans, might
 determine how far the results were affected by purely                      local con
 ditions.     At present it        seems      to be impossible      to   suggest   any
 satisfactory      explanation       of   the extraordinary      magnitude      of the
 depth to which the daily solar radiation                apparently     penetrates in
 the Mediterranean         Sea.
     It has been long known that the solar radiation penetrates to                     a
 comparatively        small depth in the rocky material of the earth.                In
 1837 Professor         Forbes    began a valuable series        of observations of
 temperature at various depths in the rock of the Calton                   Hill, Edin
 burgh    ; and the main conclusions from these may be found                in several
 of our modern text-books           (e.g.  Tait's Heat).     Thus the conductivity
 of the rock is easily calculated by methods furnished by Fourier
 in his classical work Theorie de la Chaleur (1822). From this,
 in combination with the observed rate of increase of temperature
 with depth, an estimate may                be made as to the amount of heat

lost by the earth every year.                              This is perhaps the           most interesting
of all results deducible from measurements of earth temperatures.
     There           is,   however, another direction of enquiry                               suggested       by
the comparison made                     in the early part of the present                         paper,       and
that      is   to estimate          the accumulation                  of heat at different times               of
year throughout                   the rocky              stratum.        \Vhen this      is    done   a    com
parison may then be made between the heat so accumulated                                                      and
the available quantity of energy according to Langley's estimate.
Thus       we should expect to find that during                                 a    particular month          of
the year there was more heat accumulated in the rocky stratum
than during any other month.                                    This will       be due to the excess           of
radiation supplied in the summer months.                                         The relation between
these two quantities may possibly lead to an approximate measure
ment of the emissive power of the earth.
     In   the calculations which follow                         I     have used as the fundamental
data       the       earth temperatures                    during        the    eight   years     beginning

nection with sun-spot periodicity.                                   There are four thermometers

stants, of which p and p should have the same value.        The                                               con
stant p is calculated at once by taking the ratio of any two of                                                the
amplitudes, and dividing the Napierian                               logarithm of this ratio by
the difference of depth of the corresponding                                    thermometers.                 The
three values of           p found in this way by combining the 1 st                                 and 2nd,

0-003C3, giving a mean of 0-00392.
    Then p may be calculated from the phases when the expression
A   cos 6 +     B sin      0 is    thrown into the form                    P    cos (6 +      Q)    ;   for this
quantity Q must be equal to -px + q. We have four equations to
determine two quantities.  Working them out by the method of
least squares,        we find
                             p = 000371                        2 = 0-9629.
    The difference between p and                        p is not more than what                           might
reasonably be expected.
    Finally, calculating              the   value of           V    from        each set, we get the
four     values       10 34,      10-35,        10-03,        and    1T2,           a very     satisfactory
result, giving        a mean       of 10-48.
    Hence we may write the most important                                  term representing                   the
annual wave of temperature passing downwards                                             into the       rock of

    This   gives      a   wave-length of about 16'93 metres, but before this

   A    better estimate may, however, be made from the temperature
observations themselves              if   we first of all calculate the values at the
surface.      This requires          us to   work out the                successive     harmonics in
the same way in which the first has been treated.                                         The results

  The comparative smallness of the amplitudes of the third and

   Calculating the numerical           values at the surface (z = 0) for the
successive    months, we get       a  set of temperatures which may con
veniently     be  tabulated      along with the means          of  the observed
temperatures at the different depths.             We   are now furnished with
five  columns of numbers, each row containing                 the simultaneous
temperatures at the surface and the positions occupied by                        the
thermometers.        The calculated values of the surface temperatures
are given in the last      column of the table on p. 302 above.                 We
may now get fairly accurate             determinations     of the accumulated
heat  within the crust      at any time by multiplying          the mean of       the
temperatures at each pair of consecutive positions as we                  descend
by the distance      between the corresponding            positions measured       in
centimetres.       The   four     quantities    so  obtained are      then   added
together,    and the result multiplied           by the thermal capacity         per
unit volume.       Reducing to the Centigrade as unit, and subtracting
the smallest    of the numbers from all the others,            we finally obtain
a series  of numbers representing the annual gain and loss of                  heat
under each square centimetre of the earth's surface.                 In this     cal
culation we neglect the heat which penetrates                below the     deepest
thermometer.        This, however, is comparatively small, and             besides
the determination of the surface temperatures will almost certainly
involve   as largo errors.      The final results are shown graphically in
the Plate, fig. 3, and are given in the following             table, which con
tains, in addition to the monthly values deduced from the tempera
tures  as  originally tabulated, intermediate values obtained               by cal
culation from the interpolated values taken from the curves.

solar constant, namely        6, we get the daily         heating expressed         in
calories.    The values are given in the third column.
    The particular values of the declination entered in the first
column are the values at equal intervals of a month. With these
as abscissze,    and with     the corresponding         values     of the     energy
supplied    per day, we may construct         a  curve showing the manner
in which the heating      effect varies from day to day throughout                the
year.      The   curve is    given in the        Plate,    fig.   3.    From this
curve by estimation of areas we can readily calculate the whole
amount of radiant energy supplied by the sun during any assigned
period of time.      Thus we find
         Energy supplied during summer months,                     114,840
                  „         „         winter         „               19,030
     Roughly speaking,    the sun supplies during         the summer months
 in our latitudes nearly 100,000 units of energy per unit area in
 excess of what it supplies during the winter months.                  But of this
 amount only 1200 units accumulate in the crust in the form of
 heat.    In other words only about       1 per cent, of the energy falling on
 the surface of the earth is allowed to accumulate in the crust of
 the earth as heat.    The remaining 99 per cent, escapes by radiation
 and convection      or is partly     reflected   back untransformed             into
 heat.    This  seems to be quite       a reasonable      result, and contrasts
 markedly with the extraordinary result given in the first part of
 the paper.
    The above estimate is necessarily of a rough character.                  In this
 country the sunshine which reaches the earth's surface so as to be
 propagated    downwards as     a  wave of heat is on the average much
 less than what would be       in  a clear atmosphere         similar to that in
 which    Langley    worked.      Consequently      the overplus        of    energy
 supplied in the warmer         months of the year is probably                  over
 estimated.     Then again there is some doubt as to the surface values
 of temperature as deduced       from the Calton       Hill    thermometers,      for
 a complete   account of which      I  refer to  a paper     shortly to be pub
 lished  in the Transactions of this Society by Mr Heath.                     Had I
 been   aware sooner of the fact that Mr Heath was preparing an
 elaborate discussion of the Calton       Hill rock    thermometers,       I  should
 not have taken the trouble to make           an harmonic         analysis of the

310          Proceedings   of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                        [sbs.
eight years' observations    already published by Piazzi Smyth.                These
I  have used as they were given, without any regard to the probable
corrections.    As my object       was,    however, to get an approximate
estimate    of the amount of heat            stored   in the rock at       different
times, and not to discuss the conductivity              of the material, it        was
not necessary to pay much attention to comparatively small errors
of observation.     The probable heterogeneity of the different layers
and    the surface irregularities      of the rock itself will give rise             to
disturbances    as important      as   any that might arise from neglect
of slight and (as      Mr Heath         has   pointed out) not very certain
corrections.
    It  would be of great interest to apply similar calculations                     to
underground temperatures         in other parts of the globe, especially in
parts which are blessed with         fairly   steady sunshine.
    In  regard  to the general form of            the curves of underground
temperature,    there is one feature which          I do not remember to have
seen commented      upon.     The feature is apparent in all, but most
evident in the curve for the thermometer nearest                the surface.         It
is the sharpness    of the crest      as  compared      with the trough.          The
reason of this is at once recognised           when we observe       that exactly
the same feature is distinctly characteristic of the lower solar radia
tion curve, but not     so of the higher curve.          In other words, in        the
 higher latitude the low altitude of the sun and the shortness                       of
 the clay combine during        the winter months to produce a marked
 effect   upon the    law of absorption of solar             energy.      In    lower
 latitudes this effect is hardly appreciable,         and at the equator       a per
 fectly symmetrical semi-annual variation of comparatively small
 amplitude is to be expected.         It is instructive   to compare the annual
 variations of solar radiation already given for two different latitudes
 with the corresponding variation          at a place    on the equator.          The
 results,  obtained in exactly the same way, are            as follows  :

Change of the Coefficient of Absorption of a Gas in
       a Liquid with Temperature.                     By Professor Kuenen.
        (With   a  Plate.)
                              (Bead January 22, 1900.)
    Bunsen's     classical experiments        on the absorption        of   gases    by
liquids show that the coefficient of absorption in water and alcohol
between 0° and 20° diminishes              as the temperature rises.             Bohr
              I
and Bock found that at higher temperatures the coefficients of
some      gases   (hydrogen     and    probably     nitrogen)    pass    through       a
minimum,        hydrogen     in water at       60°  C,  nitrogen     not far from
100°     C.    These   results were      not    confirmed by "Winkler,*            who
concluded from his experiments             that the coefficient approaches a
smallest value asymptotically.           Recently Estreicher,3 working with
Professor Ramsay, found a           minimum in the solubility for helium
in water at      25°  C.
     By   a letter  from Professor      Ramsay      I  was induced       to   look at
 the problem from the            general     point of view of mixtures,             and
 to consider whether        the phenomenon was not connected with the
 approach of the critical region.4
     Hitherto mixtures of water or alcohol with              gases have not been
 investigated up to the critical        condition ; instead of these liquids,
 however,       we may consider a substance like methyl chloride                      or
 carbon      dioxide,    whose    critical    temperatures      are    more     easily
 accessible,    and mixtures of which with substances of low critical
 point     have been sufficiently       investigated      for our purpose.            In
 the vast majority of cases, mixtures            of two substances of widely
  different    critical temperatures       and     vapour-pressures       behave      in
 very much the same manner, and from the behaviour                         of a com
  bination    like methyl chloride         and     carbon    dioxide,5    or carbon

dioxide and hydrogen,8 we may with safety draw conclusions with
regard to combinations of water and alcohol with a gas.
     It   may here be mentioned                    that     the        thermodynamical             theory
of mixtures        does not lead to a definite                   law for the variation of the
coefficient       of absorption with temperature, unless special assump
tions are made with regard to the equation of condition                                            of the
mixture and the constants which it contains.                                       But even without
doing that, our present knowledge                          of the behaviour                   of mixtures
of the kind indicated above enables                             us    to show the direction              in
which this coefficient will                change.
     The coefficient of absorption,                 as used by Bunsen, represents the
volume of the gas, reduced to 0°, which is absorbed by unit-volume
of the liquid.               This gas-volume              is,   by Boyle's law, independent
of the pressure          as long as          Henry's law holds, i.e.,                   as long    as the
quantity of        gas absorbed         is   proportional             to the   partial pressure of
the gas.         This law         is   in many         cases         sufficiently correct for low
pressures, and as long as the temperature                              is   not too high.          On the
other hand,        it   cannot be true near the critical point of the liquid                              ;
the absorption              of the gas lowers             the critical            temperature of the
liquid, or, to put             it   more correctly,             it      gives      a    mixture     whose
critical point        is    lower than that of the liquid.                          The consequence
is   that   if   the temperature           is   near the critical                point of the liquid,
the absorption itself may make the liquid disappear, and the law
of absorption          is   naturally no longer valid.
     It   is   easily seen          how      we have            to modify           the definition       of
coefficient of absorption so that we may still use                                  it    when Henry's
law begins            to fail.      Instead       of    considering              the volume        of   gas
absorbed         reduced         to 0°, or, which comes                     to    the same, the gas-
volume reduced to 0° and normal                           pressure, divided               by the partial
pressure of the gas, we must take the limiting ratio of the latter
quantities                                   For the sake of sim
                  for infinitely small absorption.
plicity of expression, we may substitute mass for
                                                  " volume reduced
to 0* and normal pressure."    Finally,   will be more convenientit
as well as more natural to consider the mass of gas absorbed by                                           a

per unit pressure             the ratio of mass absorbed and pressure,
small pressures are considered.
    In    considering        the value of the coefficient of absorption              in   a
special case,      I   shall use the vapour-pressure temperature diagram,
for   a  complete discussion of which               I must    refer to former papers.1
The figure gives the general appearance of the diagram for two
substances of widely different                 critical temperatures and vapour-
 pressures,     in this     case methyl chloride (solvent) and carbon dioxide
 (gas dissolved).           It contains    in addition     to the two vapour-pressure
 curves of the pure constituents,                 ending at C1 and C2, the two
 critical     points,     condensation-curves for some of the mixtures.
 Each     one of these belongs to a mixture of given composition ;                      the
 lower branch of the loop gives the pressures and corresponding
 temperatures at which the mixture                   in its lighter condition     {i.e., as
 vapour) is in equilibrium            with    a  liquid mixture of different com
 position,      the upper        branch      contains the points at which the
 mixture       as a    liquid is in equilibrium with             a vapour.
     In   our problem we have                to deal      with the latter,    the upper
 branch     :  its vertical distance from the vapour-pressure curve of the
 solvent is what we have called the partial pressure of the gas, and
 the quotient of the (constant) mass of the gas which the particular
 mixture say of the lowest loop shown in the diagram contains and
 this partial pressure is the coefficient of absorption.                Obviously then
 the coefficient of absorption is inversely proportional                  to the vertical
 distance of the upper branch of the loop and the methylchloride-
 curve.
     Owing to the peculiar way in which the upper branch of the
 loop bends round              on approaching the critical curve, Co            P Cj, it
  will be seen that the partial pressure referred to will necessarily in
  the end diminish and therefore the coefficient of absorption in
  crease.      At low temperatures the partial pressure is low                   and the

coefficient of absorption relatively high, and there must therefore
be     a minimum              somewhere.            With strongly soluble                            gases    (for
which the condensation curve                    is a narrow loop) this minimum                                will
probably occur at a relatively high temperature not far from                                                  the
critical point. For sparingly soluble gases on the other hand                                                  we
may expect a well-marked minimum at lower temperature.  The
minimum will therefore occur at low temperature for helium,
hydrogen          and nitrogen in water, at                 a       higher temperature for oxy
gen and argon, conclusions which are borne out by the experiments
referred        to.
     It   is incorrect to say ' that the coefficient                                becomes infinite at the
critical point.             The partial      pressure           does not and cannot approach
zero, and the coefficient                  of absorption remains finite.                             That this
assertion is true even               if   we apply the correct definition which holds
up to the critical point may be shown as follows.                                          We may treat
the lower branch of the condensation-curve in the same manner                                                   as
we have treated the              upper — i.e.,           we may consider the partial                         pres
sure of the gas in the vapour-mixture and introduce                                         a   coefficient of
absorption            of the gas in the vapour — viz., the ratio of the mass
of the gas contained in the vapour-mixture                                           in the saturated con
dition per unit             mass of the solvent and the partial pressure                                  of the
gas.       If    we call the density of the saturated vapour of the solvent
dv the density of the gas at one atmosphere d, its partial                                             pressure

seen that this conclusion                   holds even              if    we take the limiting ratio
of m and p.                Owing to the existence                   of the condensation-loop the

   The  same result   would have been arrived at if we had considered
the gas absorbed in unit volume instead of in unit mass of the

is drawn for mixtures of constant composition.
   It  might be tried to use the coefficient for           a  mixture   in the

right of the critical curve   ; at moderate pressures the approximate

these  circumstances     give the coefficient any value we like.              In
this case   it would   be better to consider the gas dissolved         in unit

a   given   temperature.     But    in any      case  no special    advantage
attaches to the use of the term in this case, and             it  seems   more
appropriate to reserve     it for conditions of equilibrium between            a
vapour and a liquid.

                             (Read January 22, 1900.)
    About     a   year ago, while writing             a     Text-book           on Heat in which
the use of higher mathematics had to he avoided, it appeared to
me that the phase-rule could be rigorously                                    proved       by a process
which      does not involve          the deduction               of the somewhat difficult
thermodynamical          equations         used by Gibbs,                      Flanck and others.
Quite lately, however,           I
                       discovered that proofs somewhat similar
to mine had been previously given by Nernst and Bancroft, and
I   must     therefore not be understood                        to   claim originality in this
paper.       Seeing,    however,       that       modern thermodynamics                           do not
yet command in this country the interest they deserve, it                                        will not
be superfluous to draw the attention of the Society to the subject.
    The phase-rule       states      that when n mutually                        independent           sub
stances     are in equilibrium        in    a system of                  r   phases, the system is
capable      of    (w-r+2)       independent              variations,           or, the number of
independent variable quantities is         2).        (ra

    In   determining n we must not count separately those substances
which in all the        (either separately or in combination with
                        phases
others in the ratio in which they occur in the same phase) may
be formed out of those that have already been                                    counted, with the
 additional understanding that              if   we obtain different results for the
total number by counting in                a   different order, we are to take the
 smallest of the numbers found.
    A    system of ammonium                chloride          and its products of dissocia
 tion,    ammonia      and   hydrochloric              acid,         must        therefore       be    con
 sidered to contain one substance,               if       the two substances are present
 in equivalent quantities,            two substances,                if       there   is   a   surplus of
 either of the two gases.             Calcium         carbonate, on the other                         hand,
 when dissociating, contains two substances,                                 as neither        the carbon
 dioxide     in the    gas-phase       nor the calcium oxide can                               be formed
 out of the        calcium   carbonate           by itself           ;       two independent           sub
 stances,     say carbon dioxide            and calcium                  oxide, are sufficient, as
 the     third substance, carbonate,             is    formed by the combination                         of

 the other two.      A  single substance, whose molecules are supposed
 to associate into groups of two or more, must still be looked upon
 as one substance     from the point of view of the phase-rule.
    The condition of      each phase is determined by (n + 1) quantities,
 viz., the (n-   1) ratios     in which the n substances occur in it and
 two additional     quantities,     say the temperature          and the pressure.
 As, however, the last two           are the same     in all the   phases, the  total
 number of variables       is (n -   1 ) r+  2.   (If   there are semi-permeable
 walls, the   pressure is not the same in all the                 phases,  and the
 phase-rule does not apply in its usual form.)
    In order to prove the phase-rule, we have to apply the second
 law of thermodynamics.            For our purpose we may put it in this
 form, that the system must take up               a  condition     of  equilibrium  ;
otherwise we should get a perpetuum-mobile                   ;  tbere must, there
fore, be an equation to be satisfied by the variables for every inde
pendent virtual reaction in the system.
    Apart from the conditions that the temperature and pressure
are the same in all the pbases which arise from the fact that an
irreversible   transference       of heat or irreversible           expansions   are
excluded, we thus obtain one equation                  for the virtual transition
of every one of the » substances between every combination                         of
two phases.      If all  these combinations         had to be taken separately,
we should have -y-

and all the others separately involves that between every combina

   In    the case of any harmful                   insect of economic importance, in
order to war against               it,   or apply remedial measures            at   all intelli
gently,     a   knowledge          of the life-history       of the pest       is   necessary.
This proposition will,          I    think, meet with such ready               acceptance      as
to render proof unnecessary, but                    I   might in illustration mention
two    cases    which     came under my own observation, where                      in the   one
case   a   knowledge of the round of life of the attacking insect saved
a whole forest, and             in the other proved of great importance.
   There      is   a   large moth, not uncommon in the pine woods on the
Continent, viz., Gastropachi pint (Ochsh), whose caterpillars                               some
times do enormous damage                      by stripping the pines of their needles.
Some years ago there was                 a    plague of these moths in the extensive
Royal Forest near Niirnberg, in Bavaria.      The moths had laid
their eggs in July on the needles and branches, and the caterpillars
which hatched out had fed in tens of thousands on the                           trees during
August and September. They left the                             trees    in    October       and
November to pass the winter in sheltered                        places    under the moss
and litter of the forest.                As   a   point in their biology,     it   was known
that in the following March they would                       come out of their          hiding-
places and reascend the trees to complete their growth.                             A   ring or
circle of very sticky tar was therefore placed round                            each    tree in
the month           of February.               The result was that the caterpillars,
endeavouring             to ascend        the trees after      the winter's         rest,   were
brought to      a      halt   at the rings,       which they would not        cross, and here
they were massacred in their thousands, and the forest                             saved.

to light, and its recognition                  suggested          an       excellent annihilath-e
measure         against the caterpillars.                 It   was observed           that the Xun
caterpillars in the beginning of June, and for some weeks thereafter
(in the hot weather), had the habit of leaving the trees in the day
time to hide in the moss below, perhaps to escape the heat of the
sun, perhaps to avoid their enemies                            the parasitic Tachinidae                flies.
These caterpillars ascended the trees again at night to feed.                                          This
was one of the reasons                   which suggested              the use of tar-rings             here
too.       The descending larvoe would not pass the ring, but collected
                and thus thousands came into the power of those

over                                                                                              whose
work            was to go round and destroy them, which otherwise,                                   with-
out the knowledge of this habit, would never have been reached.
     Now,       although the Pissodes species have been long known                                        as
forest peats, the contradictory accounts given of their generation                                   (and
the flight times and length of time                       taken for development                 of     such
tree-infesting forms determine the time for trapping them by                                      means
of catch-trees),        as   well   as   my own observations of the                    species,      satis
fied me that something was                   still   to be discovered.               The    results       of
my experiments, especially as these prove                              a     long-continued            egg-
laying on the part of the mother beetles,                              with     a   very   long imago
life of both sexes, will,          I     hope, not only prove                of interest     on their
scientific side, but will place on                    a   sure and logical foundation                   the
defensive and offensive methods of procedure                               against    these enemies
of our woods.
     As the best method of procedure against                            bark-boring         beetles       is
the employment of decoy stems                        or catch-trees          or bark traps             (the
details     varying with       the species),         a    knowledge of the correct                 times
when these should be prepared and revised and examined                                            is   the
very kernel .of the treatment.

a   species and resulting issue of the brood of beetles were                                 confined
to definite times, limited                in extent.           Those holding           this opinion
recommend           the preparation of the decoy stems only against these
swarm periods.           It    would be extremely agreeable                     if   wo could rely

on such    a perfect periodicity,         but the opinion, for its truth, takes
for granted      a comparatively        short life in the adult stage, with the
eggs   all laid about the         same     time, and a rate of larval feeding
extremely       regular.     But this      does    not   hold   even of      the Bos-
trichidae, which are quoted as a good example of it.                       Again and
again   I have     taken members of the same species              of Bostrichidae at
the same time, and yet in very different stages of development.
    It is true that the intervention               of winter produces        a certain
periodicity, inasmuch         as the last-appearing        beetles of the previous
year and the earliest-appearing             in the spring will start egg-laying
at the same time         ; but that mature beetles of the same species can
issue and proceed to breed in any of the warmer months can no
longer be doubted. Outside of the Bostrichidse, Von Oppen ( 1 ) proved
this in 1885 for Hylobius abietis, the large pine weevil, and now
my experiments have proved that for the Pissodes no longer can
the preparing of catch-trees be limited               to so-called swarm periods,
but must      bo attended to      all the year from March till- October.
          Position of the Pissodes in the Insect World.
    Of the families into which the Rhyncophora or proboscis                    beetles
are broken        up,   one  is the Curculionidaa,        and   to   it the Pissodes
belong.
    The Curculionidae may            be defined      as rounded     or oval beetles,
possessing       a    beak of varying          length,   and   distinctly elbowed
antennas    ;  the females do not enter bodily              into the tree for the
purpose of egg-laying like the Scolytida?, but lay their eggs on the
tree   externally       (rarely),   or in     a  hole   bored    from    the outside
(generally),      or, it may   be, lay them       in the soil.
    This family contains          a   very large number of genera, many of
which     are very important           from the economic          standpoint.     The
harm may         be done by the grubs, more             rarely by the imago, and
rarest of all by both.
    Among       the    forms    with destructive        grubs are      Otiorhynchus,

their neighbourhood, gnaw the external surface of                   these and cause

 Anthonomua larvae, so troublesome to the apple grower.                     Harmful
in the mature      stage is   Hylobius abietis, the pine weevil, one of the
 greatest scourges in our conifer plantations             and nurseries.
                             The Genus Pissodes.
     The   species   belonging      to this genus have a longish            rostrum.
 Near the middle of the rostrum the elbowed                 antennae   are inserted,
 their long basal joint almost reaching the small, slightly-projecting
 eyes.    The prothorax        is narrowed        in front, and its posterior
 margin, on examination with           a  lens, may show two slight excava
 tions.    The scutellum is round and raised.              The elytra quite cover
 the abdomen.        Femur untoothed, tibia straight and with a curved
 hook at the point.        The third joint of the tarsus is broad and two-
 lobed, and the .terminal fifth joint ends in two simple claws.
     Life History. — In life history most of the Pissodes               agree.     The
 females lay their eggs in the bark of conifers.                   The hatched-out
 grubs, starting,      it may     be,  from    a common         centre, gnaw      long
  winding tunnels in the bark, the whole perhaps showing a star-
 like pattern, although this design is not             so frequently    met with     in
  Pissodes notatus and Pissodes piniphilus.               The full-fed grubs gnaw-
  in the outermost layers of the wood           a   little bed or cradle, oval in
  shape, and here, covered by a cushion of wood chips and sawdust,
  they pupate,     the imago biting its way when ready through bed
  cover and bark, leaving a small round hole.
     The grubs living and tunnelling between                    the bark     and the
  wood interfere with the conduction              of the sap, and the infested
  plants   weaken      and   die.     While     the larval stage        is the very
  injurious   one,    the adult      beetles   may weaken the plant            by the
   punctures they make with their probosces                  when feeding.
      Of the twenty or        so   species   known, five       are  well  known      in
   Great Britain or the Continent as pests on coniferous trees — viz.,
  P   pini, P. notatus, P. piniphilus,        P.   picea,    P. liareynite.

    In   the    Continental       literature     on     the Pissodes, another form                       is
mentioned       — viz., P. validitodris, which                was said to breed in pine
cones.   I       have proved, however, that                      P. notatus and P. vali-
dirostris      are one and the same (3).
    A    glance over        the    above table           will show that the                        species
Tesemble each other closely.                    This resemblance                 is   close,    in    size,
and colour, and round of life.                     Besides, the characteristic                       spots
and bands        (these latter formed from the coalescence                             of individual
scales), so helpful in the determination                         of fresh specimens,                    get
rubbed        off in course    of time, making              the recognition               of isolated
not-fresh specimens troublesome.
    Size* and      colour of species           also fluctuate             within limits.                For
example, while         a   normal-sized     P.    picece    is   not to be confused with
a   normal-sized       P.    notatus,  I       have taken specimens of                         piceae    as
small    as    an ordinary notatus, and not to be distinguished from the
latter   save by their different food plant.

   (a) The larval tunnels may arise from a common centre.
is just the chance of confusing the work with that of the Scoly-
tidse, but in the case of Pissodes no mother tunnel                                    is found,    only-
larval ones.              Sometimes            the eggs are laid singly.                The resulting
single tunnels are difficult to determine,                         but if they         are very         long
one can pretty safely diagnose them as the work of a Pissodes.
     (//) The           tunnels        are    long,   a   considerable distance intervening
between            the place        of egg-laying and the pupa bed.                         Kecently        I

¦off from insect attack.  On examining these I found the beds of
P.   notattts, and therefore enclosed the pines in                             a sack     in order that
I    might    get the images            when          these         emerged      later      on.     I     left
Munich       on   July     20, 1895, bringing with me the pines to Edinburgh,
and on opening them out on July 23rd I found that a number of
beetles had issued. With the material thus won I started the experi
ments at      the Royal          Botanic Garden, Edinburgh,                          in   a part of the
garden vyry kindly placed at my disposal by Professor Bayley
Balfour, to whom I am also indebted for some of the pines used.
                                 Method of Experiment.
     During my work in Munich                    I    had become acquainted with the
' sack -method       '
                          practised by Professor Pauly in his insect-breeding
experiments.              In dealing with bark- or wood-boring                            insects whose
development          lasts      for some months or longer, it is neither con
venient nor always              possible   to make use of entire stems, and yet
if   branches or sections of the trunk be kept for use, there is always
the drawback of            a   rapid drying.              In    a   cut piece of stem evapora
tion takes        place    chiefly from the cut surfaces, and to reduce                                   this
evaporation         Pauly      recommended             the paraffining               of the cut ends.
Both      ends of the          cut length of stem are clipped                        several      times    in
melted      paraffin,      which dries     as     a       thin protective skin over the cut
surfaces.         That by this          means, in spito of evaporation, moisture
is retained long enough for                  the           contained       insects         to     complete
their development, Pauly's                 successful               breeding experiments with
Bostrichidae        prove.           Personally           I    have     also    proved          its value.
The paraffined lengths of stem are placed in a sack made of some
thin material, and the insects to be experimented with are placed
inside and        the sack securely tied.
     I   employed this method at the beginning of my experiments
with notatus in            1895, but soon departed from                        it,   as
                                                                                      I    saw that by
it  I    could not obtain sure results                    us    to one important part of my
inquiry — namely,              the length of life of notatus in the imago stage.
Besides,   I      was desirous        of giving           as   natural conditions           as possible,
and after      some thought devised the following                          plan.

326              Proceedings   of Royal  Society   of Edinburgh.         {
     I used young pines from three to five or six years of age.         Each
pine   as  it was required was uprooted from the nursery or plantation,
and after being subjected to careful scrutiny to make sure it was
quite free from insect attack, it was immediately              planted in soil
       '      '
in   a   pot     large enough to conveniently     hold it.  To surround the
pines    I had     sacks made 30 inches high by 60 inches in circumfer
ence, or 40 inches by 80 inches,          etc., according to the size of   the
pine.     The sacks      were open at both ends.      Over each potted pine
such a sack was slipped.          It was securely tied round the top of    the
'pot,' and stakes were inserted into the soil of the 'pot,' and on
these the folds of the sack rested.         A  counted number of specimens
of beetle was then placed on the pine, and the sack secured at the
top.
     The material of which the sacks were composed consisted of
the very thinnest muslin.          So thin was the muslin that the Pissodes
could be seen from the outside, crawling            up on the inside of the
bag.      Each potted and muslined pine was then placed outside in
the garden, quite exposed to all weathers, and except that the en
closed beetles were protected from outside enemies like ichneumon
 flies and birds, their      condition  may be described as natural.        To
give the         pines every chance     as  regards   their health, the pots
 were sunk in the soil up to their rim.
     At  certain intervals the sacks were opened for examination, and
 when the proper times came round the beetles were looked for and
carefully counted previous to their being placed on fresh material.
This proved         a very tedious part of the experiment,      as the beetles
being small, and resembling in a very perfect way the colour                 of
the bark of the pine, not to say the soil, much time had often to
 be spent       in searching for them.      The pines, thus freed of their
feeding beetles, were once more placed outside, each with its bag
surrounding         it.  Now and again, by little dissections, one traced
the progress of the developing brood, which, as it issued, was
 caught inside the muslin bag.         To ensure perfect accuracy, if after
 very careful search the number of beetles           previously placed inside
 was not exactly accounted for, dead or alive, the pine was removed
from its pot and most carefully            examined previous to its being
placed in a new pot.

    This red-brown         beetle   varies   a good    deal in size, from          mcu
(the smallest which issued in the course of the experiments) up to
f  inch (the largest which issued).
    The posterior angles of the wrinkled               prothorax project sharply,
and its hinder        edges     show two sinuous excavations.                 Both the
upper and under surfaces of the beetle are powdered with white
scales.     On the upper surface            of the prothorax stand           four well-
marked white points, and a fifth on the scutellum.                          The elytra
have two        transverse       bands     of   scales,   one    in front     and    one
behind their middle.             The front one, which is non-continuous at
the suture,      is yellowish       on either     side externally,      whitish inter
nally.      The    hinder      band     has   also   the   same    coloration    ; it is
broader externally than internally, and is continuous right across
the wing covers.
    The larva is       a fleshy,    somewhat      wrinkled, curled, legless grub,
with a brown scaly head and strong gnawing jaws.
    Very     common       in   Germany      and     France,     notatus    is certainly
spreading in Britain.             Fowler (4)      gives   as  localities Chat Moss,
Sunderland (introduced in ships), and the Dee and Moray districts
in Scotland.       These, I am sure, must be added to.                Within the last
months      I  have    obtained it from Aberdeen and from Glamorgan
shire    in large     numbers.        Our    native    notatus    are   reinforced by
arrivals from other countries in imported timber and in driftwood.
I have notes from South "Wales of logs washed                      ashore,    which on
examination contained notatus in various stages of development.
Perhaps to such arrivals Glamorgan owes its notatus, and here the
beetle has recently done grievous              harm to pine plantations.
    Pissodes notatus         is injurious     both in the imago stage and              as
larva, but chiefly       as the    latter.    The mature       weevil in its feeding
pierces the bark with its proboscis,            making     a  number of tiny holes.
Some     of  the young pines         used in my experiments with the beetle
have     been    quite riddled         from    top   to   bottom by the         feeding
weevils, just      as   if  some one had         with   a needle    pierced    all over
the    stem    and     branches.         The    proboscis     pierces    through     the
cambium to the outermost layers of the                       youngest wood.         The

circumference of the wounds                         widens from outside inwards,                      the
innermost part being the widest, doubtless from the moving                                     about
of the proboscis        in       the    feeding region.              In healthy       pines little
bead-like drops of resin issue from the punctures, and when, after
more than    a   year's time,      I        have     peeled     the bark from        a   still living
pine    which had hold feeding but not                             egg-laying      notatus      for     a
month, the old feeding-places                       in the cambial region were plainly
marked out       as    tiny red-brown patches.                       The punctures may                 be
dangerous      in another way,                as    forming convenient entrance                 holes
for the spores of injurious fungi.
     The larva tunnels in the bark and between the bark and                                    wood,
and    where the bark may                     be     thin the outermost part                  of    the
youngest     wood may be also gnawed                       away.
     The favourite breeding places are young pines from three or                                   four
to eight yoars of age, but trees in the pole stage are also frequented.
The favourite host plant                is  pine (Pinus sylvedris), but
                                              the     Scots
in Britain   I   have also obtained notatus from Austrian pine (Pinus
Auslriaca), and             Weymouth                pine
                                                 (Pimts strobw). There are
Continental      records         of attack on spruce and larch, but this                               is
exceptional.
     Whether the beetles attack and breed in healthy trees                               isa   much-
vexed question.             In   the world of timber-infesting beetles we meet
with    various demands                as     regards         quality     of food.       Some         are
dainty, asking for          a    better quality of material, some are                      easier      to
satisfy, while some are not at all particular.                               Thus   I     find Boi-
trichue typographic dainty, while Hylesinus                              piniperda will        practi
cally put up with anything.
     Xow in deciding this              question       for notatus,      I   have    no hesitation
in saying that        it    asks for        a      certain quality.         While in old           trees
the weakly and sickly                  will     be chosen,         the thinned branches                of
perfectly sound trees and                   any part of        a   healthy young plant              can
be used      for breeding.              The beetles bred quite willingly in                           the
young plants     I    offered them, these being always freshly dug from
nursery or plantation, and apart from                            a      slight 'checking'          that
would     follow      the    transplanting,             there      could be no possible             sus
picion of their vigour.
     The female after copulation lays her eggs in holes in the                                  bark.
If    pines in the pole stage be chosen, then as several eggs                                      may

1S99-1900.]    Dr E. Stewart MacDougall               on Genus Pissodes.          329
be laid near one another, owing to the sufficiency of room at the
disposal of the larvae, the resulting tunnels show             a star-like pattern.
In young plants, however, the larvae on hatching tunnel upwards
and downwards.         A trail of hrown bore-dust remains behind to
map out the path of the larva.           Arrived at the end of its gallery,
the larva gnaws out       a  hole in the outer layers of the wood, and in
this hollowed-out bed, protected by a cover of sawdust and wood-
chips, the pupation stage is passed.            These beds may be made from
the upper part of the stem all down to the ground, and also an
inch or two below ground.            A very favourite       place  is immediately
below the whorl of branches,           where, in an infested plant, one is
always sure to find several beds clustered together.
    How plentiful     these beds may be may be gathered                   from this,
that in  a piece  of Austrian pine taken in October 1897, measuring
6 inches long and       1   inch in diameter,        I   counted no fewer than
fifty-seven beds   ;  another piece of      a  three-year-old pine held eight
beds   within  a space 1£ inches long and          J   inch in diameter.
    Very often during the experiments I found that eggs had been
laid and larva; developed on the thinner branches, sometimes on
very thin twigs    as  well    as on the   main stem and thicker parts of
the branches.      The result was that when the larva came to gnaw
out its bed in the wood the whole of the tissue                     in   these    thin
twigs from centre to outside (pith and wood alike) was eaten away,
and in its bed in the hollow, bounded all round only by a thin
rind, the larva pupated.          In such cases the merest pressure            on the
branch bent it at these hollowed-out places.                More than once when
examining my pines          I  bent the twigs by accident,           squashing the
enclosed    larva or pupa.         In nature     the   wind must,      I  think, not
rarely break off the twigs at such places,              when the recognition of
 the broken     or blown-down        twigs    mi<,rht   prove helpful in calling
attention    to the pests.        This  use of the thinnest twigs for egg-
 laying in my experiment would             be   partly due to the beetles not
 having enough of egg-laying room in thicker parts.
    If one remove the chip-cover from the bed before                  beetle escape,
 the white pupa may be seen lying on its dorsal surface                     with the
 rostrum arranged along the under surface                 of the thorax.        When
 the beetles are ready to escape, they bore a circular                hole    through
 bed-cover   and bark.        Just   before   and     after emergence        they are

light coloured, but     soon they darken         into their normal coloration.
The  beetles,   although they can fly well, are somewhat sluggish on
the pines.     In   collecting      them, when touched they would often
drop to the ground and lie motionless as             if  dead.      Owing    to their
colour they are difficult to find on the pines,               till one by practice
gets to  know where to look for them.                When buds were present
the beetles would often lie between the buds, which sometimes, like
the stem, showed proboscis punctures.
                                 The Generation.
   In   the literature,     which is entirely foreign, on the generation
and flight times of notatus, very opposite opinions have been ex
pressed,   and before giving my experimental               evidence and showing
where the various theories fail, because founded on a wrong notion
of the biology,    it will    be useful to quote representative opinions.

Folgendes schliessen      : —
   "                                  P.

   I think   it very unlikely, in Britain at any            rate,   that two broods
can be produced in a year, even in the most favourable                       weather
conditions, but, any way, one cannot safely infer                it from Henschel's
facts.    One has no guarantee that the beetles which issued in June

i8»-i9oa] Dr E. Stewart MacDougall on Genus Pissodes. 331
 were the result of eggs laid in the same year                 ;  indeed, they are
likelier to have     been     beetles   from   larvas   which overwintered            as
such.    Besides, even     if for the sake of argument          we admit that the
June beetles were from          eggs of the same year, Henschel             takes for
granted that the so-called summer generation is able to proceed at
once to reproduction,       a  fact which has still to be proved.
   2nd. The generation is a single or annual one. — llatzeburg,Nitsche,
Altum, Pauly, and Perris all favour the one-year generation (while
also admitting the additional possibility of three generations in two
years), although there is some difference of opinion as to the details,
Ratzeburg     holding it to       be  the general      rule that the winter is
passed in the imago stage, while Perris, writing of his observations
in France, stands out for hibernation in the larval                stage.
   Thus Ratzeburg             "
                       :
                         (6) Die Generation ist auch moist nur eine ein-
jahrige hochstens dann und wann eine anderthalbige, gewiss nie                     eine
doppelte.     Die Kafer im Nachsommer oder Herbst ausschliipfen,
iiberwintern und sich im Friibjahr           begatten,   so dass man die         Brutt
im Laufe des Sommers sich vollstiindig              bis zum Klifcr entwickeln
sieht."
   And Perris : (7) " Ordinairement le P. notatus hiverne                  a l'etat de
larve.    Celle-ci  so    transforme       en nymphe vers la fin du mois
d'avril ou dans le mois          de mai et comme l'etat de nymphe dure
environs un mois et qu'il faut ensuite a l'insecte parfait un certain
temps pour fortifier      ses organes,    durcir son enveloppe pratiquer une
ouverture dans la couche de fibre ligneuses qui formait sa niche et
percer enfin le bois on l'ecorce qui l'abritait            il   en resulte que les
Pissodes ne    se  montrent guore que vers la fin de            Juin."
   The seeming contradictions            are really no contradictions          at all.
The facts   are correct, but the generalisation is wrong.
   The key to the whole position lies in the proof, given by the
experiments, of the long life and long-continued                 egg-laying of the
mother beetles which make it possible to find notatus, at the                     same
time, in very different stages of development.                 During my experi
ments   I  have found with Henschel, imagos in                June and August           ;
with Ratzeburg,      larva; in summer and hibernating                  imagos; with
Altum, imagos in May and August ; with Perris, hibernating                      larva?,
and imagos in June and July.
   On one and the       same day and near one another               it is possible to

332         Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh           .           [m
find eggs, young larvae, full-grown larvae, pops, and imagos; and the
danger of generalising         in    absence   of   a complete     experiment          is
further emphasised when           I  state  that  I  had feeding side by            side
in the autumn, representatives of three generations of imagos in
direct descent, born in 1895, 1896, and 1897 respectively, and
among these feeding imagos could be numbered beetles which                          had
issued from       my various      pines in every month of a year                 except
January, February, March, and December.

       I also found, towards the end of March both in 1896 and 1897,
  beetles     feeding on my pines.         These were beetles            from among
   those which        had issued in the previous summers or autumns,             and
   had early come out of their winter quarters               to feed again.     Save
   December,       January and February,     there    is no month of the year
   in which     I  have   not found feeding beetles.           No longer then can

    To take the general results given in the table, without               com
parison of different weather conditions, the shortest period taken
for development was three and            a  half months, and the      longest,
four and    a half months, showing an average over nine        cases, extend
ing from    April   to  June, of four months.
    Very different, however, is the result if the larva        be overtaken
by the winter, the period of the development extending             then    over

    It is impossible, however, to lay down a hard and fast rule as to
length of time for development                 from egg to imago, for         I  have
found and been surprised at the great variation                   shown in rate of
growth     and imago escape where eggs had been laid by the same
beetles,    on the same          plant,   and within a comparatively            short
interval    of time one from the other.                  The part of the plant the
eggs are laid    in  ;   the difference in quality of food in different parts
of the same host plant,             so  that some larvae        will feed in better
places and others in worse ; the possibilities of overcrowding from
much      egg-laying      so  that feeding       larvae    will interfere   with  one
another ;    all these influence        development in one direction           or the
other.
    In illustration      of the foregoing, and especially to show that issue
of adult beetles from a pine may last over a much longer interval
of time than that represented between the laying of the first and
the last egg,      I    subjoin   details of      imago issue from some of the
experimental pines.

     This pine (a four-year-old one) held in it from Nth April 1896
 till about the middle of June 1896, 16 notatus. The first new
 imago appeared on 24th August 1896 and the last on 7th                    July 1897.
     On 2nd April       1897   I uprooted    this pine, which had been standing
 all winter   exposed      to the weather.          On being examined, the part
 of the pine immediately under the surface of the soil, for a depth
 of 2 inches, showed a number of little round exit holes from which
 adult beetles    peeped out.         One of them on being' touched walked

one large pot on 25th        May 1897.          On this date four notatus, two

    On 24th December 1897            I   removed the soil from the part of
the pine     a little below the ground, and on dissection came on two
beds side by side, one containing a pupa and the other a larva.
    Before passing away from this part of the subject                       I  would like
to refer again briefly to the question of the generation.                        Limiting
ourselves to one cycle, and to the earliest laid eggs of that cycle,
let  us ask — What is the generation of            P.     notatus   1
    "We have seen that the imagos             which issued in          July    1895 from
the pines brought from Munich fed              till the autumn and hibernated
on the approach           of   winter,   and   how,        after    hibernation,      they
copulated      in spring 1896, the earliest of the resulting                        brood
appearing in        July    1896.    These    July       1896 beetles wintered           in
 1896-97, appeared again in spring 1897, and from their copulation
then a new brood began to issue in August 1897.
    Thus we have an annual generation,                    one brood        in  a calendar
year.       But it may be objected        to this that the imagos             which  issue
in early autumn will in the            same year of          their issue proceed to
 reproduction        and  egg-laying, from which eggs beetles would be
 developed say in       June of the next year (winter having been                  passed

340             Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                           [sia.
in the larval condition),           that     is,   in time to lay    eggs    in their        turn
from      which another           brood     would     be   developed        and      issue     in
September        or October of the same year.                    We would          thus have
three generations in two years.
I       reply   to this that   I       have no proof that the newly escaped
beetles    of autumn are able to proceed at once                      to    reproduction.
They     seem rather       to require some time for ripening, so that repro
duction    is   delayed    till after hibernation.
   In 1896      I   placed the earliest new imagos of the year on                      a   large
pine.      The first imago was placed on the pine on 24th July                                and
others added as they issued.                  On 2nd September         I     removed          the
notatus from the pine              (there were         no fewer than 27 beetles                on
the pine at the date of removal).   This pine on careful                            examina-
tion showed no trace of egg-laying.
   Again in the next year on 24th August                   I    prepared    a   young pine
and placed on         it   the first      issuing    beetles.      Four     beetles        were
placed on the pine on 24th August, and by 31st August there                                were
thirteen     notatus on the pine.             Other seven        were added          between
31st August         and 11th September.               These      twenty     notatus        were
allowed     to remain on the pine             till 7th October.        On 27th Decem
ber
  I       carefully dissected this pine from top to bottom,                        peeling    off
all the bark, and found no             trace of egg-laying.         Still again,     between
12th September and 24th September                    I   placed twenty newly-issued
notatus on      a   fresh pine and allowed them to remain                   till   they went
into winter quarters in November.                    Dissection of this pine showed
much trace of the feeding of the beetles but none of egg-laying.
   It     must not be forgotten             here that      during     the     August and
September       I    had egg-laying and             larval feeding in other                pines
winch during         these   months held old beetles which had                       issued    in
the preceding year.
   But while        the beetles that issue          in late summer or autumn               seem
not immediately ripe for reproduction, these individuals which                             have
not completed their development because                         of the entry of winter,
but haye lain in their beds all winter, are, when they issue                            in    the
next      year as imagos, able to proceed to an efficient                          copulation.
Doubtless ripening of the reproductive organs proceeds during the
long period of rest.          Here     is   the proof.     At    the end of June           1897
and the beginning            of    July     1897     there issued from two of my

1899—
        1900.J  Dr E. Stewart MacDougall                 on Genus Pissodes.           341
pines imagos which had passed                  the winter of        1896-97      in   beds
as    full-grown    larva?,  perhaps some          as   pupa).      I   placed nine of
 these on a pine on 12th          July, and removed them              to fresli material
on 2nd August.          The proof that they had bred was afforded on
 24th December, when            I  dissected the plant and found larvae           (I  may
add that on other material they continued to lay                       till September),
a brood of new beetles issuing             in  July   189S.
     If  we start a cycle at this stage we might get three generations
in the two      years, thus   : — Eggs laid in July would give imagos in
 the   following June or July, and these proceeding to reproduction,
 a new brood might issue           in late autumn of the           same year, which,
 overwintering       as imagos, would           lay their eggs      in the following
 spring, from which imagos would                 be developed      in summer.          Pro
 fessor JSusslin     (8) of Karlsruhe by dissection showed that when
 beetles issued their genital organs were not fully developed.                          He
 believes that Pissodes, which appear in the spring from                            larvae,
 which have overwintered              as such, are able sooner to proceed to
 reproduction than those Pissodes imagos which issue in summer as
 a result of eggs     laid in the      same year, these       latter imagos appear
  ing with      their reproductive          organs     in  a   less    complete     condi
  tion, and so    a longer time elapsing before they can pair efficiently.
 Professor      Niisslin  also showed this           most interesting        fact that a
 female isolated in spring after copulation was able to continue the
 laying of fertilised     eggs     all during the summer, and               even   in the
  winter still held live spermatozoa.

     Earlier in this communication             I spoke of     eggs being       laid from
  April till September inclusive.             I wish now      to emphasise the fact
  that the same individual mother beetles which start to lay in the
  spring live all the summer, and can be found                    in September still
   laying.     The males    also    may live through         this period, copulating
   and    recopulating.     Nor     does    death of the individual necessarily
   take place at the end of one such copulating                 or egg-laying season,
   but   as  the cold    weather approaches these               beetles may go         into
   hibernation, and reappear in the succeeding spring to renew their

copulation and egg-laying.                            They can live to the close of                   a second
year, and even then need not die.
    That      such statements,                   in view of the general impression                         among
zoologists        of the shortness                 of imaginal           life (especially of              a male
that has copulated), will require for their general acceptance careful
and undoubted proof                     I    readily admit, and such proof                      I    now pro
ceed to give in detail.
    It will       be remembered                   how a number of notatus issued in                             the
end of     July        and the beginning of August 1895 from pines brought
by me from Munich.                          These notatus fed on material furnished                                to
them till November 1895, when they stopped                                        feeding and                  went
into winter quarters                a       little below the surface             of the soil of                 the
pots.
    Towards the end of March                            1896     I   found on examination                      that
the     notatus had come                         out from       their     winter's       rest       and        were

I   noticed in copula              on 2nd              April    1896.       This pine was bred                     in,
and before the issue of the new brood                           I    removed the parent                 beetles.
    Some of the other                notatus which               had wintered             in 1895-96               I
placed on Pine            2,   on 17th            April    1896.          This was   a     day        of   bright
sunshine,         and the          notatus         were    seen to copulate              riotously.             On
17th    Juno   I       removed          the notatus from this pine and placed                               some
of them, along with others of the old beetles from Pine                                         1,   on    a   new-
pine   — viz., Pine           3.   I        got   a    new brood of beetles from Pine                          2   in
August 1896.

when examining Pine       chanced to see two pairs of
                                            3,
                                             I                                                       beetles       in
copula.           These  I     kept out, and placed                     them on      a   small         pine        by
themselves.             All    these beetles of            Pine      3   (including the four           I       took
out and isolated) were now                         a   year old.
    During August              1896 my time was so taken up                          with       a     Summer
Vacation Lecture Course that                          I   had   little opportunity          to attend              to
Pine     3.       Up    to the middle                  of August, however,           I      had           noticed
living     notatus      on the pine (which was now in poor                               condition),            but
when    I     came to revise my pine at the end of the month,                                        I     found
the pine dry and dead,                           and the notatus also dead.                     This       was      a
disappointment to me,                       as
                                             I     might well suspect that the death                               of
the twelve months' old images had been due to their lack of proper

  food material,        the pine       being hard and dead.                  I  was     still left,
  however,        with    the    four     notatus     previously        isolated.       On    2nd
  October 1896 I placed these four on a fresh pine, surrounded as
  usual with muslin, and having thrown a handful of moss on the
  surface soil of the pot,         I    placed   the     pine outside          in the garden,
  giving    the protection of a glass           roof in        case   any heavy snowfall
  during    the winter might bring the experiment to an untimely end.
      On 5th March IS 97, on examining the pine, and pulling aside
  the    moss,   I  noticed   a   slight movement             of the soil on the surface,
  and    soon had the pleasure of seeing, from the place                         of movement,
   one of my old notatus appearing               after hibernation.
      I replaced     the moss, and once more                  surrounding the pine with
   muslin, left it outside.
      On 20th March 1897,               a sunny day,        I  examined the pine again,
   and found all the four notatus on the pine.                          Up    to this time     the
   beetles were twenty months old (as imagos), and had hibernated
   twice, in the winters of 1895-96 and 1896-97.
      On 20th March 1897              I  removed     the four beetles to a new pine,
   and changed them later on the following dates and with the follow

    But the interest       does not end here.        Apart from the long life of
these beetles,      it is additionally interesting that a male should be
the survivor.         I had   no doubt of the survivor being a male,1           but
 to put the matter beyond doubt,             I  put this survivor   under a     bell
jar with    a   female from another pine, and soon the two were in
 copula.

     On 29th September            I placed these two beetles on a fresh pine,
 and up    till 28th October         I frequently   saw them both on the     pine,
 the male being now twenty-seven months old.                 In the beginning of
 November        I looked     again for the two beetles,     but could only find
 the female.       In   spite of long search there was no trace of the male,
 and my hope was that it had proceeded to hibernation,                 nor was   the
 hope vain, for on examination of the pine on 12th March 1898,                     I
 found    the two beetles feeding on the plant, their probosces               sank
 deep   in the bark.        I  placed these     two beetles on a fresh pine on
  14th March,       and continued to give them fresh material until the
 experiment ended by loss of the veteran male.                The further record

      Owing to the close resemblance of males and females, in order to maie
 recognition of sex sure I had adopted the following plan.          When I found
 two beetles in copula I mutilated them by cutting oir the tar.-us of a leg, on
 the right side in the case of a male, on the left side in the case of a female.

     On 3rd August            1898    I   placed the male on a fresh pine, and
 observed it alive several times during the month.                             On 31st August
 I undid      the muslin sack, but could not find the heetle.                              Further
 prolonged search for it was also unsuccessful.                           At   the time of        this
 loss the male had lived with me as                    imago for over three years.
      The long life of the adult beetles can                  be shown        in another way.
 In    one series of experiments during 1897 1 began on 1st                             April with
  thirty-six notatus.          These thirty-six were without exception adults
  which had issued from the experimental                             pines in August,            Sep
  tember or October             1896, and had passed the winter of 1896-97
 hibernating in the soil.
      From     1st   April   1897    till  1st October 1897 these                 notatus, which
  were distributed over various pines, were looked for and changed to
  fresh material at intervals              of   a    fortnight and over.              At the last
  change, in the beginning of October, twenty-seven of these beetles
  were alive,      a  fairly equal mixture of males and                   females.       Eggs had
  been     laid from the end of               April onwards up to and including
  September.          The further fate of           these notatus is as           follows   : —

    In August         a gale   of wind tore to shreds the muslin surrounding                    the
pine, so that on 31st August 1896 only one notatus could be found.
Up       to this time        these beetles     varied in       age   from       twenty-two        to
twenty-five           months,      and     during      this    period        they had        twice
hibernated.

     PifsoJes piniphilus,           the pine pole         weevil, measures          less than       a
quarter of an inch in size, and in colour is rusty brown,                               powdered
all over with whitish               scales.     The posterior corners of                 the    pro-
thorax are rounded, being more round than in any other of                                        the
 Pissodes       species    :   Scutellum,    whitish.        In    place      of the ordinary
 transverse        band behind the           middle of the elytra there                   are two
large rusty-yellow spots, one on each side, between the suture                                  and
 tho outside edge.              These spots are very characteristic, and,                    along
 with the absence of the band at the front of the elytra (character
 istic of the other Pissodes), are of great service in determina
 tion.
     Distribution. — This beetle is widely spread                       over Europe,           from
 Franco       in     the   south     to  Sweden in the             north.        It   is said by
 Fowler to be rare in Britain.                  Mention is made of it as found                      at
 Sunderland in imported timber, and doubtless                         in this way it        has or
 will     spread.

pest attacks, as its name indicates, chiefly pine forest in the                     pole
stage.     "While trees from twenty to forty years old are the favourite
breeding      places,   yet piniphilus not seldom attacks old pines, its
tunnels being found not in the thick-barked under parts but in the
thin-barked      upper parts of the branches of the crown.
   "While larval tunnels of a atar-shaped pattern are not unknown,
the female piniphilus seems most usually                    to lay her eggs singly
and not several all very close together.                Ou peeling the bark from
an attacked stem the larval tunnel               is easily traced by the brown-
black bore dust which fills it.               The tunnels        measure    from 4 to
6 inches     in length, but    as each tunnel          winds in and traverses the
bark at different levels,        one is apt to     think from the comparatively
small part presented at any one level that the tunnels are shorter.
The pupal       beds gnawed      in the wood      are small,    in keeping with the
small-sized weevil, but        I  find they may go deep           ; indeed,   it would
be possible to bark       a stem     and, yet, owing to the depths of some of
the beds in the wood, the enclosed larva                     or pupa might safely
perfect its development.             Whilst weakly         trees  may be preferred,
piniphilus     also attacks   healthy trees.          As it makes its      onsets high
up on     a tree,    and not on lower more easily seen and examined
parts, the determination of attack is rendered difficult.
   The forester, up till now, was said to have this in his favour,
that piniphilus did not pass through                its round of life rapidly, but
that   as   it took two years from the time of egg-laying till the
beetles were mature and ready to issue, time was given for obser
vation and procedure against                the    pest.     That this      two-yearly
generation is erroneous my experiments will show.
   The imagos were said              to issue   in June and the beginning of
July, the     eggs to be laid     in July, and the        larvae to live as such      for
over twenty months.
   Professor Altum (9) founded the theory of a two-yearly generation
on the fact that he obtained a brood of piniphilus in 1878 from a
dead pine whose spring shoots of 1876                    showed normal develop
ment while        those   of 1897 were stunted.              He argued from          this
that if the generation had been             a  yearly one, as the beetles issued
in 1878, the      eggs from   which they were developed must have                   been
laid, say in June        1877,     too late for the resulting          larvae   to have

348           Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinburgh.               [skss.
affected the development         of the spring shoots of 1877, which in
the dead pine would thus not have been found stunted.
    The other     suggested   proof   of   the   development     from   egg    to
imago lasting over two years is the finding at the same time of
piniphilus,    near one another and        in very different    stages  of de
velopment.       Thus to quote Professor        Nitsche (10) :   " Oberfbrster
Petersen zur Flugzeit 1876 im Walde alle Stadien des Insektes
von kaum sichtbaren         Larven bis zu flugreifeu        Kafern.    Ebenso
fand Nitsche      mitte October     1887 in denselbem Rollen zwei ganz
verschieden grosse Larvenformen,          welche durch keine Uebergange
verbunden      waren, also wohl von zwei verschiedenen Jahrgangen
herriihrten."
    I can parallel   both of these quoted cases in my experiments, and
I  will show that this cannot       be accepted as proof of a two-yearly
generation, but is explained by the fact that like notatus, piniphilus
has a long imago life, with an egg-laying            which lasts over  a  num
ber of months.         The  two-yearly    generation of     P. piniphilus, in
view     of the smaller     size   of this   beetle compared       with other
Pissodes species, often seemed to me hard to believe, and this partly
suggested    the experiment.
    At   the end of     April 1896, through the kindness of Professor
 Pauly,   I had sent on to me in Edinburgh some pine logs, which, on
 dissection, showed the larval stage of a Pissodes.
    After keeping the logs for      a short time     in water, I  placed them
in  a sack.
    On 7th    July   1896 the first beetles issued, and on examination
 they proved to be piniphilus.         Escape of adults from the logs con
tinued to 25th      July.

                                   Pine log  1.
    The first ten piniphilus which issued         I  placed in a muslin sack
with   a cut length of sickly pine.       The   piece of pine was paraffined
 at both ends,     and was allowed      to stand    in  a room   with  no   fire.
 The ten piniphilus were all dead by 2nd August                  1896.    After
some     time  I  dissected  the log, but could find no trace of           egg-
 laying.

    On 13th    July    1896   I surrounded        a healthy seven-year-old young
Pinu8    gylvestris,   which    was    potted, with muslin         as in the notatus
experiments, and seventeen piniphilus having heen introduced, the
pine was placed outside.          On examination of this pine on 8th October
the    piniphilus were found             alive,     and   were   removed.     In the
summer of 1897          I  dissected this pine from top to bottom.               The
pine was still alive and healthy, and had made                  some growth during
 1897 in spite of its having been surrounded                    all the time with    a
muslin bag.         Here and there over the pine were the proboscis
 punctures made in the previous year by the feeding piniphilus,                   and
 on the bark being stripped            the brown       discoloured    spots here and
 there on the alburnum           attested the feeding.          There was no trace,
 however, of eggs having been laid.

     On 14th    July    1896 another pine log was paraffined and placed
 in  a sack.     Between 14th         July    and 25th      July   twelve piniphilus
 were introduced,         and allowed       to remain     till 3rd October.     Here,
 again,   I could find no trace of any egg-laying.
                                         Pins     2.
     On 12th October 1896           I   surrounded another potted pine with a
  muslin    covering and introduced             thirteen    piniphilus,  all of them
  from the brood obtained in             July.       As this pine was larger than
  those usually employed, and the muslin sack presented too great                    a
  surface to safely allow the pine to be exposed to                 a high wind, the
  pot was sunk in the soil in a little glass-house at the Royal Botanic
  Garden.      The door of this house was always left open, and except
  for the protection of        the surrounding         glass, which was broken      in
  many places,       the weather        conditions     were the same as outside.
  One can safely believe that no eggs were laid in October or before
  the next year.       In   the soil of the pot and under the moss provided
  for the purpose       these   piniphilus hibernated during the winter of
   1896-97.      On looking over the pine on 2nd               April   1897  I noticed

350           Proceedings      of lloyal Society of Edinburgh.                      [¦
some of the beetles feeding            on the plant, showing that for some
of them at least hibernation         was over.        This pine, which was alive
but not flourishing, was watered at intervals.                   On 21st    June 1897
the living piniphilus were            removed      to     fresh    material.     In   the
month of September the first beetles of the new brood issued, the
flight holes being in the upper thinnest                   part of the main stem.
On 1st October another piniphilus issued, and still another on 20th
October.     On 29th December             1897    dissection revealed a number
of beds containing       full-fed    larvae.     The theory of the two-yearly
generation is thus disproved.
    As Pine   2 had never been very healthy, at intervals                  from April
onwards    I had placed in beside          it cut lengths of Pinut sylvesfri*,
paraffined at the cut ends so as to give the piniphilus a choice of
other and thicker breeding material.

    On 2nd October 1897 the three piniphilus were placed on a new
 pine, on which they remained feeding             till the middle of November,
 when they proceeded to their second hibernation.                    On 19th March
 1898    I found them above ground again feeding                       on the plant.
 They were at this time twenty months old.
     P. piniphilus then resembles P. notatus in its long life                as imago
 and    in the continued egg-laying.         The generation, following one
 cycle, is at the most a           yearly one, even with the unfavourable
 condition     of development        being retarded        by the intervention        of
 winter.

     Description.  —This      beetle measures      § inch in length, and is red-
  brown to black-brown         in colour, with     sparse yellow scales on both
  upper and lower surfaces.             The punctured            thorax    has a fine
  raised middle line ; its posterior corners are right-angled, and the

352            Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                    [
hind    edges show scarcely any sinuosity.                  In   front of the elytra
are two      yellow spots on       each side.
    Behind the middle of the elytra there is                     a small continuous
transverse band composed            of    yellow      scales   compacted together.
There are rows of long deep pits down the wing covers.
    Life history. — The larger brown weevil, which is found in the
centre and the north-east of Scotland (and, according to Fowler, also
in Northumberland),           lays eggs on old stems of the genus Pinus,
Scots pine and the Weymouth pine figuring most largely in notices
of attack.      The thinner parts of the tree              are not neglected    by the
females ; indeed, Altum, generalising from his experience with pini,
proclaims that in the first instance it is the upper, thinner parte
which      are attacked,    and later in the progress of the attack                 the
lower thick parts.         In    my experiments          I   had egg-laying on per
fectly thin twigs.        In one      case, where       I  had given a pine log for
breeding material, and placed alongside of it a small three-year-old
pine,     eggs   were laid in the latter, and after larval feeding                  the
pupal beds were formed in              it  ;  I  also   got such beds on thin side
roots an inch or more below the soil.
    Spruce also is sometimes used for egg-laying.
    A   varying     number      of  eggs     are   laid in    a hole    bored by the
female in the bark.          The larvte start from their common hatching
place and bore out in all directions, the tunnels, however, running
chiefly in the long axis of the stem.                In   one case    Altum counted
 no fewer than thirty of these               tunnels      starting   from one point.
 The tunnels      are long      (I have found specimens up to              a foot long)
 and winding, and they often cut one another.                   The pupa beds, with
 their characteristic covering of wood chips, are made in the outer
 most layers of the wood.
    It  is a practical point worth emphasising that the beds                   may be
 quite into the wood.
    "While examining         a   pine   in the pole          stage   from    Aberdeen
 shire,    I  came   on the work of pini.                Having peeled away          the
 bark,    it was     easy   to   trace the progress of the               larva  by the
 frass.      This  I  removed      with my knife,            including the thicker
 mass     at the end, where one might have expected to find either
 larva    or pupa,     but     neither    was seen.          Instead    was a round
 hole neatly plugged with sawdust.                  The grub had bored into the

1899-1900.]    Dr E. Stewart MacDougall              on Genus Pissodes.         353
wood first of all transversely, and then in the longitudinal direction.
All behind it      was sawdust, and the grub itself          was lying in    a  bed
protected by the outer layers of overhead wood.                  In such    a posi
tion the larva might easily have attained its              full development up
to the imago stage,      in spite of the tree having been stripped of its
bark.
                                 Experiments.
    In   the winter of 1897-98      I    obtained some sections of Scots fir
from Aberdeenshire, and on determining that                 these were infested
with the larva of P. pint, I placed them in                 a sack in one of the
hot-houses at the Royal Botanic Garden.
     In the beginning of March        1898 the adult beetles began to come
away, and continued to issue until 20th May.
    With this material       I carried out some experiments          in order to
 compare     this, the largest of our British Pissodes, with the other
 two    as regards generation, length of life, and continuance of egg-
 laying.
                                     Pine     1.
     On 2nd June 1898          a healthy      and   vigorous    growing     6  -feet
 Scots pine was uprooted, and replanted in a large tub.                The whole
 was in the usual way surrounded                 with  a muslin    sack,   and    on
 account of the size of the pine placed (in order to avoid accidents)
 in a little outhouse at the Royal Botanic Garden.                  The door of
 this outhouse stood constantly           open,   and the weather conditions
  were the same as        if the pine had stood exposed             save   that    it
 received a certain shelter from the wind and rain.                 The pine was
  watered at intervals.
      Eighteen Pissodes ptni were introduced, and remained on the pine
  until 29th July.      The pine was      soon studded    all over with drops of
  resin (which ultimately solidified so that the branches were covered
  with little whitish balls), which had oozed out from the punctures
  made by the feeding beetles.
     In the month of August, when examining the pine here and there
  on the stem    I  noticed the bark swollen,         and on such places being
                                       '
  tested    with the finger they         gave.'     Dissection   at such places
  showed that the swelling indicated the path of the feeding larva.

    On 12th October 1898, for convenience                 I removed  this pine from
its tub and sawed it up into pieces, which were placed in                  a muslin
bag, over    which water was thrown at intervals.                    The spring of
 1899 passed    without any       issue of imago, but on dissecting in         June
I came   across pupae   in their     beds, and so might soon expect escape.
    On opening the sack on 9th             July    1899 (the sack not having been
examined for some days)          I found       a number of     P. pini had issued,
and were crawling        about the bag;               altogether  twenty-nine    had
issued.
                By the end of the second week other                45.

                                        Pine    2.
    On 29th   July   1898   I   placed thirteen pini on         a thick  piece  of a
freshly-felled  full-grown Scots pine. This was to serve as breeding
material, and in order to supply material on which the pini might
feed and so continue to live,           I   enclosed in the same muslin         sack
a small three-year-old     Scots pine.           The pini were removed in this
experiment on 30th August               1898.       The thick log of freshly-cut
pine was very freely        used      for egg-laying, and dissection after          a
time revealed feeding larvae.              The first imago of the new brood
issued on 24th    July    1899.        The beetles       came  away very rapidly.
Before the end of       July fifty         had issued, and by the end of the
first week of August other twenty-three.
                                        Pine    3.
    On 17th    April  1899    I  took five P.        pini of   the brood that had
issued with one in the spring of 1897, and which had hibernated
in 1897-1898,     and placed them on                a   muslin enclosed pine.     In
the course of the summer breeding was attested by the presence                     of
feeding larvae.     The spring of            1899    was very cold, and this,       I
think, impeded development.                  The five pini were allowed            to
remain on the pine until 27th May, when they were removed.                         It

 was not     till the first week of September 1899 that the earliest
 beetles   of     the new     brood    issued,    the escape    continuing        until
 26th September.
    In all the three experiments the generation is                  seen   to   be an
annual one.
    Length of life in imago stage. — In the case of           P. pini,   also, a long
life has     to    be  chronicled.     The imagos which issued (after the
pupal stage) in March and            April of     1898   lived and bred during
this year.       In November they proceeded to hibernation, reappear
ing    above ground again on 11th March 1899.                     The five men
tioned in Experiment 3 continued                to live and      lay eggs      during
1899, hibernation        following in November.           On 9th March 1900           I
undid the muslin sack that surrounded the pine in connection with
which the five pini were hibernating, but could find no                       beetles.
The pot had split in two, and            I  was afraid of losing the beetles         if
they should reappear.           I  therefore decided to look for them in
their winter retreat, and on removing              the surface soil carefully         I
came on a male         pini which, on being taken up into the warm hand,
soon    started to move actively           about.    This beetle was now two
years old, and had hibernated twice.
    As to when the imago may            be got, there was no month             in  the
whole     year save January          and December         when    I   did not find
feeding imagos on my plants.                It was very interesting        to me to
find   P. pini     feeding in one case even in the month of February.
This was on        a pine where    I  had ten hibernating pini of a brood of
1899.      During      some   mild weather      at the end of February          1900,
I   had the curiosity to open the sack and examine this pine, when
I  found that the beetles, tempted by the comparatively high tem
perature, had left their winter            quarters and were feeding on the
plant.
                             General Conclusions.
    1.  The Pissodes have       a remarkably       long life in the imago stage.
This long life is characteristic of both          sexes.
    2.  Copulation      and egg-laying are not single acts, which,               once
accomplished, terminate the life of the individual, but both may be
often repeated.         The same individuals which have paired and bred

356            Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                      [i
in one   season may, after hibernation,          still farther proceed       to a new
season's reproduction.
   3.   Hibernation takes place in the month of              ^November, and           in  a
season    of   average    temperature ends in March;             in exceptionally
mild weather      even earlier.
   4. Egg-laying       takes place in all months from            April (in      a   very
favourable season even in March) to September inclusive.
   5. As adult beetles may be met with during all this period, the
length of time necessary for individual development                   loses some         of
the significance that up       till now has been       assigned   to   it in relation
to exterminative       measures,    because   a comparatively        limited      flight-
period being disproved, corresponding             limited    and definite swarm-
periods can no longer be relied on.
    6.  Still, limiting our view      to one cycle and the earliest laid eggs
of that cycle, the generation is typically a yearly one.
    7.  As the first imagos issuing in the summer             as a result of eggs
laid earlier in the     same year are not immediately             able to proceed
to an efficient copulation,       but require some time for ripening, there
is little likelihood of there being in our climate two generations                       in
direct descent in one calendar year.
   On these conclusions, and the knowledge derived from the breed
ing and observation of the         species,  we found the following
                  Preventive      and Remedial Measures.
    The great     means     the forester has in proceeding against these
pests once they have got to          work is the preparation of catch-trees
or decoy stems.          These   will   be  sickly plants, or      trees     left here
and there in nursery or plantation             ;  or plants can be artificially
 weakened and left standing, or an older tree can be cut down and
allowed to lie as a breeding place.              In consequence of          the    long-
continued life and egg-laying, such trap-plants                must be arranged
and visited and renewed at intervals               throughout     the whole year
from March       till October.
   These trap trees will be barked or removed before the enclosed
brood has reached maturity             and their      contents in the shape of
larvae or pupa; destroyed.

   1899-1900.]     Dr E. Stewart MacDougall            on Genus Pissodes.         357
       My experience is that where full-grown           larvse have been exposed
  to the    light and weather by      a stripping   of the bark, and a removal
  of the bed coverings, they do not complete their development, yet
  it  is safer not to give them the opportunity.              It should not be for
  gotten, especially in the       case of   P. pint, that the full-fed larva or
  the pupa may be protected by the wood under the outermost layers
  of which they may have bored.
      Where notatus is plentiful, collecting the imagos would be a use
 ful measure. This plan could certainly be adopted in nurseries
 with good results.         The beetles would require careful looking for,
 however,        owing to their protective coloration, but favourite places
 for them       are below    the whorls, at the bases of the bifoliar spurs,
 and between the buds.             I  have pointed out that imagos may be
 found during many months, and new imago issue also, yet the inter
 vention of winter will give rise to a certain seeming periodicity of
 imago appearance.           Collecting,   then,   will probably       be most suc
 cessful in the springtime, when the overwintered                 beetles    and the
 earliest escaping ones renew or proceed to their egg-laying ; and
 also    from August onwards, when          escape   will   be at its height.
      Where the beetles have not yet got              a    footing,  a   timely   and
 vigorous rooting out of all suppressed or sickly pines               will  go  far to
prevent injurious attack.
     As guides denoting attack we may mention —
     (a) The bead-like drops of resin that            issue    from the wounded
bark.
     (6) The drooping of the plants, with a reddening of the needles.
     (c) The little proboscis puncturings.
     (d) Broken twigs.
     (e)   At   later stages before escape,       in young or smooth-barked
parts, on the fingers being pulled over the bark little risings may
be     felt or little ridges may     be seen.    On cutting into        these  it will
be    found that they mark the place of larval tunnel or pupa bed.
     Natural aids in checking increase of the pests will be forthcoming
from parasitic insects, and from birds.                From notatus and pini-
philus-attacked        material,  I  have bred out many parasitic Ichneu-
monidae,       and  I have found silver firs    '
                                                  holed

woodpeckers which had wounded the trees for the enclosed larvae
and pupae of Pissodes picece.

   The     ScolytidsB     is  a   family of small           roundish        tetramerous
beetles    characterised     by the fact       that the       female beetle enters
bodily    the   tree    or plant     for    her    egg-laying,       the     eggs    being
generally laid in little notches cut out in the                  sides of the mother
gallery.     "With some       species,    however,      the     eggs      are    laid    all
together in      a   bunch.      The grubs        are    whitish,       wrinkled       and
legless,   and    have brown        scaly heads.         The      close    resemblance
to   each    other of the grubs         of the various species             renders      the
determination of the           species    from    larval characters           extremely
difficult, if not impossible, but the figures or patterns presented
by the mother gallery and the larval galleries in relation to it
are in general so highly characteristic,              that with these            and the
name of the host plant one can generally determine the species.
   The family Scolytidse numbers in it                  some      of the very worst
insect   enemies     of   our woods       and felled      trees.      Some do harm
as imago by gnawing the roots of conifers ; some, both as imago
and grub, attack the bast of grown conifers;                     others, again, like
Hylesinus piniperda — that           scourge     of our pine-woods — do harm
as newly-issued       imagines by tunnelling into the young                        shoots,
and later, both      as imago and larva, boring              their galleries in the
cambial     region,    interfering with         the conduction            of   sap,    and
weakening      or killing the tree      ;   while   members          of still    another
group    bore  into   the    wood and        render    it   useless      for technical
purposes.
   Among the six         species  of Scolytus given by Fowler as British,
we have enemies       of the birch, oak, and elm.               Two     species     attack
elm, viz., Scolytus destructor, Oliv. (Geoffroyi,               Goetze), the larger
elm   bark    beetle,    and Scolytus        multistriatus,        the    smaller      elm
bark beetle.

    As regards insect and work, the two may be distinguished thus :—
S. destructor is larger, measuring 4 to 6 mm., muUidriatus being
in length only          3  to    3£ mm.      The    larvae of destructor are also
larger, hence the mother gallery              and the resulting         larval tunnels
are     also  of    greater circumference.           The larval      galleries     of S.
destructor from         each     mother    gallery    are not so numerous              nor
so close     together as those of S. multistrialus.
                                Scolytus muUidriatus.
    The beetle is black or dark brown, and glossy,                        the antenna
and legs paler.          The thorax is longer than broad and very finely
punctured,        the punctures        on the flat part being finer and                not
so    thick   as    those   at the sides.        The brown        elytra,     somewhat
narrowed        behind,      show     many     punctured       striae.      From       the
posterior margin of the second abdominal                   segment       there projects
a moderatoly         long,   strong     spine, backwardly directed.              In    the
 male the forehead            is somewhat        compressed, and          bordered       at
the sides and behind             with greyish-yellow      little bristles.        In   the
female the forehead is somewhat                 arched and        lacks the bristles.
Length,      3   to 3£ mm.
    After fertilisation and           the boring      into the bark of         the    elm,
the female gnaws out in the cambial region a gallery, longitudinal
 in direction.        This gallery       cut out in the youngest             wood-layer
 varies in length         between one       and    two inches, measurement               of
 some     of the galleries in my experiment giving 1£ in., 1\ in.,                    2 in.
 In     shape the gallery resembles a miniature golf club, the                        head
 of    the club      marking      the place     of   entrance and start.            Along
  the sides of this neat gallery,           the mother cuts little           notches     at
 equal distances from            each   other, and in each         notch      an   egg    is
 laid.     The    legless,  whitish,    brown-headed      grubs on hatching             out
  proceed     to   gnaw     their tunnels       at right angles         to   the parent
  gallery.     These     tunnels,    crowded      together, are      cut    chiefly into
  the bark, but where the bark is thin their course                 can be traced      also
  on the outermost layers of the wood.                As the tunnels run         out from
  the parent gallery, they cease to be at right angles, but bend,                     some
  upwards      some    downwards,        while the width of the tunnel               keeps
  increasing with the growth of the grub.                 At  the end of the larval
  tunnel (some of the tunnels in my specimens were                     2 J inches long)

the  full-fed grub     pupates    in   an oval bed hollowed       out in the bark,
whence later, after pupation, the imago bores out through bed and
bark, the flight holes on stem or branch from which a brood has
issued resembling a number of small shot-holes.                   If one  examine
the beetles in their beds soon after they have ceased to bo pupae,
their colour is light-brown yellow, with dark glossy heads.
    While continental writers were unanimous on the point of
multistriatus being         a  late swarmer, not appearing, it was said,
until    a summer      temperature        had been      reached, there were no
experimental       records as to the length          of time necessary     for the
completion     of the life cycle, and partly            to make certain of this
and partly to determine           whether multistriatus        would attack (and
be successful    in attack)     a healthy tree,    I undertook my experiment.
    Previous   to the experiment,         I had recorded several observations
of this beetle in my notes.              Thus in Munich, in the autumn of
 1894, several elm logs on dissection showed larvfe of multistriatus.
These logs after being kept in water for some time were placed
in  a room, where they remained quite dry               until the spring of 1895,
 when, again, they were placed in water.                 At  the end of  June and
 in the first days of     July, the     beetles began to issue from the logs.
    Again, in Munich, in the laboratory of Professor Pauly,                I noted
escape of beetles as       follows : —

    "With some of this material          I  started an experiment in Munich,
 and in    July  1896 brought        with   me to the    Koyal Botanic     Garden,
 Edinburgh, from Munich,            the sack containing       the prepared pieces
 of elm and the beetles.           From pressure of work, however,           I   was
 unable to attend further to the matter.                In the autumn of 1897,
  when removing the pieces of elm from the sack in which they had
  been standing       since   July      1896,  I  noticed    them    covered   with

362          Proceedings        of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                     [sbs.
flight  holes, indicating       that some time in 1897 there had been                  an
escape   of  a new brood of beetles,             and that my experiment would
have been successful had           I  had leisure to attend to it.
   In  February    1898      I  took out one of the branches from which
a brood had issued,        and was dissecting it with a view to making
a museum preparation            of the work of 8. multistriatus, when                   I
came upon some        living     larvae.      These must,       I  think, have     come
from eggs laid by some of the 1897                  beetles,   which thus    appear to
have used for breeding purposes the very same branch in which
they themselves had been bred.                  This branch — 22 inches        long by
If   inches in diameter — cut in             July    1896, had been paraffined         at
the cut ends to prevent             excessive loss of mixture,           but by     1897
must have lost its freshness and been dry and dead.
    In order to allow       the larvae present in the half-dissected              speci
men of elm to attain their full development, the branch was placed
in  a cotton sack, and exposed            in the Garden         to all weathers.      On
15th   July   1898 beetles        began to       issue,    and from this dead dry
branch    I obtained on

    With this fresh supply of multistriatus                 I  started a new experi
ment.
                             Method of Experiment.
    Two branches of Ulmus campestris, freshly                       cut in the Royal
Botanic Garden, each measuring                 2  feet long by       2| inches in    dia
meter,   were placed in       a  cotton sack, after being paraffined,          t.e., the
cut ends of the branches had been dipped in melted paraffin, which
 when solidified    had formed          a crust over the cut surfaces.               This
coating of     paraffin, by        causing retention          of moisture, kept the
branches fresh for a much longer                   time    than    they   would     have
remained so without the treatment.                    To the sack containing          the
elm branches eleven S. multistriatus were added between                       July     15
and   July  19, 1898.        The eleven were placed in without their                  sex
being determined, as determination                  of these    small beetles, with      a

lens, meant a handling           of them such as might have risked their
life, and      as  my material was not plentiful,       I was unwilling to run
 the risk of loss.
    Examination of the two branches on 5th August revealed several
entrance        holes in the bark, a slight outflow of sap marking                 the
place of the beetles' entry.          Three of the eleven beetles were lying
dead in the bottom of the sack.               On 20th September other two
dead beetles were found, and a live one, which               I kept   out.
    On 10th February          1899 one   of the branches was carefully             dis
sected, an entrance hole being followed              up, when    I  found that at
this place        a mother gallery     had been     made and eggs had been
laid, the      larvse  — exposed by the scalpel — having started           to gnaw
out their galleries.         These larvae were very small, and had not pro
gressed far from the mother tunnel.              As the year went on constant
examination was made regarding the imago issue, and                at last, on 13th
July,      the first new beetle issued.         Here is the record of escape
from     these     branches:  —

 July    beetles is an annual one, the larvae from the eggs of these first
 beetles passing the winter as larvie and completing their growth in
 the spring and early summer of the next year in time to allow of
 preparation and escape of imagos in           July.
     With the material thus obtained in           J uly and   August, an experi
 ment was arranged to test whether or no multistriafus was able to
 attack successfully and breed in a perfectly healthy tree.
                             Method of Experiment.
    A   large cotton sack in the form of a sleeve             open at both ends
 was slipped over a vigorous branch of a healthy Utmus campestiT*,
 the branch, of course, not being severed from the tree.              One end of
 the sleeve was securely bound round the branch, and the other end,
after the introduction       of the beetles, likewise secured.         The sleeve
 was wide, and by means of thin stakes it was kept from touching
 the branch, except at the secured          ends.
    The    above     was  done on two different        branches, the sleeve on
 Branch     I. holding twenty -two multutriatus introduced between July
 15 and     July   30, 1899, and that on Branch        II. holding twenty -three
 multidriatus introduced between August               13 and August 26.

ember live         muMstriaius were seen         crawling    over the branches.
Examined        in  July  of 1901, and later, the two branches were both
alive and showed quite green on dissection.                  In neither  case did
the beetles succeed       in rearing   a brood.
    It  would seem, then, that S. multistriatiis alone and unaided              is
not   a  formidable enemy of our elm trees, although in conjunction
with S. destructor, the larger elm         beetle,  and seconding the work of
the latter, it might have considerable importance.
   In   cases where     multutriatus was proving troublesome, the attacked
trees    should be felled, and the branches containing              the enclosed
brood burned.
   Perhaps      a  useful measure would be the preparing of sickly trees
or branches as traps for the beetles           to lay    in, these to be peeled
before    a  sufficient time had elapsed for the larvae to have completed
their development, and the bark burned.

Note on the New Star in Perseus.                           By The Astronomer-
                  Royal for Scotland.               (With    a  Plate.)
                                 (Read March    4, 1901.)
    We   axe   again indebted to       Dr T. D. Anderson of this city for the
announcement of the discovery of a new star, which was first seen
by him at       2h 40m    a.m., G.M.T., on Friday, the 22nd February.
    Shortly after eleven o'clock           on the forenoon         of that    day   Dr
Anderson        came    to the Royal Observatory and communicated                   the
exact particulars of the startling phenomenon. The approximate
position of the star in the heavens was R.A. = 3U 24m 25", Decl. =
 + 43° 34'    ;  it was of the     2"7 magnitude, and       of bluish-white    colour.
Telegrams        were at once         dispatched     to   the Royal Observatory,
Greenwich, and to the International Central                      Bureau    for Astro
nomical Telegrams at Kiel for general distribution to the observa
tories of the world.               To make assurance doubly sure, special
telegrams       were also sent to a few distinguished                spectroscopists.
    The magnificent spectroscope, presented                 to the observatory       by
Lord Crawford, and specially constructed by Messrs T. Cooke 4
 Sons of York for stellar spectroscopy, was at once mounted to the
 15-inch refractor, and everything             prepared, as far as possible, for
 observation.        Fortunately the sky partly cleared in the evening,
 •when, at 6h 30m p.m.,          I  had the great pleasure of inspecting the
 star with the 6'3-inch           Simms' refractor       and a small direct vision
 prism.      The first impression was in          a certain    sense   disappointing,
 as the spectrum showed none of the striking peculiarities so con
spicuously displayed in the case of Nova Auriga?, which,                    it will  be
 recollected,     was also discovered by          Dr Anderson.         The spectrum
 •was   brilliant indeed, but apparently              absolutely    continuous from
 the  red to the extreme violet ; a fact which was                confirmed     by   Mr
 G. Clark. The first view with the larger instrument gave no
 further information, and it was only on very careful inspection
 that Dr Halm noticed                about   half   a dozen delicate       absorption
 lines, and,     in addition      to these,   two hazy dark bands, closely ac
 companied        in  each    case   by indications      of   brighter   intervals   on
 the  less refrangible       side.    The wave lengths of          these  bands were

501 and 486, and thus would seem to agree with those of the two
principal    nebula lines.*        The    positions of these features           were
measured      as  satisfactorily as their faintness permitted.
    Several of the dark lines       I was able to confirm, but thickening
haze    prevented      further observation.        On this night Mr Heath
secured a photograph         of the star with the 24-inch reflecting             tele
scope through shifting clouds.           The night of the 23rd was unfor
tunately overcast,       except   for a  very short interval at about eight
o'clock, when Dr Halm             and   Mr Clark     saw the     Nova and        esti
mated, its brightness,      which was found to exceed that of Capella
by a fifth of a magnitude.          An attempt      at viewing the       spectrum
with the 15-inch refractor led to no result.
     The sky was completely         overcast   on the 24th,      25th, and     26th.
On the 27th the weather was more favourable, although                      observa
tions could only be made          through rifts in the clouds.         The    whole
character     of the spectrum       had,   in the interval, undergone         a pro
found change,        and now resembled         indeed that of Xova           Aurigse
when at its greatest brilliancy.          Besides the bright bands suspected
on the 22nd, which had           now increased      so much    in brightness        as
to become the most prominent feature              in the spectrum,      the C-line
of hydrogen had         blazed out with great brilliancy.         This    line had
been specially looked for on the            22nd, but no trace       of    it  could
then be distinguished.          Nearly all the bright bands were of con
siderable    width,     being, in fact, in general not less than three
times    the width      of the slit   used.     It required     no   considerable
optical    means to bring out the special         characteristics of     the Xova
typo, for the whole spectrum           was    beautifully shown on        applying
a tiny direct vision prism and cylindrical            lens to the eye-piece        of
the finder, which has an aperture           of only  3|  inches.
     Owing to the repairs of the dome, now in progress, the auto
matic driving of the telescope was to some extent deranged.                        In
spite of these untoward circumstances,             Dr Halm and       I  succeeded
in securing     a fair number of measures of the principal          spectroscopic
features.
    *
      Note added March 15. — While the band at 486 pp. is undoubtedly doe
 to hydrogen, which is also present in the spectrum of the nebulee, that at
 uu does not appeal-, as later measurements showed, to coincide with the chief
 nebula line at 5007, but is probably identical with the chromospheric line

1900-1901.]         Note on the New         Star in Perseus.                      367
   Somewhat      similar   observations       were made on March 1st, but
the impression was gained that the dispersion                  employed       was too
great for the star's diminished         light.     Accordingly     a 30°     prism of
very transparent flint      glass    by Salleron was adapted            to the spec
troscope.
    On resuming work on the 3rd, under                   favourable     atmospheric
conditions,   this change in the apparatus told with full effect.                  All
the   larger   bright   lines   were      well   defined,     each    one    with    an
attendant deep black line on the more refrangible side.
    This very favourable       night afforded         a  large number        of satis
factory   measures,     which still await final reduction.                 The chief
results may, however, to some extent be summarised                    as  follows  :
    The spectrum     seems to be due to two media, one of               which emits
light of  a limited number of definite wave-lengths, and must there
fore be considered as gaseous.             The continuous background may
reasonably be attributed to matter of            a  liquid or solid constitution.
The dark lines are then the          effect of absorption on the part of the
same kind of gaseous matter that yields the bright spectrum, only
with this difference, that the absorbent medium must                     be of lower
temperature     than the body producing               the continuous        spectrum,
and that it is being carried towards us at a very high velocity.                      It
is not at all necessary that this absorbent layer should be of great
thickness, provided it is of sufficient density.               The relative differ
ence of velocity of the two bodies is quite stupendous, the reduc
tion of the observations      so   far yielding the enormous value of 800
miles    per second.       It   is   certainly     remarkable      that    this Nova
should show     a displacement of nearly the same amount and towards
the same side     as  Nova Aurigse.        It  is not altogether inconceivable,
however, that the two stars may have something in common                              as
regards their origin, as they are both in the               Milky    "Way, and not
more than 30° apart.
    The accompanying drawing made by Dr Halm, which was shown
at the meeting, represents the spectrum               as seen   in our instrument
on March 3rd.          The intensity curve is             based   on estimates of
brightness    of the bands made at the same time.
    A  number of photographs            of the violet      part of    the spectrum
 have been secured by         Mr Heath, using an object              glass   prism in
 front of   the   6-3  inch equatorial.          Unfortunately it has not yet

368          Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                  [stss.
been possible to determine the wave-lengths of the lines shown on
these   plates, but the general character of the spectrum seems                   to
agree   with that of the visual part.
   In  the Times of March 1st Miss Agnes M. Clerke propounded
the hypothesis that the broadening of the lines in the spectrum                   of
the new star might be due to the influence of a powerful                  magnetic
field, and that in this case their light would be polarised, so to
speak,   in " sections," thus affording an instance of the well-known
" Zeeman phenomenon."             At the     same time Miss Clerke       indicated
how the question might          be at once         decided   with  the  help of a
Nicol prism.      Last night afforded           a singularly   favourable   chance
for making this interesting          experiment.         Accordingly, at    a  time
when the sky was          perfectly     clear, and the spectrum was conse
quently seen to the best advantage, the chief lines were carefully
examined with a square-ended               polarising    prism by   Dr Halm and
myself.     No trace of polarisation            was,   however, visible   ; on the
contrary, the bright       lines could be clearly seen of their         full width
in all positions of the prism.             To whatever cause, therefore, the
extreme width of these lines may be due, it is not to the one so
ingeniously suggested        by Miss Clerke.
    Regarding the brightness of the star, the following notes may be
of general interest    : —

On the night of the 21st, some three hours before the star was
first seen by Dr Anderson, Mr Dodd's attention chanced to be
directed   to the constellation  of Perseus.    He writes   :
    "Occupied     with Perseus    at  11.45;  tried  to get    the telescope
pointed    on t Persei, but the star had got too       low for the stand
I   was using.     I glanced   across   the constellation     to Algol, and
remembered      that there was no star as bright as either of them

Additional Note on the Ultra-Neptunian Planet, whose
       existence is indicated by its action on Comets. By
       Professor George Forbes, M.A., F.R.S. (With a Plate.)
                                (Bead May 6, 1901.)
   The history of research in this planet is briefly              as follows   : —
   In   1879 Professor        Newton enunciated the proposition                that if
the elliptic orbits of comets have been changed from parabolas by
planetary perturbations,         then the probabilities are in favour of the
comet's position at the time becoming the aphelion position of                       the
new orbit.       This explains why the aphelion distances of                 so many
comets agree       with the mean distances of Jupiter and Neptune
respectively.
   At the meeting of            the     British   Association       when    this     was
announced,      I  stated that      if this   be true there are        certainly    two
undiscovered       planets    beyond       Neptune,      one   of   which is       at   a
distance from the sun about 100 times the mean distance of                           the
earth from the sun.
   In    1880,   on   16th February,        I  made a communication             to the
Royal Society of Edinburgh,* referring                   to  seven    comets whose
aphelia were calculated          to be at this distance, and describing               an
attempt to determine          the present position of the new planet                  on
the supposition        that it occupied the longitudes               of  the several
aphelia at dates when the comets were at those aphelion positions.
 Mr Isaac Roberts made           a search     by photography but did not find
the planet, possibly owing to my having indicated                     for his    search
an area that was too limited.
    These calculations       have lately been         revised by me,        use being
made     of every elliptic orbit in Galle's recent Catalogue (Cometen

astronomers who applied for them.           The present Astronomer- Royal, who         at
that time edited      The  Observatory,   published the full paper in the issue        ol
 that journal for June 1880.       The perturbations of Uranus by the new         planet

 particulars  were given to the       R.S.E.,  1881, January    17th.    Both of   these

The whole of the work                 was     gone    over,    reasons were found for
altering   some of the data, an error                in   one   of the calculations was
discovered,     and a comparatively               recent comet was added to the
list.   Yet the final position            assigned     to the planet was unchanged.

   The present         Note       comes     from the discovery of a remarkable
confirmation      of these       results.      It  is well known that the comet of
1556,    which has generally               been looked         on as a return       of the
comet of 1264, did not reappear in 1848 as was expected.                                In
fact, it  seems     to have disappeared               as completely      as  did Lexell's
comet of 1770           by the attraction            of    Jupiter upon it when in
aphelion.
    The longitude of the aphelion of comet 1556 was                         99°"24' in the
year 1696, and its distance from the sun was 88 times that of the
earth.     Now,     I   find that       if my published results           be correct the
longitude     of the new planet in 1696 was 112°, its distance from
the sun being 100 times that of the earth.                        From this it appears
to be highly probable that the non-return of the comet was due to
its deflection at aphelion by the new planet.
    Anyone who         has read Laplace's analysis of the action of                Jupiter
upon Lexell's comet * must realise that if Jupiter's longitude had
been unknown it might have been found by the action upon the
comet.      So also in this case we may deduce conclusions which
must be true      if the     comets       1264 and 1553           were  identical.    And
the first conclusion is that the longitude                     I  have assigned to the
planet which we know to be at 100 times the earth's distance from
the sun is not far wrong.
   The latitude         of the comet 1556, when in aphelion,                     was 30°.
Hence its distance from the planet was very much greater than
is the   case   with ordinary cometary perturbations                      considered by
astronomers.        On     the other         hand,      such     perturbations    are  im
portant only for a few days or weeks, while in the present case
the influence remains of the same order of magnitude                           for nearly
two hundred years.
   It becomes      then    a  matter of great interest to examine, generally

in   the    first place, the nature of these            perturbations    on various
assumptions as to the mass of the planet.                  If it be found    that the
 perturbations would not suffice to prevent a return of the comet,
in  a   moderately changed orbit, except on the assumption of a mass
so great that its influence on other             planets could not have escaped
notice, then we may be sure that,              if comets 1264 and 1556 were
identical, the comet must have returned as an unrecognised comet
 in an altered orbit.          If  we can identify comet 1556 with such a
 comet seen in the last half century, a beautiful                 problem presents
 itself  :  Given    an orbit transformed         into another given orbit by a
 planet      of  unknown       mass    in   a position    approximately       known,
 determine the mass and exact longitude of the disturbing planet.
    The estimation of        the general character        of the perturbations          is
 facilitated in the present case by the following considerations                  : —
    1.   The aphelion radius vector (or the line of apsides) is very
            nearly in the line at right angles to the line of Nodes,
            being only 4£° from it.
    2. The comet's aphelion being                88 times, and the planet           100
            times, the mean distance of the earth from the sun, and
            the angle between the radii vectores of the two bodies at
             the  aphelion being 31°, it follows that, at and about the
             time of    greatest disturbance,         the perturbations       by     the
             planet   are  almost entirely        perpendicular     to the plane of
             the comet's    orbit,  so   increasing the inclination and retro
             grading the line of Nodes.
     3.    At any other position of           the   planet    where    there   is   any
             component in the plane of the comet's orbit,                 the action
             is such as to increase the longitude of Perihelion
     I  have made a preliminary           computation of the general character
  and amount of these perturbations, and find that                if the new    planet
  have the same mass as         Jupiter, the orbit of this comet would               not
  be so seriously affected       as was that of       Lexell's comet by Jupiter          :
  but the plane of the new orbit would                 be inclined    to that of the
  old one at about 5°, so that the longitude               of the Node would          be
  retrograded       about   12°,   and the inclination of the orbit             to the
  Ecliptic would        be  increased by about 3°, and the longitude of
  Perihelion would        be advanced      slightly.
     But the number of comets               affected   by this new planet is           so

large that in all probability                   the new planet has a greater mass
than Jupiter.         If    the new planet be several times the                            mass        of
Jupiter,     the    orbit       of    the    comet of          155G       might     be    so    much
disturbed as to render the comet on its return unrecognisable,                                         if
the existence of the new planet be ignored.
     A   careful examination of all the comets in Galle's Catalogue, to
which      elliptic orbits have been assigned has convinced                                me that
no one of them is the lost comet 1556.
     At   the same time,        if the new planet had deflected the comet                              so
far   as to prevent its return                  up to now, the planet must have                         a
mass so great that its influence on planetary orbits would ere now
probably have been detected.                       It    is therefore desirable to search
among       the comets           to    which elliptic orbits have not yet                         been
assigned, to see whether any one of them may be the lost comet
1556.
     Upon making this             search,     I    found that Comet 1844 iii., which
has been assumed to have a parabolic orbit, would,                               if its orbit were
elliptic, have its aphelion in longitude 116°, while Comet 1843                                        ii.
would      have its aphelion in longitude 115°, and no other comet in
the whole          of Galle's         Catalogue can possibly                be    identified      with
Comet 1556.           It   is   to the first of these,             1844    iii., that   I   wish in
the first place to draw attention.                           According to the ephemeris
published       by     me,      the        aphelion        longitude      of     this    comet     was
occupied by the planet in the year 1705, i.e., about the same time
as the      comet itself.             Both Kncke and Cooper (Cometic Orbits,
p.    173), besides        others, have noticed                a    similarity      between        this
comet and 1556.             I        find that        if   this comet be moving                 in the
disturbed orbit of 1556                   the Node         lias been retrograded           consider
ably,     the inclination has been                      increased, and the longitude                    of
Perihelion has         been          advanced.          In all   these points      it    agrees    with
the character of the perturbations that we should expect the new
planet to produce, as stated above.                          Also the line of intersection
of the two orbits            is      near their aphelia, and              is   approximately            in
the position suggested                 by   a     preliminary      examination.            Only the
latitude      of Aphelion            is   smaller than would              be expected on           any
moderate assumption as to the mass of the planet.                                        This     is   the
only apparent discrepancy that appears in the preliminary investi
gation.  In all other particulars the orbit of Comet 1844 iii.

appears to be the orbit of the Comet 1556, perturbed by a planet
considerably larger than Jupiter,* situated at or about the position
indicated as to radius vector and longitude                          in my original                com
munication              to the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1880, according
to       which the planet is at               100    times the mean distance                    of the
earth from the sun, and is in longitude 181° in this year 1901.
     With regard              to Comet       1843    ii., if this   be   a       reappearance of
Comet 1556,                 the Nodes have been retrograded,                     the      inclination
increased, and the longitude                        of perihelion    advanced,            as in the
other case.                 But the latitude of aphelion has not been                        reduced
like the other, but rather increased.                      Also the Perihelion               distance
has been increased quite sufficiently                       to account for the inferior
display and the insignificance of its last appearance.
     It       would     be rash to make any              further expression of               opinion
until the calculations have                  been completed.         In      the meantime the
conclusions certainly arrived at are the following                           :   —
         1.   The position of the new planet                 as stated       in 1880         is con
                   firmed by a fuller investigation on the same lines.
     2.       If    the comets       of   1264     and 1556     were identical,             the new
                   planet    would     produce       perturbations       whose            amount     is
                   sensible, and these account for the non-reappearance of                          the
                   comet in its old orbit, and may lead to further knowledge
                   about the mass and position of the new planet.

                   may be the lost comet of 1556, perturbed                          in its orbit

                   engaged on, must throw some            light on this question.

          On Hair in the Bquidae. By F. H. A. Marshall,
                 B.A., F.R.S.E. (With Six Plates.)
                                         (Read June 17, 1901.)
   The taxonomic value of hair                       has   long been       recognised.         The
different types of human hair have been made                            use of as a basis for
classification       of the varieties of Man by Primer Bey* and many
others, while Waldeyerf in his Atlas has described briefly the hair
characters of well known members of the Mammalian                                 orders.        In
the present paper it is proposed to deal with hair within the limits
of a single family,                that of the Equidse, and to describe certain
peculiarities        in the hairs of members of that group, which the
author is of opinion                    are probably    of specific value.          But before
dealing with the hair characters by which the                           species   may be dis
tinguished from            one another, something             must be said about those
of the group         as a whole.
   The characters by which hairs of different animals can                                  be dis
tinguished from               one another, apart from            their length, shape, and
colour,      the latter          being of little or no taxonomic              value, are the
nature of the cuticle, the extent of development of the medulla in
different parts of the hair, the relative thickness of the medulla,
and the arrangement of the pigment in the cortex.                                   The cuticle
presents comparatively                   slight modifications, and consequently the
characters of this layer are not of much value for taxonomic pur
poses.       In    the hairs of the different members of the Equidae it                           is,
so far     asI     have observed,            almost identical, being smooth or only
slightly imbricate.                In     transverse sections     it    appears little more
than     a   line bounding the cortex on the exterior.
   The medulla, on the other hand, shows very great variability in
different animals, and the accounts given of                        it   by various writers

differ widely      from one       another.     Primer Bey, writing of          human
 hair,   describes three        kinds of hair differing           in this   character,
 according as to whether there is a central canal devoid of medullary
substance, a canal filled with medulla, or whether the hair is                     com
 posed   of cortical substance throughout.                Reissner * refers      to the
partial    absence    of medullary      substance in some           animals, and      its
total absence in seals and some Chiroptera.                 Ride wood, f in   a recent
paper, draws attention to its absence in sloths, and quotes Welcher,
who first noticed this fact.           Poulton i      states   that the medulla is
                                                                               '           '
 wanting in the slender unpigmented                base    and also in the        neck
region in the hairs of Ornithorhynchus.                Henle,§ who      describes    the
medulla      as a substance consisting          as  a   rule of two rows of cells
whose nuclei are flattened transversely, says that this substance is
quite absent in the finer hairs, and is not constant in the stronger
ones,   failing here and there.         Other authorities might be quoted              to
show the variability of the medulla in different animals' hairs.
    In all  the equine hairs that       I  have examined, even in the very
finest, the medulla is present, though its degree                of development         is
somewhat variable.            It  is usually     absent for     a   considerable dis
tance, both from the point and from the base of the hair, and may
have broken down in an unaccountable                     fashion in one or         more
places    on    the hair     shaft.    Moreover,      it consists, at     least in its
thickest part, of certainly more than two rows of cells, the nuclei
of which     can be seen       in suitably stained sections.           They   are not
shown in the figures illustrating this paper, which are drawn from
unstained preparations.            The absence     of the medulla        at the    base
of the hair is accompanied in many                cases by the absence         of   pig
ment in the cortex.         Tins is well shown in the hairs of the             Somali
zebra,   which    will  be described      lower down.         Such an absence          is
invariable in fully grown hairs.            Hairs which have not yet            grown
to their   full length retain the medulla to            a point much       nearer the
root.    This shows that with the growth of the hair, the                     medulla

tends to disappear        towards the root.       The manner of its disappear
ance is an open        question.     Mertsching,* after referring to certain
statements     by Kolliker that the frequent absence of the medulla
in coloured human head hairs, and its almost regular occurrence                        in
white head hairs, says that this points to the inference that the
formation      of the medulla is connected            with the turning grey            of
the hair.      This, however, cannot apply to equine              hairs.     But the
colour of    a  hair to the naked eye is affected by the breaking down
of   the   medulla,      such    hairs appearing considerably            duller     and
darker.     Thus light brown hairs become dull brown.
    Speaking      generally,      then,   equine    hairs   may    be    said    to    be
characterised       by the      invariable    presence    of the    medulla        to   a
greater or less degree of development, and by the tendency of the
medulla to disappear at irregular intervals, leaving air spaces of all
sizes.    This latter characteristic         appears    in Waldeyer's       figure     of
horse hair, but not in his figures of the hairs of other Mammalia.
    Another      character by which           the   equine    hairs may       be     dis
tinguished from other hairs, and from hairs of other species in the
genus, is the distribution         and arrangement of pigment in the cor
tex.     Nathusius t has called attention to the fact, which                   1   have
often observed, that in some species of the genus Equuf, the pig
ment granules on one side of the medulla may present                      a  different
coloration     to those on the         other side   ; in  other words,       that the
hair may      be   striped longitudinally.         This character,      so far as       1
have observed,       does not hold good         for horse hairs, but it is very
general in other members            of the family.      The hairs in such         cases
are coloured by at least two different sorts of pigment, which have
blended unequally on the two sides of the hair.                   In this     connec
tion, it is interesting to repeat for equine             hairs some of Sorby's           ;
experiments on human hairs.                When    brown hairs of the type in
which longitudinal          striping is common        are dissolved in a strong

solution of sulphuric acid, it is frequently found that one or                                              more
of the pigments goes into solution which is coloured,                                       as do also the
other constituents of the hairs, while another pigment sinks to                                               the
bottom undissolved.                         This result is similar to Sorby's for black
human hair, which contains                          a     quantity of brown or red pigment,
which          colours         on    acid        solution, the dominating black pigment,
which causes the hairs to appear                               perfectly black, sinking to                    the
bottom          as a    precipitate.              This, however,          I    have     not found           to be
the case         with black horse hair, for when this is dissolved in                                    strong
acid, after the black pigment has sunk to the bottom, the                                                    acid
solution remains                   perfectly clear and uncoloured.                      "When white, or
nearly white, horse or ass hairs are dissolved, the solution is                                              also
clear,         this result agreeing                 with      Sorby's for white               human         hair.
The study, however, of the different sorts of pigment, whether                                                 in
equine or other hair, and the application of the spectroscope                                            to the
problems          presented,              is the work of the chemist.
     In discussing hair coloration, it                             is well to remember                that the
tone of colour presented                          by the hairs collectively              on the skin            is
often quite different to that of the individual                                   hairs when            viewed
separately            through             the    microscope.            This    must     be    due       to the
blending of            the          different shades           of colour in the general                   effect.
The        colour of           a    hair is commonly supposed                         to depend         on the
presence or absence of the pigment granules of different shades                                                in
the cortex.            This         is,   of course, largely the case.                But     there    is   often
in addition            a       diffuse          coloration throughout             the    cortex, and           as
above remarked, the colour of                           a   hair   is   affected not inconsiderably
by the degree of development of the medulla, and what                                             is    related
to       it,   the    presence            or absence        of air vacuoles           in the medullary
canal.
     A     few remarks must be made concerning the shape of                                              equine
hairs.          Nathusius, in his investigations, made use of hairs from                                      the
shoulder region or from the side of the body, and                                        remarks that           in
these, with the increasing thickness                                of the hair the cross                section
becomes              more       oval and           less     circular in shape.            Thus        the    most
circular sections                   are     those       through the medullaless regions                      near
the point and root.                        In another place,* Nathusius                 appears to apply

1900-1.]   Mr F. H. A. Marshal]          on  Hair in the      Equulcc.        379
this description     to hairs   in general.      My own observations have
shown it to be very generally applicable to the shoulder and side
hairs in the Equidae,     but this cannot be said for the hairs of the
mane, sections through which are commonly                  circular  throughout
the entire length of the hair, the exceptions being, so far as             I have
seen, certain very long and fine mane hairs of horses and the mane
hairs of the mountain zebra.          These are elliptical.       The flattening,
as is well known, is related closely to the tendency the hair has to
curl.    Thus, in animals with stiff upright manes we should expect
to find  a circular hair section.
   Like Nathusius, whose investigations           were almost entirely upon
horse    and ass hairs,    I   have employed        hairs from the shoulder
region.     By simply mounting such hairs in balsam, many of the
characters can be quite well made out.            But   I  have also employed
mane hairs, which from their greater value for taxonomic                purposes
and the much greater ease in cutting them into transverse sections,
are more useful for purposes of comparison.                    Cutting sections
through hairs is always       a matter of some        difficulty, and not the
least part of it is to contrive     that the sections shall be transverse.
Dr Hepburn has        been   kind enough      to show me the apparatus he
has invented     and employed        for keeping the hairs stretched           out
during embedding.        It  consists of two small metal boxes open at
their ends and made to fit into each other.           The hairs are stretched
across the open end of one of the boxes, which on being fitted into
the other one, retains the hairs in position.           The whole apparatus
can then be embedded in paraffin, and the paraffin block containing
the stretched hairs can be cut out of the metal box (since the ends
are open) after solidifying.        I have employed this apparatus for
the shorter hairs, but for longer hairs it is just as easy to embed in
an   ordinary    paper box,     keeping     the   hairs   stretched    across  by
fastening their ends in holes in the paper.          The hairs were cleared
in xylol or turpentine         before being      embedded.        I have found
paraffin of a melting      point of 58° C. the best for embedding in.
The sections were cut with         a   Cambridge rocking        microtome at a
thickness of 10/*, cleared in xylol and mounted in Canada balsam.
   The material employed has been largely provided by Professor
Ewart, either from animals in his stud at Penycuik or from skins
in his  possession  ;  but  I  have been      able to confirm some of my

380           Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                       [siss.
observations on hairs obtained from animals in the Gardens of the
Zoological Society of London.             In work of this sort it is desirable,
before setting down certain characters              as   those   of the species, to
confirm    one's   observations in        as   many individuals          as   possible.
Where only one individual of a species is studied,                 it is easy to fall
into the error of regarding certain characteristics as belonging to
the species     which are really only individual               peculiarities.       It   is
also well to remember       that it by no means           necessarily follows that
because hairs possess certain general characters              which it is usual to
find in the members         of a particular family,           such   as that of the
Equidse,   that they must belong to an animal which is                  a member of
that family.      On the other hand, it is natural to suppose that                   the
causes    which   operate    in determining         a   particular    form of hair
in   the  members     of one    family     should operate        and     bring about
similar results in the members          of   a  quite different family.            It   is
acknowledged that those who maintained that an extinct animal
could   be restored   by an examination of          a   single bone went       a great
deal too far.     And   so, in the absence of other evidence,              to attempt
to assign an animal to its genus on the strength of the characters
of some of its hairs, would      be   equally unreasonable.            An    examina
tion of the hairs of the new mammal recently discovered by Sir
Harry Johnston, K.C.B., pointed            to the conclusion that the animal
belonged    to the genus Equus,         The history of this discovery           is now
well known.       Pieces of skin were first obtained, but not             a complete
skin, nor had the animal been seen alive.                    There was, however,
other evidence      besides   that derived from the shape and structure
of the hairs that the animal was equine.               The skin was striped            in
a   manner very suggestive         of   a  zebra.      On the strength of            the
evidence,     Dr Sclater     named     the    animal Equus Johmtoni.                The
resemblance      between    these   hairs and       the    shoulder hairs in         the
Equidne was shown by         Dr Ridewood        at a meeting of the Zoological
Society,*     and  1  myself     can    testify    that    whereas      they do      not
resemble     the hairs of any particular           species   of zebra       especially,
they do not differ more from the hairs of any such species than                      the
species of zebras    in their hair characters          differ from one another.!

Sir Harry Johnston                has more recently obtained a complete                      skin and
two skulls of the animal, and                  these    show that          it is related       to the
extinct Helladotherium               and may perhaps be referred to that genus.*
Dr Ridewood,              at a more recent meeting of the Zoological                         Society,
exhibited microscopic preparations of the hairs of this animal and
also of giraffe and antelope hairs, and pointed out that the hairs of
the so-called Equus Johmtoni, while they differed from those of
antelopes,         resembled        those      of the giraffe and also              those of the
zebra.
   The genus Equus contains                    some    ten or more species,              including
two     species of horses, three or four of asses, and                 a   doubtful number of
species of zebras.              Three species of zebras are, however, well defined,
namely,       the Burchell's zebra              (Equus Burchelli), the common or
mountain           zebra (Equus       zebra)    and the      Somali          or Grevy's         zebra
(Equus Greeyi),the skinsof which are figured in Plates                           I.,   II.   and   III.
Some account will now be given of the hairs of these                                zebras,     after
which the hairs of the horse will                  be referred to, and the paper will
be concluded by             a   description     of the hairs of certain zebra-horse
hybrids and           a   reference to the telegony hypothesis.

   In    this, as in other zebras,              the hairs are          generally        of stouter
form than in the horse or               ass, and the medulla in the case of the
shoulder hairs at any rate              is   relatively    thicker     in the former than
in the latter.            The exact measurements for               a   typical hair from the
shoulder region of the Burchell's                 zebra are as       follows    : —

in the Somali and Penrice's           zebra,    from both of which they differ in shape,
tapering to       a   point much more gradually.            In   the relative development of
the medulla and cortex they closely resemble                equine hairs, differing entirely
from the hairs of antelopes, goats, and deer.

point and the root; (1) is taken half-way between the point and
(2)  ;  and (3) is taken half-way between the root and (2).                          A
longitudinal streak, formed by pigment darker coloured than that
colouring     the rest of the cortex, may not infrequently            be observed,
so that the hair        may appear, if     mounted in       a  suitable position,
differently coloured on one side of the cortex to what it is on the
other.     The medulla in many hairs is broken down in places and
may be absent from the root for a distance as much                    as  a  quarter
the length of the hair.          The latter may reach         20 mm.        Sections
through     the    hairs   of  the   mane which is upright            are   circular.
Fig.   7 represents such a section.       The line of demarcation between
the cortex       and medulla is irregular.       The pigment is          seen   to be
distributed much more thickly in that part of the cortex nearest the
medulla than towards the periphery of the hair.                   The hairs here
described      are   those    of the   Chapman's      variety    of    the     Equut
Burchelli.       This animal      is regarded by      Xathusius      as a    distinct

   This animal, though undoubtedly            a member         of the Burchell's
group of zebras, is commonly regarded as a distinct                 species.      The
hair characters are closely similar to those of the Chapman's zebra,
but those of the side of the body tend to be longer and may reach
25 mm. in length        ; that is longer than the same hairs in any of
the other zebras.

   The shoulder        hairs of the common or mountain              zebra are not
strikingly different      to those of the Burchell's.       The length is about
the same.         The following are      measurements taken as with the
Burchell's      zebra hairs of the breadth       of   a   typical   shoulder      hair

    A  longitudinal        streak is commonly very distinct, and is often
brought about by the presence              of pigment on one side of the hair
but not on the other.            The medulla is 'wanting in the tip and root
regions    as   in the Burchell zebra hairs.         The hairs, including those
of the mane, undergo a marked flattening.                      This is remarkable,
seeing that sections through mane hairs, not only of the Burchell's
but also of the Somali zebra, are nearly, if not quite circular, even
those    through the hair in the             middle of its length where the
degree of flattening is often greatest.            The sections also show that
the pigment is not specially aggregated               towards the medulla, but
is spread      fairly evenly through        the cortex, except      in cases where
the hair is longitudinally striped by pigment being present in much
greater quantity         on one     side   of the medulla than on the other.
The line of demarcation           between    the cortex and medulla is parallel
to the surface        of the    hair and not irregular     as   in the Burchell's
zebra.      Fig.    8 represents      a section   through     a mane     hair from   a
common zebra.

    A  study of the hairs of the Somali or (Irevy's              zebra leads to the
 conclusion       that    this  zebra    stands   apart from       all   the  others.
 Xathusius       has commented        on   the  extreme shortness of the hairs
of the side of the body, their average length being about                      5 mm.
 The breadths of the hair and of the cortex on one side, taken                     as
 before in three places, are        as  follows : —
      Breadth of cortex on one side                     lireadth of hair in
        of medulla in three places.                        three places.

    These measurements           show considerable divergence          from those of
 the other zebra         hairs, and     what is more, they are remarkably
 constant, being approximately the same for any fully grown hair
 drawn from the side of the body.               The medulla is absent for some
 distance     from the root,       and    where it    makes     its appearance      is
 accompanied        by  a  sudden thickening of the hair.            Thus the hairs
 have long medullaless          stalks.    The pigment, which is thick in the
 greater   part of the hair's length, becomes thinner passing along the

384              Proceedings        of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                                   [sess.
stalk, until near           the root       it   is almost completely absent.                         It   is
apparently disintegrated in various places in the hair shaft.                                         The
most obvious character of these hairs is their remarkably short and
.stout form, being,          relative to their length, much thicker than                            those
of the other zebras, but actually very slightly thinner than                                        those
of the     Burchell's        zebra,      that       is,   taking       the    measurements       in the
thickest part of the hair in each                     case.        Sections through the              hair?
of the mane, like those of the Burchell's zebra, are circular                                    almost
throughout.           The line of demarcation between                                the   cortex     an.;
medulla     is     also    almost      regularly circular.                    The pigment       is   seen
to be distributed            pretty equally throughout the cortex, but                            has     a
slight tendency in places to be thicker nearest to the medulla                                        and
thinner towards the cuticle.                        This tendency was not apparent                        in
the section       from which fig.         6     was drawn.
  The extreme shortness                  of the hairs on the side of the body                         can
hardly be ascribed to want of vigour caused by the environment
in which this zebra lives, for,                 as        Xathusius points out, the hairs                 of
the     Somali     ass,    which lives under the                       same climatic       condition:-,

show     extreme          variability,     so       that     it   is       practically   impossible       to
state    any characters          which are applicable to all varieties                           of    the
species.     The section          figured, which                  is   through       a   mane hair        of
Professor Ewart's             " Circus Girl,"              the    foal of       a   skewbald    Iceland
pony by     a     Shetland pony,          is    fairly typical.               The characters         there
seen, such as the fine granular appearance                                 of the evenly distributed
pigment,     the clear and regular line of demarcation between                                   cortex
and     medulla, and the relatively                        narrow cortical region,             are very
common           in transverse         sections           of mane           hairs of horses.          The
shoulder hairs, speaking broadly, show                                 a    weaker development            of
the     medulla and   thicker cortex than in any zebra hairs. Of
                             a
course the length, breadth, and fineness of horsehairs are especially
variable and depend largely on the breed.

considerable       space to horse hairs, referring to the characteristics of
some of the breeds,           so  it  is unnecessary          to   say     anything      on this
subject     here.      Reference must, however, be made to                         a  character
upon which Xathusius, in his earlier                    papers at any rate, appears to
lay   considerable         stress.       I   refer to the longitudinal               striping   so
common in zebra and               ass   hairs.      For   some time he regarded               this
character       as  absent     in horse hairs.             Subsequently, however, he
discovered longitudinal striping in hairs of certain ponies of mixed
breeds     imported from Russia.                  Although       I  have      never    observed
such, longitudinal        striation in horse hairs,           I  know of no reason why
it should      not sometimes         occur,     especially in view of the fact that
there    is considerable         evidence, as Professor Ewart
                                                                                * has shown,
that the     horse is descended            from   a  striped zebra-like ancestor, and
that this longitudinal striation               is quite as well marked in the               hairs
of the asses, which are often supposed                     to have branched off from
the ancestral equine stock, before the body striping was acquired in
the   Equidte.        It   must, however,            be   doubtful         how much        stress
should    be   laid upon such          a   character    as  variation in the degree of
blending and arrangement of pigment,                       seeing that pigment in the
other    groups of the animal kingdom                       is known         to be especially
variable and easily influenced by the environment.

   Ass hairs are very fully dealt with by Xathusius                                in the two
papers     already      quoted.         It   need     only     bo mentioned here that
longitudinal striping is very common                     in the shoulder hairs, and is
sometimes       seen    also    in those of the mane,                 and     that the     hairs
show   a  marked degree of flattening, especially those of the Somali
ass.

                              Zebra-Hone Hybrids*
   The hairs of several of Professor Ewart's zehra-horse hybrids
have been examined and sections cut.                    Seeing that the dams of
these animals belong to different breeds,            it might at first be expected
that we should find quite          as  much diversity in the character of the
hybrid hairs     as   in those of the       dams.      Such, however, is not the
case,  for the hairs of the hybrids          are  for the most part constant in
shape and in the relative development of the medulla and cortex.
The measurements, taken              as before, of the shoulder        hairs of the
hybrid "Norette," whose dam was                a Shetland pony, are        not widely
different from those of the sire, the Burchell's zebra               :—
       Breadth of cortex on one side                        Breadth of hair in

             (3) -0198 mm.                                     "054 mm.
    They    point    to  the conclusion        that in the transmission         of the
character     of the hair the Burchell's zebra             is prepotent      over the
horse.
    In  some cases, however, the           hybrid hairs do not resemble those
of the sire any more than those of the dam, but this is not because
they    depart from the hybrid type, but because                   the hairs of the
dam happen          to be not dissimilar          to zebra hairs.      It   has been
mentioned that horse hairs, owing to the large number of breeds of
horses, are very variable, and so            it is not   to be wondered        at that
in some cases sections through horse hairs should resemble sections
through zebra hairs.           This is the    case  with sections taken through
the hairs of the mane of Professor Ewart's Clydesdale mare,

Sections through the hair* of the hybrid              offspring   "Sir John,"         on
the other hand, are in no way suggestive               of those from the dam,
but    closely resemble      those of the hybrids          "Black Agnes"            and
" Brenda,"    one of which is figured (fig. 10).            Professor Kwart has
given reasons      for the conclusion that of the existing species of
zebras the Somali zebra          approaches      nearest   to the ancestral       type.
 He has also shown that the markings of the hybrids resemble                         the.
 markings of the Somali zebra much more closely than those of the
 Burchell's zebra, and this resemblance            he has ascribed     to reversion.
 Now it cannot     be said that the shoulder hairs of the hybrids, either
 in their shape, length, which is rather variable, or in the arrange
 ment of the pigment,       are at all suggestive       of the same hairs in the
 Somali zebra.      "When, however,       we compare the hairs of the mane
 the case is quite different.        A  section    through    a  hair of the mane
 of a hybrid, such     as the one figured,        which is through such          a  hair
 in  " Brenda," which in the mane hair characters               is quite typical of
 the   hybrids, shows     a   fairly   even   distribution     of pigment        and a
 circular line of demarcation between cortex and medulla,                  which are
 also what we find in a mane hair section from the Somali zebra.
 There    is very little of that tendency of           the   pigment     to    become
 more thickly distributed towards the interior of the cortex, such                     as
 I  have found in all sections       through mane hairs of the Bluebell's
 zebra.     This   is  a  curious     result,    and   may,    perhaps,     like     the
 peculiarities of the striping, be ascribed          to reversi    >n  to the      morj
 ancestral type.

  hypothesis that subsequent        offspring are infected by        a previous      sire
  be correct, we might expect to find evidence             of it in the character
  of the hairs of the subsequent offspring.          We have such      a subsequent
  offspring in Professor Ewart's "Circus Girl."                 In 1807 the dam
  " Tundra" gave birth to a hybrid, " Hecla."                 In 189s the subse
  quent foal "Circus      Girl"    was born, the sire       being a bay Shetland
  pony.    Just  as   "Circus Girl," both in          make and      colour,     closely
  resembles   her mother,     so  the hairs    of the two animals are almost
  identical in character,    and sections through the hairs of the manes
  are quite indistinguishable.        There    is  nothing whatever suggestive

  The    same remark is equally applicable, so far as             I  have seen, to the
  other subsequent foals in respect of their hair characters.
      I  must express my indebtedness to Professor Ewart for provid

  the Zoological       Society,   I  am indebted     for what other material           has
 been employed.           In   conclusion,   I  have great pleasure in thanking

      Pott script,  July 31st. — Since writing        the above, Professor Ewart
 has been good enough to obtain for me, through                      the kindness of
 Mr Oldfield Thomas,           some    mane and shoulder          hairs from a zebra
 skin recently brought home from Angola by                     Mr W. Penrice.          Mr
 Thomas* describes the skin as possessing                 " the deeper and more
 essential characters of Equus zebra, such as the forward slope of
                                                             '                      '
 the median        dorsal hairs, the presence         of a     gridiron   pattern      on
the rump," etc., but differing from it           "  so much in other details that
it clearly cannot       be assigned to the       typical form of that         species.*'
 Mr Thomas           adds that since       it is isolated geographically from
E.     zebra,   which is only        known from South Africa, and differs
from      it in   so  many respects,       in the    absence    of evidence of the
existence of intermediate forms,             it must   be regarded as a        distinct
species, which he calls Equus Penricei.
     The characters of this animal's skin are briefly described by                    Mr
Thomas.*         I find  that the individual hairs from the region of the
shoulder resemble closely those of the Somali                    zebra   (E. Grevyi),
which, according to         Mr Thomas, Penrice's zebra            also  resembles in
" the                       of  the   body,  the  short  close   fur,  and  the buffy
         equal striping
tone of     the  light stripes."      The   following    are    measurements of a

       of medulla in three places.                           three places.

In  length the shoulder hairs are scarcely more than those of the
Somali      zebra,   being   usually    a  little over       5   mm.       They   are
appreciably flattened in the middle, agreeing in this respect with
most equine hairs.         A longitudinal striping          can    be   observed in
some of the hairs.        The medulla is not present for            a considerable
distance from the root, and where            it  arises  the hair thickens        out
rapidly    as   with shoulder hairs from the Somali               zebra.     On the
other hand, the medulla extends almost to the hair's tip.                        Pig
ment of    a  lighter colour than that of the rest of the hair is present
throughout       the medullaless    region in the coloured hairs.             Trans
verse sections through        the hairs of the mane present                a circular
outline.      The pigment in the cortical region is evenly distributed
between the cuticle on the one side and the medulla                  on the other.
The line of demarcation between the cortex and medulla is ex
tremely irregular instead of being parallel to the cuticle.

other sections through the mane hairs of this zebra.)

    The habits and mode of existence of Foraminifera                 are always
 interesting subjects to students of the Protozoa, and this fact alone
 might perhaps justify the following              notes,  even were they not
 accompanied       by the valuable drawings         prepared by    Mr G. West,
 from pencil sketches and microscopic slides made by Sir John
 Murray from the living Foraminifera            collected during     the voyage
               '

    The writer is greatly indebted for            the  privilege of examining
 and describing these drawings, and a collection of mounted speci
 mens of a like character, to Sir            John Murray, K.C.B., LL.D.,

  The central figure on Plate I. is that of                                          a fine specimen                   of
Textularia conica (fig.                        1).    The       test    is     rather larger than usual,
consisting of no less than twenty-five                                     chambers     ;   the initial series
being         practically              hyaline or sub-arenaceous in structure.                                    This
example          is   seen        to    be    creeping along               a   smooth spicule of Hyalo-
neina, with the granular                             sarcode        completely          covering            the oral
surface of the test.                          There       is   no sarcode emission, apparently,
from        the       lateral          surfaces of the test,                   and this would               point to
its    imperforate                   character.           From         Station      232,       S.     of     Japan,
345      fathoms.
      Figs.      2    and        3   are     typical specimens of Truncatviina lobaiufa,
fig.   2    showing              the superior, and fig.               3    the inferior        surface of the
shell.        The protruded                   sarcode      in       these      examples seems to form
somewhat              ragged extensions,                  which partially               separate        from         the
main mass surrounding                         the oral opening of the shell, and are pro
bably emitted from the tubules, forming                                        by themselves          a     knotted
reticulum.                These specimens were found moving over the surfaces
of various marine algae.                        Station 232, S. of Japan, 345 fathoms.
      The remaining figures,                    4,   5,   and    6,    on this plate, are examples of
the curiously variable and interesting species                                   Anomalina polymoryha.
In this form we have                    a    remarkable instance of the adaptability of the
foraminiferal              shell to the surfaces over which the organism moves.
This       species         presents two modifications, one with longish, round-
ended spines, and the other, not so frequent, without processes.                                                     The
latter form resembles Discorbina rugosa very closely, but                                             is    as   a   rule
never       so   regularly shaped               ;    and       it   is, moreover, always                associated
with the spinous variety.*                            The specimens shown in                        figs.   4    and   5
were        found         attached to marine                    algas,      and,   it   will    be remarked,
are    fairly regular in the coiling of the shell.                                  The other specimen,
shown in fig.               6,   has adapted its shell to the form of the object of
attachment, the spicule oi Hyalonema                                   ;   and the coiled shell, besides
being laterally elongated,                      is   hollowed          along the longer axis, on its
inferior surface,                    so as to be more               securely seated on the sponge-
spicule.            There        is    little doubt that            these      modifications          of Anoma-

living : and in that condition always appear to have carried an
arming       of   slender     sponge-spicules       round the region of the oral

    In    this remarkable        adaptation      of a foraminiferal          shell to the
surface on which it lives, Anomalina polymoipha                       shows      a parallel
ism      with      Orhitolites     marginalis,         which     at      Funafuti       was
found to frequently          present the most unconventional                modifications
of    the     ordinary discoid       form,      often     appearing      as    a   sinuous,
contorted or S-shaped series of chamberlets when seen in vertical
section in the cores of the Atoll-boring               ;  and in the lagoon*         it was
often found to have attached itself to the fronds of Halimetla, and
even to have wound itself round the cylindrical stems.                             Both in
the     case    of   Anomalina and Orhitolites,              the more       regular form
seems       to   be   the   simpler in construction,          because       formed on a
uniform and successional plan of growth, the wild-growing                          varieties
being a later and hence secondary modification.                      In    the examples
quoted, it is possible that this anomalous Anomalina was derived
from       the    regular    Discorbinw,       and from       Orhitolites       the genus
Nuhecidaria may have been derived through                          the more regular
or intermediate genus Miliolina.

    The specimens of Foraminifera represented in                    fig.  1   are probably
the young of Carpenteria              balaniformis,       Gray.    This      species   is in
its earliest     stage remarkably        like the erect forms of the Rotaline
 type,     as   Truncatidina refulgens and Pulvinulina                   Micheliniana.]
 These young forms are seen living attached to the stems of hydroids,
 and a noteworthy          feature is the presence of         a conspicuous bunch of

sponge-spicules grouped round the mouth of each test.               This habit
of   collecting   sponge-spicules is common to the other species                of
Oarpenteria, and in some cases, notably in C. rliaphidodendron,               the
sponge-spicules are often enclosed in the sarcode within the test               in
such abundance that at first sight        the animal resembles a sponge
rather than a f oraminifer.
    The other specimens       on  Plate II.  (fig. 2) are    a  small    variety
of    the    deep-water   type    of  Pulvinidina      elegant,    and     these,
similarly     with the Truncatulince       before     mentioned,      have     an
irregular    mass  of sarcode surrounding      the test.

    The Foraminifera figured on this plate were obtained off St
Vincent, in the Cape Verd Islands, at a depth of 10 fathoms
(30th   July   1873).
    Amphistegina     Lessonii, of which there are numerous specimens
in this dredging, is here      seen  to be attached to an        algae,  and   its
sarcode almost covers the weed in places.              Another and much
smaller species accompanies the AmphistegincB, bearing                 a  strong
resemblance to Discorbina globularis       ; but this is not quite clear in
the absence     of specimens preserved in the mountings, which               the
writer has examined for them, but without success.
    The   species  upon which the above        remarks have been made,
illustrated by the beautiful drawings by        Mr West, will, the writer
ventures to think, amply show the interest attaching to any records
relating    to the appearance and habits of living Foraminifera ; and
this   may be     an incentive     to those who have opportunities            for
collecting and preserving these tiny creatures when they are in the
living condition     to add to our knowledge         in this direction,      and
especially to note any facts regarding the changes or development
of the animal during its life's history.

Photographs of the Corona taken during the Total
       Solar        Eclipse of May 28th, 1900.                              By Thos.
       Heath, B.A. (With Five Plates.)
                                (Read   July  15, 1901.)
    In June     of last year    I   had the honour of reading before this
Society     a  preliminary     account of the Scottish            expedition      for the
observation of the Total Solar Eclipse of May 28th, 1900, at Santa
Pola,    on    the   south-east coast       of   Spain     (long.    0'    30'   W., Lit
38°    13'  N.).     I  have now to lay before the Society the                      results
of the part        of the expedition        specially     assigned      to   me,     which
was to obtain photographs of the Corona.                    I  succeeded     in securing
four, that being the largest number                I   considered it advisable             to
attempt in the very short total phase of eclipse, only 75 seconds
being available        for the exposures aud           necessary      manipulation         of
the camera        backs.
    According to my original plan,              I  had arranged to expose                the
four plates       as  follows : — The first immediately after totality                com
menced, with an exposure of              1  second   ;  for   the   second     T  allowed
an exposure of 6 seconds;             for the third, 15 seconds          :  and for      the
fourth,     1    second.      For     each   of   the three        intervals      between
successive     exposures necessary for turning the backs, closing                       and
opening the slides, etc.,        I found I     had to allow 15 seconds.
     I drilled myself for several days before the eclipse, till                 1  found     I
 could get through         my programme          quite comfortably           in the    time
 allotted    to each     part, and finish with my fourth plate exposed                       a
 few    seconds      before   totality ended.          In    the agitation which            is
 almost     inseparable     from     the supreme        moment        of    an eclipse,      I
 suppose     I  must have made some of my intervals rather longer                      than
 I  had arranged, with the result that my last plate appears to                        have
 been     exposed at       the   critical   moment       when       the    sun    was just
 beginning to reappear outside the western limb of the moon.                           This
 fact is well shown on the photograph.                   The presence of           the sun
 has not, however,         in any way interfered            with the      success of     the

 1900-1.]   Mr Thomas Heath            on Photographs        of the Corona.       397
 photograph as a picture of the Corona.               I  regret to say that, owing
 to the amount of       light in the sky during the whole progress of the
 total   phase,    the    two   longer-exposed       plates show      more or      less
 fogging    of the background,          making     it rather difficult to obtain
 good prints.       This is more especially the           case  with No.    3, which
 had the longest exposure.
    The instrument with which the photographs were obtained is an
 equatorially     mounted      telescopic camera,        belonging    to  the Royal
 Observatory, Edinburgh, with            a  Cooke triple object-glass of 6-inch
 aperture and 104 inches focal length.                 The object-glass had been
only recently acquired by the Royal Observatory when the eclipse
took place.        It  had, however, been mounted sufficiently               long to
allow of its being carefully tested by Professor Copeland, who con
cluded that     it was admirably suited for such a purpose as photograph
ing the Corona.           A few trial photographs were also made for the
purpose of determining the focus, and at the same time testing the
photographic definition.           Amongst      others, the trail of the double
star   £
           Ursje Majoris        was   photographed.           On   developing,      the
trail was found         to be    distinctly double in all its length.             The
difference    of declination       of the two components is 12"-6.              If   we
compare this with the moon's angular                 diameter and her diameter
measured on the eclipse plates = 0*94 of an inch, we will find the
distance between the two trails to be            T^^    of an inch.
    It  will  be    seen   from the photographs           that the whole       of the
moon's disc is surrounded             by coronal      light,   but that    the    rays
about the sun's polar          regions are very much shorter than those
which emanate from the regions about the equator,                   the  usual form
of Corona at minimum of sun-spots.
   The long streamers stretching out to the                east and west occupy
about    135°    of the limb on each side, and are               nearly symmetri
cally placed with reference              to   the    sun's    equator.     The    two
sides,   however,      present quite       different     configurations,    in their
outermost extensions more especially.                 The western streamer has
its longest extension at the sides, which reach                 outwards about a
solar   diameter      and    a  half,   as   measured on photograph            3,  the
northern edge being somewhat longer than the southern.                         These
edges start from the        limb in beautifully curved lines for about half
their length ; the outer halves, on the contrary, are straight and

slightly divergent.            The portions of this streamer lying inside                              the
edges fade away more rapidly than the sides, giving                                   it   somewhat
the appearance           of a swallow-tail.              On the eastern           side there            are
four streamers,          one of which         is,   however, much longer and                          more
conspicuous       than the others, and              is   of about the same length                 as the
edges of the western.               The extreme end3 of these four rays                           can be
easily seen separated          ;   but, up to   a    distance of about half the                       sun   's
diameter from the limb, they coalesce, forming together the bright
inner region of the Corona.                  From        a   careful study of the                 photo
graphs,   it    seems to me that the eastern section of the Corona                               is   made
up of four roughly                 conical streamers,             whose       bases     overlap         one
another to some extent at right angles to the line of sight.                                           The
western section, on the other hand, would appear to be composed                                             of
several streamers        :    three, at least, can be made out, whose bases                                 do
not overlap, or do so only to             a   small extent.
  The polar regions present              a   great contrast to the east and                            west
equatorial       regions.       They are       much          more       contracted          in    extent
along the limb, covering only about 45° at each pole, and                                         instead
of the long, far-reaching streamers, show only short feathery                                         tufts,
seven     or eight in number at each                      pole.        They curve away from
the north and south poles of the sun's axis, and collectively give
one the idea of groups              of feathers arranged as plumes.                              There      is
no appearance           on any of these photographs of the dark rifts which
have been found on some other photographs of this eclipse, and                                              of
some previous eclipses, such as 189G.                        The Corona surrounds                        the
limb at all points, and in the spaces between the tufts the                                            light
fades     away to        so   small an extent, and so gradually, that                            it    is   in
some cases difficult to be sure that there                         is   a   division between            the
rays, without very careful examination of the negatives.
   As to        the    possibilities of the photographic method for                                giving
large-scale      pictures of the Corona, there                    is   no doubt that        it    is   only
since     the    introduction        of photography into the regular work                                   ot
eclipse-observing that reliable pictures of the forms of the                                      Corona
have been             obtained.       Though         several           good    photographs              had
previously been made by                 Dr De la Rue and                      others,      it    was not
before the eclipses of 1870 and 1871 that really successful                                      picture?
of the outer regions of the Corona were obtained.                                     In    the latter
year Mr Davis at Baikul and                   Mr Henessy at Dodabetta                       succeeded

in obtaining photographs which for beauty of detail have not since
been much, if at all, improved upon. Reproductions of drawings
made from the combined negatives of                          each    of   these    observers
will    be found        in vol. xli. of Memoirs of            the    Royal Astronomical
Socvty.         A glance      at these     two pictures will show their remark
able     resemblance,        and     even     careful    examination        fails to show
differences       between       them in        more     than    a   few of the minuter
details.      In     each   the    Corona extends to rather less than                  a  solar
diameter from the limb.                As   to the    drawings made          by hand from
visual observations with              telescopic    assistance    — and this     is also true
of every      eclipse    observed in this way — there             is nothing so remark
able     as  their dissimilarity.          On the other hand. Captain Tupman's
drawing depicts the Corona extending to fully \h diameters
from the limb, as compared with less than one diameter of the
photographs.
    Somewhat           similar     has   been     the   result    of    the  1900     eclipse.
 None of      the photographs, or reproductions                  of photographs, which
 have      come      under     my notice,         show    so    far-reaching       a   Corona
 as is shown in what           I   quite believe is       a   most faithfully executed
 drawing.          I   refer to the drawing            by   l>r   A. Wolfer of Zurich
 and      two     colleagues,       published       in   the    Arrhires       des    Scienr'S
 Physiques       et  Naturelles of Geneva.             "While in my photographs the
 Corona reaches outwards about                  a  diameter and       a  half,  Dr Wolfer's
 drawing shows it extending more than two diameters,                              and a very
 striking peculiarity of         the drawing, as compared             to the photographs,
 is   that    the     eastern    extension, instead of coming to                 a   point, is
 spread out to          a shape      very similar to the western              extension.
     It   would       appear,     therefore, that photography,              as   at   present
 practised, has its limitations in the direction of coronal work, and
 by no means does away with the usefulness of trustworthy                                draw
 ings.      These limitations are particularly              felt in such an eclipse          as
 that of May           1900,    on account of the short duration of totality
  and the general brightness of the sky.                   There seems no reason             to
 suppose,      however, that photographs of the Corona could not                             be
  taken in     a long total eclipse, of say five minutes' duration, which
  would show the extensions               as   far out    as   they were visible to the
  eye, unless we are to adopt the suggestion                    which has been made,
  that the outermost         regions are less rich in actinic light, as compared

ever, that further             efforts    should be made             with   the most        suitable
instruments          available, before           photography          has       to    confess itself
unable to do for the whole of the Corona what it has already                                        done
for the greater part of it.

Corona, though the details are necessarily not                             so   distinct as         they

Observations on Binary Fission in the Life-History of
   Ciliata. By Dr J. Y. Simpson. (With Two Plates.)
                                                (Read June         3,   1901.)
    The simplest and most common                                     form of reproduction amongst
the Ciliata            is   binary fission.               In this ordinary, possibly vegetative,
method of reproduction the plane                                   of division        is   generally perpen
dicular to the long axis of the creature.                                      To this generalisation                the
Vorticellidic           form an apparent exception, but on the view that their
evident long axis really corresponds to the dorso-ventral axis of
other ciliates their case falls into line with that of the rest of the
sub-class.             Formerly              many instances of fission in the direction of
the long axis were                       described        ;   they may safely be considered                            to
have been mere instances of conjugation.
    Jiinary fission                most       commonly takes place                     while       the        creature
moves          is.,
              about;         (in most cases at least) an activity
                                         it    is
temporarily added   to all the other activities of ciliate existence.
As such       it    may be considered to be the original                                   method of repro
duction.            Under other conditions                         fission may take place                when the
creature          is   at rest     ;     or, in other words, in certain cases binary fis
sion    is   not associated                  with    free     movement           ;   on the contrary, this
stationary fission                 is   usually associated with the formation of                               a    cyst.
Under these circumstances the operation may take place more than
once    in succession.                  Such stationary fission together with budding                                       -
which        is   simply       a    form of fission where the products are                                so    unlike
in size as to be distinguishable                              as   parent and offspring — are                       best
considered             as   modifications of ordinary binary fission.
    I!y ordinary binary                      fission,     then, we understand the division                             of
a   ciliate during its active free existence into two daughters by                                                      a
constriction            more        or less transverse to its long axis.                                 It    is   con
fessedly          difficult        to arrive         at   a    rationale of binary fission.                         One
might suppose that                      it   was associated             with   a   certain limit of size, and
that,   as    is   more evident               in    the case of globular Hhizopoda, since the
bulk increases                as    the cube         of the diameter while the surface                                in

creases only as the square,          relief is obtained by the        process.        But
it has    been shown more than once— indeed is matter                     of common
observation     — that binary fission takes place             at  all  stages     in the
development of certain Infusoria, and is not merely postponed                          till
they reach a definite size.              That is to     say, binary fission is not
necessarily connected with growth beyond the specific mass of the
species.      For example, in encysted forms, there is              no possibility      of
growth      previous to division, and in other cases,              as   the result of
 continuous division,        there may be an actual decrease             in   size.    To
put the matter briefly, actual increase in size is neither a constant
precursor or result of binary fission per           se in the case of the Infusoria.
 All   that can be said is that while in certain cases,            e.g^   Styloniehia,
 Euplotes,    a  distinct   lengthening is noticeable at the commencement
 of the process, in others, e.g., Stentor, Spirrwtonnttn, no such phe
 nomenon is observable.
     Another question        has interest    in this connection— where           are   the
 first   signs of     the   process noticeable,        in the nucleus or in tho
 cytoplasm     ?   In   view of the fact that both answers have been given
 by first-class workers,         Biitschli contents himself with stating for
 the majority that there are undoubtedly                   many     instances where
                                                                                           ''
 there are hints of new formations in the plasma, e.g., the "anlage
 of    the   new     ciliary apparatus, mouth,           or   contractile      vacuoles,
 before     any    change in either           macronucleus      or micronucleus           is
 observable.
     Simple binary fission, apart from nuclear considerations, is not
 a   very    complicated        process.     As already      stated,    the    plane     of
 division lies more or less at right angles to the long axis of the
 body, and usually approximately               near the middle.        It  is necessary
 to make the qualification             " more or less,"     because   in the case of
 Spirnstomum        teres, at any rate, the plane of division             is somewhat
 oblique, as Stein observed so long ago as 1S67 (Der Org<tni*mu*
 der    Infurionzthiere,       Bd.    II.).    In   the    more    highly organised
 Ciliata the special organs have                 to  be duplicated,      and      this    is
  achieved either by division of the already existing organ or by fresh
  formation in one of the offspring.              The former method is compara
  tively rare, and only occurs where the organ or system in question,
  as, e.g., the canals connected           with the contractile       vacuoles, runs
  practically     the    entire   length    of the creature.       When the twin

organ is entirely formed             anew, the position        of the original           one
usually decides upon which of the daughters this work devolves.
Be it in the anterior portion of the parent, it is generally found
that the daughter that develops from the posterior half will have
to form the new organ.              Of Paramecium, however, it may                 be said
that the mouth lies         as a rule slightly in the posterior half of the body             ;
and in this particular           instance the new mouth             is always formed
behind the old one, and this involves               considerable consequent dis
placement.          One or two abnormal Parameeia,              in which the mouth
lay unusually close to the tail, gave one the opportunity                    of verifying
the correctness of this exception, even in              such extreme cases.                It
is, however, the anterior contractile vacuole that is formed anew in
either daughter.
     In  the case of the Hypotricha there is             a   renewal       of the whole
ventral ciliary apparatus of both daughters                   as a consequence             of
division     : the      same   phenomenon      occurs after conjugation.                The
process has been studied by Stein, Balbiani,                   Engelmann,         Sterki,*
 and Prowazek,t and even yet we cannot claim to know all the
 details.      I   have attempted to       follow the      process     in the      case of
 Siylonichia, the favourite object of examination, but it is                       a work
 of exceptional difficulty.           Previous to division, new frontal cirri are
 formed in the anterior             half of the dividing creature, practically
 under the old        :  they are remarkably      transparent       and clear.        Then
 follow in     succession,     according to Prowazek,       the new adperistomal
 cirri, and finally the still insignificant             anal      cirri.     Behind      the
 marginal cirri the rudiments of their successors                 are formed        at the
 same     time   ;  they have a very crowded           appearance.
                                                                              " The new
 adoral membranella? arise close behind               the old, so that at           a  later
 stage the latter         seems   ruptured."    This sentence settles the                one
 point most in dispute among the older workers as to whether the
 adoral zone was renewed or not.                Personally     I   have no doubt of
 the fact.       Much the      same can be also observed         in what will       be the
 posterior daughter.            The new cirri appear first as cilia, and are
 very irregular and often violent in their motions, contrasting                        with

the old ones, which are generally lifeless.                   Their    area of origin is
very much less than that which they eventually occupy.                           The new
anal cirri, in the     case  of the posterior daughter, are formed                   above
the old.     The area occupied by the latter is marked off by                       a sort
of furrow, and undergoes          degeneration although there is no actual
separation from the body of the creature — rather absorption.
   In binary    fission the nucleus is naturally                 the seat of the       must
complicated processes.           Even when changes are first noticeable in
the cytoplasm, it can be sufficiently well                    maintained on a priori
grounds that there          are previous changes               in the nucleus, which,
though    invisible,     are   yet the       inciting       cause   of   those   that     are
visible   in the      plasma.        Macronucleus            and micronucleus          alike
divide, the latter usually in advance of the former.                       It  is not yet
possible to state authoritatively whether, in the                   case  of two micro-
nuclei,   the    two    halves of       the      same       micronucleus      go   to    one
daughter, or whether it is         a  half of each of the micronuclei that                 go
to form the daughter micronucleus in any one of the offspring.
   With    regard   to the duration of the             process, no definite rule can
be  laid down.       I  have noted the         following        periods for the forms
named when under observation               :   -
                    Paramecium caudatum, 1A-2 hours.
                    Stylonichia puslulata,             1-2   hours.
                    Lacrymaria olor,           1-1. ',  hours.
                    Spirostomum ambigunm, 1-2 hours.
                    Spirostomum        teres,    1-2 hours.
   As regards the rate of fission,           it may be noted in the first            place
that it is by no means constant throughout the Ciliata,                        but  varies
with the species.        Each species has its own normal rate of divisi"n
depending upon its specific           qualities.         The following      list of    rates
of division is based upon            Maupas.           I   have    ventured to modify
it slightly,   in accordance        with my own results.                  The range        of
temperature on which          I  base the modifications is 16°-22° C.

    In  the second place, we may note that the rate of fission depends
intimately upon the food conditions                to  which the creatures           are
subjected.      In   conducting these experiments           I   have been in the
habit of employing two distinct foods — either                a  hay infusion      of a
light straw       colour,    into    which one       put  a     piece   of meat to
hasten     the   production       of   bacteria,  or else the forms produced
by     making     a     very     dilute   paste     with   ordinary       flour     and
water.      Paramecium         and Stylonichia take         kindly     to   either    of
these media, of which a drop               was   added daily to the slide on
which they were isolated.             The conditions     were kept       as  constant
as    possible    by    the    withdrawal of        a  couple     of drops     of   the
medium (some four or five drops in all) in which they had passed
the night, which were replaced by one of food and another of
distilled water.         Pond     water was also sometimes employed,                but
greater constancy was secured by the other method.                      I  could    not
 find  that either of these          two food media made           any appreciable
difference on the rate of division.             But after  a    certain   amount of
 manipulation     one learned that there was a minimum                 of food that
 kept, e.g., Paramecia,        as  they were   ; that there was also a definite
 amount, usually one drop, which caused one division in twenty-four
 hours   ; and that there was also a maximum which seemed to have
 an  inhibitory   effect upon the forms        in question.       In  this case the
 body of, ejj., Stylonichia, became positively black with unassimilated
 food matter, a condition of affairs that is reproduced in fig. 1.
Change to      a   less   rich medium       soon   resulted in a return         to the
 normal state of affairs.
    We may note in the third place that the rate of division                      bears
a  direct relation to temperature.           To Maupas belongs        the    credit of
having established this fact upon           a comparatively       sound basis.       As
far back as 1776 Spallanzani            had observed that the multiplication
of   Ciliata was accelerated by increased temperature.                      But it is
Maupas' chief count against the defective work of his predecessors
that they had not properly attended — in some cases not at all — to
the   temperature        and    food   conditions.     The following         rates    of
division under different temperatures are taken direct from Maupas.

the Infusoria are kept has                               a   direct influence upon their power of
increase.               Thus he says that Paramecium                                        aurelia    requires to          be
kept in            a     cubic centimetre of water in order to realise its full
power of multiplication.                                In    view of the interesting results that
E. Warren has obtained with different bulks of water in the                                                             case
of Daplinia (Q.                J. M.       S., 1900), it would seem as if similar treatment
of the             Infusoria         offered           a     field in which good results could                              be
obtained.
        It   has       long been known                       that the comparative regularity with
which binary fission was carried out in favourable circumstances
decreased as the period lengthened                                        since       the last conjugation.                      I
have          observed             this    phenomenon                     several           times     in the     case       of
Paramecium cawlatum and Stylonirhia punt., but have been unable
to express the                gradually                decreasing          energy in the terms of any
formula.                On    the         other hand, it has been maintained                                    that im
mediately after coming out of conjugation these two forms                                                             show
a    marked increase                      in       the rate           of fission — the               expression        of      a
surplusage of energy                           ;    of       this phenomenon,                       however,     I     have
never seen any trace.                              So far as          I   am aware,            conjugation        results
in no difference in the after-rate of ordinary                                                  multiplication,         and
this also would appear to be true of light and darkness.
     Before proceeding to examine Maupas' theory of binary                                                           fission
and          the       recent attack                   upon       it, I     should            like to refer to           his
specification of two distinct                                 species       of Paramecium                aurelia        and

which the latter                   is   described as possessing                         an elongated body,                  as

being fusiform, obtuse in front and thinner behind.                              This  species
is also    credited with one micronucleus, and the zygote nucleus was
said     to    give rise to eight           corpuscles.        The other       species   had    a
broader body,            was    almost oval,      and obtuse at both extremities.
It   further     possessed two micronuclei,              and the zygote nucleus gave
rise to only four corpuscles. Since this account no special notice
seems to have been taken of the two species, except to cast doubt
upon their existence             as  two distinct species.           Thus, in the Zoologie
Descriptive, Fabre-Domergue                  states     that neither        he nor Balbiani
have ever        come       across   this Paramecium             with the double micro-
nucleus, and he makes                the   remark      in such      a way      as to suggest
that Maupas was drawing on his imagination in his description of
it.      Accordingly we find but one species — caudatum, with the
single micronucleus            —recognised       generally        in the text-books         and
other      literature.         There     is no doubt, however, that                these    two
distinct      species      do exist.      Figs.  2    and    3   are photographs        of the
 two    species      which give        a  very good idea of their relative                sizes.
 Measurement            of    certain stained specimens which bring out the
 nuclear characteristics              give   P. aurelia         a length     of 80/n and a
 breadth       of    40   /n,  while on the       same       scale    P. caudatum        has    a
 length of       130 /x and a breadth            of     50  /*.     These figures, though
 hardly exact for the living form, bring out the peculiar feature
 of aurelia        as    compared with caudatum,                  viz.,   the high     propor
 tion    that     its    breadth      bears   to  its     length.       The magnification
 of the photographs             is about 80.         I   may also       mention here that
 I made      frequent       endeavours, through isolation of pairs, to get the
 two     species      to   conjugate.       The disproportion            in  size offered no
 a priori objection,            as one     often sees equal disproportion              in the
 case     of   conjugating          Stylonichia    ;    and even        in the    case of     P.
 caudatum the inequality is often marked.                          The representatives of
 P.   caudatum were selected from a culture in which an epidemic of
 conjugation        had set in     ;  while the aurelia were taken from another
 culture which was far advanced in the number of its divisions.                                 1
  never had the chance of contemporaneous epidemics amongst the two
 species, and accordingly always selected                    P. caudatum         as the form
  that  one certainly         knew was ready for conjugation, inasmuch                  as  it is
  the larger and probably more forceful species.                         Out of twenty-one
  attempts     I  had but two partial successes.                 Conjugation       took place

on two slides       : the period was normal.             After separation each of
the ex-conjugates divided once                : on the third day they died off.
 In  anticipation of something of this sort from analogy in higher
forms,    I intended      to let the two pairs run their natural course, fore
 going the desire to examine their                  nuclear   condition.     In   view,
therefore, of the incompleteness of the experiment,                    it is   perhaps
 unwarrantable         to draw      any results regarding         hybridisation      and
infertility, or even the "fixity of species,"                  so  far down in        the
animal scale.
    As   has been previously          mentioned,      numbers of observers have
remarked        that     the   comparative        regularity   with    which binary
fission proceeds        under     favourable      circumstances decreases       as    the
time     increases      since     the     last conjugation,     and one     has often
wondered       if it would not       be possible to express this decrease              by
means of a mathematical              curve or formula.        In  this connection, it
is Maupas' chief distinction           to have established that in the case of
each species this power            of binary fission comes to an end after               a
definite number of divisions            ;  and that, were there no other method
of restoring this potentiality to the individual, the species would               come
to an end.         "With the later stages of this gradual loss of fission-
energy, he found distinct             degeneration of the creature associated.
In    this degeneration          he distinguished        two    well-marked     stages.
The first    stage is not accentuated by any particular external change
in the infusorian, unless, possibly, a slight reduction in size.*                      It
continues to feed and multiply in the normal manner, but all                         the
while it is giving rise        to successors       that  are  entering    the second
stage of degeneration.             Moreover, when preserved in the ordinary
method it is found            to   have undergone         a certain   atrophy of its
nuclear apparatus.           The macronucleus fragments (StyL ptut.), or
may disappear            altogether (Styl. myt.).             The micronuclei are
reduced to one, or even none (Styl. pust. and Orytrlcha up.).                         On
the other hand, after such reduction                  they may later      increase     to
 numbers in excess of the norm (Styl. myt. and Onychodromus gr.).
In   the second stage of this senile degeneration the infusorian                   loses
its power of multiplication.               It   no longer takes in food, and its
body in consequence           becomes       quite clear.    There is now a marked
 decrease    in size,t and atrophy of external organs and                 appendages
    *
       In the case of Stylonic/iia pust. this reduction varied from 25 to 50 p.

1900—1.]    Dr J. Y. Simpson            on   Binary Fission of Ciliata.                  409
sets in.      Finally, this degeneration further                   expresses    itself in a
sort     of  sexual     hypersesthesia,         causing     sterile   conjugations       that
inevitably end in the death of the partners.
   Now, Maupas determined that senile degeneration                                began in
the    case of Styl. pust.          about the        170th generation          or division,
and     that   death      ensued at the 316th.                  Similarly,     cultures     of
Onycliodromus         became      extinct      after 330 generations, and so on.
It  is also an integral part of his theory that it is impossible to
induce conjugation during the earlier bipartitions which cover a
definite     period     of immaturity         :  in the     case    of Styl.     pust.    this
extended       to the      130th     division.       At the end of           these    earlier
divisions   — at the 131st in the                case    of   Stylonichia    — puberty is
attained, and conjugation can be induced.                       This period of eugamy
lasts     over   a  definite number of divisions — until the 170th, as
we    know in       the    case of     Stylonichia      — when senile degeneration
sets   in, ending in death.
    The first thing that strikes           one when examining             Maupas'      tables

    I  have   taken the        figures   for   the   first fortnight,     but greater
regularity could have been shown if one had taken a fortnight                        at   a
later date.    Fabre-Domergue confesses that he never succeeded                         in
obtaining such regularity in any cultures                that he undertook, and
it seems to me that in so saying he intimates that                       he obtained
a series   of divisions       that    is much more         natural   than anything
represented    in Maupas' mathematical tables.                  When cultures of
Stylonichia or Paramecium are kept in glass vessels where they may
have some small bulk of water in which to live, they do not
multiply    at  this rate,        or with such regularity.           It   is not     my
intention,    however,      to    impeach Maupas'         tables as    a   whole,     for
with    his results   I   find myself        largely    in agreement       as against
his latest adversary Joukowsky.                  Xevertheless,     apart altogether
from venturing      to inquire       how such exactness was acquired              as is
expressed    in 935 Stylonichia,         I  would maintain         that the results
which Maupas first established are reached by                 a process    of division
that is far from regular, and depends              to   a great   extent upon        the
individuality   of the infusorian.          Even under the happiest           possible
conditions (so far     as    one can judge),        artificial or natural, binary
fission does not proceed with that constant regularity that the French
savant would ascribe to it.            The following table, representing         a  few
weeks of a short series, expresses,            I believe,   a more   natural rate of
progress   than one would gather to be the case from Maupas'                     table.
The form experimented with was Paramecium                       caudaium, and          in
every case the series        was    commenced        with two     exconjugates.         I
have reckoned that case as one bipartition in 24 hours, where half                     or
 more of the creatures       on the slide divided.

     Here,          then,    in     a period          of   three weeks, with              a   temperature
tanging from                16"    to 24°      C,      there      is,    over six slides, an average
of   eight divisions.                   This   series          was by no means            the       first        that
I   inaugurated, and the slides were numbered from                                        a     to r.            The

 414           Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh,                        [sea.
 majority were treated daily in a constant manner, given the                          same
 definite   amount of food (calculated from previous experiments),
 and provided         with a certain amount of fresh water at definite
 intervals.     With the others            I   experimented       in the     amount        of
 food given, in the period of time that they were left without                          any
 change of water, in the amount of water on the slide, and                         so on.
 In   no single instance         did    I   obtain    such    clockwork        regularity
as Maupas' tables show.            The slides, whose history is given,                were
amongst those that were treated with regularity                       so far as     I   was
able, and consequently          they were all treated alike.             Hence     a d»y
like June      25,     when    but    one     of the slides shows           a   complete
Maupasian       division, appears to me to represent the more natural
state of affairs, and      for no   reason     more than       this.    Maupas' table
of    Stylonicliia      pustulata    admittedly        deals with       a   form       that
multiplies     more quickly         than      Paramecium        caiulatum     — possibly
about twice       as an      average over        all temperatures.          But   at the
close of the first three weeks his           Stylonicliia   has divided        no fewer
than     thirty-nine      times    with     a   temperature      that    ranged from
15° to 19° C.         Now, no    one has laid more stress upon the influence
of temperature in raising the rate of division than Maupas, and yet
I do   not find from the table that his high rates of division                        bear
any relation to the temperature.                Quite the contrary         is the     case,
for out of the four occasions within the first three weeks                     on which
the    Stylonichia divided         three      times in     24    hours,     on two        of
them the temperature was actually a degree lower than the previous
day,    when     it divided      a less      number     of   times.       Accordingly,
although     I believe that ultimately          continued binary fission involves
a certain degeneration, and that Maupas' theory                      of the matter         is
largely    correct, still it is altogether false to imagine that under
natural    conditions      a  Stylonichia will rush through 316                 divisions
in  4i   months     :  that is to say,    the validity of Maupas'             method       is
open to question, and where this is so the results are always                             in
jeopardy more or less.
    I  may refer here to two peculiar               cases  of    division     that   came
under my notice.           On 13th May           1900 two paramecian ex conju
gates   were isolated on        a   slide and subjected to ordinary culture
treatment.       On the 14th they were as before; on the 15th                        there
were    three  ;   they    remained       at   this  number       on the 16th           and

presented       no    abnormality.*         On     the     17th     there      were      four
Paramecin       on the      slide, but one      of them       had developed           a  cleft
tail.    The cleft was       in   a plane perpendicular          to the dorso-ventral
axis.     From the first it extended to           a  depth of about 25 /i and did
not grow deeper.           Otherwise the creature           appeared     to be perfectly
normal    :  the two contractile         vacuoles    functioned       and the       internal
circulation     swept round, clear of the divided tail.                    On the        18th
it remained        as  it   was.      On   the   19th     it had divided, and the
anterior half, though           distinctly    undersized and resembling rather
the species aurelia in configuration, was yet normal in every other
 respect and continued afterwards to divide by itself.                      < >n  the    20th
the original form again divided, but not on the 21st.                       However, on
the 22nd it resumed             operations, and while the anterior one still
 retained its aurelian characters,          I  noticed that the internal circula
 tion of the posterior half no longer swept clear of the tail, but had
 partially entered      into one (the dorsal) lobe, which now contained
 excretory granules and one or two small food vacuoles.                              At the
same time this lobe had slightly increased in size, while                        the    other
had correspondingly decreased.                On the 23rd it divided again, but
not    on   the    24th.      The anterior       parts     still  retained       the    same
characteristics as formerly, and gave rise themselves                       to otherwise
normal      Paramecin.          In   the   posterior cleft-tail       Paramecium          the
dorsal    lobe   continued to grow, while the other was more and
more absorbed.         The mouth also          was    driven unusually           far back.
On the 25th and 26th it again divided, but not on the 27th.                              The
ventral lobe had now been completely absorbed,                         while     the    other
had increased in size         till it now     measured       some 60     /x ;  there     was,
however, no proportionate increase in breadth, and there seemed to
be a tendency for        it  to get blocked.        At any       rate   the    number of
excretory granules increased,              and the      circulation      slowed down.
On the 28th and 29th it again divided, but the dorsal tail seemed
thoroughly congested,           and by the 30th it was dead.               Xone of the
daughters reproduced             the   peculiarity     in themselves          or   in their
descendants.
    The other case is still more peculiar.                   About      the    same time
as    the preceding         exconjugates       were     isolated — one         of    several

series  — on       another    slide     two     had    been    set     aside,       which       on
the    following      day    were   found to be still, in           a   sense,       the    same
number.         Yet evidently one of the creatures had begun to divide,
but stopped in the process, so that while on the slide there was
one normal form, the other was a monster, composed                             of two full-
grown Paramenia with organic union between the anterior                                 part     of
what should have been the posterior daughter and the                                 posterior
part of the anterior one.             There was no constriction              between           the
two, or other hint of their origin.                   The two bodies           formed         one
continuous whole with one circulation, and was so flexible through
out that the two extremities could touch.                      On the        17th     of Aiay
it appeared, and on the 18th was in no way changed.                                   On      the
 1 9th   the slide on which           it    was   isolated contained three forms                  :
the   monster had given            oft'   a daughter      from     either end.           These
daughters were ordinary P. caudatum of good average                               size ;   they
continued to divide by themselves,                and in every way appeared to be
normal.        On the 20th the monster remained as it was, but again
on the      21st     it  repeated    the     operation of giving off            a   daughter
from either end.            On the 22nd it had not multiplied, but on the
 23rd for the third and last time it had given off                      a  daughter from
either end.        These last, however, were markedly smaller in size, and
otherwise like the " aurelian

                                             daughters that had been given off by
the    cleft-tail individual.         Previous to this the posterior                 creature
had gradually been becoming inclined at an angle to the anterior
one.      Up    to this point the combined            activity   of the monster had
been as great as that of any normal Paramecium.                              The anterior
half, perhaps        naturally,   was      the   more active,    and,     in   a sense, the
guiding       part.     Its cilia   were       feverishly    active   :  they were         also
longer and better developed, especially in the anterior regions, than
those of the posterior creature.                This greater anterior activity            may
also have found expression               in   a  process   that began         to come off
from it     a   little   above   the     angle    made    with the posterior             form.
Further,       the    two    contractile       vacuoles    of the anterior           creature
were close together and contracted simultaneously.                         From the      23rd,
i.e., about a week          after its appearance,           growth ceased           to show
itself, as we have seen, in the regular separation from either                             end
of two daughters on every second day, and began rather to express
itself in the growth of the aforesaid process and in remarkable

lateral expansion of the anterior half.                 This and an earlier             stage
are shown in fig. 4.           In   this peculiar condition it remained with
slight modifications about another week, but was                    dead by the 28th.
    Up till     quite recently Maupas' classical work has been permitted
to    go    comparatively      unchallenged.           In the     Verhandlungen            des
Naturhistorisch-Medizinischer Vereins                 zn Heidelberg,         however,       D.
Joukowsky publishes             certain
                                             " Beitrage       zur    Frage        nach    den
Bedingungen          der Vermehrung         und des Eintritts der Konjugation
bei den Ciliaten," which            go    contrary      somewhat        to    the received
views.
    Joukowsky's         observations      were made        upon Pleurotrieha lan-
ceolata    — a form allied to Stylonichia — Paramecium cavdatum, and
 Paramecium putrinum.               He     says   that he got irregular             divisions
 at first   :  only after  a month did the forms divide regularly.                      After
 the numbers on a slide had reached one hundred,                              division    was
 slower.       I  have already referred         to this question         of regular and
 irregular division.         My own experiments              were more            than   once
 carried on considerably          over two months, and            I  did not find any
 greater regularity       after the first four weeks than           I  did during         that
 time.       Nor is it   easy to see    why this should          be so.          To imagine
 that     these    infusorians    will settle down             after     a     month      into
 regular methods of division simply means failure                    to appreciate the
 conditions of the experiment.               Joukowsky indeed               says     that the
 abnormalities        in the division        rate were       due to the            abnormal
 relations       in which the        creatures      live.   Bacteria         generate and
 hinder ordinary division,             and    one     may   well suppose that              the
 secretions       and   excretions     of   the creatures        themselves may              be
 ultimately dangerous in such            a  circumscribed area.            But then this
 investigator      deliberately    states    that after     a   month         the divisions
 became regular ; and yet we are not led to believe that he had
 found any means of overcoming the difficulties in which he sees the
  cause of the earlier irregular         divisions.       Obviously,       therefore, they
  cannot      have played      the    part    that     he  imagines.           I   may     also
  mention here that Maupas, while                making     these     largely statistical
  experiments in binary fission, employed cover-glasses on his slides
  in the damp chamber.              This appears to          me    to    have       been    the
  introduction      of an altogether unnecessary artificial condition.                       So
  far  as  regards the observation         of the mere        rate and other simple

418              Proceedings                of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                                          [fc
aspects       of binary              fission,         I   never employed cover-glasses                          :     any
infusorian        requiring high-power                         examination            was easily isolated.
Maupas also states that in his damp chamber there was very slight
evaporation, and that
                       " when it was            " he made com
                                      necessary
pensation       for the loss with rain water.                              If    he added food          daily, it
is difficult to see how                 it was never                necessary in addition              to make
up for evaporation.                    If    the latter had to be done at all,                             it       were
surely better to change                     the water in greater or in less quantity
with regularity, and so give less occasion                                      to bacteria to generate.
I   cannot say that              I    found the latter method unsuccessful                              ¦when               I
tried it.
     Joukowsky kept Pleuro/richa                               lancealata for           a    period    of eight
months, in the course of which 458 divisions occurred, and durii:^r
that tirno he got neither conjugation — not even when he starved the
creatures       and set them in pure water — nor evidence of degeneration.
In    a certain degree                 there          is correspondence               here     with Maupas'
experiments               on    Stylonicliia              mytilus,        whore       senile    degeneration
(which,        however,              Joukowsky                did    not      find) did not seem to
stimulate this species                      to       conjugation           as it did in the case of
Stylonichiapurtulata.                       Joukowsky,              nevertheless,       observed       a   certain
shrinkage in size, which he found depended                                          on the quantity                 and
quality of food.                 The following is his temperature table :—
                                                     30' C.                  23' C.                15° C.

     The question of degeneration is probably                                         the most        important
that he raises.                As    we have already seen, Maupas distinctly                                    states
that at the end of the period of eugamy,                                        which covers          a definite
number of divisions of the creature,                                   senile degeneration                 sets       in,
which ends in death                   if    conjugation             does        not intervene      :   we have
also seen the method in which                                 this degeneration expresses                       itself.
(   in this subject he had already been                                challenged by Biitschli,                     who
maintained that the fission capacity of the Ciliata was specially                                               great
and       much in evidence                      after conjugation,               but    that thereafter               it
gradually ebbed away.                           If   by this Biitschli meant that immediately
after conjugation the                   rate         of fission       is    above      the     normal,     I        can
only say that         I        have never observed                  anything of this nature in                      the
several forms that have                         come       under my observation.                      But       if,   as

1900-1.]    Dr J. Y. Simpson           on   Binary Fission of Ciliata.                419
seems more evident            (Protozoa,     Bd. I. Heft      III.   p.   1592),     he is
simply entering        a  protest    against Maupas'        action in limiting the
process of degeneration to one special late period in the inf usorian's
life — thus in the        case of    Stylonichia pustulata it is not reached
nntil from the 170th to the 200th generation — he is surely                         to be
commended.           If there   is degeneration at all, it is most improbable,
on all other analogy,            that   it should set in         at  a    certain fairly
definite point — so late         as the last    third of the creature's life.           If
there    is degeneration,         it has commenced invisibly long before
those outward manifestations in the loss of frontal cirri and other
appendages;         it is ever      so   with    decay.     And      in    referring    to
Maupas' Stylonichia series,            with its increasing temperature from
the middle of the period onwards, and bearing in mind the effect
that temperature            has   on the rate      of   fission,    Biitschli    is only
asking     a  common-sense question             when he demands how, under
these conditions,        it could have been possible to recognise             a gradual
ebb in the fission-energy, such as we may suppose                         to constitute
the initial stages         of degeneration.        Joukowsky,        then, found       no
degeneration in his eight-months cultured Pleurotricha.                       He never
saw the disappearance of the frontal membranella?                       : he found     no
abnormal relations in the condition                of the nuclei, unless in two
cases, when a certain change              in the relative positions of the two
parts    of the macronucleus             was noted.        He examines          Maupas'
Stylonichia table, and finds that the creature multiplied much more
quickly in the later weeks,* and to this he in large part attributes
the    degeneration.         "It   is very possible        that    the cause       of the
degeneration which Maupas observed is not the mere number of
generations alone, but            the number       of generations in association
with the rapidity of multiplication."                 For my own part             I  have
looked for evidence of degeneration                throughout       3-4 month slide
culturest     of both the Paramecia and Stylonichia -pvstulata, as also
 in the  case   of other odd forms that          I happened      to find    in quantity
previous     to an epidemic of conjugation, but have not recognised it
 in such specific manner          as  nuclear degeneration or loss of external

appendages.                Still, none the         less   am     I    convinced         of a       gradual
ebbing         of     vital energy        as     the series       proceeds, which                 expresses
itself in slowed motion, in                     a tendency           to inactivity and general
listlessness         (if   the word be admissible in this connection),                              as also
in   a    certain diminution in size that                        was not         remedied          by any
amount of food.
     Joukowsky also              made      observations on           a   culture of Paramecium
caudatum.              In   a temperature of 19°-23° C. he got them                            to divide
one or two times.                By the seventh month he noticed that                                    they
divided badly.                Some of           the individuals seemed                  dead,       but    on
examination they were found to be still                               alive.       The cilia on            the
upper surface had almost completely                              disappeared       ;    indeed      it    was
only      at either end and             in the region round about the mouth                              that
he found ciliation at all.                 He    made out, however, no                  hint of nuclear
degeneration.
     Maupas laid great stress on the period of immaturity iu the
infusorian's           life — that      definite     number          of divisions           previous        to
puberty that had to be gone through before                               it   was in    a   fit    state to
conjugate.             We     saw,      e.g.,    that     this       period      was       reached         by
Stylonichia pustidala                  at the 130th division.                  Joukowsky,           experi
menting with Paramecium                         putrinum, found that this period                            of
puberty was attained after some seven or eight divisions, that                                        is   to
say,     it   is   practically       always present.        In this           particular    species        he
succeeded           in getting exconjugates to conjugate within that                                  small
number of divisions, and maintains in consequence that Maupas' rule
does not have universal                  validity.        Now     it     is   well known that              by
means of starvation not                 only can Ciliata         be prevented from multiply
ing by binary fission but after they have reached the period of puberty
                                 ,
they can be hurried                   into conjugation by                a    similar    method.*         I
therefore made               deliberate attempts, by means                       of starvation           and
other unfavourable means, in another series similar to that of which
details have already been given, to induce conjugation                                      within        the
period of puberty, but never succeeded.                               The forms exj erimented
with were the two Paramecia (aurelia and caudatum), S'yloniehia
     *
         With regard to
                     the former point, we may note that those Ciliata that
have         hindered in this way from reproducing themselves
          been                                                   by binuy
fission require some little time to recover the power to do so when food                                   is
again supplied to them.

this phase of Joukowsky'.s                work, and am entirely           in   agreement
 with Maupas' view.*
      The French biologist also maintained that conjugations                      between
 near relatives        were     sooner     or later sterile.      As   I   have already
 shown, this       is possibly        true in the case of conjugation             between
 members of the two tpecies of Paramecium.                        But in     the   case  of
 Paramecium putrinum, Joukowsky                      observed    effective   conjugation
 between the descendants of one individual                   ; at   the   same    time he
 admits that this probably               has its  limits.    I   also   am    inclined   to
 believe that this peculiar process has            its limits — but in    the Maupasian
 sense    ; for although       I  have observed       conjugation in the case of         P.
 raudaturn between the descendants                of an exconjugate, in the four or
  five instances in which           I  kept them they all died oil' within four to
 eight divisions.
     *
       Joukowsky     fails to observe that in Lcwophrys patula and Paramrrium
 putrinum Maupas         recognised possible exceptions to his puberty theory (Le
  Ilaj. karyitg. chcz   h:s Cilu's, p. 410), while he also admits that the period         of
  immaturity may be greatly shortened under certain unknown conditions. Of
  these conditions I have been able to rind out nothing.

On the Thermo-electric Properties of Solid Mercury.
    By Dr W. Peddie and the late Alex. B. Shand, Esq.
                         (Read February IS, 1901.)
                                 (Abstract.)
   This paper contained an account of a redetermination of the
thermo-electric position of solid mercury, by a method described
in a  note read last session.     The only difference    was that, by the
use  of three galvanometers, simultaneous readings of the deflection
due   to the   Hg-Fe circuit, and of the deflections due to thermo
electric circuits giving the temperatures of the two Hg-Fe junctions,
were taken.
   The results confirmed    those previously   obtained.
   It  may be said that the line of solid mercury on the thermo
electric diagram is practically    parallel to the iron line at ordinary
temperatures, and that,    if produced, it   meets the line of copper at
or near, its intersection with the ordinate of 0" C

    During       the    past   Session       48    papers,      many     of    them       in
volving much ingenious research, have been communicated to the
Society.       Of   these,    15    belong      to the    department        of   Physics,
9 to Mathematics,         3 to Chemistry,          2 to Astronomy,         3 to Ocean
ography, 5 to Biology,           1  to Human Anatomy,              2   to Comparative
 Anatomy,        3 to Physiology,        4     to Meteorology,       and    1   to Social
Statistics.
    Since the commencement of the Session 23 Fellows have been
added      to    our    numbers.      Of     these,    2    are   Professors,       6    are
Lecturers       on Science,      3   are    Doctors      of   Science,    3    have      the
degree of M.D., and          2 that of    LL.D.
    I  regret to say that during the same period the Society                     has lost
by death      11    members,      among whom are two of its Hon. Vice-
Presidents,      having    formerly      filled    the office    of    President, — the
Duke of Argyll and Sir Douglas Maclagan.
   The Duke          op  Argyll,     besides     being President of this Society
from 1860 to 1864, held at various times the offices                     of Chancellor
of the University of St Andrews,                Lord Rector of the University of
Glasgow, and President of the British Association for the Advance
ment of Science in 1861.              Theological       controversy,      metaphysical
speculation, economical inquiries,              historical    research, and geology
were     subjects     all ably     treated      of  in his various        publications,
whilst as     a   statesman      he initiated and           supported     much useful
legislation.
   Sir Douglas          Maclagan       was President          of  this   Society      from
1890 to 1894.          He held in     a distinguished        manner for thirty-four
years    the Chair of Forensic         Medicine,      and was trusted adviser of
the   Crown in trials where forensic advice was required.                     His genial
presence among us, now lost, is a happy                  memory to many of our
Fellows.

    Professor Sir T. Grainger Stewart held for twenty-three years
the   position    of Professor      of the Practice      of Medicine, and          he
worthily    maintained the high traditions of the Chair of Cullen,
Oregory, and Alison.
    Professor     Piazzi Smyth          published     works    on    the      Great
Pyramid which have attracted much notice both in this country
and     the     United     States,    and    his   spectroscopic   studies      and
researches    are of great      cosmical iuterest.
    Adam    Gillies Smith discharged with great           acceptance   the duties
of Treasurer of the Society.
    Robert Halupay Gunning, LL.D., Grand                     Dignitary     of    the
 Order of the Rose of lirazil,         the munificent    founder of the Prize
which boars his name, will be long affectionately remembered                      for
his genial and unassuming disposition, and for his many                  deeds     of
 enlightened beneficence.
    Dr John Anderson,           a native of this city, and a distinguished
 graduate   of our University,      was from 18G5 to 1886 Superintendent
 of the Indian     Museum at Calcutta.          He was the author of       several
 valuable    works on the Vertebrata of India, Siam,                Arabia,     and
 Egypt.

    The Society having           been   invited   to  send   two   Delegates       to
 represent   it   at the celebration of the         Bicentenary   of the      Royal
 Prussian Academy, Dr Burgess and               Dr Traquair     were    appointed
 the   Society's     representatives.      At   a  meeting    of the     Academy
 convened      to receive    the   congratulations     of the Delegates        from
 Societies,   the following       Address    was   presented and read        in the
 name    of the Society      : —

 congratulations to the         Royal Academy of Sciences of              Prussia
 on the attainment of its two hundredth anniversary.
     Wo rejoice     to recognise     that the Royal      Academy     of   Sciences
 of Prussia stands in the very front rank of the Learned                  Societies

 existence, counted      among its memher.s an extraordinary numher of
 the most renowned and        fruitful investigators.         It  has successfully
 carried on vast and erudite       labours      which have made all scholars
its debtors, and stimulated numerous              researches     of great national
 and general utility.
    This Society sincerely     sympathises       with the Royal Academy of
 Prussia in the losses which it has sustained           in recent years through
the deaths       of von Helmholtz,          of von     Hopmann, of Du Bois-
 Keymond,      of   Ernst Curtius, of Waitz, and of Wattenbaoh,
and other eminent and honoured members of the Academy                        ; while
it recalls with satisfaction that it           has counted,      and   still counts,
among its own         Honorary      Fellows,     members       of the    illustrious
Academy.
    The Royal Society of Edinburgh              hopes that the Academy may
have continually increasing prosperity, and that all its labours may
contribute to the glory of the Herman Empire and the enlighten
ment and progress of humanity.

all his books of original drawings and journals, and all his boxes
of glass photographs, and likewise his portrait by          Mr Faed, R.S. A.
     It was announced in the Times of 31st May of this year that
the Government had appointed a Committee, inter alia, for suggest
ing changes      in the staff and arrangements      necessary     for bringing
the Geological Survey in its more general features to a speedy and
satisfactory termination,      and in connection with this, the following
representation was submitted to the Committee              on the part of the
 Society   : —
     "The Council,       in the interest   alike   of science      and   of the
 industrial or economic development of the country, wishes to
 express its conviction that no termination of the Survey will be
 considered     satisfactory   in Scotland    unless   the     survey    of  the
 country is completed on the 6 inch scale, and its hope that, what
 ever arrangements the Committee          may recommend, this specially
 important point will be kept in view.
      " Should it  be desired by the Committee, the       Council is prepared
 to send representatives to give evidence regarding the future work
  of the Geological Survey in Scotland."
      The President and Council of the Royal Society of London have
  made    a   Grant towards meeting the        expense     of   publishing   the
  Observations made at the Ben Nevis Observatory              of a sum corre
  sponding to the half of the         whole expenditure        expected to be
  incurred.    The    half will amount to £500.          The Royal Society
  of Edinburgh      will pay the other half.
      Dr Copelaxd, Astronomer-Royal for Scotland, and his Assistant,
   Mr Heath, proceeded to Santa Pola in Spain, with suitable
   apparatus, to observe the eclipse of the sun.
      The Society continues      to take   a  great interest      in Antarctic
   Exploration.     A British Expedition will     sail next year for the ex
   ploration of that part of the Antarctic Continent which lies south of
   the Pacific Ocean, and a German Expedition will explore that part
   of the Continent       which  lies south of the      Indian Ocean.        But
   expeditions limited to the investigation of these regions          will leave
   a considerable part    of the great South Polar Continent unexplored.

It  has, therefore, been proposed that a Scottish             Expedition should
be organised to supplement          the work    of the British and German
Expeditions.       It would undertake the exploration of that part of
the Antarctic Continent         which lies south of South America.             It is
calculated that £35,000 would be required to provide                  a  suitable
vessel,   with   the necessary      equipments of men, instruments,             pro
visions,   etc.,  for the purpose.       Of this sum £10,000 have             been
promised.
    The proposed staff includes six scientific men, five ship's           officers,
and a crew of        twenty-six.      The scientists will       take  systematic
observations both on land            and sea    in meteorology,      magnetism,
terrestrial    physics,    biology,    geology,     hydrography,     and     other
branches of inquiry.        The Expedition would be under the command
of  Mr William       S.  Bruce, who      has  had great experience in Polar
expeditions, having been five summers and one winter in the Polar
regions, where he         distinguished    himself    as    an Arctic zoologist,
having brought back larger zoological collections               than any of his
predecessors.

  To   the King's      Most      Excellent Majesty, the Loval asd
     Dutiful     Address      of the Rotal Society of Edinburgh.
     May it please Your Majesty         :
     We, the Royal Society of Edinburgh,                 humbly approach          Your
 Majesty, on your accession          to the Throne, with the expression of
 our sincere    and earnest      sympathy towards yourself, your Royal
 Consort, and the members           of the   lioyal Family,         on your bereave
 ment,   and our sense of the great              loss   which      has  befallen    the
 nation through the death           of our revered       and     beloved   Sovereign,
 Queen Victoria.
    We feel assured        that the memory of your Royal Mother,                    the
 late Queen, whose       life was devoted to the welfare of her              subjects,
 will ever be held in affectionate             remembrance          by all who      are
 privileged to owe allegiance to the Crown, and that Her Majesty's
 name   will be  illustrious in history, not only for the greatness                and
power of the Empire which was consolidated                   in her    reign, but for
the wisdom and justice with which               the Empire was administered
under her guidance and example.
    We desire respectfully to express our good wishes and our                    hope
that Your Majesty may             enjoy a long and prosperous               reign,   as
Sovereign of the many territories and races over which you                       have
been called by       Divine providence           to   preside.      Your    Majesty's
most gracious      assurance    that your life would be devoted                to the
service of the State, springs         from the same sense of public              duty
which inspired our lamented             Queen, and       gives    the promise of      a
brilliant   and    prosperous      future    for    the    Empire       under    your
Majesty's sovereignty, which we trust may be of long duration.
    Following the example         and   inclination     of your revered Father,
the Prince Consort,       Your Majesty       has shown a warm interest               in
the advancement        of science, literature, and art         ;  and we feel     sure
that it will be in accordance            with Your Majesty's feelings              and
wishes    that your reign      may be distinguished           by the     progress    of
the nation in all fields of intellectual activity.

to   Dr T. D. Anderson" for his discoveries of New and Variable
Stars.
    The Chairman,       on presenting the I'rize, said:       —
    The Council of the lioyal Society of Edinburgh                 have decided to
award the Gunning           Prize to Dr T. D.         Anderson for his distin
guished services to astronomical science.              Dr Anderson's      name has
come prominently before the astronomical world by his discovery of
a  large number of variable stars, visible in our latitudes, as well as of
two temporary       stars, one in the constellation of Auriga and the other
in that of      Perseus.      In    the  present highly       developed state of
stellar spectroscopy,      the discovery of these two remarkable stars              in
such close succession was bound to lead to                 a considerable enrich
ment of our knowledge with regard to the physical constitution of
these celestial      bodies,   and still promises         to   shed   new light on
important and perplexing problems in the domain of stellar evolu
 tion.    In  the case of Nova Persei, the present            new star, the value
of  Dr Anderson's timely discovery             is enhanced by the fact that it
 afforded    astronomers      the    unique opportunity         for   watching    the
 course of development in the in itial stages of this phenomenon, and
 in this respect      the  importance       of the discovery        has been    fully
 appreciated by astro-physicists.
    Brilliant, however,       as these     startling   discoveries undoubtedly
 were,   they   are only,    so to speak,      incidental    results of  a  lifelong
labour devoted to        a systematic search for variable stars; and this,
indeed, is what constitutes Dr Anderson's principal contribution to
astronomical science.         The indomitable        zeal and     perseverance     by
 which ho has been enabled to add              as  many as thirty-live variables
to the catalogue of this important class of celestial objects are all the
more creditable to him,          as   the small optical power of the instru
ments at his disposal, and the distinctly unfavourable site of his
 private observatory, were bound to render his observations very
difficult   and laborious.      Not     being in possession      of star-maps,    the
essential requirements for        a   work of this kind,     Dr Anderson bad       to
prepare    his own charts from the star-catalogues            of the Bonn Durch-
 musterung.       The extremely fatiguing labour involved in the con
struction of these charts,           which include more than 70,000 stars
 down to the      9 5th magnitude, is        a signal proof of his enthusiastic

450             Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
devotion to this particular branch of astronomical observation.                            It
is the desire of the Society to recognise              by this award the value          and
importance of Dr Anderson's work in                      a   field of astronomical        re
search where results can be obtained only by the most                          determined
perseverance       and by an unabating enthusiasm and love for science.
     In conclusion,       I   have     to   express    the extreme regret of             the
Astronomer-Royal            for Scotland        that    illness    prevents      him   from
being present on this memorable occasion.
     The    Keith    Prize     for    1897-99       was     presented to Dr          James
                                                                                         5

with extended Tables of Values,"                    printed in vol. xxxix. of            the
 Transactions of the Society.
     The Chairman, on presenting the Prize, said                   : —
     The Keith Prize for the Sessions               1897-8, 1898-9, is awarded              to
 James      Burgess,     Esq.,     C.I.E.,    LL.D., for his paper               on   "The
  Definite     Integral   —      1 c   '/It, with Extended           Tables of Values,'
                           «/W    o
 published in the Society's Transactions.                   This integral     is of import
 ance in various fields of physical science, such as theory of atmospheric
 refraction, conduction of heat, probabilities, errors of observation,
 etc.    It   is also of fundamental             importance in the evaluation               of
 many other         forms      of    definite    integrals.       A   closely    connected
 integral was tabulated in 1789 by Kramp, and                          various tables       of
 both integrals         have     been      computed      or     compiled     by different
 authors since that date.               Dr   Burgess's     tables are, however, calcu
 lated to    a  greater number of significant figures than in any of                   these
 earlier tables, being for certain values                 of the limit computed             to
  fifteen decimal places.           The logarithms are in these cases given                  to
 sixteen places,      and     the table is prepared for all practical purposes
  by being provided          with     tables of differences as         far  as the fourth
  order.     The arithmetical           labour    involved in constructing           such a
  table must have been enormous,               and could have been accomplished
  only by    a   calculator of rare accuracy and power.                    In  addition      to
  the tabulated values,          which fill thirty-nine          pages of the Society's
  Transactions,      the    memoir itself contains             a  brief   history    of    the
 subject, and a luminous account of the methods adopted in making

and in checking the calculations.                The section    on   Interpolation      is,
in particular,      a   valuable addition         to mathematical literature, and
shows      that the author       is   as   well fitted     to extend     mathematical
theory as to compute mathematical                  constants to thirty significant
figures.      In   awarding      Dr Burgess the Keith Prize, the Council
have considered         the pure mathematical             interest of    the processes
involved, as well as the great practical value of this admirable and
finished piece of work.
  The Makdougall-Brisbane Prize for 1898-1900 was presented to
Dr Ramsay H. Traquair for his paper entitled " Report on Fossil
Fishes      collected by the Geological            Survey in the Upper Silurian
Rocks of Scotland,"         printed in vol. xxxix. of the Transactions                  of
the Society.
    The Chairman, on presenting              the Prize, said    —
                                                                :
    Dr     Traquair's   report    on the Fossil Fishes discovered               by the
Geological         Survey   in the Upper Silurian Rocks                   of   Scotland
furnishes striking proof of his thorough knowledge of Palaeozoic
Ichthyology. His researches have proved of exceptional value from
a   biological point of view.          By   means of these fossils,       all of which
are new to science,         he has advanced           a   new classification     of    the
Ostracodermi, which now comprises three orders.                       He has enlarged
our knowledge of the order Hetermtraci,                   which now includes four
families instead of one.          He has shown that the Cwlolcpidce, though
probably of Elasmobranch              origin, were not Cestraciont sharks, and
has indicated the transition from the Oatlolepidm                   to the Pteraspid<e.
These are only some of the important features of his researches, the
results of which have been of the highest value on account of the
light which they throw on the evolution of                  these Palaeozoic    fishes.

    His Excellency R. H. Gunning, Esq., M.D., LL.D.,                                                 etc.

    I   need    hardly remind the Society that,                           at the first         meeting of
the Session, the Chairman is expected to refer to the Fellows who
have died in the course of the year.                             In   a   few words mention was
made of the death of                  His Excellency Robert Halliday Gunning,
Esq., M.D.,          LL.D.,           F.S.A. Scot.,             and       the Vice-President who
occupied the Chair intimated that                          I   would prepare             a    fuller notice
of His Excellency                   later on.          When looking             at       Dr Gunning's
relation       to this Society it is worth noting that the Fellows consist
                             —
of five    classes  (1) those who join it with the intention of contri
                         :
buting to its literature ; (2) those who listen with pleasure to the
things new and old which the Proceedings                                  (3) those who
                                                                            reveal   ;
find in the title F.R.S.E.                         an honour and, in many cases, a true
help in their life's work                  ;       (4) those who set a high value on the
work done by the Society, who in the past have                                               been,   and no
doubt in the future will be, helpful by money endowments                                                 ;   and
(5) Honorary Fellows
                       — men of this and other lands who are
celebrated by original contributions to one branch or to more than
one branch of science.                  Numbers            2   and 4 are specially represented,
both in the motive and the method of true science, by the personal
friend of whom                I   now write.
    When Napoleon heard any                          one       praised highly he was wont to
ask,
     " What has                  he done
                                               "
                                          Is this relevant in the present case 1
                                           ?
I   think it       is,       though the proofs of Dr Gunning's     doing  often
                                                                                         '           '
come, not       in scientific          sequence,        but are frequently                   suggestive of
missing links.                Anticipation           becomes       mixed      with retrospect and
the association               is   mutually         interesting.           Both testify to           a       busy
life.     In   a   letter to me, so recently as August                           1899,          we have        a
good illustration of his frequently                        linking the chief events of his

changeful life with matters which might have stood alone, whose
connection, however, gave them a place of importance which they
could not otherwise              have had.           The mention of             a comparatively
small matter leads him to think                          of his childhood,          and then to
hasten to dwell on the upward                       steps     of his experience.             I    notice
this in answer to the query, " What                                     done ?
                                                                               "    It

the opportunity            early in this sketch of bringing                     to the front his
standing as       a   worker.
                                        "   I   am anxious," he says,
                                                                      " to determine
some     points about my               family       history.        My mother belonged to
the Dicksons              of Gateside and Bankhead,                     and having       lost both
her parents in Dumfries                     when about nine years of age, she was
taken to Gateside and brought up by her uncle, the laird.                                         I   was
born in Ruth well,               1818,      but left, when only two or three years
old, for Kirkbean, and afterwards Newabbey and Dumfries, whence
I    left for Edinburgh in 1834.                         My last visit to Dumfries and
Newabbey was in 1839 and in 1839-40, and 1840-41                                         I    went to
Aberdeen as Assistant                  and Demonstrator             of Anatomy to Dr               Allen
Thomson at Marischal College.                        I   returned with him to Edinburgh
in 1841-42, and when he was appointed to the Chair of Physiology
I   took charge of the Anatomical                    Rooms under Monro tertiue, and
afterwards lectured on anatomy in Surgeon's Square, and prepared
a    numerous class of students and graduates from all parts of the
Empire for taking                 the       Degree       of    M.D. in Scotland               and      the
membership of Surgeon in London.                               In   1847   I   was married, and
in    1849   I   was obliged to seek a warmer climate on account of my
health.      The great improvement                       of my health in Brazil, and the
prospect of easy and lucrative                        medical       practice, induced             me    to
remain there for thirty -three years; and from                                  the time of my
 return to England in 1882 on to 1896                               I   had never been to my
 native place         ;   that   is,
                                  I      had been away from                it   between seventy
 and eighty years.               In    1896     I   took Lady Hughes               [Mrs Gunning]
 to Dumfries, to show her my native haunts, and we drove by way
 of Glencaple and Bankhead to Ruthwell and returned to Dumfries.
 Blindness deprived me of seeing                         these various places.               It   was in
 connection with this visit that                         thought         should do some little
                                                 I I

 thing    for my native                place, as          had done for the neighbouring
 parish, Ecclefechan, in honour                     of Carlyle.          My chief benefactions
 have been for Edinburgh, where                      I      spent many happy days, but                 I

felt   I should   also remember my birthplace             and Newabbey, where           I
was at school for      some years before going to            Edinburgh."
    I  am indebted to        Dr Gunning's          agents,   Mossrs Auld & Mac-
donald, W.S., for the following record of his chief benefactions:                     —
The University of Edinburgh for Medical Prizes, £5000; the
University of Edinburgh for Divinity Prizes, £5000 ; Protestant
Institute of Scotland, £1000            ;   Waldensian       Missions    Aid Society,
 £2500;       Keformed       Church       of   Bohemia,       £2500;      Evangelical
 Church of Italy, £2500; Koyal Society of Edinburgh, £1000;
 Society     of   Antiquaries     of    Scotland,        £1000    ;  Association     for
 University Education of Women, £1000                  ; New College, Edinburgh,
 for Science Prizes, £1000        ; Royal College of Surgeons, Edinburgh,
 £1000;      lioyal College of Physicians,            Edinburgh, £1000; Royal
 Society, London, £1000 ; Victoria                    Institute, London, £500            ;
 Dumfries Infirmary, £1250            ;   and Robertson's         Orphanage,     South
 Queensferry,      £1000   ;  more than £28,000.
     In  forwarding    this list  Mr Macdonald           adds  : —"   I enclose   a  list
 of Dr Gunning's benefactions which               are passing through my hands.
 Of   course his benefactions to the West Port Church, from first to
 last,   must    have come      to a very        large sum.         He continued his
 subscriptions     to it all the time he was in Brazil."
     Now    I am   far from gauging the worth             of  a  man by his wealth,
 or his    greatness   by his     giving.      But it     seemed     to me the only
 way to shed light on the individualism of                one whose environments
 were often so many, and their influence on his every-day life so
  well marked.       The list of his benefactions make it clear that            he had
 determined to devote his riches only to schemes which were great
 and good.       These considerations         lead us to seek for links between
 his personal motives and every-day practices. The Institutions to
  the help of which his gifts were so generous were associated with
 philanthropy or with physical and natural science.
     In looking over the material for this biographical                   notice.  I am
  struck with Dr Gunning's frequent references to two men who, in
  their several departments of thought, were in their day men of
  mark, men appreciated by him while they lived and not forgotten
  after their death.      One could not be long in his company without
  hearing him refer to one or the other — Thomas Chalmers, D.D.,
  and Robert Christison,       M.D.        In   this connection we find       a key to

492            Proceedings                of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
many things in Gunning's life                        :   Chalmers the leader of theological
thought and action                   ;   Christison       the distinguished         physician,         well
known       as a man           of high attainments, not only in medicine but in
sciences     outside of his personal profession.                          The influence of this
acquaintanceship                was       the    strengthening           of    those     desires and
ambitions which                characterised and gave                 direction to Gunning's
earnest     efforts       as    indicated        in       the   list of his benefactions.               In
making       this statement                 I   wish       simply   to    show that            Gunning
admired both because he found in each elements with which                                               he
was in deep sympathy, and which would be helpful                                        to himself      in
carrying out aspects of work which be loved and early began to
take    a   lively    interest in.              In Mr Macdonald's               communication               a

striking contrast is suggested without any break : — Dr Gunning's
                    " in Home Missions was aroused
interest," he says,                                 by Dr Chalmers,
and he was one of the first elders ordained in the                                 West Port, and
I)r Gunning          was created a Grand Dignitary of the Empire of                              Brazil
by the Emperor             Dom Pedro             II.,     and this carried       with it the right
                                 '
to be addressed            as        His Excellency.'            The Emperor, a short time
before his own expulsion from Brazil, wrote a holograph                                        letter to
the Queen asking that                    Dr Gunning should           be   authorised to use the
rank in this country.               The Queen granted this request, and                                Dr
Gunning had           a   letter from Lord Salisbury intimating the fact."
   The mission work was                    a great       success, and     His Excellency lived
to take a     leading part in laying the memorial stone of the present
West Port Church, which has                          a   congregation almost         as large as the
largest in Edinburgh.
   Reference has been made to Sir Robert Christison                                       as a   friend
of His Excellency, and helpful                           to him in trying          to influence the
Church      in other than purely religious work.                              Chalmers had seen
good    opportunities                for ministers          benefiting        society    if,   to their
theological acquirements                   and teaching,         they brought to their work
the knowledge of one or more                             branches   of physical or of natural
science.      In     1843 he had given great                    prominence to his views                on
this matter: — "We hold,"                       he   wrote,     "a natural         science     class    in
connection with theology to be most desirable                             as   a   component part
of our system of theological education."                            In this quotation                keep
clear   of seeming             to discuss       the question        on the         merits.

wish to indicate the lines of public thought which led                                  Dr Gunning

to   devote large sums of money in its behalf.                 Chalmers,    whose
views impressed Gunning very much, was well acquainted with
the apologetic value of such questions, and was in the habit of
complaining      that no provision was made in the theological course
for it.   There might be willing students, and Gunning resolved to
do something for them.          His strong efforts in this direction        comes
out in his correspondence with Sir Eobert Christison.                  Sir Eobert
entered cordially into his proposals and brought                them under the
notice of leading University friends.               The second object in the
benefaction      list,  £5000, must         be   associated with      Sir Robert
Christison's friendly desires to help him to realise his long-cherished
designs.     I  am greatly indebted        to David Christison,       Esq., M.D.,
for documents bearing on this and other matters.                   He says : — " I
send    you    all the correspondence with Dr Gunning which my
father had preserved.         It relates,  1st, to the procuring     of specimens
of the ipecacuanha plant with the object of cultivating it in India,
 at a time when its enormous importance as a specific in dysentery,
 taken in large doses, was being realised.            The 2nd    series relates to
 the negotiations      about the Gunning Fellowship."              There are also
 documents bearing on Sir Robert's              first acquaintance      with him.
 Among the letters is         one  in which      he informs    Sir Robert     that
 " Professor Agassiz                               of days with him, seeking
                           passed    a   couple
 specimens of fresh-water fishes          in the river not far from his resi
 dence.    He was going south with Count Portales on the Gulph
 Stream Exploration."          Gunning's      mind was at the time charged
  with strong dislike of what he believed to            be the tendency     of the
 science of the day      :
                           " Telling Agassiz my disgust with the modern
 caricature of the doctrine of the production              (spontaneous genera
 tion) and reproduction (evolution and development) of living beings,
 he thought well of my idea to help research for the solution of these
 questions."     Another letter to Sir Robert is from Principal Tulloch,
  St Andrews, approving of his suggestions in favour of Dr Gunning's
                                 "
  plans, and concluding : — I do not think, therefore, you could give
 your friend better advice than what you indicated to me."
     In  the   Life of Sir Hubert            Christison   (vol. ii.   p. 257) an
 extract   from his private Journal (June 27, 1870) is given relating
  to ipecacuanha as referred to above.

 been ascertained        in China and India that it is         a  sovereign remedy
 for dysentery."        It   was a native of S. America, and         Sir Robert         had
 pressed    for   several    years on his students the importance of intro
 ducing it into India.          "Some months ago,"           he says,     "I wrote        to
 Dr Gunning,       an Edinburgh         graduate,    who entered      very cordially
 into the scheme.          The first consignment of plants has just arrived
 at the    Botanic Garden, consisting of roots well preserved in sod.
 ....       I  have seen to-day in the           garden    stove-house       a   hundred
 thriving     young     plants."       Soon     arrangements       were       made      for
 introducing it into India, and he records that "there is                     a   promise
 of four hundred more from the cuttings of Dr Gunning's consign
ment."       1 believe      that ipecacuanha is still reared in India, and is
regarded      as a specific in dysentery.            Be this as it may, it says
much for      Dr Gunning's       zeal in his profession.         Indeed the desire
to work in its behalf led to that habit of the eye which characterised
him until blindness overtook him,               as it had done his father.            One
could not spend           an hour     with him without his varied scientific
attainments coming to             the   front.     The    scientific    references       to
Brazil were many and valuable, but lie had also been                            a  skilled
observer in the home            field.    The lluviatilo     and glacial markings
of his native district, and its zoology            and antiquities, had occupied
                                                                              '

the history of the         Kuthwell Stone, with its form and                 runes, and
the value      of its verses, were favourite themes.
    There are many other facts which might                be stated    illustrative of

triennially by the Council of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, in
recognition      of  original    work in Physics, Chemistry,            or pure or
applied     Mathematics.        Evidence     of such work may be afforded
either by a paper on one of the above subjects, or some discovery
in them, elsewhere communicated                 or made,     which the Council
may consider to be deserving of the prize.                 The prize consists of
a  sum of money,          and is open to men of science            resident in or
connected with Scotland.            The first award was       made    in the year
 1887.     In accordance with the wish of the donor, the Council of
the Society may on fit occasions award the prize for work of a
definite kind to be undertaken            during the three succeeding years
by  a  scientific man of recognised ability.
    At the    close  of the first triennial period, 1884-87, the prize
was awarded to Sir William Thomson, Pres. R.S.E., F.R.S. (Lord
Kelvin), for a remarkable series of papers on " Hydrokinetics,"
especially on waves and vortices, which have been communicated to
the Society.       At the    close  of the second triennial period, 1887-90,
it was awarded to Professor P. G. Tait,               Sec.  R.S.E., for his work
in connection with the " Challenger " Expedition and his other
researches in Physical Science.             At the   close of the  third triennial
period,    1890-93,     it   was   awarded to Alexander Buchan,            LL.D.,
for his varied, extensive, and extremely important contributions                 to
 Meteorology,       many     of which      have   appeared     in the     Society's
 publications.      The    last triennial award,        1893-96,    was   made   to
John Aitken, Esq., for his brilliant investigations                    in Physics,
especially in connection          with the Formation and Condensation of
 Aqueous Vapour.
   The Gunning Fellowship in connection                    with the Society of

                             (Read Decomber       2, 1901.)
    When      Professor     Tait last       February      resigned      the chair of
 Natural Philosophy         in   the     University of Edinburgh,           we hoped
 that the immediate relief from strain and anxiety regarding                        his
 duty might conduce         to a speedy recovery from the               severe  illness
 under which he was then suffering.                I was indeed myself sanguine
 in looking forward       to an unbroken           continuation      of the friendly
 intercourse with him which           I  had enjoyed through forty-one years
 of my life.      A  slight abatement of the graver symptoms, and                      a
 cheering return to       some      mathematical work left            off six months
 before, gave hope that       a change      from George Square to Challenger
 Lodge in June, on the invitation               of his friend and former pupil
 Sir John Murray, might          be the beginning           of a recovery.       But   it
 was not to be.      Death came suddenly on the 4th of                  July, and   our
 friend   is gone   from us.
     Peter Guthrie     Tait   was born at        Dalkeith      on  28th   April   1831.
 After early education         at    Dalkeith Grammar School, and Circus
 Place School, Edinburgh,            he    entered the       celebrated Edinburgh
 Academy, of which he remained              a  pupil till 1847, when he entered
 the  University of Edinburgh.             After  a session    there under Kelland
 and Forbes, he entered        Cambridge in 1848 as an undergraduate of
 Peterhouse, and in 1852 he took his degree                 as Senior Wrangler and
 First Smith's Prizeman, and              was elected     to a    Fellowship of      his
 College.     He remained officially in Peterhouse                 as   mathematical
 lecturer till 1854, when he was called to Queen's College, Belfast,
 as Professor of Mathematics.              This was a most happy appointment
 for   Tait.   It  made     him     a   colleague of, and         co-worker    on the
 electrolytic   condensation of mixed oxygen and hydrogen and on
 ozone   with   Andrews,       the    discoverer of a procedure producing
continuous change        in   a   homogeneous         substance,     from   liquid    to
gaseous and from gaseous           to   liquid condition.         Through Andrews
it introduced     him to William Rowan               Hamilton,     the discoverer of

the captivatingly            ingenious          and beautiful        method of quaternions
in Mathematics.              It   gave      him six years of good duty in Queen's
College, well done, in teaching Mathematics                               ;   and for some time
also Natural Philosophy, in aid of his colleague Stevelly.                                             During
those      bright years in Belfast                   he    found his wife, and laid the
foundation        of a happiness which                    lasted as long            as    his life.
     In    1860    he     was       elected to succeed               Forbes          as      Professor       of
Natural Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh. It was then
that 1 became acquainted with him, and we quickly resolved to
join in writing          a   book on Natural Philosophy,                           beginning with a
purely geometrical preliminary                       chapter on Kinematics,                       and going
on thence instantly to dynamics, the science of Force, as foundation
of all that       was        to follow.          I   found        him full         of reverence for
Andrews and Hamilton, and enthusiasm for                                 science.            Nothing       else
worth living for,             he     said   ;    with heart-felt              sincerity           I    believe,
though his life belied the saying, as no one ever was more thorough
in public duty or more devoted to family and friends.    His two

in the slightest degree               the cheerful humour of his student days;
and this was       a    large factor in the success                 of our alliance for heavy
work, in which we persevered for eighteen years.
                                                                                    "    A   merry heart
goes      all the day, Your           sad, tires      in   a mile-a."          The making of the

first part of T and T' was treated                          as a perpetual joke, in respect
to the irksome details of interchange                           of drafts for " copy," amend
ments in type, and final corrections of proofs.                               It   was lightened by
interchange       of visits between Greenhill                       Gardens,            or Drummond
Place, or George Square, and Largs, or Arran, or the old or new
College of Glasgow ; but of necessity it was largely carried on by
post.      Even the postman laughed when                            he    delivered            one      of our
missives, about          the       size    of    a   postage       stamp, out             of      a     pocket
handkerchief       in which          he had tied          it,   to make sure of not dropping
it   on the way.
     One    of Tait's humours                was writing           in charcoal               on       the bare
plaster     wall of his study in Greenhill Gardens                                 a     great tabl© of

right.     Clerk Maxwell, then             a rising star of the first magnitude                  in
our eyes, was too young to appear on the list.
   About     1878     we got to the            end of our           "Division         II."       on
" Abstract Dynamics "              and, according to our initial programme,
                              ;
should     then have gone           on to     " properties         of    matter,"
                                                                                       " heat,"
"light," "electricity," "magnetism."                  Instead           of this we agreed
that for the future we could each work more conveniently                               and on
more varied        subjects, without the constraint                     of joint      effort     to
produce as much as we could of an all-comprehensive                             text-book        of
Natural Philosophy.           Thus our book         came to an end              with only           a
foundation laid for our originally intended structure.
   Tait's first published work was undertaken in conjunction with                                   a
Peterhouse friend,        Steele, who was his second in the University
both as Wrangler and Smith's                 Prizeman.       They commenced their
work together immediately after taking their                       degrees ; but Steele
died before more than two or three chapters had been written, and
Tait finished it alone, and published it four years later under the
                                                                        "

gone through many editions, and               still holds its place          as a text-book.
   Tait's second published book, " Elements of Quaternions,"                                    was
commenced under the auspices of Hamilton                       ;   but, in deference to
his wish, not published             till    1867.   It   has gone through                   three
editions, and       is,

to learn    the subject.
   Tait    also    produced several valuable             Treatises, short, readable,
interesting, and useful, on various subjects in physical science                            :   —

last   published    work,    primarily intended       as   a    help to medical
students attending      his special three months' course of lectures for
them on Natural Philosophy.
    In the Royal Society of Edinburgh we all know something of
how     Tait has enriched its Proceedings and Transactions                   by his
interesting    and   varied     papers    on   mathematical         and physical
subjects from year to year since 1860, when he came to Edinburgh
to   succeed   Forbes     as  Professor    of  Natural      Philosophy in the
 University.    Nearly all of    these are now collected, along        with   a con
siderable number of other scientific         papers which he brought              out
through other channels, arranged in order of time, from                    1859 to
 1898;    one hundred      and thirty-three    articles in      all;  republished
by the Cambridge University Press in two splendid quarto volumes
of 500 pages each ; a worthy memorial of a life of laborious whole
hearted devotion to science.
   The " Scientific Papers " collected in these two volumes abound in
matter of permanent scientific interest         ;  and literary      interest too,
as    witness   the   short    articles   on " Hamilton,"            " Macquorne
Eankine,"     "Balfour Stewart,"         "Clerk Maxwell," and "The
Teaching of Natural Philosophy."            Of all the mathematical papers
in the collection,  one of those    which   seem to me most fundamentally
important is Part IV. of " Foundations            of the Kinetic        Theory     of
Gases," in which we find the first proof (and,             I    believe, the only
proof hitherto given) of the theorem enunciated first by Waterston
and twelve years later independently           by Clerk Maxwell, asserting
equal average partition of energy between two sets of masses larger
and smaller, taken     as  hard globes to represent the molecules of two
different gases thoroughly       mixed together.      The collection contains
also papers describing       valuable   experimental      researches      made by
Tait through many years on various subjects : Thermo-electricity                     ;
Thermal Conductivity of Metals ; Impact and Duration of Impact                       ;
Pressure Errors of the Challenger          thermometers       ;  Compressibility
of   Water, Glass,      and    Mercury (contributed          originally to        the
" Physics and Chemistry " of H.M.S. Challenger).                   His work for
the Challenger      Report was       a  splendid    series    of very       difficult
experimental researches       carried on for about nine years (1879 to
1888), with admirable scientific inventiveness, and no less admirable

zeal and perseverance.                       One little scientific bye-product of extreme
interest       I   cannot refrain                from quoting.            Referring     to a hermeti

             I enclosed the glass tube in a tube of stout                                           brass,

of Edinburgh               of   July       5,   1875,       imperfectly reported in Nature of
July    15 of that year, the true dynamical explanation of one of the
most interesting and suggestive                             of all the scientific wonders of the
nineteenth century, Crookes' radiometer, was clearly given.                                          The
phenomenon to bo explained                                is   that in highly rarefied air      a    disc
of pith or cork or other substance                                  of small thermal conductivity,
blackened on one side, and illuminated by light on all sides, even
the    cool        light    of     a    wholly clouded sky, experiences                     a   steady
measurable             pressure        on the         blackened side.          Many naturalists,       I

believe, had truly attributed                this fact to the blackened side being
rendered somewhat                 warmer by the light              ;   but none before Tait
and Dewar had ever imagined the dynamical cause, — the largeness
of the free path of the molecule of the highly rarefied air, and the
greater average             velocity    of   rebound      of the molecules from the
warmer side.              Long free path was the open                  sesame to the mystery.
    The Keith Medal of the Royal Society                                 of     Edinburgh was
awarded to Professor                 Tait in the year         1S69, and again           in 1874;
and one of the Royal Medals of the Royal Society of London was
awarded to him in the year 1886.  The Gunning Victoria Jubilee
Prize of the Royal Society of Edinburgh was awarded to him in
1890.
    Enthusiast       as he was         in experimental            and mathematical           work,
he never allowed this to interfere with his University teaching, to
which, from beginning to end of the forty years of his Professorship,
he devoted himself with ever fresh vigour, and with unremitting
faithfulness,       as     his primary       public    duty.           How happily and         use
fully and inspiringly             he performed          it,   has been remembered with
gratitude     by all who have ever had the privilege of being students
in his    class.
    With not        less devotion and faithfulness                     during     all these years
he has worked             for the Royal Society, of which                     ho was elected     a
Fellow when he               came      to Edinburgh as Professor.                   At the    com
mencement of the following session                       he was elected            a   Member of
Council;          and in 1864 he became                 one       of the Secretaries to the
ordinary meetings.                In    1879, in succession to Professor Balfour,
he was elected              to the General        Secretaryship          ;    and he held this
office    till the end of his life.
    His    loss    will    be felt   in the Society, not only             as an    active partici
pator in its scientific work, but also as wise counsellor and guide.

It has been put on record that " The Council always felt that in
" his hands the affairs of the Society were                        safe, that nothing would
"   be forgotten, and that everything                  that ought to be done would be
"   brought        before    it   at the right time and in the right way."                      In
words that have already been used by the Council,                             I    desire now to
say on the part, not only of the Council,                               but of all who have
known Tait personally, and of                   a     largely wider circle of scientific
                         "

" that      we have lost        a   strong and true friend."
      After enjoying          eighteen   years' joint work with Tait on our               took,
twenty-three years without                 this tie have given me undiminished
pleasure in all my intercourse              with him.     I    cannot say that our        meet
ings were           never unruffled.        We had keen differences (much                 more
frequent agreements)                on every conceivable         subject, — quaternions,
energy,       the daily news,         politics, quicquid       agunt homines,       etc., etc
We never agreed to differ, always fought                   it   out.    But   it   was   almost
as great        a   pleasure    to fight with      Tait   as   to agree   with him.           His
death      is   a   loss to me which cannot, as long as          I     live, be replaced.
      The cheerful brightness which             I    found on our first acquaintance
forty-one years ago remained fresh during all these years, till first
clouded when news came of the death in battle of his son Freddie
in South Africa, on the day of his return to duty after recovery
from wounds received at Magersfontein.                          The cheerfulness never
quite returned.               The sad and final break-down                in health       came
after     a     few weeks        of his University lectures in October                        and
November of last year.                   His   last lecture was given on December
11,    1900.
