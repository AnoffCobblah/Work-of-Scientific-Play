                                        (Read December              16,    1889.)
'
      Last      summer,         while engaged with some quaternion investigations
connected with Dr Plarr's problem (the locus-boundary of the points
of contact of an ellipsoid with three rectangular planes) I was led
to       construct the glissettes                 of an ellipse.                     I   then showed to the
Society a series of these curious curves, drawn in my laboratory by
Mr Shand, who had constructed for                                 the purpose             a    very true elliptic
disc of sheet brass.                   I   did not, at the time,                         think it        necessary to
print my paper;                   but, after the close of the session,                                   I   made       the
curious remark that precisely the same curves can be drawn each as
a glissette           of its own special hyperbola.                        This double             mode of         sliding
generation of the same curve seems to possess interest.                                                      It   is some
what puzzling at first, since the ellipse turns completely round, while
the hyperbola can only oscillate.                              But         a   little consideration shows
the cause of the coincidence.
         Let 0      be the origin,         C any position of the centre of the ellipse,
CA that of             the major axis, and               P the corresponding position of the
    tracing point.              This   does not require a figure.
         Then    it   is easy to see that          if   <f>   be the inclination                   of OC to one of
    the guides,        6   that of     CA     to the same, we have
                                  Ja2co$26 + b^ii28 =                    Jo* + 62cos<£         .
    But this gives
                                V ct2cos2<£
                                              -   62sin2<£
                                                                  =
                                                                  J        a2       - 62cos#   ,
    which      is   the corresponding relation for the hyperbola.                                            In fact the
    one equation           is   changed     into the other by changing the sign of b-,
    and interchanging the angles                   6    and         <f>.
      Let the polar coordinates of the tracing point, referred to the
    centre of the ellipse and the major axis, be a, we obtain position          r,                           a
    of   P    by the broken line OC,                    CP    ;   their lengths being                        Ja?   +    62,   r,

         If   we now turn              the guides through                           an   angle      a,       and use          a
    hyperbola whose axes are to those                                    of the ellipse respectively as
    r: Ja? -62        ;    and consider the curve traced by                                   a    point          Q   in its

plane, whose     central polar coordinates                   are      Ja? + b\        - a;   the position
of the point Q is given hy the broken line OC',C'Q. Of these OC'
is equal and parallel to CP, while C'Q is equal and parallel to OC.
Thus the points Q and F coincide.
   In fact the motion of either is the resultant of two circular
motions,     one of which is complete (viz.,                     0,   which has all values from
0 to 2ir),     the other reciprocating (viz.,                         <f>,   which varies      '^between
sar\b! Jar      +   V) and sHa-\a/ sfaF+W)).                                 But, in the      case   of the
ellipse,    the centre has the reciprocating motion;                                    while, in the
hyperbola,     it   describes        the complete circular path
     Mr Shand has constructed                    a   hyperbolic              disc, comprising        a   con
 siderable portion of each of the branches of the curve, and                                     it   gives
 very fair glissettes.          It   is   very curious to watch the proper point of
 the hyperbola gliding           over the curve already traced by the ellipse.
 But this apparatus        is   not so easily managed as                      is   the elliptic disc, so
 that the figures in the plate               were drawn by means of the latter, and
 reproduced on a diminished scale by photolithography.
     To exhibit, hy      a few forms, as completely as possible the general
 nature of these glissettes,          I      selected    aof tracing points equi

 distant from the centre              of the ellipse, and situated within and on
 the boundaries        of the various                regions,      to each of which belongs
a    special form.       For this purpose                I    traced          the curve formed by
 successive positions of the instantaneous centre of rotation on the
disc        The disc, with this curve on                                                 in the upper

central figure.        The equation of the curve                      is

                                                                      J**     +   &

It   is   easily traced as follows.                  Draw the ellipse                 whose    semiaxes

     This equation       suggested, as a useful distance of the tracing           point
from the centre, the quantity
and accordingly the points 0, A, B, C, D, E,                  F  were    taken on the
corresponding circle.            The glissettes    of   B and D, of       coarse, have
cusps    :— and it     is interesting to study the changes of form from one
to the next of the seven          just  named.     Two groups of figures give the
glissettes     of successive      points on each of the axes separately,             viz.,
G, 0,     K, M      on the major axis, and        J,  F, L, N on the minor. Of
these     K   and    L   have    cusps.   The figures G, H,       J  were drawn to
show how the glissettes             of points near the centre         approximate to
the (theoretical) four cusps which belong to the path of the centre
itself, the finite circular arc described four times over during a com
plete rotation of the ellipse.            The point      P  was chosen      as close    as
 possible to the intersection of the ellipse and the centrode.
     The locus of the instantaneous axis in the guide-plane is of no
 special    interest.      It  is easy to construct      it geometrically from its
 polar equation, which may be written generally as
                     r(2   JatTP- r) = 4a2i2/(a2        + b2) sin220  ,
 or in the present special case
                               r(75a-r) = 4a2/5       sin220.
 It   is an ovoid figure,         symmetrically     situated between the guides,
 with its blunter        end turned from the origin.
     The equation of the glissettes is found by eliminating                  0 between
  the equations
                       x=    J a2cos20 + £>2sin20   +   r cos(0  + a)  ,
                       y =                          +
                             «/a2sin20 + b2cos20        rsin(<? +  a).
  This   seems to lead to a relation of the 12th degree             in   r and y   ;  but
 it  must     contain    a  spurious factor,    as Professor     Cayley informs me
  the final result ought to be of the 8th degree.                And in fact we        see
  at once that,       if  the tracing point be at a very great distance from,
  the centre      (in comparison with the major axis of the ellipse) the
  glissette   will   consist practically of four circles, with centres in the
  four quadrants between the guide-lines.

in the corresponding vascularity of the integumental layers.
   It differs from all earthworms in the following points: —
        1.     The vas deferens             is single on each side; it only occupies                        a
single segment, or at most two.
      2.       There       is only     a    single pair of        testes,      which      may        be    in
segment           IX.
      3.       The sperm-sacs           are a single pair with               a simple cavity, i.e.,
not divided up by trabecule.
      4. The atrium                 opens   on to   X/XI ;       its structure is that of the
atrium of Rhynchelmis.
      5.       The oviduct opens into segment                  XI.
      6. The clitellum occupies segments                       X-XIII.
      7. The egg-sacs are very large, occupying about three                                     segments.
In      these points           it   approaches various Limicoline              genera.
      The following are the principal facts in the anatomy of my species
of Moniligaster.                    Those statements           marked with a dagger                (f)    are
made for the first time in the present paper                            :—
      +1.       The prostomium is very small,                        not extending             on to the
peristomial segment.
      2. The        seta       are strictly    paired,        and entirely upon the ventral
surface of the body.
        f 3. The       seta;    are not peculiar         in   shape, but like      those of earth
worms; only the anterior pairs are larger than the posterior.
        |4. There are no penial or cupulatory                     setce (?).
      f5. Dorsal pores are present.
      |6. The mesenteries     separating                        segments         V/VI,           VI/VTI,
VII/VIII, VIII/1X                     are very much thickened.
      |7. The hearts are in segments VI-XIV, and are of large size.
      |8. The alimentary tract begins with a buccal cavity leading
into a pharynx               ; the    pharynx is well           developed,;      the oesophagus is
lined with             a    cuticle, it is very wide;            the gizzards are              three*      in
number, and lie in segments                     XIV-XYI          ; there are no          (?)   calciferous
glands.
     f9. The nephridia                  commence     in       segment   V;     each has        a   saccular
diverticulum.

   t 10.  The   testes  are either (Af.       BarweUi) in segment IX, attached
to  posterior wall, or else in segment X, attached to front wall.
   11.   The sperm sacs (one pair) are in segments IX or X — in
correspondence with position of testes ; their cavity is undivided.
   tl 2.  The vas deferens funnels,              in  accordance     with the varying
position of the testes, open into           IX th   or  Xth segment
   13.   The atrium opens         between segments X/XI; it                has precisely
the structure    of the atrium of Rhynchelmis.
   tl4. The oviducts         are   in   segment      XI; in     the individual which
probably belongs to a species distinct from               M. Barwelli,       the oviducal
funnel is spread        along the anterior face of the septum                   separating
segments    XI/XII.
   15.   The spermathecse         are a single pair       in   VIII;    each is a small
sac  with a very long coiled duct.
   These points are       in my opinion sufficient to render it               necessary to
regard Monfligaster         as the type of a distinct            family, not, as Rosa
believes,  of the      TerricolaB,   but as equal to the Terricolse, Lumbri-
culidae,  &c.     This family      has evident relations on the one hand to
the  Terricolse, and on the other to the Lumbriculide                    ;  its   at Unities
however,     to any one         family      of the Limicolae         are    not marked.
These matters are discussed             in   some detail      in the   paper, and form
its concluding portion.

are conjugate,           because -3 is     in the    1st place   of (A) and        1     is in the
3rd place of          B, and     so on     in every     case.    A   permutation may be
conjugate with itself.               Thus the permutation
                                          6  3 2 4 5       1
which has         6    in the    1st place, has also        1 in the 6th       place, and          so
on.      A self-conjugate permutation may consequently                             be       defined
iudependently, as one in which each element is either in its original
position or has taken part in one interchange.
    Conjugate permutations are identical                      with   those which           Jacobi*
calls reciprocal, his definition                 being that two permutations are so
called when the performance                   of the one upon the other gives rise
to the primitive permutation.                   For   example,     3 5 2 1 4   and        4 3  15   2
are reciprocal permutations, because
                                  (35214) (43152) = 12345.
     In  regard       to self-conjugate permutations, there               is an interesting
 unsettled question which                 Rothe raised, viz., as to the number of
 them corresponding to any particular                      number of elements.                 As a
 partial solution he gave the difference-equation which                               it   satisfies,
 but nothing further.               No   proof even of the equation was given, and
 it  is the only result so left in his paper.                  Our present purpose is to
 furnish a full solution of the problem.
      2.  Tlie number           of self conjugate permutations of                 the      elements

      This   is best established as            it  was first obtained, viz., by classify
 ing the instances of self-conjugateness,                   and then making a census of
 the classes.           A  basis of classification exists         in the varying number
 of elements retaining their primitive positions in the permutations.
 Taking      this basis, we          see at once     that we have to consider in order
 the classes

 In the first class there is manifestly only 1, viz., the primitive per
 mutation.                   In    the second class there                            are as many as                     there        are
different pairs                   of elements, viz.,                          for example,

In the case                  of the third                 class we have to find how many pairs of
pairs         are        possible,              each         having       the    four elements                  involved                 all
different.               For the first of the two pairs                               we have, as has                   just     been
seen,         C^2        to choose from; for the second there are only C,_as to
choose from,                  because               there are two fewer elements                             to make the
pairs         of    :    consequently                    the number             required is               ^C„2C._2.2,                the
\    being due to the fact that the order                                         in which the two pairs                             are
taken          is immaterial.                        In      the case of the fourth                  class, we have                      to
ascertain               how many triads of pairs are possible, each having the six
elements                involved all different; and the result is similarly found

there corresponds                  a problem             regarding the terms of a determinant.
What        problem     on determinants, then, corresponds to the problem
here dealt          with 1 The answer is most easily perceived if the
elements        of a self -conjugate permutation be considered the column-
numbers          of the determinant, and as such be suffixed to the row-
numbers          1, 2, 3,      .    .   .    ,    n, taken always in this the natural order.
For example,            if   we combine the row-numbers                              1 2 3    4 5 6   with the
self-conjugate            permutation                   3 6   1   4 5 2   of   the column-numbers, we

and        at once       see that                it   possesses     the property of remaining un
altered         when the row and column numbers of every factor of it are
interchanged            — that, in               fact, such an interchange merely alters                        the
order of its        six   factors,            lg,     2^ Zv         .     That this     is   the characteristic
property          of such          a        combination            of row-numbers             in the natural
order       with         column-numbers                       in any order constituting                   a    self-
conjugate          permutation                   is    evident on recurring               to the definition

regard       to the vertical line notation for determinants, by saying that
the elements             of the determinant which                           compose       the term are cut
symmetrically                by the main diagonal.                        Our problem           is   thus trans
formed          into finding                the number of terms of                  a   determinant of the
nth order,         which       are such that the n elements taken to form any one
of     them are          in the             square       array distributed           symmetrically            about
the main           diagonal                 Terms of this kind may fitly be called self-
conjugate;              and, generally, the word                          conjugate may be used                     in
regard          to the terms of                  a     determinant exactly as in regard to per
mutations.              We may               even go further, and apply                 it    to the elements,

 Now each of the products of the first two types consists of two
 factors,   one manifestly self-conjugate, and the other a determinant
 of a lower order than the original determinant, but otherwise quite
 similar to    it    On the other hand, in the third typical product, the
 first factor 12.31 is not self-conjugate, and the second factor cannot
 furnish    the conjugate elements      21, 13.    These considerations give
 us at once the equation

odd, and =       1 . 3 . 5 .... (n - 1) when      n is even.
   Since here     11=0, the unique product just referred                 to vanishes.

 KVJ      instead of  KVJ     *°r our multiplier and divisor in the foregoing trans
 formation, and the third by using similarly |"/,ea|.                  This is one proof of their
 identity.     Another consists in pointing out the simple fact, that to establish
 the identity of the first two is the same as to prove that

Applying           this four times, therefore,                               to our equation of condition,

Now,       if    one        of the points             1,   2,       3,    4,     5,    — say

current, this           is   evidently          a   cone       of    the second             order,     with its vertex
at    0.    And since                1    is   associated           in both of              the   terms       with    2,   3,
5,    6,   both terms will vanish, and the equation therefore be satisfied
when for           (a-^,)            we write         (z^)           or      (x^)           or (*sy6z5) or (ay^r,).
Also       it   will    be satisfied when (x^y4z4)                             is     substituted, because then
the two           terms are alike and of opposite signs.                                             The theorem           in
question         is    thus established.
     On comparison of this                      with Cayley's investigation,                           it   will   at once
be seen          that not only             is    the resulting equation here much simpler
than his,         but that           it   is   also greatly superior for the purpose he had
in   view.
     There       still remains the question                              as to the reconcilement                   of the
two processes.                   Cayley's resulting equation                           is
145 . 256 .        123       .   36T +          245.123.456.361

Can    it       be simplified         1        Observing that the two middle terms have
more       than one common factor, we write the aggregate of the two in
the    form
                                 245.123 (456. 361-356. 461).
The bracketed                expression          is   then seen to be equal to

                                 (Read January      6, 1890.)
    The inferior olivary body or nucleus forms the ovoid projection
which extends         almost the whole length of the medulla oblongata,
from the      lower margin of the pons Varolii to within              a  short distance
of    the   level of the decussation            of the anterior pyramids.           It   is
separated       from the latter by        a groove      through which emerge           the
roots of the      hypoglossal nerve.          On its outer margin it is separated
from the      line of the roots of the glossopharyngeal and pneumogastric
nerves     by a shallow depression.              Transverse vertical and longitu
dinal sections of the medulla show the olive to be a                        highly   con
voluted      sac   of grey matter open, at its hilum, towards the mesial
plane.      (It   has two accessory nuclei of smaller size, an internal               and
a   posterior accessory        olive, which, as they are really parts of the
larger    nucleus,      do not call for special          consideration here.)        The
fibres of the       hypoglossal nerve        pass through      its  substance,    but   do
not become,        as was at one time supposed,            and  as has been recently
again affirmed         by Yincenzi, connected             with the     olive.    On its
median       aspect lies the interolicary           stratum or fillet.       Anteriorly
lies the   anterior pyramid, posteriorly the formatio reticularis.
    According       to the experimente of Bechterew,             the inferior olive is
concerned       in co-ordinating movements            necessary for the maintenance
of the     equilibrium'of       the body.*         One would naturally from this
   *
       Bechterew (Neurologischet      Centralblatt, Dec. 1, 1882) states the results of
lection of the    inferior olivary bodies to be as follows: — (a) Deep section of the
olives produce forced movements, mostly rolling round the long axis of the
body towards the injured side, and nystagmus with one eye directed upwards
ind outwards, and the other downwards and inwards,              (6) Slighter lesions pro
duced movements in a circular or in a forward direction, or caused the animal
to throw itself backwards,        (c) Sometimes forced positions, with strong lateral
 curvature of the body, were produced,           (d) There was generally, also, a tend
 ency to fall towards the injured side, or in lesions of both olives unsteadiness
 of gait, or actual inability to stand or walk.
    In estimating the results of these experiments, it must be remembered that
 it is impossible to divide the olivary bodies without at the same time injuring
 some of the following structures, viz., the direct cerebellar tract, the arciform
 fibres of Solly (or the anterior external arcuate fibres of Edinger), the ascend
 ing tract of Gowers, or those fibres which pass from the lateral columns of the

fact (as well as from its large size) expect that it should possess an
extensive system of fibres connecting it with other parts of the
central nervous system, more especially with such parts                      as  have a
similar function       ;  but it is   a  striking   illustration    of the difficulty
of   the    histological investigation of this region,              that until quite
recently only one of these connecting systems had been definitely
established.
    It  has long been known that when one half of the cerebellum                       is
congenitally defective,         the restiform body of the same side, and the
inferior olive of the opposite side, are also absent, the development
of the olive being evidently dependent               on the opposite       hemisphere
of the   cerebellum.        With     regard to the other relations of the olive,
opinions have been very divergent.
    The most generally accepted view is that of Deiters, viz., that the
olive is    a nodal point or ganglion of interruption, between the pos
terior columns of the spinal cord (or their nuclei) of one side and the
restiform body of the opposite side.                 Deiters thought that the in
ternal arcuate fibres which originate in the nuclei of the posterior
columns (i.e., the clavate nucleus,            or nucleus of the column of Gall,
and    the    cuneate     nucleus,   or nucleus of the column             of Burdach)
 terminate    on the convex surface of the olive of the same side ;                while
other fibres, arising from the interior of the same olive, leave                it at its
hilum, and after crossing the raphe, and then passing partly anterior,
partly through and partly posterior to the opposite                    olive, enter the
restiform body.          Deiters considered       that the fact that the restiform
body gradually increases           in volume in proportion           as  the posterior
columns diminishes is an evidence of the intimate association                   of these
two structures.
    Meynert, while espousing the opinion of Deiters, pointed out that
many of the internal arcuate             fibres   arising from the cuneate           and
clavate     nuclei pass behind the olive of the same side, and reach
spinal cord to the superior olive, and the posterior corpus qnadiigeminum.
The lesions produced in these various strands may therefore be, at least in
part, responsible for the phenomena attributed to the section of the olivary
bodies.     Ferrier concludes (Functions of the Brain, 2nd edit., p. 20") that the
views of Deiters and Meynert, with regard to the connection of the olive and
the posterior    columns,   are established by Bechterew'a experiments.          In view
of the possible   fallacies in these experiments,    and the certain results of embry-
ological   investigations, that connection       can no longer,    in   my  opinion,   be
maintained.

      Ross (Diseases    of Nervous     System) and Ferrier      (Funrtioiu of     the
  Brain, 2nd edition) adopt the views of Deitere and Meynert.
      The recent     researches     of Edinger,*     Flechsig,   Bechterew (with
 which      I fully   agree,    on the ground of my own observations in
 my Thesis      for the degree of M.D.), show the view of Deitere, with
 regard to the     termination in the olive of those internal arcuate fibres
 which      originate in     the   nuclei   of the    posterior columns, to be
 untenable.
     If  one examines transverse       sections of the medulla oblongata        of  a
 haman embryo between the ages of six and eight months which have
 been stained      with hematoxylin        after the method of Weigert, one
 find3 that     the fibres from the olive to the restiform body are not
yet invested      with myeline, while      those internal arcuate fibres which
form      the   cuneate   and clavate nuclei are fully medullated.               An
uncomplicated        view of their course can thus be obtained            ; and it is
beyond any doubt that none of these fibres terminate                in  the olive of
the same side,      that all the fibres of this system which enter the olive
merely      pass through its substance, and terminate          in  the intorolivary
stratum or fillet of the opposite side.
     Flechsig (Plan des inenscMichen Gehirns) was at one time of
opinion that the larger part, or two-thirds of the interolivary
stratum or fillet, entered        the olive j but it would appear that he no
longer maintains         this view, and though          there seems to be some
pathological      evidence    in its favour   (see the case   of Meyer, Arch.      f.
PtyeJi., voL     xiiL),  the examination of embryonic brains, especially
in     longitudinal     sections,    points   to   the    absence    of    any such
connection.
    There is as yet no evidence           that any part of the fibres of the
 spinal    cord terminate      in  the olive, though that may          well be the
 case.

the posterior and external aspect of the olive.                  It gradually     increases
in size from the middle of the olive upwards.                       At   the lower        part
of the pons (Plate II. Bt.) it lies between the superior olive and
the fillet and dorsal to the fibres of the corpus trapezoideum.                        In the
upper part of the pons it lies in the middle of the formatio reticularis.
At   the level of the anterior corpora quadrigemina                 it lies immediately-
external to the posterior longitudinal                  fasciculus.       It  then passes
behind the red nucleus,            and enters the lenticular-nucleus                loop, to
terminate,    according to Flechsig, in the lenticular nucleus.
    About    nine months ago, while making oblique sections                            of the
medulla      and cerebellum         of a nine months' embryo,                 in order to
demonstrate       the course of the restiform body (the posterior aspect
of the section being thus at         a higher level than the anterior),              I found
another tract (Plate         I.  fig. 2, a.o.t.),     apparently       previously unde-
scribed.     (It   is possible that this tract is referred to by Beehterew
in  the paper quoted above.)             The strand, which is only indistinctly
seen in the ordinary vertical transverse                 sections,    begins, like Bech-
terew's   tract, on the external aspect of the                 olive.     It   then bends
gradually inwards, backwards, and in an upward direction, forming
a compact     bundle, till it reaches the inner side of the nucleus of the
vii or facial     nerve (vii    nucl.).    Then it turns outwards and slightly
backwards, crossing the roots of the facial nerve (vii rad.).                           As it
does so the fibres spread out from each other in a fan-shaped
manner,     and become less easy to trace.                They apparently, however,
bend somewhat         downwards and enter the external (Deiters' nucleus)
of the vestibular root of the auditory nerve.
    This connection of         the olive   with     the auditory nerve          may serve
to throw some light on the special function assigned to the inferior
olivary body in maintaining the equilibrium of the body.

                                  (Read December     16,    1889.)
      The soluble ferments or enzymes have always aroused the deepest
interest,     partly from the mystery which enshrouded                        their mode of
action,     partly from the importance of the processes with which they
are   associated.       The peculiar power which each possesses of decom
posing     apparently unlimited quantities of a specific medium, without
itself being used       up in the process, has occasioned the confusion of
enzyme        action with processes truly vital in their nature.                      Although
this action      had only been demonstrated                as subserving an alimentary
function,      its aid was invoked to explain many of the more obscure
phenomena         of biology.        The series of decompositions which carbo
hydrates       may undergo,         known     as the alcoholic, lactic, and butyric
fermentations,       were       long ascribed to it.          Even when Pasteur had
proved that        these processes were always correlated                with     a   vital fact
—the growth         and multiplication of living cells — Traube,* Hoppe-
Seyler, and       Liebig    f    still   contended    that these might act only in
directly by      the formation of soluble ferments.                  The analogy between
fermentation       and the infectious           processes       is so striking         that the
latter have       long been grouped together                 under     the     term    zymotic
diseases,     and these we are every day coming to recognise                          more and
more     as    parasitic diseases conditioned              by micro-organisms.            Here
again,    however, many tend to regard the microbe as not acting directly,
but through the       production of soluble ferments.                  The consideration
of enzyme         function       in lower organisms            has   accordingly another
interest than      that which attaches to            it,   as throwing       light upon the

processes of digestion in the higher animals.              Upon     the view   which
we take as to its origin and meaning            will depend the standpoint from
which      we    regard     many   important     physiological and pathological
questions.
     Although       Duclaux and Ilueppe, in their investigations on milk,
had suggested the probable existence of soluble ferments,                 H. Bitter
in 1887 first furnished rigorous proof that bacteria produce                 enzymes
separable     from the organisms         which form them.          He   managed     to
kill    the   organisms      by sterilisation    at  60° C. without       materially
destroying their products,          and in this way demonstrated            that two
organisms,      when grown on gelatine,          produced    enzymes which were
able, apart       from the organism,        to liquefy   gelatine    and peptonise
albumen.         Sirotinin,    in an   investigation    carried    out in Fliigge's
laboratory, noted         incidentally,   that culture fluids which had been
freed     from organisms        by means     of Chamberland's porcelain filter,
still   retained     the power of liquefying        the gelatine.      Brunton and
Macfadyen have,            more   recently,   communicated      the same fact for
another organism,          and have stated in addition that when grown on
starch a diastatic ferment was there produced.               My own experiments
were undertaken, not for the purpose of demonstrating the existence
of such enzymes, but if possible to investigate more minutely their
properties.        For this   purpose the four organisms      which form what is
known      as the cholera    group — Koch's     cholera bacillus, Deneke's cheese
bacillus, Finkler's cholera nostras bacillus, and Miller's bacillus — were
selected.       These organisms exhibit in all directions a most striking
similarity, and the point which           I  wished to investigate     wras  whether
their enzymes could be shown to differ in any way.                     The reaction
in which they would continue to act offered itself                as  the most con
venient test.          The method of experimentation pursued             whs as fol
lows : — A     tube containing 20 c.c. of sterilised      milk   was taken, and to
it  a certain   quantity of acetic acid was added.          The fluid was shaken,
 and then delivered, by means of a sterilised pipette,               in equal quan
 tities, into four test tubes.        To   each of these   1 c.c. of the sterilised
 products of one of the organisms             was added, and the result noted.
 By making        a series  containing varying quantities of acid the effect
 on the enzyme          action was ascertained.        The   cholera    enzyme     was
 found to be most sensitive towards acid reaction,                 even very small
 quantities       inhibiting its     activity.      Deneke     came     next,   while

Knkler       and   Miller bacilli continued         to act in distinctly        acid solu
tions.       But the two      enzymes     which each of these organisms possess
seemed       not to be equally affected by the acidity.                The precipitation
of the casein         occurred      in  reactions    where       the peptonisation     was
apparently        completely        inhibited.       "We must        therefore conclude
that the enzymes of these organisms                  are,   in  each case, distinct, and
that the enzymes,            even    in the    same organism, are           not alike    as
regards their capacity of acting under different conditions.
    Gelatine and blood serum cultures of the four organisms were
found,     in no   case, to exert any diastatic action on starch.              A medium
containing starch was then inoculated with cholera bacillus, which
after being allowed           to grow for some        time was sterilised at 60° C.
The amount          of  sugar present was then estimated in a small quantity.
By means of a pipette, 25 c.c. of the sterilised culture was then intro
duced       into  a starch solution, and incubated for six days,                when the
 amount of sugar was again titrated.                  The quantity       found was not,
 however, greater than what had been introduced                       with  the sterilised
 culture     fluid,  so that no evidence        of ferment action was exhibited.
 Although the experiment was repeated twice, a negative result had,
 on both       occasions, to be recorded.           It   is possible that the ferment
 may have been destroyed,             or that some condition was present which
 prevented        its action.     It   appears    to me more         probable,   however,
 that the power          of converting the starch into sugar may here exist
  only    in the protoplasm, it not having yet               become developed into an
  enzyme      separable    from the organism.          It  is not necessary to consider
  the   primary processes of digestion as dependent on soluble ferments.
  The enzyme function should, as Hueppe                    *  has insisted, be regarded
  as a   secondarily derived function of the protoplasm.                   The process of
  digestion, as observed         in its simplest form,         is an intracellular   diges
  tion, and     is not,  as Krukenbergt        has conclusively shown, dependent
  on enzymes,       but is inherent in the protoplasm itself.                The enzymes
  are    merely further differentiations of this primitive                  power of the
  protoplasm       in the   same way as muscle and nerve are to be regarded
  as   represented     in the contractility and irritability of a structureless
   mass    of undifferentiated protoplasm. We are accordingly prepared

   to find very different degrees of development              in different organisms,
   and even in the same organism,              as regards   the different substances
   to be digested.          Thus cholera appears to          digest its proteids       by
   means of enzymes,          but the faculty of digesting the carbohydrates
   appears     still  to reside   in   the  protoplasm.      How far     the   process  is
   carried out     in  each case by means of enzymes, and how far, directly,
   by the protoplasm, must be decided by experiment.                       Even in the
   alimentary canal the process is not carried out by ferments alone.
   Starch     is there     converted     into equal quantities        of maltose     and
  dextrine, and the latter is unaffected             by the further action of the
   enzymes;      yet    as neither of these bodies       is absorbed       as such,  the
   portal vein containing           the    carbohydrates only       in    the   form of
  dextrose,     these must undergo        their further changes at the hands of
  the cells.      In  a similar way lactose and cane sugar are split up by an
  inversive ferment into equal quantities of dextrose and levulose, and
  the further transformation of the latter is evidently                to be referred
  directly to the protoplasm.*              The greater    part of the albumen is
  undoubtedly        peptonised      before   being absorbed,     yet,    as  Voit and
  Bauer     f have shown, a part may undergo            direct absorption.         More
  recent     experiments,     in  cases  of artificial anus, where       the influence
 of the ferments from the upper straits of the canal was completely
 excluded,       have shown that egg albumen undergoes                 direct absorp
 tion   ; and    since egg albumen is excreted by the kidneys as a foreign
 body, the disintegration and rebuilding up which is necessary                       for
 its assimilation must be attributed purely to cellular action.                   In all
 probability the cells lining the alimentary tract perform              a  much larger
 part of the preliminary           processes    of digestion than is at present
 conceded to them.
      An   enzyme is accordingly to be looked upon as a function                  which
has undergone         a  high degree of differentiation, indeed,       as a    property
 which is able to exist and act apart from the protoplasm.                     As  each
organism       is adapted      to   special   conditions, we should expect          the
 enzymes also to act best under these conditions.               It has   already been
stated that the enzymes of cholera             — Deneke, Miller,      and    Finkler —

       Although the enzyme obtained from yeast can convert only the half of the

exhibit a varying        susceptibility    to acid   reaction   precisely as the
organisms     themselves do.       This  does not indicate that the organisms
are more    susceptible to acidity, according        as their enzymes are more
sensitive   to its presence,      but that the protoplasm as a whole, and
with it the     enzymes, is adapted to        a certain set of conditions — its
usual   environment.
    This   correspondence between           the   conditions    under which the
organism     exists and those under which the enzymes act, is exhibited
even more     strikingly by     a consideration of their temperature relationa
Every enzyme has an optimum temperature                 at which    it works    most
effectively,    and a lower and a higher limit at which it           ceases   to act.
In  the case    of the cold-blooded animals this optimum temperature
is   much     lower than in the warm-blooded animals.                   Fick *   and
Murisiert found that the gastric juice of the frog, pike, and trout
dissolved albumen at 0" C.               Hoppe-Seyler      J has confirmed this
result, and states      in addition that     at higher temperatures        they did
not act so     effectively as at moderate temperatures.          The gastric juice
of a mammal,        on the other hand, peptonises         best at the temperature
of the   body, 39°     C,  and becoming less active at lower temperatures,
is finally   inoperative at 10° C.       Again, while the diastatic ferment of
 the pancreas     and saliva acts best between 37° and 40°       C, that of    germ
inating barley, where the temperature           is usually much higher, has its
 optimum at from 54° to 63° C.           Micro-organisms exhibit even greater
 differences as regards        the temperature     to which    they are adapted       ;
 some grow and liquefy the gelatine at 0°           C,  and as is seen in the case
 of the micrococcus,      which causes the phosphorescence            at sea, can at
 this temperature      exhibit their characteristic action ; § others do not
 grow   at a temperature under 50° C, and at70°C. continue to vegetate
 actively.ll     In  accordance     with  the adaptation of the organism           as
 regards   temperature,     the liquefaction of the gelatine,        occasioned    by
  a microbe,      may vary greatly, even to the point of cessation, with
 the temperature; but how far this is due to lessened                    production
  of the enzyme, and how far to its action being interfered with,

tained.
     We   have    just        seen that each enzyme has its own most appropriate
temperature,        and as the organisms               vary    as regards        their natural food,
we should expect                their enzymes to exhibit great variety                        as     regards
their capacity of acting on different media.                              This    is very     strikingly
indicated by their action on the different sugars.                                  The     yeasts as a
group are able to attack dextrose,                        giving rise to what is known                      as
the alcoholic fermentation, and they are also able to act on                                             cane
sugar, which            is,   however, first converted by an inversivc ferment into
dextrose and levulose.                     Yet of all the     yeasts only three              are     known
which are able to ferment milk sugar, the power of converting                                        it   into
dextrose        not being possessed by the saccharomyces                            as    a    group,      al
though     it   is
                a       property very widely distributed among bacteria.                                   Of
still   greater interest            is   the varying manner          in which the same organ
ism conducts itself towards different albumenoids.                                  Thus, as         a   very
general rule,       those organisms                which liquefy gelatine            are able to co
agulate milk, and then peptonise casein which has been separated,                                         but
some      organisms            which       peptonise      gelatine are without                action on
milk.      Again, wo should expect that those organisms                               which exhibit
no enzyme action on gelatine would                            be inoperative on milk, and
although         this     is       usually    the    case    there     are   exceptions to                this
rule.      It    has beou already                  noted that organisms             vary      greatly as
regards     the reaction             in which they peptonise              the milk, and         it    would
appear that they even peptonise                      it   in different     ways.         Although the
vast majority first coagulate                   the casein and then dissolve                   it,   certain
microbes         appear         to       peptonise     the    casein      directly   ;     this       would
indicate that the process in the two cases                           is   not identical.*              Very
striking    is   the way in which                  the same organism conducts itself to
the different           alburuenoids,          gelatin, fibrin, blood serum,                       and egg
albumen.          One organism                is   unable to liquefy             gelatine,     but pep-
tonisos fibrin     ;      another liquefies the gelatine, but cannot peptonise
the egg albumen.                   They exhibit, in this respect, the utmost diversity,
each having its own special idiosyncrasies.                            We     have       thus seen, in
the course of our investigation, that the enzymes vary                               in every direc
tion    as regards the temperature                   and reaction in which they act, and
the nature of the medium on which                            they act.       They must, accord-

 ingly,   be    regarded       as specific in their nature, depending on                                 the
 specific nature      of the protoplasm of which they                         are merely further
differentiations.
      The question     now      arises,     Are the products originating from the
action of      different enzymes the same                1    "We know, already,. that the
sugars and        peptones, in certain cases, are different, and more exact
investigation, coupled               with      more    delicate methods, will, without
doubt,     in the future, add greatly to the number of these.                                           We
should not,      then, regard the peptonisation as merely a breaking down
of the complex         proteid molecule into smaller, more diffusible mole
cules,    which are in this way more easily absorbed.                                     It   is also a
disintegration        into simpler bodies of probably                    a quite definite com
position,      which the protoplasm                   can     either     convert into              colloid
catalysable       material       to be stored           up in the            organism,         or build
up into its      own proper substance.                  The protoplasm of bacteria has
been      shown      to exhibit        the greatest           possible difference               towards
bodies    all but indistinguishable               from a chemical point of view.                        We
possess    indeed      in    these organisms          one of the most delicate reagents
at our    disposal in differentiating organic bodies of allied constitu
tion.     Thus, to take one example                    out of many,               it   has been found
that the       natural and artificially prepared inulins are treated                               as dis
tinct bodies by a microbe, the first being assimilated, the latter being
left absolutely       untouched.            It   is probable,     then, that the process of
peptonisation,        in which the proteid             molecule        is,   as   it    were, taken to
pieces,   is   not always the same, but varies according to the specific
nature     of the     protoplasm, in w^ich     may have, afterwards, to
                                                             it
undergo    a    process of building up to form an integral part.
   The enzymes have not yet been isolated as chemically pure bodies                                       ;
indeed,     there     is    good reason to believe that, in most cases, these
would be found to consist of several bodies corresponding to different
6tages    of their         action.    This       has been indicated most clearly in
the     case    of    the     diastatic        ferment       obtained        from        malt.*         The
starch,   after undergoing            a   first change        into   a   soluble form,             is   con
verted    into    a   molecule of maltose               and dextrine          ;        the latter then
undergoes       successive       hydrations, until 52 per cent, of the maltose
which the starch could have yielded, has been formed, at which stage
the action      of the ferment        ceases.         If, however,       the ferment had been

previously heated             up to 60°           C,   the      starch is converted completely
into dextrine        as    rapidly    as    previously, but only 28-4 per cent, of              the
possible maltose   producible from the starch is formed, and this
quantity is not increased by the addition of more of the weakened,
ferment-       It    would appear, from these and other experiments,                           that
the successive stages in the conversion of the starch                                into maltose
depend      on different ferments,                which are destroyed,           perhaps    through
coagulation, at different                   temperatures.            Little     is known     of the
products which              intervene            between          albumen      and peptone,    and.
nothing of the action which the various secretions exert upon them.
Yet    a complete         knowledge of these, and of the action upon them                           of
the various secretions               which are poured               into the alimentary canal,
is essential    to a proper understanding                         of the process.      At present
the action of a ferment is always tested on the unchanged                                  albumen,
usually egg albumen or fibrin, although,                           as is    probably the case with
the    intestinal secretion,              it may       operate     only in the later stages         in
the splitting up of the albumen.                           This   may perhaps account        for the
want of action of this secretion upon the chief articles of food which
so many observers have recorded.                               The products resulting from the
action of the secretions                  on the different forms of albumen                  in raw
and in cooked                    — the nature and relative amount of the
                          condition,
peptone      and     bye-products formed in each case, — still require more
exact investigation.             By        a     consideration of the relative amount of
peptone      yielded by each we should be able to form a much                                  more
accurate conception            of its dietetic value.            The nature and amount of
the bye-products, and the effect,                      in this relation, of prolonged action
of    a secretion,    as may     frequently occur in gastric digestion, might be
expected to throw much light on the effect of diet                               in such disorders
of assimilation           as gout.
     The enzyme function                   is,   as    we have seen, to be regarded            as   a
higher development of                a     primordial function of the protoplasm, and
we have       now to consider the question as to whether the degree of
development in each organism                          is   a   fixed invariable quantity or one
subject to variation.                It   follows, from what has been already stated,
that such external conditions as temperature,                               nature, and reaction of
the medium affect its action                      ;    we have      still    to mention here that

investigations          from the liquefying colonies                         destroying the gelatine
plates       before    the other, more slowly-growing                           organisms,     have      had
time to develop,               Cbantemesse and Widal *                          have    attempted,       by
the   addition of some substance to the medium, to hold the peptonis-
ing power           temporarily           in   check.            To facilitate      the discovery of
typhoid       fever     bacilli      in      the    presence           of other organisms,         as     in
suspected        earth        and    water,        they         recommended         the addition          of
carbolic acid         to the gelatine.               Control experiments carried out by
me    at     the      request       of Professor                Hueppe.f        indicated      that      the
quantity       required to effect this in different species of bacteria varied
from 0"01 per        cent, to 0"1 percent carbolic acid, and that the higher
concentrations          necessary       for the more refractory, entirely prevented
the   development             of more sensitive           organisms.           Other substances were
accordingly           investigated for the purpose                          of selecting one which,
while retarding           the liquefaction of the gelatine, would still exert no
injurious action               on the        microbes.            Of    those    experimented with,
glycerine seemed              most suitable for general use, although the influence
which        it exerted          upon this           function varied greatly in different
organisms.            This is explained by                 the fact, that its action appears to
consist not           in operating directly                    upon    the enzymes,      but rather in
offering      the microbe           a   substance              as pabulum, which          it   selects    in
preference          to the gelatine.               It     has been already mentioned that
Branton and Macfadyen found that an organism produced a pepton-
isng ferment when grown on albumen, but a diastatic ferment on
starch, so       that these would appear to be produced according to the
special      temporary requirements of the organism.                                I   had    previously
observed       that all the members of the cholera group, when inoculated
on blood serum,               produced sulphuretted hydrogen, and at the same
time liquefied          the medium.                If,    however,          glycerine is added to the
blood serum the               liquefaction and production of sulphuretted hydro
gen appear            much later, which                  is,
                                                         I       think,      to be attributed to the
organism         obtaining the energy                     which        it   required, first from the

become       exhausted, resorting         to the albumenoids           present.    The
degree of retardation         in the liquefaction of the gelatine will in each
case depend on the protoplasmic idiosyncrasies                   of the organism as
regards     the form of nourishment best adapted                  to its metabolism.
It   is   not improbable          that   an analogous       selective   action of the
protoplasm may come into play when organisms are grown anaero-
bically on gelatine containing grape sugar, and that the absence                      of
liquefaction, in some of these cases is to be ascribed to this.
    It  is not, however, such temporary abeyances of function                    that  I
wish to consider now, but more permanent changes in the organisms
themselves      as regards      this function.      The first occasion on which        I
observed      the complete       loss of the power of liquefying the gelatine
was in the case of an old gelatine culture of Koch's cholera                   bacillus.
The     colonies originating         from    it   presented     the usual irregular
margin and granulated-glass appearance,                and, under the microscope,
cover-glass      preparations gave the characteristic comma form, but it
grew in gelatine without any signs of liquefaction, and in milk no
separation       of  the     casein    took   place.    On     potatoes,    which    are
naturally of acid reaction,          the growth      was either much       impaired or
even     completely inhibited, although other samples of cholera grew
luxuriantly      on slices of the same potato.            This   sensitiveness   of  the
organism to acid reaction, when it has lost its enzyme function, will
 be dealt      with   later.     The variety      of cholera which had lost its
enzyme faculty, preserved its new properties for many months when
 cultivated on agar-agar.            When grown under other conditions, it
 rapidly     regained    its power of liquefying           the gelatine.       Thus,   if
 frequently re-inoculated on fresh              bouillon,   and retained at a tem
 perature     of 25°  C, it     recovered   its former characters in about three
 weeks.       Since noting this loss of function in the case of cholera,                I
 have had occasion            repeatedly to observe          the same     fact in    old
 cultures of many other organisms.               Gelatine plates from such tubes
 presented     non-liquefyiug       colonies often intermingled with the char
 acteristic liquefying ones, which had alone been expected.                     At firft
 sight it would appear that the former must be impurities, a view
 which, by preventing further investigation,                  has    no doubt misled
 many who must at some time have observed the same appearances.
 I was    able, iu such cases, by cultivation under appropriate conditions,
  to cause such      aberrant forms        to recover     their original characters.

The question now arises,                   What   are the factors which come into opera
tion in old cholera cultures, and cause this loss of function                           ?    It   has
been already            stated, that         when oxygen is excluded, the organism
exists without            the aid of         enzymes.       Now,    if   a culture is left, for
long,     undisturbed, a membrane forms on the surface which effectually
prevents         the entrance of oxygen to organisms                     which have fallen to
the bottom             of the tube, and the habit of taking its food otherwise
than by enzymes may perhaps                        persist for some time after it is again
grown under              ordinary conditions.             The    most     important factor, as
evidenced           by the fact that the               age of the culture is essential,             is
undoubtedly             the action of the metabolic products of the microbe,
which accumulate under such                        circumstances.        These      products may
act either as           general depressants            devitalisingly    upon the protoplasm
as a      whole, or specifically upon one or other function.                         We must in
this      case      attribute        the    action to      the presence        of   some     special
.substance,         which       acts upon this function, as organisms which were
unaffected     by their own products suffered this loss when cultivated
in    sterilised cholera cultures. As the phenols had been found to
act       powerfully in restraining                the action of the         soluble ferments,
attention           was directed to indol, which Brieger and Salkowski had
shown to be formed by cholera.                           The    great difficulty and expense
involved         in the preparation of pure indol                  prevented     the experiment
from being carried out                 with     it,   so recourse was had to phenoL               The
method of procedure was as                        follows — A
                                                          :        series of tubes each con
taining 10 c.c. of sterilised bouillon, received quantities, varying from
1    to   10     drops, of      5    per cent, carbolic acid solution.              The organism
was then seeded                in   these tubes, and the effect of the varying concen
trations investigated.                 The microbes which were experimented upon
in this way were Koch's Cholera bacillus, Micrococcus indicus,                                Micro
coccus pro<iufiogus,                and Bacillus pyocyaneus.             These varied greatly
as regards          the quantity required to effect the loss of their enzyme func
tion,      1   to   2   drops being sufficient for cholera, while Prodvjiusus and
 Indicus required the highest concentrations.                             Bacillus pyocyawus
being          still    more    intractable, showing itself unaffected,               even by 10
 drops        of carbolic acid,      it    was finally omitted from the series.             The state
 of    the enzyme function in the other organisms was tested from time
 to time by inoculation                     on milk and gelatine.           By this     means,      in
 the space              of about six weeks,              varieties of cholera,        Prodiyiooiis

 38               Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                 [skss.
 and Iwlicus, were produced which grew on gelatine without                          any
 Bigns   of liquefaction.         The condition       was  not,   however, a       very
 permanent one in cholera,           as  after a certain time a slow liquefaction
of the gelatine        began to show itself.
    In  the case of all the organisms,           the longer they were subjected
to the influence of carbolic acid the more fixed was the new condition.
 On the other hand, the strongest              solutions in which the organism
could be got to grow were not those best suited for the production
of more permanent           species.    No doubt, the     enzymes were lost more
quickly by       the use of the higher concentrations, but on recultivation
on other media they almost immediately returned.                       It   would ap
pear that the carbolic acid,            by acting devitalisingly      on the proto
plasm    as a whole, restricted the exercise of that lower function, which
by replacing its enzyme            action,  prevented the tendency to relapse
reasserting     itself, when cultivated again under normal conditions.
At any     rate,   it   was   the use of medium concentrations over more
prolonged periods which were found most effective, and indications
were not wanting that a previous growth of the microbe                    in the more
dilute solutions would have produced even better results.                The enzyme
which acted on the gelatine, and that which occasioned                    the rennet
like  separation      of the casein in milk, were not affected alike in these
experiments.          In all   three organisms     the power of coagulating the
milk   appeared to be lost before the power of liquefying               the gelatine.
If  this were     so, one    might consider the rennet-like ferment          as  being
a  later evolved function, and           so  more easily lost when subjected to
degrading influences.            For,  as the  precipitation of the casein is only
a  splitting, preliminary to the peptonisation which is to follow, such
an enzyme would be of no use to the organism                unless the peptonising
 power were also present.            The absolute proof that it is first lost, is
however wanting,           as   another factor must here be taken into con
sideration.        These organisms       become more sensitive to acid reaction
 in proportion to the loss of their enzyme action, as is evidenced by
 their less vigorous growth on potato.                 Now, as they all produce
 acid from the sugar in milk, their further enzyme production may be
 inhibited by the acid they themselves              have formed     before such fer
 ment is present in sufficient quantity to cause the precipitation                   of
 the casein.
    It  may be mentioned here that Prodigioaus                  and  Indicus, which

hid      lost   the power        of liquefying the gelatine had                     also    lost the
faculty of forming              their characteristic pigments.*                     This function
was, however,         much more easily lost than the enzyme                          function, for
perfectly       colourless cultures could be obtained, which nevertheless
acted on the         gelatine and milk, and it was evident that by properly
graduating          the agent brought to bear                   on the organism,            the one
might be lost         without the other being appreciably                     affected.
    It   has    already been stated that Fliigge found that micro-organ
isms when        grown in the absence of oxygen, appeared to obtain their
food     without the aid of enzymes, as they then ceased to liquefy the gela
tine.      The most natural supposition                  is,   that oxygen being necessary
for the formation              of the    enzymes,        when    it   is   excluded, the proto
plasm      reverts more or less to the primary form of digestion — that
without enzymes.                This may, in         some cases, be the explanation, but
there are       a   number of facts which tend to show that in some cases
under     anaerobiosis the products of the organism                           are different from
those      which occur under aerobiosis.                       This    has    led Hueppe        and
Brieger to           suggest     that    the metabolism of the organism under
aerobiotic          and    anaerobiotic states           may      be       different, these     two
being      entirely different adaptations of the protoplasm.                                On this
view,     under anaerobiosu, they do not liquefy the gelatine, because
they      then take their           food       in    a   different way from what they
do under            aerobvmt.       If    this       conception should, at first sight,
appear      rather fantastic,       I   must refer to certain facts which indicate
that such           organisms may have an                   adaptation to even so impal
pable an agent as          light.   Prove      j-   found that Streptococcus ochroleuku*
produced its yellow pigment only when exposed to diffuse daylight,
while Scholl states that Bacterium                       mycoides      roseum formed its red
pigment in darkness only.                     There    is   no escape, here, from the con
clusion that these two organisms                    have developed           their pigment func
tion under different conditions, which alone permit of its exercise,
a   result in perfect harmony with the beautiful                           researches      of Engel-

enzyme function.    In both cases this may be attributed, in part to an adapta
tion to the conditions present in the animal organism,       and in part to the
attenuating influence exerted by the cells.

mann,* on the influence of light on the Purpurin                         bacteria.    We
may, accordingly, regard the protoplasm as having several                        adapta
tions, latent memories          ready to spring into action on the application
of the appropriate stimulus.
    As   we have already seen, the enzyme faculty is to be regarded                     as
a   differentiation of       a   primitive    power of the protoplasm,           and we
have now to consider the probable cause of its origin.                      The resolu
tion of the complex into the simpler, more diffusible molecules,                        is
accompanied         by the setting free of      a  certain amount of energy which
is lost to the organism             when this occurs         by means of enzymes
in   the external medium.            What compensating           advantage     could its
development entail on the organism                1   From experiments on anaero-
biosis,  I was     led to suggest some time ago, that;under this condition,
where the enzyme            action appears       cut off, the organism        was more
sensitive to acid reaction.             Further     investigation has indicated so
clearly    a  relation between         the loss of this function and a corre
sponding       increase     in    sensitiveness     of the organism        to  injurious
agencies, that this view becomes more than a mere hypothesis.                         The
development of enzymes, by which the complex indiffusible                            com
pounds which supply it with nourishment are rendered                           diffusible
outside the OTganism, would allow of the protoplasm being invested
by    a firmer,     resisting,    bounding membrane          ;  and   as  this function
 was gradually        evolved,     each stage of development would be asso
ciated    with    a  corresponding condition of the cell membrane.                   In  a
similar way each loss of this function would bo accompanied                          by  a
 change     in   the membrane,         rendering it more sensitive to external
 injurious    agencies.        We must now consider how far this                  accords
 with a series of facts which have lately been observed by Fliigge.
    Fliigge   f  has come to the conclusion that Pasteur's anthrax                    and
 fowl-cholera vaccines         are really degenerated          cultures, in which the
 protoplasm       as a  whole has sutfered          by the devitalising       conditions
 to which       they have       been    exposed     during their production.           He
 founds this view on         a series  of very careful experiments, which indi
 cated    that the attenuated cultures grew less                    rapidly    than the
 virulent,    and     were    also   much more        sensitive towards antiseptic
 agents.     In addition, they       grew more slowly and were more sensitive

ation they had nndergone.                The incapacity of the vaccines to grow
and cause disease           in the bodies of       susceptible   animals he ascribed
to   their lessened reproductive power and greater sensitiveness,                 which
gave the     victory to the animal in           the struggle for mastery.        He saw
no reason to suppose that the action of these microbes                    depended    in
 any degree on the production            of specific toxines.     As his experiments
 were carried out        in   greatest detail on anthrax,      I will limit myself at
 present to its consideration.            On comparing the action of the virulent
 organism and its vaccines on Koch's gelatine, the vaccines were seen
 to liquefy the gelatine much more slowly, and had                     in fact lost in
 great    part their       enzyme      function.     This   effect was    much more
 clearly shown        in milk.        The normal anthrax coagulated           the  milk
 on the second day, while             Pasteur's 1st vaccine only began to show
 signs of this after, at earliest, two weeks.               My    suggestion   that the
 phenomena were           in   great part to he accounted         for by interference
  with enzyme function was confirmed                 by this result.      The method
 by which Fliigge compared the resistance of the organisms                      to acids
  was, shortly, as follows         : —A  series of test tubes, each containing the
  same    quantity of gelatine, was prepared,             and to each set      a  given
  number of drops         of  the acid to be tested was added.          The organisms
  were    then     inoculated by means of a platinum wire in a set of
  tubes   containing the same quantity of acid, and their growth com
  pared.     I was     able, however, to register       more exactly the effect of
   the acidity     by the following         modification.    The acid gelatine was
   rendered    fluid, and after being inoculated was, as it cooled down,
   distributed    uniformly      on the walls of the tube.         By this  means the
   organism    was enveloped on         all  sides by the medium whose influence
   was to  be tested.        In   addition, as the organisms        becanio  separated
   from one    another in. the liquefied gelatine, the colonies which ap
   peared later     would each originate approximately from one organism,
   and  thus the disturbing influence arising from the varying quantity
   introduced     in  each case was eliminated.            I  was, by this method,

so that we must conclude          that the loss of virulence and suscepti
bility   to  antiseptic     agents   have    no      necessary    connection.    The
susceptibility was in all probability          to be referred to the change         in.
the cell membrane         induced by the loss of the enzyme                function.
The pigment microbes which had lost their power of liquefying the
gelatine    were   also   compared      with the       unaffected   organisms,    and
found to have become much less resistant to acidit}'.
    It has been already stated that if the application of the degrading
agency is properly graduated, Prodigiosus and                Indicus  can lose  their
pigment faculty, although their power of liquefying the gelatine                     is
not appreciably lessened.           It  is probable       that in a similar      way
anthrax can lose its toxine faculty without its other functions being
seriously affected.        In support of this it         may be mentioned, that
Gamaleia     states that his vaccines, prepared by means of bichromate
of potash, did not exhibit the great loss of vitality which Fliigge
observed in Pasteur's vaccines.           Pasteur's method of attenuation by
the   use  of high temperatures       would appear to be so coarse         a method
that not merely        the pathogenic      function, but the vitality         of the
organism     as a  whole is affected.       But this      general loss of function
and lessened vitality, depending as          it  does on the method employed,
can in no sense be regarded as characteristic of the vaccines.
    We    have had occasion, frequently, in the course of this paper to
refer changes in the power of resistance of an organism to a probable
change     in the condition of the cell membrane, and it may be not
uninteresting hero to briefly mention certain morphological variations
in   the bacillus, some of which may, perhaps,                be regarded from this
point of view.         I   have   repeatedly      observed     that when virulent
 anthrax has been grown for some time in bouillon, anaerobically,
the shape of the organism undergoes             a  very remarkable     change.    The
 rods   and filaments     are no longer to be seen, and in their place             we
 have a series of larger spherical or oval bodies, apparently              multiply
 ing by fission to form chains         and clusters.       This torula-form is best
 investigated in its natural state,         as    it  does not stain readily and
 appears to shrivel up when dried.            When examined in this way            the
 appearance of these spherical bodies              is so different from what one
 finds normally in anthrax, that one feels inclined to put down its
 presence to the entrance of some chance impurity.                   Gelatine plates
 laid down from such cultures proved however that the cultivations

consisted       of pure anthrax, and inoculation of             mice  indicated that
their pathogenicity         was unimpaired.         It   is but right to state here
that      Pasteur    * has observed precisely similar phenomena in                  the
case     of certain moulds and mucors.           These fungi, when grown with
exclusion of the air, tend to produce, instead of the usual mycelium
and hyphce, cells much larger than normal and more                        globular in
form, so much           so that Pasteur      would     refer in part to this, the
erroneous statements so many botanists have made                     concerning the
 transformation        of  these  into   yeast.     The anaerobe cells of these
 fungi suggest by their appearance                a tendency more        or less pro
 nounced to revert to the amoeboid state.               Another appearance which
 may be noted         in anthrax cultures grown anaerobiotically also indi
 cates a change       in the cell membrane.        Under normal conditions this
 organism never forms on its cultivation             fluids anything approaching
 to a surface         membrane,    at most only        a   narrow ring     of growth
 appearing round the walls of the tube, which falls to the bottom as
  soon as     it  has attained any size; but when the air is excluded the
  superficial growth remains attached          until almost the whole        surface is
  covered.        Now   a surface membrane       or zooglcea results, as does the
  matrix of cartilage, from the changes which the cell membranes un
  dergo     in swelling up and yet remaining in continuity, and a change
  in this respect is what we might expect when grown in this way.
  The vaccines under certain conditions exhibit an appearance, probably
   of  a  somewhat similar character,      which points in the same direction.
   When virulent        anthrax is grown aerobically in bouillon,            the fluid
   remains     clear and limpid, the growth collecting at the bottom as a
   whitish fluffy mass.       The  vaccines,  if allowed to grow slowly, present
   a  precisely similar appearance;      but if placed      at a higher temperature,
   where     they grow more rapidly, the tubes of bouillon, especially in
   the   case   of the most attenuated,      present a uniformly turbid aspect.
   The apparent       change  in the specific gravity of the organism, which
   permits     it to remain in suspension in the fluid, is evidently to be
   ascribed    to the condition of the membrane in the vaccine being still
   further accentuated by the rapid division of the cells at the higher
   temperature.       The vaccines are described as morphologically indis
    tinguishable from the virulent organism ; Gamaleia,t however, asserts,

in opposition       to other observers,        that the bacilli of the vaccines are
smaller,    this corresponding to the degree of attenuation they have
undergona          On comparing the bacilli of Pasteur's vaccines with the
virulent     forms when grown on gelatine                 and   bouillon, only a very
slight difference in their size was usually to be detected; when, how
ever, they originated from a potato culture, the difference became very
marked,      the   1st vaccine     being    only about one-half        as broad as the
virulent organism.             This  appears     to be mainly due to the acid re
action of the medium affecting               the vaccines more than the          virulent
 organism,     the size of the bacillus apparently varying with the more                or
 less favourable conditions           to which     it  is for the moment        exposed.
 Huber *     has observed        that anthrax bacilli vary in size        as  they occur
 in   the tissues of different species' of animals, being much larger                   in
  the more sensitive than          in  the less susceptible     animals.     This differ
  ence   in size of the organism in different animals, or even in different
  tissues   of the same animal, should not be regarded                    as indicating
  a more    or less favourable medium in             a physical sense, but rather       aa
  the vital expression         on the part of the microbe         of the influences to
  which it has been there exposed, resulting from the reactive powers
  of  the tissues    in that    special animal or even tissue.          This point    will
  be dealt with more        fully   presently,   since  it is important   as evidencing
  an action exerted         by the cells on the microbe which lies outside
  them.
      There is still a relation of the enzyme function                to the organism
  which has not yet been discussed                — the action,     or rather want       of
  action, which the ferments            manifest on the living protoplasm.            The
  organisms     are constantly bathed in their own enzymes, and may even
  be exposed to those of other microbes               without their substance being
  attacked     by these.          The    explanation       of Pavy,f      of why      self-
   digestion of the stomach            does not occur in the       living animal, even
   if it  were sufficient      in that    special case, would not apply to those
   ferments which act         in alkaline                  The " living principle

view, since         Metschnikoff has                 ascribed    the death of microbes in the
animal body              to the mesoderm cells which                     are able to take up the
organisms as             foreign bodies and digest              them.      Now, as the organisms
appear to be unaffected by enzymes,* by general consent the antiseptic
action of the gastric              juice being          ascribed entirely to its acidity, even
assuming that                 they actually undergo their death in the cells, we
have no reason                to believe that this is due to a process of digestion,
but rather to some influence exerted                            by the living protoplasm with
 which         it must there           come into such close relations.                   It    is probable
 that the struggle which                       may occur between            two microbes             in our

  in    a culture        fluid, which  will " overgrow " the other may depend on
  the relative           quantity of the two primarily introduced, the nature and
  reaction       of the medium, and the temperature at which they are held                                    :
  in a precisely                analogous fashion, the growth of a disease germ
  introduced            into   a susceptible animal and the disease which                            follows
  is dependent            on the quantity introduced (Davaine, Watson-Cheyne),
  the tissue            inoculated (Koch, "Watson-Cheyne),                       and     it   may    be the

  organism          might be highly injurious to another, and that thus the
  sudden          disappearance           of an organism introduced into                        a mixture
  might be explained, but more                          recent    experiments tend to ascribe

   recently reported that he found that the organisms                      which, when
   together, destroyed cholera,          did not exert nearly the same effect
   when seeded       as   pure cultures alone with cholera,         a  result which he
   seemed to regard as very anomalous.              This, however,       becomes easily
   understood    if  we consider the course        of events    in putrefaction      as  it
   occurs  normally       in nature.     If   we examine from time to time                a
   fluid undergoing this change, we find that at different periods of the
  process   different organisms predominate, the others, for the time,
  sinking into the back-ground or even disappearing                   ; yet, as   Hauser
  has shown, several of these organisms can, when grown alone as pure
  cultures, carry out, although much more slowly, the greater part of the
  process.     In   nature    we   have, however, a physiological            division   of
  labour, each organism          becoming adapted       to a special       stage   of the
  process, during which         by its more active growth and the molecular
  changes   it  sets up in the medium,         it seems to exert a certain        inhibi-
  tive action on the other microbes present.                 This is more clearly
 shown by the remarkable way in which yeast                  * remains essentially
  pure,  when grown under favourable conditions, although exposed to
 every chance impurity.            If  the wort is held at a suitable tempera
 ture, and sufficient yeast is at the first added, so that             it  may increase
 sufficiently rapidly to get at an early period "within striking distance"
 of any chance        intruders, no other organism       appears able to obtain a
 footing, unless when the process is allowed to proceed                 so far that the
 products of the yeast         begin to act depressingly on its own cells.
The inhibitory          action which one        microbe appears        to exert upon
another during the vigorous exercise of its vital functions, is strictly
comparable       to that which        the tissues    may exert upon such organ
isms.     The cells of the human body have undergone great differ
entiation morphologically           and physiologically,      fitting them to carry
out the various stages in the dissociations and oxidations necessary
in the combustion of albumen to urea, carbonic acid, and water.                        A
microbe on entering the tissues              finds itself in conflict with cells
specially adapted to the conditions present               there, and more        or less
vigorously carrying out their stages in the vital processes,                  so that  it
has     small chance       of invading     the organism,      or even      holding ita
ground, unless it exerts         a depressing influence by means of its pro
ducts   — unless it     is pathogenic.      That we are not here ascribing too

important a role to the toxine*    is indicated by the varying grades of
virulence        of the organism which at present may be said almost
certainly to depend on the production of varying                             quantities of the
poison,     and by the fact that when a tolerance                       of the specific poison
has been        acquired either by a passing attack or by the previous intro
duction of the toxine, the disease germ                        loses its power of invading
that animal.            The microbe under such                     circumstances       need         not
immediately perish,             but may, and probably usually                     does, undergo a
gradual      process       of attenuation from         the increased         reactive powers of
the tissues,      and then falls a victim to the "phagocytes *                         as does an
ordinary saprophyte, or even a foreign body.                           This    has been shown
hy Hueppe          and myself * to              be the case when animals have                  been
rendered        only partially immune to anthrax, the course of the disease
is then      much prolonged, and when death does occur the microbe is
found       to have become               attenuated.   f       An Italian         observer    %     has
 rendered       it probable that in            a precisely similar way anthrax, when
 grown     with another organism, whose products exerted                             no injurious
 action on       it,   undergoes    a    slow attenuation, an effect which we must
 ascribe    apparently to the direct action of the one cell on the other.
 There     is   accordingly, as already asserted, no reason to assume that
 any other       forces      come into        play in the destruction of disease germs
 in   the animal       body than those we            see   operating in our cultures.

   tenacity.    Hueppc,       from the mere fact of its being              a.  secondarily
   derived function, considers it of little value for classification, as all
  characters    for this purpose should depend on primary powers of the
  protoplasm, which          as  such, are unchangeable.          At the       same time,
  the extreme        convenience and value of the gelatine methods                        as
  a   means    of diagnosis cannot             be   overrated, although the result
  arrived at in this way should in every case be further tested by the
  appearance      of the growth on potato and in milk.
     The varying power of resistance of the same microbe, which we
  have had so frequently            to refer to, has a great     practical interest       in
  its relation to the most important application                of bacteriology — the
  antiseptic system.          Koch     proposed    anthrax   as a  standard by which
  we might compare            the relative efficiency of different disinfecting
  agents.     Great confusion has, however, arisen from this,                 as  not only
  anthrax, but other organisms             also, exhibit varying powers of resist
 ance.     In determining          the absolute      value of an antiseptic agent,
  those conditions        which cause the powers of resistance of the organ
 ism to vary must be most carefully considered.                     This    is  still more
 necessary     at   present     in   consequence      of the search after specific *
 disinfectants.        It   has    been   found     that each     organism        exhibits
 idiosyncrasies in relation to antiseptic agents, being exceptionally
 susceptible to one, and more than usually resistant to another.                        The
 object being to find that substance,               or combination        of substances,
 which    acts    most     vigorously on the disease germ, and yet injures
 least  of all the tissues, the confusion              occasioned     by the organism
itself not being constant in its properties, can be readily understood.
 In such experiments          even a difference      in the  age  of the culture may
cause a serious discrepancy in the results.                 Thus,     if the organisms
experimented with are            a  brood of very young cholera cells obtained
by incubation        for   18 to 24     hours at the temperature of the body,
the action of the antiseptic is much more                 marked than on an older
culture.      This   is probably to be ascribed           to the organisms          in this
stage    of   development          possessing     a  more    permeable        membrane.
The nature of the medium appears also to exert a certain influence,
as anthrax which has been grown on potato is slightly less resistant
than that form other strata,             as agar-agar.      We   have     here again to
consider the influence which the acidity of the medium exerts on

¦if   the air may be            of more general interest,           as perhaps        throwing light
on    a   question        which      has long remained               obscure     — the manner in
which certain             diseases    are    propagated.            In    cholera,     typhoid,        and
yellow fever, the intestinal symptoms predominate, and                                  it   is   through
the evacuations            that the poison           is   disseminated.           Yet although         the
"rganisms are present                in   large    numbers,        in the      case   at least of the
first two diseases,             direct infection from the fresh stools                  is   by almost
general        consent          considered the exception rather than the rule.
Pettenkofer           has emphasised              and attempted           to explain         this view,
•¦specially      in the case of cholera, by assuming that the organisms do
not     leave the        intestine in       a   condition        capable    of infecting others,
but that they must first undergo                          a process       of " ripening " in the
soil.     It    has been suggested by others                     that the organisms          must first
grow outside           the body to form spores, and that these may be the
only means            of infection.         This      is,   however, completely negatived
 by   direct    bacteriological investigation.                    Now, the mode of existence
of organisms             in the intestine must              be   from the first practically an
amn-ohiotic              one.      The small quantities                  of    oxygen     which        are
swallowed            with the food         are rapidly absorbed                by the walls of the
stomach, or           converted into carbonic acid by the organisms always
found        there, so that,        in    the upper straits of the small intestine, at
most,     only traces           of oxygen       can be present.               Experiments         carried
out       by   Hueppe and myself, have shown that cholera can under
precisely        these     conditions        produce its           poison in great            quantity.
But     if   the organism lives             anaerobioticdlly in the intestine,                    it   will
leave     it    in   a    peculiarly      sensitive condition,                especially as regards
acids.         This greater susceptibility                to acids would raise           a   barrier to
its passage           through the stomach,                  through which infection                 must
occur.         But,   if   allowed to grow in contact with the air,                      as on     soiled
linen, they would                acquire their normal power of resistance,                             and

curastances,    so often remarked.           The need for that stage of growth
outside    the   body and      the influence of the         "time" and "place"
disposition    as   alfecting this becomes thus more readily understood.
It  is not denied that many other factors, such                 as  personal    predis
position, and all conditions local or seasonal which favour                  a state  of
intestinal irritation, come also into play             ;  but to discuss       these  at
present    would be obviously out of place.                It  is sufficient to have
noted that we have         hero    a  factor in this question which has not as
yet received consideration.
    The wholo question of enzyme                action is of profound interest,
from    a general     physiological        point of view.       Burdon      Sanderson
has recently advised us to study function,                    not in its simplest,
but in its most specialised          form.     Contractility   is not to be investi
gated   in a  mass of undifferentiated protoplasm, but            in striped muscle.
We     have   in  the case of the enzymes           a function of the organism,
separable from the protoplasm, whose mode of action we can investi
gate at our leisure.        It  is a catabolic    function of tho organism, and
by   a complete     knowledge of its mode of action we should learn how
 the process of combustion in the animal body proceeds                     at so  low   a
 temperature.       The action of enzymes is generally recognised as con
 sisting in  a   splitting up of complex molecules into simpler,                 accom
 panied by hydration.          The same result is attained by the chemical
 action of acids and alkalies or even by a much higher temperature
 alone.     Thus hydrochloric acid can convert fibrin into peptone and
 starch into sugar.        But this      occurs  only at   10CT    C,   whereas    with
 enzymes the change takes             place at a very much lower temperature.
 The power possessed by          a  comparatively small quantity of an enzyme
 of decomposing        relatively very large quantities of         a special   medium
 is spoken of as due to         catalytic action — an action bordering           on the
 chemical and the physical.             The dependence      of its optimum action
 on a definite temperature          suggests that it may consist in tho trans
 mission of     a  certain molecular motion, which enables               the molecule
 to be decomposed         at a much lower temperature              than if the force
 were less accurately       adjusted to the work to be performed, — just               as
 certain chemical substances explode most readily when sound waves
 of  a certain   length and rapidity impinge on them, or               as certain rays
 of light decompose or cause to combine certain chemical bodies.                     The
 energy which is present in the shape of temjjerature,              instead of acting

  as  it usually does   for the most part in merely increasing                the inter-
  molecular   spaces   by increasing the mean free path of the                 molecule
  by means of the     enzyme, is presented         in  such a form that     it is taken
  up by the   molecule or rather by a part of the molecule until its in
  tegrity is wrecked      and dissociation       occurs.    Now   we have       already
 seen that the     enzyme is merely a property separable from the proto
 plasm, but      not   differing otherwise from other functions.                   Each
enzyme     has its    optimum        temperature,     and   may   not the different
cakdyrimj powers         of the protoplasm of          an organism have different
optimum temperatures           ?   A   series of facts which have been accumu
lating for some       time   must,    I think,   be explained in this way.          "We
find that the     pigment bacilli have         each an optimum temperature            at
which they produce          most readily their pigment,         although this does
not necessarily coincide with that at which they grow most rapidly.
Thus     Prodigiosus grown        at the usual temperature       of the room, is of
a  striking red colour, but, when cultivated at the temperature of the
animal body,       it is absolutely colourless.*        I had recently    occasion    to
    *
      This need not be entirely attributed to the direct influence of the tempera
ture   on the catalysing processes ; the protoplasm,        as we have already seen,
exhibits a selective action as regards the different substances offered it as food,
 »nd it may be that when one process is partially interfered with, a similar
 power may come into play, and this would exaggerate the direct effect of the
 temperature.     Correlated with these perhaps only quantitative changes which
 may be catabolic or anabolic       in character, the metabolism as a whole may
 become more or less altered, so that the centre of gravity of the organism
 becomes as it were shifted.     It is to this, probably, that we must refer the fact
 aoted by Schottelius that, when Prodigiosus is grown for a certain time at the
 higher temperature, it loses the faculty of producing its pigment even when
  grown at a lower temperature.         In a more recent communication he states
 that,  when grown sufficiently long at the lower temperature,           the property
 returned, so that we have here an example       of that form of
                                                                  " reversion " which
 Romanes    has recently so ably discussed.       Dallinger has found that Infusoria
 ean be   gradually accustomed to withstand very high temperatures, and this
adaptation may be associated with a similar change in the metabolism.               The
 "tolerance" which Kossiakoff (Annates de Vlnstitut Pasteur, No. 10, 1887)
has shown that microbes can acquire towards antiseptic agents when previously
cultivated in more dilute solutions, is to be referred chiefly to the organisms
beraraing gradually accustomed         to exist without those "associations" and
 "dissociations"   which the chemical substance tends to inhibit, and to a cor
responding development of others to take their place.         The permanence of this
new habit of the organism,       when grown again under the old conditions, will
depend on the more or less stable nature of the new combination or complex
functions which has been evolved.          This modification of the organism as a
whole, which may result from a change in one direction, and is dependent ou

larger quantities of acid than ammonia                             (?)   appeared to be formed                only
within       a   certain range of temperature.                           "Warrington * found, with
quite    a    series of organisms,                  that when cultivated in milk, at higher
temperatures            they produced relatively more ammonia,                                  at lower re
latively more peptone.                      It      has been        recently communicated that
certain yeasts produce                 at lower temperatures                   relatively more alcohol,

temperature.            I      conclude that the temperature acts more or less
directly on those catalysing processes inherent in the protoplasm
itself, in       a     way     similar to that in which                    it   acts on        the    enzymes
which are separable                    from the protoplasm.                      It   has      already        been
noted, that in the organisms                          of the cholera group the rennet-like
ferment appeared                able       to act in acid          reaction in which the pepsin
like ferment was inhibited.                           We should not then be surprised to
find that         a    chemical         substance        is   able        to   inhibit      one      catalysing
process        in the protoplasm without                       materially affecting               the others.
There are already many facts in Bacteriology which speak for this,
but     a    systematic        examination of the influence which such bodies
exert on the functions of microbes                            is   much to be desired,               as   throw

living       protoplasm,         and       as    furnishing        us     with    a    basis    on which          a
cellular therapeutics                 may perhaps in the future be founded.                           Interest

 The Electrolysis of Potassium-Ethyl Malonate and of
         Potassium-Ethyl Succinate.                   By Prof. Crum Brown
         and Dr James Walker.

                                       (Abstract.)     .
     Synthesis    of Succinic Acid.— Potassium-ethyl              malonate  is easily-
 prepared     according to the directions of Freund (Bcrichte der deut.
 chem. Gesellschaft, xvii. 780).
    The conditions most favourable for the electrolysis were found
 to be as follows      : —A    large  platinum    crucible formed the cathode,
 while    a  spiral of stout platinum wire was used as the anode.                 The
 source of electricity was a battery of accumulators,               and the current
 was so regulated        that while passing through the solution it had an
 electromotive force of 12 volts and           a strength of not more than            5
 amperes.        Under     these circumstances      the heat      developed   in the
 solution could be easily conducted away by                a  stream   of cold water
 flowing round the platinum crucible.              Heating is to be avoided, on
 account of possible saponification of the potassium ethyl salt by the
action of the caustip potash formed at the cathode.                 "With the above
arrangement,        however,       the hydrogen developed at the             cathode
serves to stir up the liquid and bring the potash into contact with
the carbonic acid liberated at the anode, and thereby convert                 it into
carbonate,      which, far from being prejudicial to the action, seems on
the whole advantageous.              One point to be attended to is that the
solution should not be too concentrated.               When this is the case the
liquid    has a high resistance,        and  the electrolysis proceeds slowly          ;
the product, too, is not so satisfactory         as when       the solution is so far
diluted that      a brisk evolution of gas takes place at both poles with
out any excessive frothing being occasioned                by the viscosity of     the

  liquid      After the current has passed for some time,               a  deposit begins
  to be formed       in the solution.       This   is mainly potassium         carbonate,
  with possibly some bicarbonate.             When this has increased somewhat
  in quantity     the current is broken, and the contents                of the crucible
 transferred      to a separating-funnel, where            they  are   shaken up with
 ether.     A further quantity           of  carbonate      is  thereby      precipitated.
 The aqueous        layer is then allowed to run out, nearly all the solid
 carbonate      remaining behind, and the ethereal               layer is poured off.
 The former is          again submitted to electrolysis, and the extraction
 with    ether repeated.          The ethereal     liquids are united, dried with
 calcium    chloride, and the ether distilled off on a water-bath.
     In our first experiment, made with                  15    gTams of       the double
 malonate, there        remained in the distilling-flask          over 3 grams of a
nearly colourless          liquid of    ethereal    odour.     This   liquid     was sub
jected     to fractionation        ; it  passed    over almost entirely           at  213°
 (uncorr.)    :  the boiling-point       of succinic ether is 216°.             A portion
 of the   distillate was       analysed, with the following results :         —
                      ¦2619 gr. substance      gave "5287 gr. C02

 There    was thus        little doubt that       the substance      so obtained was
 succinic     etheT.     In confirmation,      however,      a portion of the ether
 was    saponified, and the white silver salt precipitated.                This salt   was
 then carefully       ignited, and the residue of silver weighed.

 bonate, and        precipitating the double salt from its alcoholic solution
  with ether.
      The conditions        to be observed      in   the electrolysis are quite the
  same as    in the case of potassium ethyl malonate,               and     the  mode of

but faint odour of melons.             It  boils with decomposition at        about
240°.    An analysis of      the substance        thus obtained, after drying     in

obtained.

from part of the potassium salt thus produced the silver salt was
precipitated, while another part was converted into the acid, which
was purified by shaking its ethereal            solution repeatedly      with small
quantities of water.        The acid melted          at 147°   :  the melting-point

 thereby led to     investigate tbe action of these two reagents on solu
 tions of nickel     and cobalt salts.
    Gnen, Cobalt      Solution.   — If sodium      carbonate     is   added     in large
excess    to a    solution    of a cobaltous salt, on shaking the mixture
with a sufficient      quantity of bromine,       the whole of the precipitated
cobaltous carbonate         dissolves, giving rise to     a  beautiful     dark green
solution.      This solution is stable        when   preserved      in  closed vessels
at  ordinary temperatures.           It decomposes     on boiling with precipita
tion of cobaltic      oxide.     Caustic alkali produces rapid decomposition,
cohaltic    oxide    being precipitated.        The green colour is destroyed
on    acidifying    with hydrochloric or sulphuric          acid, but reappears on
neutralising the acidified         solutions with sodium carbonate.               Acetic
acid does not       decolorise the green solution.
    Red Cobalt Solution.        — If the   green   solution, prepared         as  above,
is acidified    with sulphurous acid, and the decolorised solution then
rendered      alkaline with sodium carbonate, a fine red-coloured solu
tion is produced.          On shaking this in        presence     of air, it absorbs
 oxygen and becomes           green.    On standing, the colour         goes back      to
 ted,  but, on again shaking         with air,  becomes green.         These changes
 of colour may be         produced a number of times.             After    some time,
 or on adding        alcohol, the red solution ceases to become green on
 soaking    with air.
    The reaction        of solutions of nickel salts with sodium carbonate
 and    bromine      are   very    complex.      They    vary     in   a   remarkable
 manner,      according      to the temperature and          concentration of the
 solutions    employed      and the relative proportion and order in which
 the reagents      are added.
    If   excess    of sodium carbonate        is added   to a solution of nickel,
 the resulting      mixture behaves       differently on addition of bromine,
 according     to  the proportion of bromine added.             If  a large excess     of
 bromine     is added,    part of the nickel goes into solution, part remains
 undissolved as pale green carbonate.            On the other hand,        if  a smaller
  proportion    of bromine is added, so as to leave              excess of       normal
  sodium    carbonate,     the nickel is rapidly and completely converted
  into peroxida

the    resulting mixture, the whole of the nickel goes into                                solution.
Such solutions are, however,                           very unstable,         and   rapidly darken,
owing to the formation of peroxide of nickel.                                   Much more           stable
solutions of nickel can be obtained by using supersaturated                      solutions
of sodium carbonate,                   prepared         by subjecting decahydrated sodium
carbonate          to aqueous fusion.
      The author points out in this connection that bromine does                                      not
liberate carbonic acid from such                        a supersaturated       solution of sodium
carbonate          even when       it   is added in excess.               Carbouic acid       is,   how
ever, given off freely on subsequent                         dilution with water.
      The author       is   at present            investigating the action of bromine                 on
sodium carbonate under varying conditions— (a) upon each other,
(b) upon mixed solutions of cobalt and nickel salts.
      His   experiments,          so   far   as    they have gone, point to the possibility
of effecting the separation                  of nickel from cobalt in               a   rapid and easy
manner.

      As the immediate result of the ingestion of certain chemical com

lsss-90.]          Dr H. H. Ashdown on Substances in Urine.                                           59
years, however,        by the attempts               made      to define      and differentiate
the individual       members of which it consists, and to ascribe to each
their relative significance,            and these efforts            have     been    crowned         in
some measure         by a considerable degree of success.
     Schmiedeberg          and Mayer        were the first to isolate and analyse the
substance     thus produced, and found it to be glycuronic acid, and that
its chemical       constitution        was represented         by the formula CjH^Oj.
     This substance         appears in the urine in combination with urea,
from which         it may    be obtained by precipitation, by means of barium
hydrate, and extraction              with alcohol, and decomposition of                   the com
pound thus obtained          by sulphuric acid.
     It   holds the    oxide of copper in solution in                   the    presence            of an
alkali and reduces            it,   throwing      down the        suboxide, upon boiling
ether      in Trommer's or Fehling's tests; and                  a   similar reaction occurs
with the oxides of bismuth, mercury, and silver.
     For the definite recognition, however, of glycuronic acid, the only
reliable means possessed at present                  is   to thus obtain      it     pure, but, as
already      remarked,      the process      is   long and tedious.
     The polariscope,         unless used with pure solutions of this acid, or
with solutions of known combination,                      is   very apt to mislead, since
some of its        combinations rotate the ray of light to the left, and others
to the      right; and     if   glucose be also present very erroneous                         conclu
 sions may be        arrived at.
     When pure,       it   rotates the ray of polarised              light    to the          right, —
35°, — or to       half the extent of the deflection produced by glucose.
     There    is   no doubt, however,          that with comparatively small quan
tities of    urine the differentiation of this substance from the glucose,
which possesses            similar chemical         reactions,    may be        readily arrived
at    by   applying the       test   of fermentation by yeast —               a   test    of great
delicacy     if   conducted     properly and with due care over mercury,                            and
one capable        of demonstrating the presence                 of smaller quantities of
glucose than        either Fehling's solution or Trommer's test can detect.
                                        Experiments.
  1       have now    investigated      a   large    number of specimens                 of urines
obtained      under        different    conditions, in order to trace                    as    far as
possible the presence           of glycuronic acid, and              to differentiate         it   from
glucose.      The fermentation test was always employed, and, whenever

the quantities of urine obtained were large enough,                    the   chemical
process was undertaken in its entirety for obtaining the acid                    pure.
I   now chronicle my results          : —
     Morphia.    — The urine       secreted after the exhibition       of this drug,
 either by the mouth or subcutaneously,             contained   a substance,    which,
 from its power to reduce               Fehling's solution, has been generally-
 regarded     as a   transient condition of glycosuria, but after              a close
 investigation     I  find it to be due, not to the presence of glucose,           but
 of glucuronic acid.
     Chloroform. — I have also satisfied myself that the reducing power
 of the urine, after the administration of this anaesthetic, is dependent
 entirely upon this acid, and is not due to glucose.                In this manner
  I   have   been able      to    confirm independently        the  observations     of
  Mayer upon morphia and chloroform.
     With      chloroform      I    have,   however,    found    some      exceptional
  instances,    in which no reducing substance             appeared     in  the urine,
  but these exceptions          over a large     number of observations           were
  undoubtedly rare.
      Curara. — The glycosuria, so called, of curara poisoning has long
  been known, having been first             observed   by Claude Bernard, but          I
  have    not succeeded,        after an extended       series  of observations,     in
  obtaining any fermentation by yeast of these urines, which appear
  otherwise to     be so   markedly glycosuria.
     In  these instances,      however,    it  was most difficult    to obtain    large
 enough quantities of urine to complete              the whole chemical        process,
 since the curara itself interferes          so decidedly with     the secretion     of
  the kidney     ; and consequently       I   have not been able to separate        out
   the acid in this group of observations.
      Ether.  — As   the result of the administration of ether            I have never
   found the appearance of this acid or of any reducing substance                     in
   the urine, and      it is therefore     a   useful anaesthetic for observations
   upon the urinary system.

      Renal Nerves Intact. — With the view of further investigating the
   significance of this glucuronic acid,          I placed cannula? in the ureters,
   iu order to collect for analysis the urine              so  secreted     by the two
   kidneys     separately.       I  found that under ordinary conditions             the

chemical      constituents of the different secretions                 differed     only to
such an extent as           could      be readily accounted     for by the difference
in the size of the          two organs.
    I found,     as   the result        of these experiments,     that   if  the reducing
substance was          present      in the urine of    one side,     it  was invariably
found also      in that of the opposite side.
    Sniion    of     the   Renal     Nerves.  — Again, in another       series of experi
ments,    I collected        and analysed the right and left urinary              secretions
separately      after division of the renal nerves                upon the left side.
These observations            then differed from those of the preceding               group,
only by the        fact that one organ had been completely cut off from
all nervous       influences from any source without the organ itself.
    The    results which were thus gained are most interesting, and an
illustrative series          of  these experiments are tabulated below.

      Ether. — Where this was the only anaesthetic                    employed,      I  never
  succeeded        in demonstrating the presence of this reducing substance
  in the urine (Expt.                 I.). But when used in conjunction with
   chloral     hydrate       (Expt. II.) or morphia (Expt. III., IV.), it was
   present in such abundance as to be very readily recognised.
       This result was produced             upon both sides, and although           I  am not
   able to state that          I  could recognise any very marked increase in the

amount excreted upon the left side, no quantitative                     analysis having
been made,        it certainly      was present      in larger quantity than upon
the right.       These results may be explained as corresponding to                    the
results gained previously and already noted.
     Chloroform. — As was to be expected when this anaesthetic was
exhibited (Expt. V.), the reducing substance manifested itself in
abundance        upon both the injured and also the uninjured sides.
    Ether and Chloroform.           — In     the    iustanee    in which     these    two
amesthetics       were     combined,      a  very interesting result was         gained
 (Expt.     VI.  and   VII).
    If  the chloroform was given            to any pronounced extent both sides
showed       the   reducing substance,          but in those instances       where     the
chloroform was only given at the earliest stages, and its administra
tion stopped before the commencement                    of the collection of the urine
for analysis,      a different condition appeared to be induced.
    Under these circumstances             no reducing substance          was present    in
the urine secreted by the normal and uninjured kidney, but in the
urine which flowed from the other kidney, the nerves of which had
been previously divided, this reducing substance                  was readily demon
strated.
    In   the case of Experiment          VI. it   was found on the left side only,
but there only in small quantity,                and   limited apparently to only        a
short period of time         (VI., L.    2), for none could be detected, not even
a   trace,    in  the   first or last stage of the observation.               No   traces
could at any time be obtained on the right side at any stage.
    In Experiment VII., however,              a  further point is illustrated.       This
substance      appeared     distinctly throughout the whole period of observ
ation in the left secretion, i.e., the side upon which section had been
performed — but much               more   markedly       during    the   second   period
(VII.     L. 2), during which it seemed to reach its maximum and to be
present     in quantity, and then         again    to fall off.    There was no trace
detected on the right side.
    In  these instances,       therefore,    it  was found that this reducing sub
stance      appeared      upon the left side only, — upon               the side  where
complete division of the renal nerves had been                effected, — and also that
the    greatest    output, in the former instance              (VI.)  the only output,
was found to correspond              with the period of the greatest activity of
the renal      epithelium,      if  the eliminative       activity may be judged of

by the        respective          quantities of the normal urinary constituents
eliminated.
   I have      shown elsewhere                  that the renal secretion, after section of
the renal nerves,                is a true paralytic secretion,                and        I    find that the
greatest abundance,                 never very large though distinctly marked, of
this    substance           occurs       at the maximal             display         of energy which is
reached just           prior to the outset of the stage of exhaustion.
  After a very                careful and exhaustive chemical analysis of                                   these
different      specimens,            I    have    convinced myself              that          this substance
which is present              is not      glucose,    and that this condition is not there
fore a form              of      glycosuria       properly        so-called,        and        I    have little
hesitation          in affirming that            it is due       to the    presence            of glycuronic
acid.
  It    is,   however, no easy task to seek out the cause or significance of
these results.              The animals were fed with                 a    liberal meat diet on the
evening        prior        to    the observation,           and as the urine showed                           no
tendency           to reduce solutions             of    copper     before     the experiment,               it   is
necessary          to conclude that this reducing substance                            is      occasioned by
the disturbance               of the economy resulting from the experiment itself.
      Again, since the administration                     of chloroform         is   now recognised            as
ahle to       establish such         a     condition in healthy animals by mere inhala
tion, and           as
                     I      have     never succeeded             in producing          these         conditions
without having employed                      this    anaesthetic,   I     am disposed to attribute
the     appearance               of this     reducing       substance          to    the effect of the
chloroform inhaled, although                      it     does not at present seem possible to
appreciate             in what particular manner or by what altered                                   process of
metabolism             it   is   brought about
      The explanation, further,                      of these appearances                 in       those   results
upon        one side only,               does    not      seem     to be very simple, but two
theories           may be offered as capable of accounting                          for       these results —
 firstly,      this reducing              substance may be                circulating          in     the blood
 as     the        result     of the conditions             under which             the animal experi
 mented upon has been                       placed, and that           it    may be eliminated                 by
 the one kidney alone,                     since the action of the cells of that organ
 are completely                  cut off from         the central nerve               influences, which
 hold the other organ                    in check    ;   or, secondly, this substance                      may be
 formed in the cells of the one organ alone,                                   owing to the fact that
 there        is   a   greater activity produced            in them by section of                    the nerves,

and this is accompanied                      by    a   much greater supply of blood to the
organ, which               is synonymous with an increased                        supply of material
from which the substance                      is formed.
     It    has       already clearly been                 shown        that a condition              may        be
established in the                  which          both       kidneys    will    produce         a    similar
result,     and      it is therefore difficult                 to imagine that this material                     is
already in the blood, and is being eliminated upon one side only;
but it is not unreasonable                         to consider that,       if only   a small          supply
of .material be forthcoming, the organ which has the greater supply
sent to      it,   accompanied               by   an increased         activity in the cells them
selves,     will      produce       the results described.
I         lean to the latter view, since                      the quantity in which this reduc
ing substance                 appears     in the left secretion           is    sufficiently abundant
to lead       one to expect                 its appearance           in the right secretion,              if   the
substance          were circulating               in that form in        the blood itself.
I         therefore advance                  the       view based        upon    these     observations,
that there           i3   a   distinct chemical process presided over                       by    the renal
epithelium             which       has as          its result        the formation        of glycurortic
acid, but the precise nature                        of that process and upon the presence
of what chemical compounds                          it   is   dependent  I      am at present unable
to appreciate.
     If   this acid may be regarded, as                       is   probably the    case,    as   a    deriva
tive of an                oxidation         process       of the sugars          within the animal
economy,             these      results      may       prove       of considerable       importance as
offering an explanation of how the sugars are oxidised within the
system.
     These        observations were                    made     in    connection with            the lower
animals,         and  I        was thus encouraged                 to further pursue       my observa
tions in regard to man.
     After       a    prolonged         search         over    several    hundred cases of man,
both in disease and health,                   I     have succeeded in finding one instance
— this       is    the first and only recorded instance,                    I     believe — in which
this reducing substance                       has been         shown to be excreted                  in    large
quantity.
     This individual              is    a   man about twenty-four                 years    of    age,          who
apparently enjoys perfect health and                            a    complete    sense of well-being,
and does not suffer from any of those symptoms which but too
readily indicate the presence of glycosuria in youth.

    It    must     not, however, be concluded from these results that the
presence          of   this substance       is   so extremely rare, for my observations

        The principal           phenomena           connected        with the        great      volcanic
 eruption at Bandaisan,        in Japan, have been described by Professor
 S.     Sekiya     and Mr Y. Kikuchi in their official report,* but certain
features,         especially with reference             to the effects          of erosion on the
ejected materials,             seem worthy of more detailed description.
      To make the account intelligible,                  it   will    be necessary         to describe
briefly the chief features                  of    the eruption.       The name Bandaisan                     is

 E.    Eefore the eruption there were four peaks— Obandai, Kobandai,
 Kushiga-mine, and Akahani-yama.               They are of volcanic origin and,
 according to tradition, formed at one time           a  single mass which was
 split into four by      a great    eruption early in the ninth century, at
 the time when Lake [nawashiro was formed.                 Bandaisan rises to a
 height of 6037       feet above     sea-level, and   Kobandai       is believed      to
have    reached    almost exactly the same           altitude.       For about ten
 centuries  the   mountain had shown no signs of activity, except                   by
 the existence   on  it of  a number of hot springs          and solfataras.         It
 was, however,    included by Professor Milne in his list of the active
 volcanoes   of Japan.
    The recent eruption took place on the 15th           July  1888.      There was
 no premonitory warning of the catastrophe              except     some   rumblings
 heard at 7 a.m. of that day, which were followed by an earthquake
 of no great intensity.       At     7.45   a  great explosion took place,          by
which an immense cloud of steam and debris was shot                    up to a great
 height above the top of Obandai, and this explosion was quickly
followed by fifteen or twenty minor explosions.               The result of these
explosions was that        practically    the whole mass of Kobandai              was
shattered,   and the materials      forming it were spread over an area of
27"31 square miles.        As  calculated     by Professor Sekiya, the volume
of material moved         by the explosion was 1587 x         10''  cubic yards, or
say a cone with a diameter of 1000 yards at the base and                   a height
of 7(!0 feet.
    The shattered    fragments of the mountain travelled in two direc
tions.     The   main stream       went northwards,        spreading out       as    it
advanced,     overwhelming       a   number of villages and hamlets,              and
entirely damming up the Nagasegawa,              the chief feeder of Lake        Ina-
washiro.      The other stream took       a south-south-easterly direction over
the Hank     of Kushiga-mine        and down the valley of the Biwasawa
towards the village of Mine, part of which was swept away.                      This
may be called the Mine         stream.       The eruption was due simply to
an explosion of steam,       no    lava or pumice being ejected, and the
so-called   "mud" which        spread over the       country was simply            the
matter which had formed the mountain, more or less moistened by
condensed steam and by water which had existed in the mountain,
but most of it was certainly not wet enough to deserve the name of
mud.      The scattered     mate-rials   may be described      as being for the

most part earthy,          mixed      with    stoues  of all sizes    ;   but at certain
places, mostly near         the crater, there were great piles of large blocks
of stone almost free         from earth.        This  was specially the case at the
X    Jl  corner of the      crater, where the crater-wall showed a magnifi
cent section      of beds of lava intercalated with layers of scoriaceous
material,     lying uueonformably           on each other.
     The manner      in which       the fragments of       Kobandai travelled out
wards resembled          closely the rush of water from          a  reservoir on a hill
when the       embankment has burst.              The stream followed, as a whole,
the line of least      resistance, but after descending           a  considerable way,
and     having     acquired      a very high      speed, part of      it flowed up hill
a^'ain,   and where,      in descending the valley, any mountain spur                      met
it at a sharp      angle, it rushed up the hill side in sume cases                        to a
height of as      much as 120 or 150 feet above              the general          level.    In
une place      the  torrent    passed    over a col about 200           feet high.         The
average     velocity is given by Sekiya as 46 miles an hour.                          In   one
 respect    this earth-torrent         behaved     differently    from       a    torrent    of
 water, viz.,    in the way in which, owing to internal friction, it came
 suddenly      to rest as if it had all at once been solidilied.               This is very
 marked m the case           of the Mine stream, which ended in                a  bank with
 a nearly    vertical face just above the village.
      In addition     to the damage done by the earth-torrents,                  the   forests
  all round,     except where sheltered by hills,              were      almost entirely
  destroyed      by the eruption.        -  Most   of the trees were           uprooted or
  broken off, and       the few that remained          had not only every leaf and
  twig removed,       but    even the whole of the bark was stripped off from
  them on the side        facing Kobandai.          This destruction of           the forests
  was ascribed      to a gust of wind          caused   by the eruption.            That the
  sudden    liberation of a great volume of steam must have given rise to
  a strong    air blast is undoubted, but that all the observed effects could
  liave been     produced by such        a   blast seems highly improbable.               This
  was one     of the points which          I  took up when      I   visited I5andai«m,
  in May last,      in company with Dr C. G. Knott.                      We examined          a
  number of the stumps           left standing, and found that in every case the
   trunk    on the side facing Kobandai              was pitted with           holes    of all
   sizes,  evidently    caused      by the impact of stones.              In     some    cases
   stones   of considerable      size were found imbedded in the wood.                    This
    indicated    pretty    clearly,   that the     damage    to   the     trees had       been

caused largely by what may be described                  as a  nearly horizontal      hail
storm of small stones.            Some     idea of the density of this storm           was
obtained by counting            the number        of marks on        a   measured    area..
This    was found to be from "250 to 300 per square foot, and                    it mustt.
be remembered          that most of these were probably made after                     the
bark had been removed by the first part of the storm.                       At a distance
of   3  miles from     the crater the        bark had been stripped from onl^-
very young trees, but the marks of blows could easily be seen on the
bark of all the trees.
    In following       the earth-torrent        from     Mine    up the      bed  of   the
Biwasawa,       I  was immediately          struck     by the extraordinary        effects
produced      by erosion     in the short space of ten months which                   had
elapsed since the eruption.             The Biwasawa is only            a  small stream,
and yet in these ten months it had carved                      out  a   valley which    at
one place      was,   by actual measurement,             80   feet deep and 80        feet
wide at      the top, and at           other    places,    where    measurement       was
impracticable, was by estimation little short of 150 feet deep.                         It
must be remembered,           too, that this one cutting           does not represent
nearly the whole of the work done by the stream, which had                             not
flowed along the same channel all the time.                   Had the stream flowed
quietly along       its channel for the whole              of the ten months,        it is
probable that it could not have made nearly                  so deep a    cutting, but it
was evident that much of the work had been done by a succession                         of
floods.      In   one place, for instance,         a lake had been formed         which,
after reaching      a large size,   had burst through the embankment which
held it back, and the water descended the valley with an impetuous
rush,    carrying     even   stones     of   a  considerable      size   along with     it.
In other       cases     landslips     had     blocked      the channel at        various
points     for some       time,    and     during     the    winter    snow-slides    had
also aided in forming          temporary dams.            Even at the end of May
the    stream    was    spanned      at several     places   by snow bridges.         The
material through which this cutting was made was, of course,                         very
soft, and in many places         it had been     reduced almost to the consistency
of mud, for all the small tributary streams                 had been blocked by the
earth-torrent, and the water was taken up                     as  by a sponge by the
mixture of loose earth and stones.                 The photograph reproduced in
the Plate shows          some     of   the   main features       of the erosion but,
unfortunately, the heavy             mists which hung about the hills, lifting

only for a few             minutes at long intervals, made it impossible to get
really good views.                 The great V-shaped cutting               is,   however, clearly
seen, and        it   should be noted that, judging                 from photographs taken
soon after the             eruption, and from the descriptions given by visitors,
this cutting          is   entirely due to erosion.
     The minor             details of the water action were no less interesting.
The        loose     debris        was, as has been mentioned, mixed with large
blocks         of    stone.        One of     these,     distant some              miles from the
crater,     measured          about 18 feet by 13 feet by 13 feet, and still larger
blocks were met                with higher         up.     Now when the             water      had     cut
down       to   such    a   block    it    behaved in one of several              ways.        In    some
jilaces,       where    the eroded channel was wider than the block, passages
for the water were                 cut round      one or both ends, and the block                    itself
gradually sank              down      as    the material on which            it     was     supported
was    cut away.              In    some     cases, where the block was long enough
to bridge           the channel,       a    tunnel had been made under                    it   through
which ail the           water passed.             In other   cases waterfalls      of considerable
height had been               formed by such blocks.                In    these    cases the large
                                                             by
block was protected                 on its upper side        a      number of smaller stones,
which prevented                erosion from taking place behind it.                       The conse
quence         of    this was that the bed of the stream                     for some distance
back became            nearly horizontal, and the carrying power of the water
was greatly            decreased,      thus tending to make the falls permanent.
It   is   not to be         supposed that they will be really permanent,                            as the
blocks         will gradually be undermined by the water falling over them,
bat their        existence         at present illustrates the way in which differences
in
      slope     in    the bed of       a    torrent may have been brought about by
obstacles        which have long since been removed.                       As     seen from above,
there       were       three main           lines of     erosion,    but that along the old
bed       of   the     Biwasawa was by far the most prominent.                              In addi
tion to these              principal       channels      there were       numberless tributary
channels,            reproducing        in miniature all the details of mountain
sculpture.
      In   a     few       years    the materials         forming        the earth-stream             will
consolidate          into what will probably be classed as                  a     volcanic breccia,
 and erosion           will   go on much less rapidly.                   The consolidation             has
 indeed        already begun, and            it   was interesting to notice how             a   sort of
 laterite       was    forming        out of the more ferruginous materials,                        which

were     in   parts    plentiful.      Vegetation, too, will before long help                  to
protect the surface, but at the time of my visit the only traces                               cf
this that could be found were                    a   small fern and        a   small plant     of
lichen on the warm ground close to                       a   nearly extinct fumarole           in.
the crater itself.
     In  and near the crater           weathering showed             itself in other forms.
Immediately after the eruption the walls of the crater were nearly
vertical, rising in some parts to                   a  height of over 1600 feet above
the crater floor.          In  the more rocky parts            this has not been greatly
changed,         but elsewhere,        through        the    action of      rain   and    frost,
constant landslips           have    been     taking place, and the precipices are
now no longer vertical, but are for the most part covered with, a
talus lying at the angle                 of repose.         Again, the rugged         "conical
mounds," of which hundreds were spread over the crater and the
main earth-stream,             forming       a    most     conspicuous feature          in   the
early photographs,            are now smoothed               and   rounded to an extent
almost      inconceivable in        so    short    a time.      Another      striking   feature
is the rapidity with which many of the rocks                        lying    about the crater
are crumbling down.              These      have      been subjected to the action             of
steam      and acid       vapours     in the heart of the mountain, by which
almost       all    the   constituents        except      silica  have      been    removed.*
When        exposed       to   the   air these         blocks    quickly      fall  to   pieces,
spherical        flakes   which soon        fall into sand peeling off them with
great ease.
     It is worth considering to what extent the gradual decomposition
of the      rock      brought     about     the final catastrophe.             The mountain
was,    as    it   were,    bound together           by   a   number of sheets of lava,
which made it strong enough to resist the steam pressure                               beneath.
During       the     past ten centuries        these lava beds         have   been gradually
decomposed           along   certain    lines,    and    at length a time came when
they were          no longer able          to    resist the steam pressure,            and the
mountain          was    blown     to   pieces.        May not this, rather than             the
sudden       development         of    a   large      quantity    of     steam,    as   usually
supposed,        be the true history of the eruption              1

                On Evolution and Man's Place in Nature.
                        By Professor Calderwood.
                                         (Read January 27, 1890.)
      My aim in this paper will be to present                          as    concisely as possible
the    problems involved                in Man's Place in Nature,                 and    to consider
briefly     how      far an evolution theory contributes                        towards    the solu
tion of these            problems.
      Needful preliminaries can be disposed of briefly.                             We    are agreed
that       evolution       is   "a    change     from an indefinite, incoherent homo
geneity         to   a   definite, coherent           heterogeneity,          through continuous
differentiations           and integrations."              We are agreed that this process
is    to   be   taken as applicable in the history of matter and motion,
and afterwards                in the history of            organised        existence,   raising the
 whole      problem of biology.                 We do not require here to linger over
 the   transition from the one to the other,                    as   all    requirements     are met
  by   accepting         life   and its laws as facts, and acquiescing                   in Darwin's
 hypothesis          of       one    or more       primordial        germs.       Next,     we     take
 Darwin's laws as applicable in the history of organism.                                   These     are
 briefly    — (1) struggle for              with survival of the fittest; (2)

                                           ;
 adaptations.           We do not need to raise the debate between Darwin's
 view      and Weismann's              as to hereditary transmission, with                   its two
 fold bearing,           as     it   concerns     mode      of transmission and the time

needful for securing results.             Granting,     as a   hypothesis, biological
evolution under the conditions stated, with reservation                       of all  the
open problems         concerned    with the history of evolution, the way               is
clear for considering how this theory of evolution stands                      related to
man's place in nature.
   While discussing         the question from the standpoint of evolution,
we   must accept        Herbert     Spencer's      view    as  correct,   which     takes
evolution of existence as a whole            as  indicating the true range of the
problem     raised.     " Evolution     becomes not one in principle only,            but
one  in fact," implying "one evolution going on everywhere after the
same manner."          Further, we take it as beyond question that man
belongs to Nature, and in respect of his whole being comes                        within
the scope of science.           An evolution theory must include                 man,  or
acknowledge that it is not          a  theory of existence        as a whole.        The
position of the theory and of all scientific observers                    devoted to    it
is clear.     Every     piece   of scientific work, whether concerned with
structure of organism,         with functional activity, with visible adapta
tions of organism,         or with manifestations of animal intelligence, is
an essential contribution towards             solution of our problem.            On the
other hand, everything which tends to clear up the specialties                         of
human life, whether concerned with the structure and functions of
human organism,          or   with   the activities of human            intelligence as
these   are concerned         with  the    attainment of scientific knowledge
and the government of conduct,               is a definite contribution          towards
the scientific conclusion we seek to reach.                The outstanding problem
is this, — What      is man's place in nature1!
   Scientific inquiry advances towards this problem along the path
way of biological research, always making account                    of the common
characteristics     of life.    The common condition of organic existence,
from the lowest form to the highest, is the sensori-motor                          nerve-
system.      The main question is therefore definitely shaped,               — What     is
a sensori-motor      system    equal   to  ]    How    much     can be scientifically
made out as       lying within range            of such     a system      when highly
differentiated      and co-ordinated          in an     elaborate    nerve-centre,     or
series of nerve-centres,        liable to modification in the history of its
activity  ?    According to the answer            to this inquiry is the advance
made towards including man             within     a science   of nature.
   The laws of      a sensori-motor      system, as     it provides for    the activity

of life, are well defined.           In   accordance     with   these every organised
being is placed       in vital relation with its environment; it              is sensitive
to contact,      it is capable of receiving senBory impression, and of
responding      to   it in action.        This    may   be represented       in simplest
f jrm thus    : —

                                                  Environment.
    Starting with this simple provision, research                  is continued along
the line   of increasing complexity in structure, until we find Special
Senses,    with special terminal         organs     providing for definite modifica
tions   of the sense of touch, while the elaborate                   system      of nerve-
fibres is  correlated in a nerve-centre            of proportionate complexity.
    We come          within the region of difficulty            and debate       when   we
reach    the higher         orders of animal life, classifying           these together
 as  we may         do   in   accordance     with homologies in structure              and
 function.        Within this group        we may include with man, our higher
 domesticated         animals, the cat, dog, and            horse,   and besides,      the
 monkey and ape.
    We    are   thus brought directly upoij the question of animal intelli
 gence,   with all the difficulties           of observation connected            with   it.
  Here at least we have definite evidence              of intelligence, for which it
 is needful      to account.        And this problem is far from           easy, in view
  of the forms of        life only   a little   lower.    A   tendency has appeared
 to seek    abatement         of this puzzle      by the hypothesis that mind is
 present from       the first movements of life.          There is extreme difficulty
 in interpreting such a suggestion,               as  we recognise     in representing
  mind-manifestation         in  a gnat, in   a  worm, or in     a  mollusc.      Besides,
 the   hypothesis         virtually   abandons       the scientific     conception       of
 evolution, giving up the attempt to demonstrate                   that the appearance
 of intelligence       is scientifically     explained     through    elaboration and
                                                            is held that " psychic

action is the constant attendant of vital                           action,    and is the            true
explanation of                  it,   we transform the theory of existence                so     as to
represent     it      as   a    single life history, unfolding itself more fully as the
ages   roll on, — moving through                      matter, and next through          spirit, back
to    the    Idea,         as       Hegel represents.        But the scientific conception
makes intelligence                    a   later type of being, evolved in the history of
organic advance.                      In this light    we read the theory of evolution.
     We are therefore required to concentrate                       attention on the classifi
cation of the higher animals already given,                         so as to trace the         appear
ance of intelligence                      in our world's history.         As     we     contemplate
these higher animals, first                    in their relation     to lower orders           of life,
and next in their relation to man,                        it   seems plain that we            have        to
deal with three                 sets of facts,    — sensori-motor activity in           the    simpler
organic forms;                  a     simpler or lower order of intelligence,             as    in    the
dog;        and   a    higher intelligence, in possession                  of man.        It would
seem that no scheme of natural history can meet requirements,                                        ifit
fail to make account of these three stages of life, or three distinct
sets of facts.
     The recognition of this sufficiently clears the path, carrying                                   us
forward to the highest form of the problem,                           concerning man's place
in   nature, without our being entangled                       and delayed with the question
concerning animal intelligence.                         Our own intelligence, as the better
known to us and the more easily studied, can supply the essential
phases of this problem, and can be discussed                              without       prejudice      to
the    intervening                and lower type of intelligence.                 The    problem       is
clear and definite, — How can sensori-motor action evolve                                a     rational
activity?          Or, taking the problem, in the first instance, on the side
of intelligence alone,                    — How   can nerve sensibility provide for evolu
tion of intelligence?                      That this   has been matter of actual history                  is
fast becoming              the traditional belief of thorough-going                   evolutionists.
Scientific tests, therefore,                   need to lie applied        with    exactness       here,
seeking for facts and their interpretation.
     Given        a    highly-developed               organism,    with   large      adaptation       to

problem       is   certainly not an easy one, though the popular scientific
faith shows            no sign of misgiving.                   Accepting all the conditions           as
laid down by the evolutionist, there still seems                           a   set    of difficulties

senting      to ourselves what feeling                    is,   as    it   appears     in the life of         a
snail or     of   a   fish   ;   but we are at least clear that there                          is    in both
forms     of life       sensibility to          contact,        and    such    sensibility as proves
adequate      to      direct motion.             We can similarly interpret sensibility
along     divergent lines, as in the action of the optic, auditory, and
olfactory nerves             in higher life-forms.                An animal           swerves as readily
under the influence                   of light, sound, or odour,                 as    under the whip          ;
there    seems no manifestation of intelligence in this, as there would
be none      in the          case of          man.     But intelligence                    something very
                                                                                   is is
                                          a
different from               sensory impression, whether                      it           concerned       with
the size     of an object, direction of                  a      sound, or the meaning of sign.
How can we explain the appearance of intelligent action                                        ?
  The functions                  of the best developed sensory system seem quite
inadequate to supply                  a   scientific conclusion here.                 Even    if   we add all
the advantages           connected with an exact knowledge of intelligent ex
perience,     as      in our own          consciousness,         our difficulties are not abated,
but seem to come                 out in more perplexing form.                          Take    a     series   of
sensory impressions, even according to the possibilities of the highest
organism,         and   it    seems impossible to find, either in their nature or
in   their relation,             anything       helpful      towards an explanation of the
rise    of   intelligence.            The sensory apparatus                   can do no more               than
supply impressions                ;   successive       impressions cannot even become                          ,1
series    without        the action of intelligence in comparing the impres
sions.       In    whatever direction we turn, with the best apparatus                                        in
           order, we find that intelligent comparison

be possible.            Impression must indeed follow contact.                                By    the same
necessity,        but with no provision for permanency of the first, or for
comparison of the two,                    a   new impression must result from renewed
contact.          The history of this            is    continual rise and fall of feeling, —
continual          flux, — but            no meaning.                Sensations         are    continually
arriving and continually                      passing away.             Even       to say      as    much     as

ledge organism cannot                   supply.         In    the history of three          successive
impressions,          No.    1   is displaced to make room for No. 2, and this in
turn disappears that No.                 3 may appear.              Impression occurs, and the
occurrence        ends.

     If   now we include motor                    activity       with sensibility,          so making
account of both sides of the sensori-motor                              system, a similar chasm
seems      to separate           functional        action from rational activity.                     The
movement              of the foot and the utterance                      of a word are actions
widely          apart.      To     express       thought        you must have              thought        to
express     ;    whereas,        to move       a muscle,           no more is required than a
sensori-motor            system,       stimulated by contact.               The problem         is how
to    account          scientifically, first, for             action    provided      for by         nerve
stimuli     ;    and, second, for action provided for by intelligence as its
necessary condition.                   We     seem hardly ready eveu yet for grappling
effectively           with this problem.                A     moderate     selection       of passages
 from scientific works of the day would demonstrate                                    that we have
 not reached a recognised                 technical definition of "voluntary action."
 Perhaps this can be accounted                          for    in   a   satisfactory way        by the
 present position of science; but as long as this want of exact definition
 continues,        the leading problem              of our age must be obscure                   and      ill
 understood.             What we need             is,   to define       with scientific precision
 the difference             between      rational       conduct and motor                activity,   — the
 contrast        which       the       popular    mind         sees     between     movement           and
 conduct,        as   when we speak of             a    man's       gait as peculiar, but say of
 his "conduct" that                it    is   wrong.          An    immense       distance     separates
 these two.              Within this          space lies some of the most serious per
 plexities the hypothesis of evolution has to encounter.                                   What      is   yet
 to be explained            is   that which Aristotle signalised               as   "deliberate pre

possible    consequences.
    A  reference to the simple diagram already used                     will illustrate our

    The functions of the sensori-motor system                   are so well known          as
to  help discrimination here.                The interaction of sensory and motor
 nerves, under external stimulus alone, gives                  reflex action.       To this
 mu9t be added       the phenomena of inhibition,— the restraints which
 a sensory system      is capable of placing on its own activity.                  Next,  Ave
 reckon the action of sense in stimulating                  appetite,    which brooks no
 hindrance, marking          one type of          "the struggle for existence," of
 which Darwin has discoursed                with   fulness.
     What we need to account for is the immense                        advance     occurring
 in life when      intelligence        interposes     to   check impulse,         and, after
 carrying through a course of reflection,                orginates    a  higher motive, or
 changes the     passion into actual motive.               We need not here include
 the  still greater     complexity          of action      when moral considerations
 are introduced.        We restrict the         reference to self-interest.
    The intervention         of intelligence in the determination of action
is an occurrence        so different from all that can be traced, even by
faintest     anticipation,     in    lowest orders of life, that it involves                 a
reversal of the law on which the hypothesis of evolution                           depends.
Keeping in view here the difference                  between   the lower unintelligent
animals and the higher            intelligent      animals, it holds true for all of
them,     that the law of          pleasure      and    pain   rules their life.       It   is
dominant      in the lower      as    in the higher      ;  but in the higher, passion

  78             Proceedings          of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                  [se
 is fiercest,  just  as   the muscular power is greatest,              and   the struggle
 for gratification is most violent.
    When intelligence           is   in the   ascendant    in life, the whole position
 is changed,      even     to    the extent of changing the law of activity.
 We have to adapt our theory to this transformation, and in conse
 quence the conception of evolution is placed                  in the midst of a host
 of perplexities.        The main question is           this, — How     can evolution    of
 organism account for life capahle                 of rational self-direction?       Inhi
 bition    may supply suggestions               here,   but these avail only on the
 side of restraint     ;  we need here to account for a power which places
 the whole life under a new order of government.                      When we include
 social   relations, there are rival interests,             consequent competitions,
 and new place and form for progress.                     All  these   are available    for
 analogies.      But the main puzzle is             untouched, — out of organism to
 evolve the intelligence which first directs its own activity, and timt
 directs organic activity.
    This    order  — first     intelligent      action, second      organic action — is
 essential   to the case.         No theory      meets the requirements which does
not undertake to explain this priority.                  Here, in contrast with what
is observed     in lower types of life, both unintelligent and intelligent,
reflection shapes the purpose              which the agent afterwards makes an
effort to  fulfil    This     is something entirely new         in  the  activity of life  ;
this presents the hardest problem in natural history.
    What is meant by Intelligence                 as concerned    with action may be
best indicated by pointing               out what it does, for thus we command
the    facts  and their history.              Passion rises in man just as in the
animals.      There is not anything               distinctive here.       But in human
life, the passion       is restrained, reflection begins,           and is prosecuted,
while restraint over passion is maintained.                   Tiiere is comparison of
consequences,      contrast of the good and the better,                  formation of a
conception,      and     next of       a definite purpose, and only then is            the
sensori-motor system brought into action in relation to its environ
ment.      Whether the passion              is then gratified,     or is not gratified,
does    not   affect    our problem.            In either    case, the whole      course
uf reflective     procedure        is carried through.        The evolution       of the
power to accomplish this constitutes the great perplexity.                     .How can
we, through       continuous action of the senses, reach the power we
name Intellect,      and that power over intellectual action which we                  see

to be implied        in   the ordinary conditions         of its exercise.   It does   not
seem to help us              to suggest,     as Professor      Bain does, that feeling
has an intellectual            side and a volitional, for feeling neither thinks
nor wills.         What         Cyples    has well described as "congruent            con
                                                                   " does not

np     to the facts         to be explained.         When      we  set   receptivity and
activity in contrast, we can agree                with Mr Romanes in naming            the
contrasts      retepts       and concepts     ;  but the laws of the recepts,           as
these are on the             way to the concepts, imply something more than
the "congruent            consecutive activity        of associated sense-apj>aratus."
It  does not appear            that sense-apparatus      is able to evolve the power
which takes         control of human activity in its ordinary but distinctive
phases.
    There      is   still    greater     complexity    of procedure     behind all this,
 when we include             a  representation of the higher government which
 we name moral           life,     I   have not introduced this      ; there is not room
 for doing       so   in this      paper,   and there is already ample mateiial
 before    the   Society for discussion.
    Having regard to the conciseness                of statement requisite in such        a
 paper as this,       I  have endeavoured to supply illustrations             sufficiently
 varied to admit          of test in course of subsequent debate.

    The vast organic              accumulations known           as coral reefs    are, un
 doubtedly,        among the most striking            phenomena of tropical oceanic

early voyagers      into the    seas   of equatorial regions of the           ocean.
Questions connected with the peculiar form, the structure,                       the
origin, and the distribution of these. great natural productions have,
from the very outset, puzzled         and interested all those who           delight
in the study of natural things.            In this communication        we  propose
to point out and discuss some of the more general                    phenomena     of
oceanic deposits,    with special reference to the functions of corals           anil
other lime-secreting organisms,          and the accumulation of their deatl
shells and skeletons on the' floor of the great oceans.
    Coral reefs are developed        in   greatest   perfection in those ocean
waters where the temperature            is highest and the annual range            is
least.    It  may   he said   that reefs are never met with where                the
temperature     of the surface     water, at any time of the year, sinks
below 70° Fahr., and where            the    annual range of temperature           is
greater    than 12° Fahr.        Bermuda, which is the coral island the
farthest removed from the equator,* and one or two other outlying
reefs, may be,    in  a sense,  exceptions to this statement,          for in these
exceptional cases the temperature          of the ocean water appears occasion
ally to fall to 66° or 64° Fahr., and there is             a   wider annual range
than    12°   Fahr.    This condition of high           temperature     with small
range in the temperature       of the water is only to' be met with in the
middle and western portions of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and
the   central parts    of the Indian Ocean          ;  consequently,     coral reefs
 flourish along the eastern shores of the continents where                the coasts
are bathed by currents of pure oceanic water coming directly from the
open sea, while, on the other hand, they are absent along the western
shores of the continents where            the   water is colder and the annual
 range is very much greater      — for instance, off the western coasts of
 America     and Africa.      The " Challenger " observations have also
 shown that the layers       of warm surface          waters    are much     thicker
 towards the western parts of the great oceans               ;  consequently, reef-
 forming organisms       flourish at     a greater    depth     along the    eastern
 shores of the continents than in positions further                to the eastward
 in the open ocean, where the warm layer of water                 — over  70° Fahr.
 — is  much    thinner.     Throughout        the temperate      and  polar regions
 there  are no coral reefs.       This     is all the more      remarkable, seeing
 that organisms      belonging to the same orders,             families, and    even

genera      as those       which build up coral            reefs      flourish    throughout
 colder, and       even in polar, seas. In                these      colder seas the re
 presentatives of the           reef-builders     either do not secrete carbonate
of lime in their body-walls,             or if  they do so, the shells or skeletons
are much        less massive than         in tropical     waters.        An attentive          ex
amination       of the animals         procured by the dredge               and trawl from
all depths shows that in descending into deeper water in equatorial
regions the amount             of  carbonate     of lime     secreted       by the animals
living on the sea bottom becomes less with increasing depth, aud
all the calcareous structures of the organisms become less massive
with the descent into the deeper and colder water of the abysmal
regions.       This remark does not, of course, apply to the shells and
skeletons       of surface      organisms     which have           fallen to the        bottom
from the surface waters.
     Still   another     illustration    of the same fact is furnished by the
 study of the pelagic            organisms     collected in the surface, and sub
 surface waters by means             of the tow-nets.          In the     warmest       tropical
 waters      there     are   numerous       species    of   Pteropoda,          Heteropoda,
 Gasteropoda, Foraminifera,             and Coccospheres             and Rhabdospheres
  (calcareous    Alg£e), which lead a purely pelagic existence, and secrete
 carbonate      of lime shells.         Mr Murray       estimates        from his tow-net
 experiments that at least 16 tons of carbonate                     of lime exists in this
 form at any moment of time                 in  a mass      of tropical oceanic water
 one square      mile in extent by 100 fathoms in depth.*                    The number of
  species and     individuals of these lime-secreting organisms decreases,
  and the shells        become     less   massive,    with      a wider removal             from
  the equator      and an approach           to the colder water of the poles,
 till we   find in the surface         waters   of the polar regions             only one or
 two thin-shelled        Pteropods, and one, or at most two, dwarfed species
 of pelagic    foraminifera.         It  would appear then that organisms,                   as a
 whole     or individually,        are able to, and        actually do, secrete more
 lime   in regions where there is a uniformly high temperature                            of the
 ocean water        than in those regions          where     there      are great seasonal
 fluctuations of temperature,             or where      there       is a uniformly            low
 temperature       of the water, as in the polar regions and in the deep                      sea.
 In temperate        seas   more    carbonate    of lime      is secreted in the warm

    An examination           of   the    deep-sea       deposits     collected      by    the
"Challenger"      and other expeditions in all oceans shows that, after                   the
death of the pelagic organisms               above     referred    to, their calcareous
shells are rained down on the ocean's bed, and there make up the
larger part of the deposits             known       as Pteropod       and Globigerina
oozes, as well as a very considerable part of nearly all other marine
deposits.     If  we take the samples            of deep-sea deposits collected            by
the "Challenger" as a guide, the average percentage of carbonate of
lime in the whole of the deposits covering the floor of the ocean is
 36-83, and of this carbonate           of lime, it is estimated that fully 90 per
 cent, is derived from the remains of pelagic organisms                  that have fallen
 from the surface         waters,   the remainder of the carbonate                  of lime
 having been secreted by organisms                 that live on or attached to the
 bottom.     If   coral muds and           sands,     together     with     Pteropod and
 Globigerina     oozes, be considered,          it is estimated      that these contain
 an average     percentage       of 7G-44 of carbonate             of lime, and        cover
 about 51,859,400           square    miles of the sea bottom.                  We have

   are to be found even           -within the Arctic circle in the course of the

  area of the       various kinds of deposits, with the average depth, and
  average    percentage       of carbonate of lime in          each.
     One of the       most remarkable facts discovered by the                " Challenger "
  expedition       is    that,     although        the dead     shells   of these     pelagic
  organisms      are    rained      down on the sea bottom, and in shallower
  depths     accumulate           so   as    to    form    calcareous    deposits     of   im
 mense extent,           still, in other contiguous but               deeper   areas,    these
shells    do    not accumulate             on    the bottom, being wholly          removed
either while         falling through the water or shortly after reaching the
ocean's floor.          The pelagic organisms are as abundant in the surface
waters over         the one area as over the other, the only apparent differ
ence    in the        conditions       being one of depth.             In the shallowest
deposits       of the open           sea,  shells representative of nearly all the
lime-secreting          surface organisms are to be found in the deposits.
With       increasing         depth the more            delicate   ones    disappear from
the bottom          till, in    1 800    or 2000 fathoms, it is rare to find more
 than    traces of Heteropod,              Pteropod, or the more delicate             pelagic
 Foraminifera,          shells     in the       deposits,    while these     same   delicate
 shells   occasionally         make up      fully one-half of the       carbonate    of lime
 that is present        in depths of 700 or 1000 fathoms.                Again, in the still
 greater     depths       of 3000 and 4000 fathoms and deeper,                     the For
 aminifera, Coccoliths, and Khabdoliths                    are either wholly removed,         or
 are  represented         only by the broken fragments of                 the thickest and
 most     compact         shells,     like    Pulvinulina        menardii,     Spheeroidina
  dehiscent, or Globigerina             eonglobata.        This gradual     decrease   in the
 quantity of carbonate             of lime in the deposits with increasing depth
 is well     illustrated       in the following          table, showing     the percentage
 of   lime      in    the samples          of deep-sea       deposits   collected by        the

    The fourteen samples              under 500 fathoms are chiefly coral muds

a   considerable quantity              of mineral      particles from continents            or
volcanic islands.            In all the depths       greater    than 1000 fathoms the
 carbonate       of lime       is mostly      derived from         the shells of pelagic
organisms that have fallen from the surface waters, and it                             will be
 noticed      that these        wholly disappear          from      the greater        depths.
 These      figures     are    derived     from    a   study     of the       " Challenger "
 deposits      alone,    but they are confirmed, as to the general                      result,
 by an       examination          of   the   deposits    collected        by the     U.S.SS.

 the ships of the Telegraph Construction and Silvertown                           Companies,
 and other ships.             One other peculiarity           as to the distribution         of
 carbonate       of lime organisms           on the ocean's floor may be noted.
 Where these calcareous              shells are most abundant on the surface, as
 in   the tropics, the remains of the dead shells are as a rule found at
 greater     depths on the bottom than in temperate                        or polar regions,
 where     they are relatively much less abundant                  in the    surface waters.
     In his     paper on the Origin of Coral lieefs, published many years
 ago,   Mr Murray pointed out that                 sea water,     rushing in and out of
 the lagoon       twice in the twenty-four           hours,    would take up and carry
 away large quantities of the carbonate of lime which, in the form of
 coral sand         and    mud,    covers    the bottom of these shallow basins.
 Just    as the surface       shells are dissolved by falling through the layers
 of ocean water, so in this            case the dead     coral fragments are dissolved
 by the      sea     water that continually          passes over them; in this             way
  chiefly he accounted for the formation of lagoons in atolls and barrier
  reefs.

     Dunn;? the        past     few years a large number of experiments have
been carried on at           the Scottish Marine Station for Scientific Research,
with the view of               throwing      some additional        light on the oceanic
phenomena referred to               in the preceding       paragraphs,    in so far as these
relate to the       secretion and solution of carbonate               of lime under vary

lime     by organisms          will    be considered in the first place, and after
wards those        treating of the solution of the dead carbonate of lime
shells and      skeletons         will  be discussed.
     A    detailed account            of some of the experiments             will show    the
nature of the          investigations,       and indicate the results that have been
obtained       in so far as they bear on the subject with which we are
here dealing.
     Experiment           I. A    number of hens that were laying eggs regularly
were placed           in a wooden building where they could not pick up
 substances       containing lime salts, except such as were supplied with
 their food.         At first      they were not given any lime with their food,
 and     their   drink was distilled            water ;   in a few days they laid eggs
 with only         a membranous             covering.       Sulphate of lime was then
 given     with the food, and in the course of a few days they commenced

  sulphate      of   lime      was stopped,      the eggs again became membranous
  and ahelless.            In this way it      was shown that hens were able to pro
  vide their       eggs       with the usual       carbonate     of lime shells from the
   silicate,  sulphate, nitrate, phosphate, and carbonate of lime that was
  administered          with their food          Further, it was found that they could
   not make use           of the magnesium and strontium              salts for the purpose
   of forming       shells for their eggs.*           It is   believed that in the case of
   the various       lime salts the lime passes through the blood in the form
   of phosphate          to the point of secretion,          where   it is deposited   as car
   bonate of     lime.
       Experiment           II. An    artificial sea water was prepared,         from which
   carbonate       of      lime was rigidly excluded, and in this some living
    wibs were placed                They lived for many months, and after ecdysis
    produced      the usual exo-skeleton of carbonate of lime from the lime
    salts,  other than carbonate,            present   in the   water,  f

   Experiment       III.   An artificial    sea   water similar    to    the above
(II.), absolutely     free from carbonate        of lime, was neutral at         first,
but after the introduction          of living crabs became at first          slightly
acid, and then, after a time, distinctly          alkaline   in character.       This
was found to be duo to uric acid,             urea,   and other effete products
thrown into the water by the crabs, and to their subsequent                   decom
position, with the formation of carbonate of ammonia, and ultimately
of carbonate of lime.          In  one of the tanks the     alkalinity     was  equal
to the production of about 45 36 grammes                 of carbonate of lime —
this representing the amount of that body formed in twelve months
through the agency          of four small      crabs,   weighing    in all about
90-72     grammes,     and whoso       exo-skeletons contained         only    about
5184     grammes     of carbonate of lime.
   Experiment      IV.    The following     experiments were conducted           with
the view of throwing some light on the above changes.                  Three litres
of   sea  water and 750 c.c. of urine were mixed and kept exposed                   to
the air at a temperature         ranging from 60° to 80° Fahr.            'What was
lost by evaporation was made up by the addition                   of pure water.
This solution     was at iirst acid    ; after  a  few days it became neutral,
and later, as decomposition of the urine advanced, it became strongly
alkaline.     On heating      a portion of the solution, ammonia was given
off,   so that the     alkalinity   was evidently due       to the formation        of
ammonia.        After    seven    days   a  bulky llocculent precipitate was
thrown down, which on analysis consisted               of organic matter, double
phosphate     of magnesia and ammonia, together with a small quantity
of carbonate      of lime,   as  shown by the following analysis         : —

 water,     principally as more or less insoluble crystalline carbonate.
      Esjieriment             V. An experiment           was made with            a    solution of sulphate
 of   lime of the same                  strength as present in               sea water.         500 c.c of

 precipitate          was collected, and was               found       to contain 51 per cent, of
 carbonate           of lime.           This,   after adding           the    carbonate        of lime in
 solution        in the filtrate, accounted                    for all the lime present               in the
 original      solution of sulphate of lime made use of.
      Experiment              VL In      this experiment an attempt was made to imitate
 the conditions               occurring in nature          as   nearly as possible.            Nine small

                                        1    ounces, were placed         in       a    shallow glass vessel
 containing           2    litres of ordinary sea water, and were fed ou mussel
 flesh.     The water was never renewed nor aerated, the effete matters
 passing       into it.            At   the end of fourteen days all the crabs had died,
and were removed.                        The water being then in                  a    putrid condition,    it
was     set aside             for about      three weeks at        a   temperature           ranging from
70°   to 80°          Fahr.         All    the conditions of the lust two experiments

      Experiment       VII.    We    obtained     the liquor from      a  number of
 living   oysters, and examined          it  before decomposition had begun.
     It  appeared to be a mixture of lymph             with unchanged     sea water ;
 the specific      gravity at 60° F. was          l-023,   the  amount of chlorine
 per litre was 17 5G grammes,            indicating    a considerable admixture      of
 fresh or river water.

              per litre.
     We   have thus an accumulation of lime (in excess over that present
 in   sea  water) amounting to 0'1889 grammes per litre, the greater
part of which is in the form of carbonate in solution, presumably
 in the amorphous or hydrated condition.
     Any doubts       as to   how this excess of carbonate of lime comes to be
present     is set at rest by the fact that the fresh and absolutely unde-
composed       liquor containing this excess of lime contains also (saline)
ammoniacal salts equal to 18 parts per million, or about sixty times
that present in any          sea waters    we have examined.
     Experiment        VIII. A       similar    experiment     was   made  with the
liquor taken from living mussels (from the mussel beds at Granton),
the results coinciding with those obtained in Ex. VII.*
    *
       Theoretically, urea plus two molecules            of water give carbonate    of
ammonia.        If, therefore, carbonate of ammonia be a stago in the formation of
urea, it is not unnatural to siqipo.se that, in shell-forming animals, the shell
formation may be the stage without any formation of urea. For special method
for the determination of saline ammonia in sea water, see page 101, Appendix.

     These   experiments show the alteration                 that is produced in the

arising from the decomposition of animal products, in presence                      of
the sulphate of lime of           sea water,   becomes    carbonate   of lime and
sulphate of ammonia.*             Thus the     ¦whole  of the lime salts in sea
water may, in these circumstances,            be changed    by this reaction into
carbonate,      and may in this way be presented to the coral and shell
builders in      a form suitable for their requirements.         The temperature
of the water is of great importance in this reaction.              In cold water,
of which the great bulk of the ocean consists, the              decomposition of
nitrogenous organic matter is greatly retarded,              whereas,   in tropical
surface     waters,    it proceeds    with  great  rapidity.     Here, then, we
have     probably tbe explanation          of the great     development of the
massive      structures    formed by lime-secreting organisms in the coral
reef regions,      which,   as has been    pointed out, are also the regions         of
highest and most uniform             temperature    in the ocean.      In the same
 way we may account for the great extension of lime-seereting pelagic
 organisms     in   the tropical surface currents that flow north and south
 from the equator.          Thus coral reef-builders and pelagic          organisms
may     not only benefit by the decomposition products arising from
their own eifete matters, but also from the undecomposed                nitrogenous
 matter carried to equatorial regions from the cold water               of the deep
 sea or   from polar regions
     The quantity of carbonate          of lime normally in      sea  water is ex
 ceedingly small, and the opinion hitherto held seems to have been
 that lime-secreting organisms          had  to pump enormous         quantities of

    t Bischof, Chan, and P/ii/s. Geol., vol. i. p. 180, says: — " In order to form
 a conception     of what testacea are capable of effecting by organic agency, I
 determined     the weight of ten oysters and their shells.    After they had been
 opened the enclosed sea water was, as far as possible, removed.       The weight of
 the shells varied from 2"78 to 7 '57 that of the oysters
    " No one can doubt that it was the carbonate of lime dissolved in the sea
 water which alone furnished the material for the formation of these shells.
    " If now we assume that the sea water contains

 and that the oysters are capable of deriving all their calcareous substance from
 the water by organic agency, it follows that the above number of oysters re
 quired for the formation of their shells 345 to 5S7 lbs., or 5'2 to 8 '9 cubic feet

much        more      probable        that the reactions indicated                       by the above
experiments           render the whole of the lime salts in the sea water, and
especially the         sulphate, available for the coral polype to construct their
massive structures.              In     higher animals, like hens, the carbonate of
lime is secreted          from the blood             ;    but in coral polype, in which there
is no true        circulatory    system, and where the animal is immersed in
the sea water,        it is most probable that the reaction above referred
to — the        formation of carbonate of ammonia — is in every way advan
tageous to these           lime-secreting           organisms, and facilitates the deposi
tion of carbonate            of lime by the protoplasm.                         In the   case   of all the
lower classes          of lime-secreting                 organisms this change             in the con
stitution of the           lime salts may take                 place       within the tissues of the
animals.          In the case of the oysters (Exp. VII.) the                             excess    of car
bonate      of lime observed            in the liquor or diluted lymph                      was clearly
due to the         decomposition of the sulphate of lime in the sea water by
carbonate         of ammonia           secreted          as such by the protoplasm                 of the
animal.
     The quantity           of salts in       a given volume of sea water varies                     with
the position           from which the              sample       is collected, and according as
the sahnity           is high or low          ;    but it has been shown, by hundreds
of analyses           from all parts of the                 ocean,         that the actual ratio        of
acids and bases            — that      is,   the ratio of the constituents of sea salts
—    is   constant        in waters from all regions and depths of the                             ocean,

indication     as to the nature of these internal             changes      is given     in
the above experiments,           dealing chiefly with the reactions              brought
about in      sea  water by the decomposition of the effete products
thrown into it by animals and by the decay of organic tissues.
Through the action of the carbonate of ammonia on the sulphate of
lime in the      sea water,   it is evident that      there  is a production         of a
largo    quantity of carbonate         of lime in a form easily available              for
lime-secreting organisms.            In   the   laboratory,     when carbonate          of
 ammonia     is added to sea water nine-tenths of the calcium                in solution
 is thrown out as carbonate of lime, while the magnesian                   salts remain
 in solution   ; so  that  if the reaction       above   indicated be that which
 takes   place   in the ocean, then to this circumstance              may be due the
 fact that carbonate of magnesia is almost wholly absent from recent
 coral reefs and deep-sea calcareous formations.                  The above experi
 ments appear clearly to show that the             alkalinity of     sea  water is due
 to the presence of carbonate of lime in solution              ;   for, in addition to
 the fact that this body is thrown                down from the decomposing
  solutions after these become alkaline, we find that when carbonate
  of lime is added to a neutral artificially-prepared sea water, absolutely
  free from carbonate      of lime, it at once gives the alkaline reaction
 common     to normal sea water.
      That the amount of the nitrogenous organic matter in                     a state of
  suspension    and solution in the ocean must be enormous, will appear
  evident when it is remembered            that the floor of the ocean through
  out its whole extent is covered with living animals, that the surface
  and sub-surface     waters and shallow depths off all coasts are crowded
  with plants and animals down to           a depth of several hundred fathoms,
  and   that the    " Challenger      "
                                         experiments have          shown      that some
  species of animals flourish       in all intermediate depths in           ocean water
  from the surface       down to the very bottom.                The waste products
  arising from the       functional      activity of these organisms,            and the
  nitrogenous organic products arising from the decomposition of their
  dead bodies, must work continual changes on the internal                       constitu
   tion of sea-water      salts,   varying     according to        their   amount, the
  temperature,     sunlight,     and    other conditions.         It  has been shown
  that ammoniacal       salts are to be found everywhere             in  the ocean, hut
   much more abundantly            in the warm tropical          waters    than in the
   polar seas — a result    due to the rapid decomposition of nitrogenous

organic matters at a       high temperature, and its retardation in colder
waters.      The ammonia of the air and all the substances carried into
the sea by the       drainage      from the land also effect changes in the
internal constitution         of the    sea   water    ; indeed, the peculiar pelagic
fauna and flora,     which     are met with in all regions of the ocean where
the ocean is affected       by river and        coast waters, are as much          in  rela
tion with the     internal constitution of the             sea-water salts as with the
lower    salinity   which prevails in            these    circumstances.        It  is well
known that organic             substances       in   the    presence    of alkaline and
earthy sulphates       become oxidised at the expense of the oxygen of
these salts,    with the production of carbonic acid and sulphuretted
hydrogen,*      which on oxidation produces sulphuric acid. The whole
of the organic carbon, which             it  has been pointed out is of enormous
amount,     must    apparently be oxidised into an equivalent amount of
carbonic     acid, and      further of sulphuric            acid.    The effects of this
reaction     are  likely to     be more       marked in the deeper           parts of the
ocean, where       all motions of the          sea   water must be extremely slow,
 and   where     consequently        the effete products tend to accumulate.
In   this way the larger amount of lime and carbonic acid and the
less amount        of oxygen in deeper waters are to                  be accounted       for.
 Xot    only so, but the very existence of such                       a   relatively lanre
 quantity of sulphate of lime               in   sea   water goes far to prove that
 this reaction        is continually         taking place,       seeing    that sulphuric
 acid   cannot     exist in a free        state    in the    presence    of carbonate       of
 lime.     Thus    it  is probable that the quantity of sulphate of lime in
 solution     in the     ocean is limited          only by the amount of organic
 decomposition         that takes place in ocean waters.                    On    the other
  hand,    if marine organisms procure the whole of their                     carbonate     of
 lime from the sulphate of lime by the reaction of the ammonkoal
 salts,  then the amonnt of lime that may be secreted                          from octan
  waters is likewise        limited    by the amount of organic matter under
  going   this oxidation process in the ocean.              +

     From          the foregoing discussion      it   appears evident that        in   the   various
reactions taking place continually                    in ocean waters there are special
conditions which are favourable to the secretion of carbonate of                                  lime
by organisms,            chief among these being a high and uniform tempera
ture of the water at all seasons of the year.
     If now wo          turn our attention to the solution of the dead carbonate
of lime shells and skeletons by the action of sea water it will, in                                like
manner, be found that the rate of this solution varies greatly accord
ing to the conditions in which these dead remains are exposed to                                    the
solvent power of the water.
     The tables at the end of this paper give some of the results of a
large number of experiments that have been conducted on the                                       solu
bility of          carbonate of lime in different states and in different samples
of sea water.                It   may   be pointed out that the normal amount                        of
carbonate            of lime dissolved in sea water is very small, especially
when compared                 with the large      amount of this substance                   that    is
continually being secreted from the                    sea   by organisms.            The amount
in ordinary   water (sp. gr. 1-026) is 0'12 grms. per litre.
                       sea                                    Sea
water may, however, take up 0 G49 grms. per litre of carbonate of
lime in the amorphous or hydrated condition.                         This solution           is   then
supersaturated,              and on being allowed to stand, the carbonate of lime
is thrown out of solution in the crystalline form, and after a time
the solution may contain less than is normally present in sea water.
It   has been found that sea water can hold in solution (at 80° F.)
for at least a week O'lG grms. per litre more than is normally pre
sent in        it,   and artificially     prepared      sea water can also hold              in solu
tion 0'2S grins, per litre for at least                  a   week, and         0T2     grms.      (the
normal amount in ordinary                  sea water)     for six weeks.
     It   thus seems that although sea water under certain conditions
may take up            a   considerable quantity of carbonate of lime in solution,
yet      it   is    unable        permanently   to retain     in solution         more       than    is
usually found to be present in                  sea water,    and   it   is   owing to this that

from the roadstead at Monte Video by the telegraph ship " Seine." It consists
of   amixture of fresh and salt water, witli a considerable amount of organic
matter which has decomposed tho sulphate, giving rise to      large amount of a
hydrosulphnric acid.

the amount      of carbonate of lime is so constantly low.                The reaction
between organic       matter and the sulphates              present  in  sea water, to
which we have       referred, tends       also to keep the amount of carbonate
of lime in solution       at about one-half        (0-12    grms.) of what it might
contain (0*28 grms.         per litre). This peculiarity of sea water, in
taking up a large amount of amorphous carbonate of lime and
throwing it out in the crystalline form accounts for the filling up of
the interstices of massive          corals with crystalline carbonate in coral
islands and other calcareous formations,                so that all traces may       ulti
mately be lost       of the original organic structure.
     Our experiments show that there is very great diversity as to the
 amount      of carbonate      of lime that will         pass into    solution in    sea-
 water from various calcareous structures              in a  given time.      As  a rule,
 the more definitely        crystalline    the substance       the less is    it soluble.
 Crystalline calcspar is less soluble than massive varieties of coral,
 and these again less so than the more porous varieties.                       To a cer
  tain extent, this variation         may be accounted         for by the amount of
  surface exposed       to the solvent action of the water, which is much
  greater    in porous coral than in        calcspar  ;  but  it is found that finely-
   powdered calcspar is less soluble than finely-powdered                 coral, and we
   have already noted that the amorphous or hydrated                       carbonate    of
   lime is much more soluble than any other form of the substance.
   In   shells and corals those layers which have been recently deposited
   by    the animals   are more    rapidly removed in solution than those of
    older date,   which have, in consequence, assumed a more crystalline
    structure.     The rate of solution is also much greater when the water
    is constantly renewed than when the same water remains in contact
    with   the coral, and the solution approaches          to saturation.    It appears,
    then, that those portions of a coral or shell that have been recently
    in direct life-connection     with     the organism are more           soluble than
    those portions which are older, and have consequently largely passed
    into the crystalline condition.
       In conducting      these various experiments          with carbonate of lime,
    we were      early led to suspect        that different samples of sea water
     possessed   very different solvent powers, and this was confirmed by
    special observations.       For   instance,   water taken last summer (1889)
    from the German Ocean, 30 miles outside the Island of May, had a
     very  distinct solvent power on the corals exposed to its action, while

water taken in January 1890 from the same spot, and having a
slightly lower specific gravity, exerted little or no solvent action                                              on
the same corals.             Those remarks also apply to waters taken from near
shore     at   North Berwick              and Granton         in the summer of 1889 and
January        1890.        The lower specific gravity of the winter waters may
be regarded           as, to some         extent, reducing the solvent power                               ;    but
this is more probably to be attributed                            to the absence of free car
bonic acid, that           is,   carbonic acid in excess of what               is    required to satu
rate the fret- base in the sea water as normal carbonate (CaCOs). To
test this point, carbonic acid was added to one of these winter
waters, but in quantity not sufficient to destroy its alkaline character.
Powdered         carbonate         of lime was then added                 to this water,              as       well
as to another portion of the water to which                              carbonic acid had not
been added, and both samples were allowed to remain under exactly
the same conditions for fourteen hours.                             It   was found at the end
of this time that the water to which no carbonic acid had been
added     had not taken up any of the carbonate                                of lime, while the
water to which carbonic acid had been added,                              under the conditions
above stated, had dissolved an appreciable amount.
   These results appear                to indicate that there             is   more carbonic acid
in summer than in the winter waters                     in our latitude, due probably
to the    increased          activity     of animal life, and although                     it    may be
insufficient     to form bicarbonate              with the free base present,                              such
waters have       a    distinctly        more   powerful action on carbonate                      of lime
structures, the greater                the quantity    of carbonic acid they contain,
and     especially so when the quantity                      is   more     than would form                        a
sesqui-carbonate.
   Mr Buchanan's observations                    on board the            "Challenger" showed
that the carbonic acid present                   in sea water,           over and above that
necessary      to form normal carbonate                 of lime, was subject to great
variations.*          In   a     few instances   it   was more than sufficient to form
fully   saturated      bicarbonate, but in the majority of cases                          it   fell    some
what short of that amount, supposing that this surplus carbonic
acid does really form              a   bicarbonate with the surplus base.                   In                 any
case    our experiments have shown that alkaline                               sea   water will                dis
solve up carbonate               of lime in addition         to what      it    already contains,
and that the rapidity with which                      this    is    effected        depends           on the

aesqui-carbonate           with the surplus             base.      It    also appears       that this
is a much         more effective agent            in the removal of             carbonate      of lime
shells than the           solvent power of        sea   water itself, although, as we have
already         shown, sea     water from which carbonic acid is                         absent       can
dissolve carbonate           of lime in addition to what it normally contains,
still     the    quantity    that can        be thus taken              up is relatively small.
Mr Buchanan's              observations       have also shown that carbonic acid                       is,
as    a   rule, more        abundant in bottom and intermediate                         waters       than
in    surface     waters, although          in   some places surface waters                 contain        a
very large        quantity,       as,   for instance,     among         the coral islands of the
lijis.       A   series    of experiments         have recently been conducted which
show that carbonated                waters under high pressure will take up more
carbonate        of lime than when           at the normal of atmospheric pressure.*
     These results          may         now be applied to the explanation                       of    the
removal          of carbonate of lime shells and structures from                              the deep
sea   dejKsits, and from the lagoons of coral islands.                                 The fact that
carbonic acid         is   more abundant in the deeper waters of the ocean                                 is
evidently connected               with    the respiration and decay of the organisms
that      live on the sea bottom, and with the decay of those that fall
down to the bottom from the                      surface of the sea.              The water that
fills the deeper hollows has also                  in its   passage to the equator passed
over      thousands of square miles of the sea floor covered with living
animals.          As this      deep water has a very slow motion and                           is     but
slowly renewed,              we would         expect       an accumulation              of carbonic
acid, and        a   deficiency of oxygen in these abysmal depths.
      When, therefore,         a    carbonate      of lime-secreting organism dies in
the surface          waters and the dead body commences                           to    fall towards
the bottom,           its shell    is   at once exposed to solution from the action
of    the sea        water and the carbonic acid,                 produced,       it    may    be, by
the     decomposition of its own body.                      If   the shell be an exceedingly
thin one, as          in the   case of Heteropods and                  some Pteropods,         it    may
be    wholly removed before reaching the bottom,                             at the depth of               a
few      hundred fathoms.                The great majority of shells, however, are
only partially removed                  during the first         few    hundred fathoms, and
on      reaching       the bottom at these lesser                      depths they accumulate

there.     After reaching     the bottom more          of the shell may be        dis
solved, but in these positions there            are circumstances which         retard
solution.      Where    shells    reach    the bottom        in depths of      a  few
hundred fathoms, they are soon covered up by other shells, and                     are
surrounded by       sea  water which        is completely or nearly         saturated
with    carbonate    of lime, from its being           but slowly renewed,        and
from having been for         a   long time in contact with a wide              extent
of calcareous deposits at the bottom of the             sea.    It  is probable  that,
say, at a depth of 500 fathoms,           fully   80 per cent, of the       carbonate
of lime shells that fall from the              surface    reach    the bottom and.
accumulate there.
   At   depths,   however, of 1500 or 2000 fathoms not more than                   50
per cent, of these      shells reach the bottom in            a  partially dissolved
condition    ; moreover,   the accumulation is here slower, from a            greater
number of shells being dissolved in their fall through the water,
and after reaching the bottom the shell will be for a longer time
exposed     to the action of water         before   being covered       up and    pro
tected by the fall of other shells,         as is the case in shallower depths.
In  the greatest depths of the ocean all the              surface shells appear to
be removed      before  they reach the bottom, except              probably some of
the heavier and more         compact      ones, which lie there uncovered,         by
other shells till wholly removed             by solution.      The water in these
red-clay areas would,       besides,     take up the lime more readily,             as
there    it is not in contact with          great   carbonate     of lime deposits,
like the water overlying          a  Globigerina      or Pteropod       ooze.   These
deeper layers of water are more active in the removal of carbonate
of   lime than the surface          waters,   not only because of the larger
amount of carbonic acid they contain, and to the deoxidation                        of
alkaline sulphates by organic matter giving rise to hydrosulphurie
acid, but also because       of the greater        pressure,    and the fact that,
the substance     of the shells being less compressible than water, they
would fall more slowly, and henco would be longer exposed                      to the
action of the deeper layers          of water than to the action of those
nearer the surface.
   In this way     we appear to have a perfectly rational explanation               of
the partial     disappearance       of carbonate       of lime shells from the
shallower depths, and their total disappearance                from all the greater
depths of the ocean.          It   is to bo observed       that all those shells in

  1839-90.]       Dr   J.  Murray & Mr R. Irvine on Coral Reefs.                    99
  which   a  considerable       quantity    of organic tissue is associated      with
  the carbonate     of lime, disappear in solution more rapidly than the
 shells   of the     Foraminifera, which contain little organic matter.
 Daring the     whole of the " Challenger" cruise only two bones of fishes,
 other   than     the otoliths        and the teeth,     were    dredged from the
 deposits, and      all traces of the     cetacean bones were       removed,   except
 the dense      earbones       and dense      Ziphioid   beaks.    The   remains of
 crustacean      animals      were    almost wholly     absent   from deep-sea de-
 pisits, with the exception            of Ostracode shells and the hard tips of
 some claws      of crabs.
    Taming now to tbe lagoons and lagoon channels of coral islands,
it is believed       that    large quantities    of carbonate of lime are in the
same    way being dissolved from these shallow basins as well as from
the deposits       of tbe deep sea, but under somewhat different circum
stances.      In the      case of a shell falling to the bottom of the sea,         it
is  continually brought in contact with new layers of water, which
has the same        effect   as  if  a continuous stream of water were passing
over the      shell.     In    the case of the lagoons this last is what takes
place.     The water which flows in and out of the lagoons twice in
twenty-four hours passes over great beds of growing coral, and from
all the    observations we have is largely charged with carbonic acid,
owing     probably to the large number of living animals on the outer
reef over     wbich the water          passes on its way to the lagoon.          This
water passes       continually over the       dead coral and sand of the lagoon,
and takes       up and removes large quantities of carbonate               of lime in
solution (as       well    as suspension) for       in these lagoons      the spaces
covered     by dead coral debris always greatly exceed the patches                 of
growing coral.          Owing       to the fact that the water of the lagoon is
continually      in motion, and constantly          renewed,   the layer in contact
with the bottom of coral sand can never become saturated or unable
to take     up more lime, as is apparently the case in the layers of
water    in contact with the Globigerina               ooze and other calcareous
deep-water      deposits.
    From the foregoing discussion and observations                it is evident that
a very   large quantity        of carbonate of lime is in      a  continual state of
flux in the ocean,         now existing      in the form of shells and corals,
but after      the death of the animals passing slowly into solution, to
go again    through the same cycle.

    On the whole, however, the quantity of carbonate of lime that
is secreted        by animals       must exceed what is re-dissolved by              the
action of sea water, and at the present time there is a vast accumu
lation of carbonate           of lime going on in the ocean.         It  has been    the
same      in the     past,   for with    a few insignificant     exceptions all the
carbonate       of lime iti the geological series of rocks has been secreted
from sea water, and owes its origin to organisms in' the same way as
the carbon of the carboniferous                formations    ; the extent of these
deposits appears           to have increased      from the earliest      down to the
present geological period.
    At    the present      time most of the carbonate of lime carried to the
ocean      by rivers has been         directly derived from calcareous stratified
rocks formed by organic agency in the                sea in earlier geological ages,
but the calcium in these formations was                in the first instance derived
from the decomposition of the lime-bearing silicates of the earth's
original crust, and this decomposition, which is still going on                   in the
sea and on the land surfaces,             is a continuous source     of carbonate of
 lime.
     In considering        the analyses    showing the average composition             of
 sea    salts, one     is struck with the relatively small quantity of those
 very substances         which    are extracted so largely from sea water by
 plants and animals, viz.,            carbonate of lime and silica.           Siliceous
 deposits are of vast extent, yet silica occurs merely in traces in sea
 water;      carbonate      of lime deposits are of vastly greater         magnitude,
 yet carbonate        of lime makes up only TJffth part of the saline consti
 tuents of      sea   water, and only j-jV^th part of the whole bulk of sea
 water.       Sulphate      of lime is ten      times more      abundant     than     the
 carbonate       in sea water     ; on the   other hand, the river water that is
 poured into the ocean contains about ten times as much carbonate
 as  it  does of sulphate of lime.*
     The total amount of calcium in             a cubic mile of sea water is esti
 mated from analyses to bo 1,911,000 tons, and                  the total   amount of
 calcium in        the   whole ocean is calculated at 028,340,000,000,000
 tons.      The total amount of calcium in           a  cubic mile of river water is
 estimated       at   141,917 tons, and the total amount of this element
 carried into the ocean from all the rivers of the globe annually                       is

 is   equal to the total         amount of calcium in solution in the whole
  ocean at the present time.              It follows from this that        if  the salinity

very tedious and doubtful            as to results, we devised and adopted the
following    process,   which was found to answer exceedingly                            well.
Pure potash was added            to a measured and carefully filtered                 portion
of the   sea water,   and the precipitate formed removed                         by filtration
through filter-paper, from which any traces of ammonia (generally
present    in filter-paper) had been removed by washing with pure
potash   water,   the clear       filtrate was then Nesslerised in the usual
manner.      We found that            by adopting this plan we had a speedy
and   accurate    means of determining between                   the actual ainmoniacal
salts and the nitrogenous matter, both of which are as a rule present
in sea water according to the proportion it carries of living or dead
organisms.
    Exp.  IX.   (p. 89) seems to prove in a conclusive manner that                         the
addition of pure potash to a fluid containing albuminoids alone does
not at once give rise to the production of saline ammonia.

        The above series        proves that under the same conditions different
     species    of coral are acted upon in different degrees                    by the solvent
      action of      sea   water.     Further, it would          appear        that the more
      areolar   or amorphous the coral is the greater             the action as compared
      with the    harder crystalline varieties.

     Note on Ripples in a Viscous Liquid.                       By Prof.     Tait.
                                (Head March 3, 1890.)
     The following      investigation was made in consequence             of   certain
 peculiarities in the earlier results of some recent measurements                       of
 ripples by Prof. Michie Smith, in my Laboratory, which will,                  I  hope,
 soon be communicated to            the  Society. These seemed to suggest
 that viscosity might have some influence on the results,                   as    might
 also the film of oxide,       &c, which     soon gathers on a free surface            of
 mercury.       I  therefore   took account of the density,           as  well as of
 possible rigidity,      of this surface    layer, in addition to the surface
 tension which was the object of Prof.                Smith's work.       The later
 part of the paper, where Cartesian coordinates are employed,                      runs
somewhat on the lines of an analogous                  investigation     in Basset's
 Hydrodynamics.           My original    object,   however,    was different      from
 his, as   I sought the effects of viscosity on waves steadily maintained
by means of        a  tuning-fork used as      a   current    interruptor;     not on
waves once started and then left to themselves.                  Besides obtaining
his boundary conditions         in   a singular manner, I think that in his
§   521   Mr    Basset   has made    an erroneous investigation of the effects
of very great viscosity.
    The stress-function in        a viscous liquid may be obtained {Pliil.
Mag., Jan. 1890) from that in an elastic solid, by substituting
velocity for displacement ; in the form

where,    in order to include      the part of the pressure which is not due
to motion, we must write         p instead of     the quantity

Here    <r is   the vector velocity     of an element       at p, and /* is the co
efficient of viscosity.
    Hence, supposing the volume of the element to be unity, we have
for the equation of motion

 When n and m are small, this is approximately
                               R+       2mm2 =       en2   - 4p.r'2m             .
     There is no other term in the first power of m, independent of                                     p. ;
so that,       to this   degree of approximation                 (which is probably always
sufficient),     the dust layer has no effect                 except to increase R. When
there is no      viscosity this increases the ripple-length {i.e., diminishes r)
for a given period          of vibration.
     When terms          of the first    degree in the viscosity are taken account
of,   the effect on        n (for   a   given value of               r)       is     merely to add to    it
the pure       imaginary
                                        2p.rh/(e-2?nr),
whose value increases             alike with in and with r.
    Thus the period          is   not affected, but the surface layer aids viscosity
in   causing waves to subside as they advance.
    This investigation            above may be easily extended to the case in
which      a   thin liquid layer        is   poured on mercury to keep its surface
untarnished.             The only difficulty             is   with           respect     to the relative
tangential motion at the common surface of the liquids.

The second term on the right-hand side of the equation is                        the part
depending on gravity, and            it  is very small relatively to           the other
term.      In the     case    of mercury,      taking the greatest          wave-length
employed, its value is only 1/2040 of the first term, a quantity far
within the limits of observational error.                  I  have accordingly used
in all the calculations           the   form    T = A.3p/2ir/2.      If in this X be
measured      in  centimetres     and t   in seconds, T is given in dynes per
centimetre.         Previous     attempts made         by myself        and    others      to
 determine surface-tensions by this method failed on account                       of the
 difficulty experienced in measuring the lengths of the ripples, and
 since  T   ex X:i, it is evident that      the method is useless unless            \ can
 be measured        with great accuracy.         This difficulty        has been     over
 come by the use of photography, and              it  is now possible        to test    the
practical value of the method by comparing the results that have
been obtained with          those   got by other means.            The application of
photography is easy, since the waves that are dealt with are                      "stand
ing"    waves, and when the           apparatus is      in proper adjustment           the
photograph is sharp even with exposures                 of   as much     as 10   seconds.
 The usual exposure        is from    1 to 2 seconds.         Thus there is an essen
tial difference between           this application       of photography and that
 made by     Lord Rayleigh, who photographs             a  moving stream in a small
fraction of     a second.
    The general       plan of procedure       is as follows     : — A tuning-fork in
which the        vibrations     are electrically     maintained       is   employed      to
produce ripples on the            surface    of the liquid under experiment,
which is contained in         a  shallow dish.       A  scale is suitably placed on
the edge of the dish so that its divisions                are as nearly as possible
parallel to the crests of the ripples, and              a  photograph       of the dish
is then taken.         This photograph        is measured        with    a  micrometer,
and the measurements           are interpreted by reference            to those    of the
scale photographed on the same plate.
    In  the    earlier experiments much difficulty              was experienced         in
getting suitable illumination,          but ultimately it was found that the
best photographs were got simply by placing the dish near a window
and using the light from the sky or a bright cloud.                       In most   cases
it  was found best to allow a shadow of a bar of the window or of
the tuning-fork       itself to fall on the surface, for the edge of such                a
shadow becomes           regularly serrated,      and this        serration     is easily

 photographed.          The     distance between the ripple-crests is easily
 measured        in such a photograph, but there is some risk of not
 measuring exactly         at right angles to the lines of             crests.
     The method         of exciting      the ripples was found               to be of great
importance.          In tbe first experiments the driving-fork of                      a  Helm-
holtz vowel-sound          apparatus was taken, and             the    dipper attached to
one of the prongs           was replaced by         a  light arm of aluminium, bent
downwards          at  right angles near the            end.    The point of this was
smoothed        and tapered,        and was allowed           to dip slightly         into the
liquid.      When        the fork vibrated,          the    point     set   up    a series     of
circular ripples which             were fairly steady and uniform.                 A   number
of photographs were taken with this arrangement, but on measuring
them     it was found that they              gave    for mercury a wave-length                 of
only   (H04 cm. for 256 vibrations per                    second,    corresponding with
T=    159.       The     value    for  T   given     by Quincke          is 540, and the
difference was         evidently far too      great    to be accounted for by errors
of observation.           During these experiments it was noticed that very
 perfect ripples        were produced        when a vessel          containing        mercury
 wis laid on the sounding-box             of   a  tuning-fork,      and    a large    series   of
 measurements were made              in this way.        Using the      same fork of 256
 vibrations       per second the photographs             gave    A. =  01 08    cm.,     which
 differed but little from the previous results.                Experiments        were then
 made     to determine whether the shape, size, or material of the dish
 had any influence on the length of the ripples, but the                       slight varia
 tions observed       in the value of     A.  were only such as might               easily be
 explained       by differences     in the temperature or in the               cleanness     of
 the surface.        The tuning-fork      was then changed for one              giving 512
 vibrations      per second, but this, too, gave            approximately          the same
 valae    for T.      Finally,   a fork  giving 768 vibrations per second                  was
 used, and      it  was  found that with a round glass vessel a result                     was
 obtained which          differed widely       from     previous results.           On sub
 stituting    a   rectangular    ebonite dish for the glass one it was found
 to be   impossible to get ripples distinct enough to be photographed
 by simply      laying the dish on the sounding-board, and consequently
 experiments were tried           with the     edge of the dish pressing against
 one  prong of the      tuning-fork low down.             This proved most          effective,
 and  the   first photograph         gaveX    = 0'075      corresponding        to   T = 528
 —a result differing only about 2 per cent, from Quincke's mean value.

This plan of making             the dish actually touch the fork           was  adopted
in all the subsequent           experiments,     and yielded consistent       results.
     The cause of the failure of the earlier methods is not                    perfectly
clear.     The average value of the wave-length in mercury                      for 256
vibrations per second             was found from      the ten best photographs to
be 0'108 cm., the values varying from                 0"102 to (H12 cm.             If      we
take    Quincke's        value    for T, viz., 540 dynes per centimetre,                  this
 would correspond           with    a note   of 445 vibrations per second.
     In  the cases in which           a dipper was used the explanation           may be
 found in        the    circumstance       that two impulses are given             to      the
 mercury for each complete vibration of the fork, one                      as the   dipper
 enters, the other as          it leaves, the liquid.      If  this is the true     source
 of error    it might     be supposed       that there is  a somewhat      similar cause
 acting when the vessel rests on the sounding-box, for in that case
 too   it must      receive two impulses for each vibration.               On the      other
 hand, when the dish presses lightly on the prong of the                           fork it
  would     receive      only one impulse for each vibration.                 But    if the
  above    explanation were complete              one woidd expect        to get    ripples
  due to a note an octave above that of the fork, whereas those                   actually
  got correspond almost              exactly to A$ of the same octave, the fork
  giving the C below.              I propose to examine this point more carefully
  hereafter.
      As finally      arranged, the driving-fork       was placed at a distance          ami
  was connected           by loose wires with the fork           —   one of the series
  belonging to        a  Helmholtz vowel-sound apparatus — actually used to
  set up the ripples.            This was placed on       a stone    slab  in front      of   a
  window so that it could be illuminated by the light from the sky.
  The vessel usually employed               was an ebonite     developing dish, eithei
  of half-plate or quarter-plate size.               This dish      was supported near
   the fork     in   such a way as to touch one of the prongs               at a point as
  low down        as possible.        The mercury or other liquid was then poured
  in till    a   depth was reached, beyond which any increase                     seriously
   diminished the distinctness of the ripples.                If   the contact    with     the
   dish be made at            a   point taken at random          a   very complex and
   unsteady series of ripples will usually be produced,                  but with     a little
   care it is possible to rind a point which yields two steady series of
   ripples crossing         each other at right       angles.     Except with the          eye
   nearly on      a  level with the surface of the liquid, the ripples can                  be

seen distinctly       only in   one    particular   direction, and care must be
taken to place        the axis of the camera in that direction.                 If   the
camera could be           placed vertically over the dish          it would greatly
simplify the measurement            of the   plates, since the scale-value       would
be the same      in all directions.        This,  however,    is seldom practicable,
and usually the        axis of the    camera has to be inclined        to the vertical
at a considerable        angle, so that the scale-value          varies not only for
different    parts   of the plate, but also for different directions.               The
corrections     to be    applied cannot easily be calculated, but they can
be got   by   actual measurement.            For this purpose a sheet of paper
was taken of       the size of the dish, and on it        a  number of circles were
described     with a radius of       1  cm.    This   was then laid on the surface
of the mercury        and photographed           The scale value for any part of
the mercury       surface in any direction can be obtained by measuring
the diameter       of the corresponding circle in the same direction.
    The results so       far obtained    can only be looked on as preliminary,
but they are      sufficient to test the value of the method.                At present
the value of      the wave-lengths is probably not trustworthy to within
less  than 2 per      cent, but there      seems no reason to doubt that this un
 certainty    can be reduced to at least          one-half by the introduction of
certain   modifications in the apparatus.            An error of     2 per cent,  in the
wave-length corresponds to an error of approximately 6 per cent, in
the value of     T, and the     extreme values obtained differ from each other
by somewhat           less than     this in the case of mercury.              Quincke's
results   for mercury* which are usually accepted, vary from 511 to
 572 dynes       per centimetre, with a mean value of 540                ;  so that his
 extreme values        differ from each other by about          12  per cent.
    In  his paper read         at last meeting of the Society, Professor Tait
 showed    that    if   we take account      of the surface-flexural rigidity (E),
 the   equation       for    the wave-length       takes a form which           can    be
 written   : —

accurate comparison       to be made, but they show that           if   there   is any
effect produced by the surface-flexure rigidity            it must   be very     small
compared   with that due to surface-tension.

   Two photographs were taken for water, but in each of them only a
few waves could be measured,         so   that no great weight can be placed
on the result.    They were both with the fork giving              25G      vibrations
per second, and the resulting wave-lengths were 0-195 and 0-208 cm.,
corresponding to the values of 77 and 94 for T.                The mean is 85-5,
while Quincke's value is 81.
   A photograph of a mercury surface covered with dilute sulphuric
acid gave A = 0T41 for 25G vibrations per second.                    If we neglect
all influence of the acid other than in changing the surface-tension,
this would give     T  = 400,    or practically     the same as for water and
mercury.
    Two photographs were taken of a surface of mercury charged to
a  high potential by means of a Holt/, electric machine.                   The photo
graphs gave very consistent measures : —

   The    Absorption Spectra of Certain Vegetable Colouring
          Matters.            By C. Michie Smith. (With a Plate. )
                                   (Read March 17, 1690.)
    For the substances dealt            with in this   paper   I   have been indebtrd
at various     times,     to the kindness of Mr David Hooper,                Quin-:lc-_-l-t
to the     Madras       Government.          The observations have           been     niiie
with several       instruments, but have all been reduced                to the   s<-ale   of
the    direct vision        spectroscope     of the Chemical Laboratory             of the
Edinburgh        University, kindly           placed  at my disposal for the m:~t
important       part     of the work           The illumination         used   with     this
 instrument        is   a    10-candle     power incandescent lamp           : with      the
 other   instruments sun-light was used.               I   have thought it better         fr
 practical purposes          to draw the spectra        to the natural scale of the
 instrument       than     to   reduce    them    to a scale of wave-lengths,           hut
 data are    supplied for finding the wave-length corresponding to a:.y
 part    of the spectrum.            To    represent   the varying        shades     cf   ar.
 absorption      spectrum is extremely difficult, and the results                  usually
  obtained    are,    at best, far from satisfactory.            The method        I  have
 employed       is   to draw the spectra            on a large scale, shading            th-
  varioos parts      by aid of     a light curve, and then reduce this draw:r._-
  to the    required size by photography.               The result, though not all
  that could be       desired, is fairly satisfactory.
     Colouring      Matter from Trichosanthes            palmata.   — Mr Hooper ha.~
  given me the       following notes on this substance           : — "The plant which
  Yields   it is the Trichosanthes palmata,               one of the Gourd        tribe or
   Cucurbitacece,      and the rounded scarlet           fruits have their seeds im
  bedded     in  a green      bitter pulp.      The bitter principle is a glucoside,
   soluble in water        and alcohol, and affords a red solution, changing
   to purple    with   sulphuric     acid.    I  have named      it ' trichosanthin,'      as

it differs from colocynthin.               The green       matter     is best   prepared
by agitating the dry pulp with ether,                   evaporating down and            dis
solving the ethereal           residue   in strong spirit.        In this manner         the
bitter principle and fatty matters                are eliminated."        The solution
 closely resembles          a   solution    of   chlorophyll       of equal strength.
 Both are beautifully           dichroic, appearing green in thin, and red                 in
thicker layers; both also have           a red fluorescence.      The chief difference
 on   inspection       is that      a  much     thicker     layer   of chlorophyll           is
 required to yield the red colour by transmitted light.
    Spectrum.     — The       spectroscope     at once       shows that this          green,
 colouring matter is not chlorophyll.                  Spectra (a), (b), and         (<¦), in
 the plate are for different thicknesses of the trichosanthes colouring
 matter,    while    (<])  gives the spectrum          of chlorophyll     from cabbage
 of a thickness and strength corresponding as nearly as possible
 with   (Jj).    Taking this       as  the most characteristic spectrum,            it may
 be   thus      described: — The        spectrum     begins at       173G,    and     slight
 shading continues to 1693.               The first band begins          (penumbra) at
 1638     (W.     L.    654-1),     and   ends   about      1600    (W. L.     615),     the
 maximum absorption being from 1631 to 1627, and from 1605 to
 1602.        From this there is a small amount of absorption                     till the
 second     bund begins        at  1576 (W.     L.  593 '4), and     continues to 1543
  (W. L. 566'8), the maximum absorption being from 1570 to 1563.
 From this there is no perceptible absorption till the third band,
 which      begins     at    1516     (W. L. 5 48 4), and continues to 1495
  (\V. L. 534 8), the maximum darkness being from 1511 to 1501.
 There is a fourth band, very faint, with its centre about 1452
  (W. L.      510-6),   and    a  fifth extending from 1400             (W. L. 485) to
  1371.       The spectrum ends about 1355 (W. L. 467).                     The relative
 depths of the maxima of these five bands are 10, 5, 4,                              li,    1.
  When      a thin     layer of the solution          is   used  the spectrum         shows
 two strongly marked bands from 1625                    to   1612   (darkness    10), and
 from 1569 to 1550 (darkness 4), and a slight trace of a third band
 with its centre at 1501.                The spectrum ends sharply at 1340.
  With   a   very thick layer the first baud widens out in both directions,
 and strong absorption — sufficient to mask bands                    II. and   III. — con
 tinues to 1485.          There is also much increased absorption in the blue.
  How completely          these spectra      differ from that of chlorophyll             will
 best be seen from the plate.                The chief band of chlorophyll               lies

between       1665    (W. L. 789) and 1625 (W. L. 639-8), while the chief
band in a          thin film of trichosanthes would almost exactly fill up
the interval            between       bands       I. and II. in chlorophyll.                       Bands
III., IT.,        and    V. of trichosanthes               may      be    coincident with faint
chlorophyll bands.
  The positions            of some of the chlorophyll bands, as is well known,
can    I*    changed        by the action of reagents, and the trichosanthes
bands       are    even more strongly affected.                     The first reagent              experi
mented        with was sulphide of ammonia, which probably has a
reducing       action. The result is shown in spectra (e), (f) and (ij),
which represent             the    appearance        after 2, 11, and 39 days respect
ively, after       which        there was no further             change.              (h) gives
                                                                                 Figure
the spectrum            of chlorophyll similarly              treated.       The change in the
trichosanthes            spectrum       is    complete.         Band I. gradually becomes
weaker,       and      finally vanishes       ;   two new bands            appear       in   the    space
between bands              I.   and    II.    of the original spectrum              ;    band       II.       is
apparently         displaced       towards the violet end and intensified                           ;    and
band    IV.       is    greatly widened.            Chlorophyll is much                 less affected,
and     the       difference      between         two spectra            could   hardly       be        more
completethan that between (g) and (h).
   When the original trichosanthes solution is treated                                   with strong
hydrochloric            acid the spectrum            consists       of three     principal         bands.
The first band begins (penumbra)                        1606, and extends to 1576 ; the
maximum absorption                          (W. L. 608-6) to 1576 (W. L.
                                      is from 1593
593-4).           From this there is considerable absorption to the second
hand,        of        which    the    maximum          absorption          extends from                1557
 (W.    L
        577-6) to 1532 (W. L. 558-8).    Slight absorption continues
to thethird band, which extends from 1497 (W. L. 536) to 1467
(W. L. 519).    The relative intensities of these throe bands are
about 8, 7, 4.  These three bands may perhaps represent the three
 first bands            of the natural spectrum moved by different amounts
 towards          the more        refrangible       end.      When this spectrum                        (/)   is
 compared          with the       spectrum        of chlorophyll          similarly treated (J),              it
 is   seen    that the three bands correspond with three of the chloro
 phyll bands, while there                is   nothing to represent the first and most
 prominent             chlorophyll     band.       It   is   of importance to notice,                    too,
 that the         unrepresented chlorophyll                  band    is   the one least affected
  by   reagents.

    Another difference between the trichosanthes colouring matter                           and
 chlorophyll     is   that when treated          either with ammonia                sulphide
 or hydrochloric        acid the former      ceases       to be green       in thin    layers,
 while the latter ceases to be red in thick layers.                        The reason        for
 this becomes at once plain when the spectra                        are examined.           The
 question of the relation which the tricbosanthes colouring                           matter
 bears to chlorophyll        is one of considerable interest, for             it is  evident
 that there is some relation, since           in the products of the action                    of
 hydrochloric acid there are three bands which are common to                                the
 two spectra.       That they differ greatly            is equally evident from             the
 dissimilarity of the original spectra and of those got after acting                         on
 the solutions with ammonia sulphide.                    The tricbosanthes colouring
 matter    is found inside a thick          opaque         rind, and so has probably
 been formed in the dark, at least it cannot serve the purpose                          which
 chlorophyll     serves    in leaves.      Chlorophyll,           according to     Sachs, is
 formed in       complete      darkness     only       in     the   cotyledons      of some
 conifers and in the leaves of ferns           ;  but etiolin, which in darkness
 usually takes the place of chlorophyll,                 has a spectrum         which does
 not materially differ from the chlorophyll spectrum, and is certainly
 not the same      as   that under discussion.               Chlorophyll itself       is  held
 by many who have studied it to be                   a    mixture of several distinct
 colouring matters.         Professor Stokes * finds that the chlorophyll                     of
land plants is        a   mixture of four substances,                two green      and two
yellow, three of which are easily decomposed                         by acids.     I  cannot
find any account of the experiments from which this conclusion is
deduced,     nor any description          of the spectra             of the several        con
stituents, but it seems probable that the first band in the red is
that due       to the constituent        which is not easily decomposed                      by
acids.     Mr Sorby t holds that           the chlorophyll            of land plants is        a

with bands in         the   natural chlorophyll            spectrum,     though presum
ably the first band in            the    spectrum         is   that due to his " blue
chlorophyll."        But this first band          is     quite unrepresented in the
tricbosanthes spectrum,          so  that it seems           a  fair conclusion that the

nutter.     Its place is taken          by another          substance          which yields          the
first band, -which           is not coincident            with any of the chlorophyll
bands.      This substance,           unlike that yielding the first chlorophyll
band, is very         readily decomposed by                 acids, and is slowly              decom
posed by    ammonia sulphide.

                             and.
coincide    in position with bands III., IV., and V. of the chlorophyll
spectrum.       Of these latter         III.   and V. are not distinctly shown in
the   accompanying plate, hut are obtained with a comparatively weak
solution and a       strong light.   Band TV. of the trichosanthes spectrum
is extremely        faint.  It is not, however, possible to lay much stress
on the    apparent coincidence              of these bands, since their behaviour
under treatment              with ammonia sulphide is                so very different.                A
comparison of spectra (g) and (h) shows that no two of the bands
are even approximately coincident— in fact, the two spectra are almost
(¦¦iciplenientary.           On the other hand,           spectra     (/)   and      (J)    show that
after   treatment with strong hydrochloric                   acid, there        is   almost perfect
coincidence between three               of   the bands       in the two              spectra.        The
influence of        hydrochloric acid          on   chlorophyll       has been studied by
many observers.              Russell and Lapraik * consider that                        the     change
produced       is   simply    a   molecular one, and call the two forms o- and
/S-chlorophyll.             Schunck, on the other hand, holds               f    that the change
is
a       chemical one, and that the ultimate product                            i3    identical with
Fremy's        phyllocyanin.          The latter view certainly seems to explain
the     observations best, and in accordance with                    it   we may say that the
trichosanthes         colouring      matter contains          a   substance          which      is   not
chlorophyll, but which on treatment with hydrochloric                                      acid yields
one     of the constituents of phyllocyanin,                  which       is   itself probably         a
mixture of two substances.                   In chlorophyll       a   partial change            is   pro
duced     by   a    very weak acid, so that extracts of certain leaves, such
as those       of the Virginian creeper, yield the modified spectrum,                                 un
less     care be taken            to neutralise         the acid before             extracting        the
 chlorophyll.          It    is   possible that     a    somewhat similar               change        has
 been     produced      in the trichosanthes colouring matter by the tricho-
 santhin which occurs along                 with   it   in the pulp.

Hooper writes : — The red colouring matter in the other bottle
should be more extensively known.                 It  is a drug that has been       used
                                                                         '
as   a dye in South        India for      ages, under the name of           Vembadam
bark.'      It  is the produce of a large creeper, the Ventilago               madras
patana, which grows on the slopes of the Nilgiris and in the Mysore
district.      The bark, besides dyeing silk and other materials, yields
its colour to fixed and volatile oils, and, what is                a  desideratum, to
kerosene oil.        From an analysis,      I make    it an anthracene     derivative."
The absorption spectrum               for thin and thicker        films is shown       in
figures (k) and (I).         There are no absorption bands, but the                light
 is completely absorbed,            even   with   a  very thin     film, except from
 1730 to 158S (W.         L.   604).      With  a  thicker layer the absorption        is
complete,       except   from 1702 (W. L. 743) to 1622 (W. L. 63G-6).
Thus      the absorption is almost entirely confined to the more
refrangible       end.    This     substance    would      probably be found very
suitable for dyeing cloths for use                as  non-actinic blinds in " dark
rooms."
    Colouring Matter from the Funiculus of the Wattle. — This yields
a  very pretty spectrum, figure (in), characterised by two well-marked
absorption bands.         The first extends from about 1546 (W. L. 568'8)
to 1519 (W. L. 550-2), the second from 150G (W. L. 541-8) to 1453
 (W. L. 511-2).         The relative darkness of the two bands is 10 : 8.
 When     a  thicker layer of the substance is used the two bands almost
 come together,       but  a  slight green colour is      seen between     them.     The
 absorption between band              II.  and  the end of the spectrum         also in
 creases.      In  an alkaline solution the bands are somewhat                narrower,
 but their centres are unchanged            in position.
    Solution of " Waras." — The dye known as " Waras" is got from
 the glands of the fruit of Flemivgia Grahamiana (W. and A.), one
 of the Leguminosoe.            The absorption spectrum         shows no bands, but
 absorption is complete          except between 1580         (W. L. 597)      and 1523
  (W. L.    552-8).
    Solution of " Kamala." — This dye is got from the glands of the
 fruit of Rottlera tinctaria, one of the Euphorbiacea!. It resembles
  Waras very closely, but is transparent to light of              a somewhat     greater
  wave-length.        The    absorption      is  complete     except   between      1688
  (W. L. 722) and         1549     (W. L. 571-2).        The chemical relations of

1th March                 1889,    I      stated the problem of constructing                         a      jointed
 model under               gyrostatic domination,              to fulfil the condition of having
no rigidity             against irrotational              deformations, and of resisting rota
 tion,         or   rotational deformation, with quasi-elastic forcive in simple
proportion                to rotation.      I    gave      a   solution, illustrated               by   a   model,
 for the case             of points all in          one plane     ;    but I     did not then              see any
 very simple                  three-dimensional            solution.           After many unavailing
 efforts       I    have recently found the following.

     2.  Take six fine straight rods, and six straight tubes, all of                    the
 same length, the internal diameter of the tubes exactly equal                     to the
 external diameter of the rods.                Joint all   the twelve together       with
 ends     to  one    point P.      Mechanically      this might       be dune     (but it
 would       not    be    worth     the doing)        by   a   ball-and-twelve-socket
 mechanism.          The condition to be fulfilled is simply that the                axes
 of the six rods and of the six tubes all pass through the one                      point
 P.     Make a vast number of such clusters of six tubes and six rods,
 and, to begin with, place their jointed ends so as to constitute an
 equilateral homogeneous assemblage* of points P, P' . . . . , each con
nected to its twelve nearest            neighbours by a rod of one sliding            into
a   tube of another.           This   assemblage      of points we shall call          our
 primary assemblage.           The mechanical connections between               them do
 not impose        any constraint     ; each     point of the assemblage may be
moved arbitrarily in any direction, while all the others are at rest.
The mechanical         connections are required merely for the sake of pro
 viding us with rigid lines          joining    the points, or more properly        rigid
cylindric       surfaces   having     their axes in the joining lines.              Make
now     a  rigid  frame,   G, of three rods fixed together at right angles to
one another through one point              0.     Place  it with its      three  bars    in
contact with the three pairs of rigid sides                      of any tetrahedron,
(PP, P'T'"), (PP",             1>"T'),    (PP'",    P"P  ) of our primary         assem
blage.        Place similarly       other similar rigid        frames,     G', G",   &c,
on the edges of           all the tetrahedrons congener            f  to   the  one   first
chosen.        The points O, 0', O", &c., form               a second      homogeneous
assemblage        related   to the assemblage       of Ps, just    as  the reds are re
lated to the blues in         § G9  of the Article referred       to  in  the footnotes.
    3.   The position       of the     frame    G— that     is to say, its orientation
and     the   position of its centre        0 (six disposables) — is completely
determined by the four points P, P', P", P'" (Thomson and Tait's
Natural Pliilostophy,          ij 198   ; or Elements,    § 1G8).       If its bars were
allowed to break away from contact with the three pairs of edges of
the tetrahedron, we might chose, as its six co-ordinates, the                    six dis
tances of its three bars from the three pairs of edges;                 but we suppose
it  to be constrained to preserve             these contacts.        And now let any

 or staple respectively,      through which     a  ring passes to hold three ends
together at the      corners.      Two of  the rings have two glass tubes and

to the five      other edges of the tetrahedron.              Any infinitely          small
homogeneous         deformation      of the primary assemblage             (§   1   above)
may be        determinately       resolved    into    six   such     simple        stretch
ings, and     any infinitely small rotational deformations may be pro
duced by the       superposition of a rotation without deformation, upon
the irrotational     deformation.       Hence an infinitely small homogeneous
'It-formation     of the primary assemblage            without    rotation      produces
only translatory        motion, no rotation, of the G frames            ;  and any in
finitely small homogeneous            displacement whatever of the primary
assemblage,      produces     a rotation of each frame equal to, and round
the same axis as,        the rotational component.
    5.  It  now    only remains to give irrotational             stability     to the     G
frames.      This may be done           by mountiug       gyrostats properly upon
them according to         the principle stated in         3-5 of Article C. of Vol.
III.   of my Papers, and         in my Address      to the   Institute of Electrical
Engineers,     10th January 1889.           Three gyrostats would suffice, but
twelve     may be       taken   for   symmetry,       and for    avoidance of any
resultant    moment        of momentum of all         the rotators of one frame.
Instead     of ordinary gyrostats        with rigid fly-wheels,         we    may      take
liquid gyrostats as described below § 6, and so make one very small
step    towards     abolishing      the crude mechanism           of fly-wheels         and

    6.   Imagine    a  hollow anchor ring, or tore, that is to say, an            endless
circular tube of circular cross-section.              Perforate it in the line         of   a
diameter,      and fix into it small straight tubes to guard the perforations
as   shown in the accompanying diagram.                     Fill it with frictionless
liquid, and give the liquid irrotational circuital motion                  as   indicated
by the arrow-heads          in   the diagram.        This   arrangement       constitutes
our hydrokinetic          substitute for      a  mechanical fly-wheel.          Mount it
on a stiff diametral rod             passing    through the perforations,          and it
becomes        the mounted gyrostat,          or Foucault gyroscope,        required for
 our     models.       Its    use   would      have   considerably     simplified      and
 shortened the description of              a model   communicated to the French
 Academy last September,*                 which, however, was        given purposely
 in terms of the Foucault              gyroscope    because    it thus   describes     real
 mechanism        by which       the    exigencies   of the    model can be practi

  swimming       bladder      in Trigla is well known         ; there,  on opening the
  abdominal      wall, it is    distinctly  seen projecting downwards from the
  dorsal wall of the        abdominal cavity.           In Dactylopterus, when         the
 viscera are removed,           only the ventral      surface of the bladder is seen
 forming      a   part of the       dorsal boundary of the abdominal cavity-
This portion        is white      and tendinous, having on each side the com
mencement         of a   powerful muscle        (fig. 1).     The kidneys overlap it
posteriorly,       and    the    oesophagus     and pericardial        cavity    partially
obscure its      anterior end.         On removing the dorsal muscles              of the
trunk     so as   to view      the bladder from      the side and back, the bladder
muscles are seen         to continue upwards, to curve inwards towards the
median line, to         be reflected downwards on each side of the neural
plate,    and finally        to become     attached     to the bodies of       the verte
brae,   whose spines go           to form that plate.        In this way     the bladder
becomes       divided      longitudinally into its two lateral portions.                 A
careful    examination, however, reveals more than this.                      On tracing
the dorsal       surface forwards by removing the superficial backward
prolongation of the skull-sheath, a secondary division of the bladder
 is disclosed.         It   is composed      of an extremely          thin   transparent
 membrane,       is triangular      in  shape, its dorsal surface being so super
 ficial   as  only to be covered           by the dorsal plate of the shoulder.
The base of         the triangle is towards the median line, the other two
 fides are    surrounded by bone, the ventral surface also lies in                a bony
cap ; so that        this whole portion, although composed of an extremely
 thin     membrane,        is completely protected           by   rigid   surroundings.
 Moreover,      one-half of it may be fairly said to be within the region of
 the  skull, since       a section taken through           the plane of the foramen
 ffiafmum     would, as nearly         as possible, bisect the triangle.         As  seen
 m
     %     2,  the posterior margin is the only one not surrounded                      by
 We.       Here it is that the primary division of the bladder communi
 cates   with this smaller secondary portion, that the muscular coat of
the one     thins out to give place to the thin membrane                   of the other.
 Making now a vertical section through the long axes of the primary
portion      on one side, so as to obtain a view of the interior, we see
 that    there is a      thin    membrane    dividing it transversely into two —
 that   in this membrane there is           a foramen     situated towards the inner
 margin.       Immediately behind this membrane                 there is a tunnel seen
 passing    in  a  transverse manner below the vertebral column, forming

134             Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                     [sess.
a  channel of communication between                 the primary portions        of each
side.      This  is the only part of the bladder which               is situated   below
the level of the vertebral column.
    The entire bladder, therefore, instead of being composed of                     " two
lateral halves," is in reality made up of six paTts, — on each                    side     a-
primary portion divided into two by a membrane, and                          anterior to
and above this a secondary             portion.
    Giinther, in his Introduction           to the Study       of Fishes, tells us that
the   air bladder and the organ of heaving are connected in a more or

plicated chain of ossicles in Siluridse, Characinidse,                 Cyprinidae,    and
 Gymnotidse.         The details of the Siluroid Aniiurus have been              worked
out by Kamsay          Wright;* and T. Jeffrey Parker has written "On
the Connection of the Air Bladder and the Auditory Organ in the lied
 Cod (Lol' lla barrhu*)." t Taking these data into consideration, and
 the fact that part of the swimming bladder of Dactylopterus                      is  pro
 duced     into the region of the head,          I   thought that we might have,
 in this instance,      a  similar connection.          My    most   careful dissection
 revealed     nothing but the          anterior portion of the bladder ending
 blindly in     a  rigid boundary of bone.             Similarly,    I  might mention
 that.   I   could    discover no connection             between     the bladder      and
 alimentary tract,      — no pneumatic duct.             The amount of gas present
  in the bladder must therefore depend on six retia mirabilia,                    which,
  horse-shoe    shaped,     are arranged,     three    in   each primary division        of
  the  bladder, — two       vent-rally  and one dorsally.
     A. Moreau, in his work Sur la                 voir,  rfe#  poissons,   describes an
  interesting experiment which he made on Tritjla hirundo.                       Observ
  ing two nerves passing to the air bladder, having their origin below
  the pneuniogastric near to the first dorsal               pair, he stimulated them
  with     electricity    and produced the characteristic grunting sounds.
  On studying the bladder, be found in the dividing septum                        (which
  he calls the diaphragm) both radiating and circular muscular fibres,
  forming     a sphincter round the central foramen.                 On removing the
  posterior end of the bladder and stimulating again, although no sound
  was heard, the sphincter was seen to contract.                 In the entire   bladder,

if   the wall only was stimulated, no sound was produced except when
the current was greatly intensified.                        He therefore concludes that the
sound is produced            by vibrations               caused by the contractions of this
diaphragm.
     In Dactylopterus, while killing two of the four                                  specimens           ex
amined, sounds exactly similar to those of the gurnard were distinctly
heard, and by            holding the fish            between          the    finger and thumb in
the region of the            swimming             bladder,    a     distinct    contraction of the
bladder       could be felt as each sound was produced.                                    These move
ments        and sounds          were       quite independent of any movements of
the operculum or mouth.
     I    examined this bladder-diaphragm                         in Trigla hirundn,               also    in
Trigla lyra and in Dactylopterus.                             In all        three   the sphincter is
present         Arguing from the fact that all gurnards produce these
sounds,       and that they all have perforated diaphragms, whereas a
perforated diaphragm                  is,   so far asI     am aware, not found              in any        fish
which        does not produce the sounds,                  I      am inclined        to support the
conclusions come to by Moreau.
     The     flying j/oirers of Dactylopterus are,  find, by some called
                                                                       I
into       question.    The conservator of the Naples Zoological Station
— where these observations were made — insisted that the fish never
left the water.          I       have       been unable to make                any observations on
the actual           flight myself, but the literature on the subject seems to
me to be             conclusive.        Mobius,* in speaking of the flight of li*h,
 discusses          the question as to whether Dactylopterus moves the wings.
 This he does from direct observation.
     Moseley        t   twice    describes         the    flight.      In    the second        instance,
 while collecting           in   a   boat amongst the weed of the Sargasso Sea, he
 succeeded           in capturing one or two in                   a   hand-net.       They flew, he
            " at      height of about foot above

In the upper pair,                  the superficial elevates,                 and   at the same           time
protracts       ;   the deep adducts,               sweeping the fin in to the flank.                       The

       rays
passing across the upper surface obliquely from the anterior portion
of the superficial protractor. The detached portion of the fin is only
very slightly acted upon by fibres from above.
   In   the lower pair, both divisions                       of the fin         are drawn            forwards
and downwards by fibres from both muscles, the superficial,                                      however,

tremely limited motion, and always must stand out at an angle                                            from
the body of the fish.                 The swimming bladder of Exoccetus occupies
the ordinary position                 in the abdominal cavity and is non-muscular.
This    fish,       I     have     no doubt, is capable                 of flying     a much          greater
distance      than Dactylopterus                ;    it   has much less mass, and               in form is
calculated          to offer much less resistance                  to    the air, and more readily*
to retain           its    natural     position, when out of the water,                          owing to
its deep-keeled              herring      body.            The     significance of the peculiar
swimming                bladder      in Dactylopterus                   now    seems    to      me     to        be
explained.
    The true gurnards, that                   is,   the near allies of the Cataphracti, are                      in
habit bottom feeders.                   The tips of the free fin rays are provided
with isolated             sensory     elements,* causing these portions to have                                  a
function analogous                 to the antenme of crustaceans.                    Their swimming
bladders have no pneumatic duct and no muscle.                                         When brought
suddenly to the surface by means of                           a    net or line, Trigla invariably
floats belly up.              If    the fish    is   then    opened, the bladder                is   found to
be violently              expanded.       The expansion naturally takes                          place      in   a
downward direction amongst the abdominal viscera, this being the
line of least resistance.                The balance          is   in this     way destroyed          beyond
recovery,        and the position of the fish                is    reversed.    I    have kept         Trigla
tataphraeta in              a     tank in this condition                 for two days.               The fish
eventually dies.                 The reason of the expansion appears                    to me to be the
sudden removal of pressure consequent                               upon the fish being brought

tish which can                readily adapt itself either                to   a     bottom life or to a
mote than pelagic              one.    It has     a   number of the gurnard characteristics,
the free fin rays,             soft and projecting downwards,                        the flattened        head
and ventrally               protruding mouth,              the heavy-looking             rounded body.
I    am totally        ignorant of any animals which prey upon Dactylopterus,
but let us suppose that for some reason or other                               it    becomes necessary
for    it   to leave          the bottom and take to the air, then the sudden
expansion of            bladder       seen   in   the gurnard        is   prevented by the action
of the strong           bladder       muscles.          In addition           to this, its air cavity
has the highest possible dorsal position, as has been already shown,
which must be of great service                             in enabling             the fish to keep         its
somewhat           unwieldy body in its natural position.                              The thin-walled
secondary portion of the bladder can, of course, not be expanded
owing to its complete envelopment in bone.                                    From      a     study of the
young           Dactylopterus,          i.e.,     the fish formerly known                     as    Cephala-
eanthus,          it   is   evident that only the adult forms can have the power
of     "
           flight."         The    pectoral fins of young examples are quite in
significant as flying organs.
      The       smallest       specimen    I      examined         was        1^    inches.        Here, the
pectorals, when               placed along the side, reached                       only to the level of
the second             dorsal fin ray.          The swimming              bladder was              as   in the
alult       I      was unable to determine the period at which the fish first
Tentured into the air, but gauging by the development of the pectoral
fins,      it   may probably be when                  it   has attained the length of about
6    inches.
      In    the   skull the encephalic arch                is   the only one which requires our
attention.             A     strong solution           of caustic         potash       is     necessary     to
loosen the         bony sheath of the head so that the superficial plates may
be      removed.             From the basioccipital the neural arch slopes for
wards, and         is       modified in peculiar way, so as to make room for the
                                         a
secondary portion of the swimming bladder.                                    The exoccipitals send
processes backwards curving at an angle and enclosing this secondary
portion, and the paroccipitals                        take their         position immediately in
front.          The processes of the exoccipitals are attached to the dorsal
superficial        plate, and flatten out posteriorly under the inner suture of
that plate.             Each exoccipital, with its process, in this way forms
 the    outer margin              of the     secondary          portion of the bladder.                   The

138             Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh,                                         [sess.
floor of the cavity is formed by the same bone.                                 Each paroccipital
is responsible for part of the anterior end.                         The supraoccipital                  and
part of the parietal make up the remainder of the end.                                       The inner
margin is formed by what                I     have called the neural plate, i.e.,                         the
coalesced neural spines.           The roof is formed by the dorsal sheathing
plate.
     It   has already been noticed that                in the vertebral column, the first
four vertebra;       have   coalesced         so as to form a simple tube.                              This
region of the body, therefore,              taking into consideration this tube and
the dorsal bony plates, exhibits                  a peculiar rigidity,              which must be
highly serviceable to the fish           if   my explanation of the unique                     position
of the swimming bladder is correct.                      A similar condition of vertebral
column is seen in Fistularia             (one of the pipe fishes),                 but here, so far
as   I    can find out, the bladder is similar                    to that seen          in    the       other
members of the family to which                    it   belongs ;    it   is,    viz.,   a   simple, non-
muscular bladder, depending in the ordinary way from the dorsum
of the abdominal cavity.               This condition,           therefore,        although closely
associated      with the swimming bladder in the                         case    of Dactylopterus,
may not be developed            on account of          it,   or in adaptation to its peculiari
ties.      In   cross section the tube takes much the outline of                              a   cervical
vertebra without        transverse          processes.          The lower surface                 is,   along
the median line, formed into                  a   groove,       down which passes the dor
sal aorta.        The eminences         on the sides of this groove are hollowed
out into canals, which,           as   it   were, tunnel          through that part of the
tube to which the bladder muscles                            are attached,         emerging         to the
exterior of the tube before and behind the muscle.                                      In Dactylop
terus we have both          a   body and          a    head kidney, and the renal veins,
in passing from the former to the latter, occupy the two canals de
scribed above.   The kidneys call for treatment in greater detail.
This will form the subject             of another paper.

in two variables.                This      is a comparatively small class                        ;   but   if   there
be    added systems               consisting of          a single            equation of the third or
fourth degree and a number of others all of the first degree,                                                 it will
include        all     equations           which      admit, in              general,       of an algebraic
solution.
     The object         of these notes is to point out the advantage of making
greater       use,    than is generally the custom, of the discriminant in the
solution of           equations, and to emphasise                       the importance                 of looking
for geometrical             illustrations of analytical methods                             whenever this is
possible.             The nsefulness of such illustrations                               is well known               in
considering,           for example, limiting              cases        in the solution of equations,
such as the            cases of infinite roots and of equal roots, of the meaning
of which          it is almost impossible to form an adequate                                         conception,
without the use              of such illustrations.
     Consider          the system
      U   =
              <u?+2)u:V + by2 +                 2gz+2fy      +c=0                    1

     This system may be solved                        algebraically by eliminating one of
 the variables,            say    ?/,   and obtaining        a   biquadratic in x.                   This biquad
ratic may             in particular         cases be soluble by means of quadratics                                  ;
but, as       a    rule,    it   will require         the general                method       of solution, by
means         of      the reducing          cubic.       It will,          however,         in       almost     every
 case be        found simpler              to determine          A-   so   that      U   +A   V      shall resolve
 into factors.             The equation in           k   will     be of the third degree.                       It' the
 solution of the system
                                          (A)   can be made                in any way to depend                      on
 quadratics alone, the                  cubic in   k   must have at least one rational root,
 which can easily be                    obtained in every             case   ;   whereas the biquadratic
 m   x    will in general               have    no rational root at all.                      In       the general
 case, when            the solution of the system                  (A)       cannot be made to depend
  on quadratics            alone, the use of the cubic in                        k   will   save the trouble

   As    a last    illustration         consider the system *
                                     x2 +   y = a,               y2 +   x=b.

   Now in the general                    biquadratic                 (deprived       of its second term)
xi+pxs + qx +           r= 0, put           a:   =   Ay;      then
                               y*+(p/xV+(?A3)y+'-A4 = o.
  Xow pat q Xs = 1, that is                          k = qU3, and       the equation becomes
            y*             +    y+ r =      0, where p =p/X2 = p/q2'3,                     r     —
                                                                                                     r/f   '3.
  This may be identified                     with (1) by putting
        -1a—p' and               o2   -b =       r   ;   that    is   a=   -p'ft,      b   =     p'-ji   - r'.
Hence       the        general        biquadratic               may     be      solved           graphically         by
means       of   the    two parabolas                x2 +   y   = a and    y-    +x=       /».
  The advantage                 of this method                  is   that theso two parabolas                     only
vary as regards             position,        a       change       in a causing the first parabola
to move      along the y-axis, and                       a    change      in   b   the second parabola               to
move along         the x-axis.              In applying this method in                           practice        one of
the    parabolis might                 be drawn               permanently            on   a      sheet     of    paper
ruled    in squares        ;    and instead of shifting                        the   parabola         it   would be
sufficient       to change the position of the origin of coordinates.                                              The
second parabola would require to be drawn on                                          a    sheet         of tracing-
paper or         engraved on glass,              t
   The above method fails when the roots are equal in pairs, for in
this case         q    =   0.    This        is      also       evident        geometrically,            since     two
parabolas         cannot have double contact unless their axes are parallel.
Three roots             of the given biquadratic will                            be equal            when the two
parabolas         have contact of the second                           order.        The point of contact
will obviously lie on the line                        y     = x, and the           tangent at the point of

        The idea of using this                   system       of equations         for obtaining         a   graphical
solution of the general biquadratic                      is   due to Professor       C'hrystal.
 t      When this paper was read                 a    diagram was shown illustrating                   the graphical
 solution    of several biquadratics.

     So much has been written                              on    the       zodiacal light that                it   may

eye observations.                 The camera and telescope                         are.     fixed to      a   common
base movable about                   a   pivot concentric with the pillar carrying the
prism,      so   that they are readily interchanged.                                   The lenses are all of

jaws of the slit both move equally,                             so that        the      centre remains fixed
in position.        A        photographed scale can be thrown in in the ordinary
way, but      I    have found this useless when dealing with faint spectra,
since   any illumination                 which will render tho divisions                               visible quite

adopted        the    following, which           is probably not now, though                            I    have
never seen it         described.           The photographed scale is removed from
the end of its tube,              and is replaced by                 a   small slit witli adjustable
jaws.        The tube is then mounted on a vertical axis concentric with
a fixed      horizontal,     graduated circle.                 The tube is rigidly attached to
the arm carrying            the verniers of this circle.                      When the position of
any line has          to be determined, the                slit      is adjusted         so as to admit
just safikient        light to render its           reflected            image visible, and the tube
is rotated      till this image coincides with the line.                             It       is   of       course
easy to        adapt Prof. C. P. Smyth's illumination                               to    this arrange
ment.
   The attempts              bo    far made         to    photograpb            the zodiacal                 light
spectrum        have been total failures, but                   I    hope that the use of plates
with a greater         range of colour sensitiveness                      may yet prove successful.
   The spectrum              as     usually     seen      is    extremely faint,              so that the
observer ought           to prepare himself                for his work by remaining in                             a
dark     room for at least ten minutes                          before he attempts to make
observations,         but    if    this precaution be taken the spectrum can                                    be
seen     on any       clear night when there is no moonlight                                  and neither
Jupiter nor        Venus is very near the place of observation.                                                 As
ordinarily       seen, very little colour can be distinguished in the                                        spec
trum, but        under favourable conditions                     a       distinct tinge of red can be
observed.            Except on         a   few occasions the spectrum,                   as    I have         seen
 it,   was   continuous and quite free from bright Hum, but on several
nights       in 1883    I         saw what appeared                  to be     a   bright line.               The
 following extracts from                    my note-book give all the cases of this
 appearance.

 bright      band or     a    part of maximum brightness somewhat like that

   times quite invisible.
       April 2ith, 7.30          p.m. — Short collimator, high power eye-piece.
   Light clouds and         a   slight haze near the horizon, through which                  the
  Pleiades were dindy visible.                 Z.   L. not very bright, but extended
  through at        least    60°.     Spectrum        pretty    bright, and bright         line

  bringing end of         faintly illuminated scale to coincide, and then com
  paring solar lines with the scale on the morning of the 25th, every
  thing having been left unchanged.
      The position thus determined corresponded to a wave-length of
  558.     After this the spectroscope was fitted for photographic work,
  and plates were exposed             on  April 30th and May 1st; on the former
 for an hour, on the latter for an hour and                          a   half, but without
 any result.        The following          is the    note   for the latter of the two
  dates  : —

 Jupiter,     near    which       it  seemed      to   bifurcate.       Slight   haze   about
 horizon, but stars visible through it down to the horizon.                        Spectrum

At other      times the spectrum seemed to be banded.
     Since then      I have never seen         the least     trace of a line, though on
a   number of occasions           I  have had particularly          good opportunities of
examining the spectrum,               especially in January 1885, when               I  spent

above mean sea-level.            The notes made on that occasion include the
remark "certainly no bright lines."
    It appears, then, that in all my observations, which have been
carried on at       intervals since 1875,         the spectrum has appeared           con
tinuous and free       from bright lines       except during the spring of 18S3,
and that even then          the lines    were not seen with sufficient distinct
ness to make       their existence certain.           The estimated      position of the
supposed      line,   W. L. 558, differs but little from that of the auroral
line ("W.       L. 556-7) which was observed by Angstrom* in the
zodiacal     light spectrum in 1867.               He, however, was observing at
Upsala, where the          auroral spectrum        can often be seen      in almost all
parts of the       sky, even when the aurora itself cannot bo detected.
Senor A. T.        Acrimis,    f   observing at Cadiz, saw two bright lines in
the spectrum,        but since he     used a refractor and a five prism spectro
scope    it is almost         certain that it       was   not  the spectrum of          the
zodiacal    light that he saw. There would seem to be very little risk
 of  obtaining the auroral spectrum in Madras, and I think that if the
 bright line seen        was real and not imaginary it must have been due
 to the   zodiacal light.          It seems, too, to be in favour of its reality
 that my       own     prepossessions    — arising from hundreds of previous
 observations,        were entirely     against      the existence     of such    a   line.
 These    observations        are presented     to the Society with        great hesita
 tion, but as        they    were   made   with ever}' precaution that           I  could
 devise,   I   think    it best to place them on record.
     Another point with reference to the zodiacal light on which more
 detailed       and    accurate observations          are much needed        is its exact
 position      in the sky.        It was  only recently that        I   discovered how
 very unsatisfactory           existing   determinations       were,     and   I  do     not
 propose      at present to give any results of my own measurements.                       I
  wish, however, to call attention           to one or two points.            Very little
  weight can be laid on determinations of the inclination                     of the axis
  of the   light     made    in high latitudes, for Searle      has   shownj     that    the
  difference     in absorption    between   the upper and lower boundaries may
  produce        a  very    considerable    displacement of the apparent axis.
  Bat no such explanation             will account for the      differences     shown in

   The former * found that the axis of the light was inclined                        but
slightly   to the ecliptic, and that the extreme             positions of the   vertex
of the western cone were lat.              2° S. and lat.   6°  N., while the latter
states  f that   the inclination       to the ecliptic was often as much as 20°,
and that an error of 3° or           4°  in his ohservations is inadmissible.

the   ordinary     methods,       but   I   have   hopes    of getting a very fair
estimate of the inclination           of the axis by using     a  form of clinometer.
This   consists of a stand with levelling screws carrying a long               wooden

provided      with      an    arrangement for       clamping it at any required
angle.     The angle is measured by moans of               a  plumb line suspended
from the upper end.             I  find it possible to place this arm parallel to
the axis of the      light with considerable         accuracy.      At  the same time
it seems probable,         as  remarked by Searle, that no really satisfactory
determination of the position of the light will bo obtained except
by   a   careful photometric survey.              A   method of making such             a
survey has, however, still to be devised,                and    to  be satisfactory    it

striped muscle of the crab and lobster.                The muscle of the crab and

 ditions.     The   author is entirely opposed         to the opinions expressed
 by Melland, and more recently              by Gehuchten,      regarding the struc
 ture of the sarcous     matter, and maintains, as he did at the Inter
 national Medical CongTess         in  1881 (Transactions International           Jfetli-
cal C'ti'/rt^f, 1881, vol.     i.  p. 270), that the sarcous matter essentially
consists of     contractile fibrils, with an interstitial substance            between
them   —an opinion previously            expressed      by Kolliker and others,
and recently supported             by Rollett.       Fibrils are the contractile
elements in non-striped muscle.                Fluid is contained in the inter
stices of the      invisible micellar network of their seemingly homo
geneous protoplasm.          The shortening of the fibrils doubtless implies
a change     in the relative positions of the micellae in the networks,
but there is no evidence           of any shifting of tluid from          one part of
the fibril to another.        The fibrils of striped muscle are segmented,
and one    of the events of contraction is the shifting of fluid from one
segment to another.           Rich fibril     consists   of segments      arranged     in
linear series     in regular alternate        order.    Bowman's dement           is the
longest segment,       and appears      to be the     only one that is really con
tractile.     Its dimness      is   due   to   a  substance    resembling niyeline
 enclosed in a contractile tissue.            There is a node in the equator of
 Bowman's      element,    the position of which is sometimes              marked by
a   dim line described by Hensen, but the author                   finds no evidence
of any transverse        membrane       there    as described by some authors.
 Between     the ends of Bowman's elements              there   is a segment about
half the length        of Bowman's element,           termed     by the author the
 irJtnneiliate segment.         It  is a tissue containing       a  watery fluid, and
there is a      globule of myeloid substance            definitely located       in the
 equator   of the segment,         and marking the position of a node; the
author    finds    no evidence of a transverse           membrane      there,   such as
 Krause    and others have described.              Myeloid    substance     also some
 times occurs      throughout the shaft of the intermediate segment, but
 always   in smaller amount than in Bowman's element.                      The lateral
 coaptation of       the   central globules in neighbouring              intermediate
 segments produces        the line to which attention was first particularly
 directed   by Dobie     in  1848.      The intermediate segments           appear not
 to be contractile,      and probably serve as elastic buffers between the
 ends of    Bowman's elements when they approach each other during
  contraction.      A third     segment,     termed by the author the proper

mediate     segment, when the uncontracted               fibril   is stretched to    its f ul
physiological length.              It is almost quite clear, and appears             to con

myeloid substance belonging to the granule line described by Fldge]
as crossing the fibre in the light stripe.                    The whole fibril has a
thin   envelope.
   The first event of contraction consists                 in  a    shortening of    the in
terval between           the ends       of Bowman's elements,              which   in their
approximation           come      close   to the globule       of     Dobie's line.       The
shortening appears to result from an active absorption of fluid from
the   clear     and intermediate           segments    by Bowman's elements.                 In
the second         stage of contraction the fibril seems
                                                                          " homogeneous,"
unless    it   is   suitably stained and sufficiently magnified.                    In this
so-called    "homogeneous"             stage the ends      of Bowman's elements are
in close proximity             to the globule of        Dobie's line, which         is now
somewhat        flattened     ;  the myeloid substance           has not yet      begun     to
shift its place in Bowman's element.                    In    the     third  stage of    con
traction the myeloid substance                moves    away     from the shaft on each
side of the equatorial node                in Bowman's element,             accumulates in
its ends, and the element               shortens,    owing to       a  real contraction     of
its tissue.       There is a "reversal          of the stripes" in the contracted
fibre, as Flogel        first pointed out.         The dim stripe of the contracted
fibril  consists      of the approximated         ends    of two Bowman's elements
with the myeloid globule of the intermediate segment between them,
now much          flattened,     owing to lateral extension by the thickening
of the contracted           fibril.     The light stripe of the contracted fibril
consists     of the shaft of Bowman's element that has become clear,
owing to shifting           of the myeloid          substance       to  the ends of       the
element.        The myeloid substance appears                to be completely moved
to the ends of Bowman's elements                    only when their shafts contract
and squeeze it out           ;  but it begins     to move out of the shafts before
they contract.          The fluid absorbed          by the element         probably   passes
into the interstices of the micellar network;                  the myeloid substance
appears to be contained in a special set of spaces.                       The contraction
of the micellar network does not express the absorbed fluid, which
therefore does not leave Bowman's element                      until     its contraction   is
over.     The elasticity of Bowman's element and of the intermediate

 segment causes          them to return to their normal length after contrac
 tion, but does not             lead to the         appearance        of the proper clear               seg
 ment, which is only seen                when the fibrils             are forcibly extended               to
 their full physiological length.                       The phenomena            of contraction are
essentially       due to        vital changes occurring in              the tissue between               the
equator of Bowman's element and that of the intermediate segment.

             Changing, in each quaternion, the second                                                    V   into S, we get the
             series for    B(r,     s)    :    changing, in each quaternion, the first                                      V only into
             S, we get the series for Z(r, s)                                 :   changing throughout                      V into S, we
          get the series for S(r,                       s).
               In    the investigation we have to use series formed in exactly the

   On     an     Accidental Illustration of the Effective Ohmic
          Resistance to a Transient Electric Current through
          a Steel Bar.           By Sir "William Thomson.
                                  (Read March 17, 1890.)
      After the recent meeting            of the British Association            at Newcastle,
   Lord    Armstrong, in       showing me the appliances               by which his house
   at Cragside      is lighted electrically by water-power, told me of                   a  very
   wonderful      incident     which he had recently experienced.                     A bar of
   steel,  which he was holding             in his hand,       was allowed accidentally
   to come    in contact with the two poles of a dynamo in action.                            Hl

  158                Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                [sf.ss.
  instantly perceived            a  painful   sensation of burning, and let the        "bar
  drop.        He found his hand or          fingers,  where it had touched the       bar,
  severely blistered.             The bar itself was found immediately after
 wards to be quite cold, or not perceptibly hot.                        This was a very
 marvellous incident.               It proved (1) the outer surface of the steel
 to have         been     intensely heated      ; (2) that not enough        of heat  was
 generated          to sensibly      warm   the    whole   bar.    The   explanation,    of
 course, was to be found               in the known      laws of diffusion of     electric
 currents, through non-magnetic conductors, considered in connection
with      the effect of magnetic           susceptibility   of unknown amount         and
 law, in conductors of steel or iron.
      Lord       Armstrong's       accidental experiment seemed to me such a
very instructive             illustration   of fundamental       principles of electro
magnetic          induction,      that  I wrote to him asking his permission to
communicate it to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, at the same time
inquiring          as  to some details.        In reply I immediately received a
letter, of date 7th March, kindly giving the desired permission, and
containing the following very interesting statement : —
      " I  send you, by parcel post, the steel (not iron) bar which                I held
 '•
      when it accidentally short-circuited the current.                You will observe
 " two little hollows,* which were burnt out of the metal at the
" instant of contact, and these mark the distance between the points
" of      contact.         The bar was held by my fingers midway between
" these two marks, and the, burns were inflicted at the
                                                                            places where
" my                                                The sudden pain caused me to
           fingers touched the metal.
"    dash      the bar instantaneously           to  the ground, and an        attendant
" immediately picked it               up and     found it quite cold.       Three of my
"

explanation of Lord Armstrong's wonderful experiment.
     To find something towards                    a    mathematical solution for                     the in
creasing current at any instant during the electric contact                                         of Lord
Armstrong's experiment,                 it   is   convenient first to solve the problem
of finding the subsidence                 of current initially given in                       a    circuit of
two very long parallel bars connected by end bridges, or in a circuit
of one long bar insulated within                        a   conducting sheath except at its
ends, which are in metallic connection with the sheath.
     In all    cases   of electric currents given in parallel straight lines,
and left to subside,* without any other electromotive force                                        than that
of their mutual electro-magnetic                       induction,           the thermal analogy               is
exceedingly convenient.                      For       electric    conductivity,              c,   we   have
thermal capacity divided by 4tt                        ;    for magnetic permeability,                       the

plicated by magnetic retentiveness, hysteresis according                            to Ewing's
designation,        no accurate mathematical              investigation         is practicable
with only our present                 knowledge      of the requisite data for the
diffusion of electric currents through an iron or steel conductor.
     Taking for iron or steel sr = 300, and, as above, a =                        "7,   b = 7,   we
find A =1/130 of a, or 1/187 of a centimetre.   Now, because X is
so small a fraction as 1/130 of the radius of the rod, we see that
the current-densityat the surface (or surface-temperature in the
thermal analogue) drops nearly to zero, while there is still but a
relatively        small diminution of current-density
                                                 (or temperature in
the thermal analogue) farther in from the surface than a distance of
1/10 of the radius.            Hence, for the roughly approximate investiga
tion with       which we must          be content, we may be satisfied                   with    the
very simplifying         supposition      of X = 0.
      If   we take 10,000         cg.s. (or    squarecentimetres per second) as
the      resistivity   t of   steel    or iron, we must divide this by 300 x 4-ir
to find the diffusivity for electric current (thermal diffusivity, or
conductivity divided by thermal capacity of unit volume, in the
thermal        analogue), which therefore is              2 "7       square   centimetres per
second.          This is only about         12 times the thermal                 diffusivity of
heat in iron (which is -225 of                 a square centimetre               per second).

see that at 1/2 centimetre from the initiational surface (supposed
plane) the amount of the falling oft" is 16 per cent, of the whole.
 Hence in our   iron or steel rod (on the supposition X = 0) the
current at 1/4300 of a second from the beginning, and at 1/20 of a
centimetre from the surface, would have fallen off by                                 16    per cent
of its given amount.            Thus we judge that during the first                      /4000 of

diffusion follows sensibly the law of plane laminar diffusion.
      The supposition of        a    circular cylindric sheath of infinite electric
conductivity,     coaxal with the             rod considered,           and separated from it
by the insulating        material,        which we have adopted for the sake of
simplicity and definiteness,              may be departed               from, and instead               we
may substitute any conductor parallel to the rod considered, pro
vided that the distance              between        the two is a considerable                   multiple
of the greatest      diameter        of either.           In virtue of this proviso, the
distribution    of current-density is necessarily but very little disturbed
from the equality at equal distances                     from the axis of the rod, which
was provided for by the supposition of a cylindric sheath.                                       If    the
second      conductor is of the same diameter                     and of the same material
as the first,   and placed at        a distance          2a from       it,   the expression        for   A
will   be the same as that given above.
  Now, instead of the great simplicity of                         a    current, generated              (no
matter how), aud given initially                    as   a   steady current, through                   the
circuit of two long parallel conductors and the end-bridges between
them   ;   suppose the conductors and one end-bridge to be given                                   with
no current, and let      a   voltaic battery be suddenly applied instead of
the other end-bridge.           If   the difference          of potentials maintained by
the    latter between     the       ends      to which       it   is   applied be absolutely
constant,     the rise   of the current through the                          parallel conductors
from its initial zero to its ultimate steady amount will follow nearly
the same law as the fall from the                   initial    steady current to the final
zero in our former simple case                :   exactly the same law           if   the quantity
of positive electricity on one conductor, and of negative                                  electricity
on the other, called forth according to electro-static                          law, in virtue of
the gradient of potential,          is   nothing in comparison with the quantity
flowing through the circuit.                  The quantity             of electricity       required

   for the    static  electrification   is not negligible in a large variety of
  telegraphic and telephonic          problems.*       In the ocean cable problem
  it is of paramount        importance    ;  and the electro-magnetic         induction
  with which we are now occupied is negligible.                    In   shorter cables
  and high-speed        action both, the electro-static        and   electro-magnetic
 induction must be taken into account,                  and  both have been very
 practically    taken into account by Heaviside               in the mathematical
 theory of the telephone.
     In   a vast     variety of laboratory experimental arrangements                   the
 currents     required for the static charges are quite negligible.                     In
such a case as that        of Lord Armstrong's experiment,            the quantity of
electricity required         for producing or changing the electrification of
every part of the circuits or           of the conductors       concerned     is clearly
quite insensible        in comparison with        the quantity which must have
flowed through the bar to produce              the observed     heating effect.
     But although we are not troubled with any difficulty in respect
 to electro-static      charge, we have in Lord Armstrong's              case    circum
 stances    of such extreme complexity that it is of no use to attempt
 to weak     out a complete mathematical theory.                It  seems probable,
 however, that the solution          indicated above, and represented              by my
 •Utfusion    diagram, fairly illustrates the circumstances of the current
 which actually flowed through the steel bar, though scarcely with any
 approach     to quantitative     correctness.      At all  events we have a very
 striking illustration     of what really took      place, and ample explanation
 of the   intensity and suddenness of the effect perceived by Lord Arm
 strong,   by working out the result numerically of what would take place
 if  a  difference    of potentials of      100 volts were     suddenly instituted,
and    forcedly maintained         constant during one or two or three ten
 thousandths of a second          between     two points of the bar         15  J   centi
metres      asunder.      This with any      reasonable     assumption      as    to the
magnetic permeability           of the iron      or steel bar, and its diffusivity
for electric     currents, is easily done        on the supposition        k=     0, and
the   solution conveniently represented by the diffusion diagram.
    We must not, however, suppose               that the difference     of potentials
between      the two points of the steel bar touched by the main elec
trodes   of the dynamo was in reality constant at 103 volts, oven for
so  long a time as two or three ten thousandths of a second.                What was

been      the strength of the current through the electrodes                               leading
from the complex dynamo-circuit                       of armature and of shunt and
series coils of the electro-magnet,                 to the external permanent electric
lighting circuit and temporary circuit through the                          steel bar.            The
difference          of potentials between          the two points of the steel touched
must have been at first 103 volts, and must have fallen very rapidly,
while the current which it produced in the steel rose from 0 to 85
amperes,            against ohmic resistance           sinking     from     infinity towards
•000137  of an ohm (this being the actual resistance of Lord Arm
strong's bar to a current running full-bore through      as  have               it,        I
found by measurement).
  The immense quasi-inertia of each partial circuit within the dynamo
forbids the supposition that there can have been any great augmenta
tion of tho outgoing current during the few hundredths of a second
of the short-circuiting                by the steel bar   ;   and, possibly with no prac
tical error, we may suppose that current to have been constant during
the whole time.                 Hence, at each instant tho electric lighting circuit
must have lost just as much current as that which was passing
through the steel               bar.       Hence, considering        the   smallness of the
quasi-inertia of the electric lighting circuit, the 85 amperes through
it   before the accident must, after two or three ten-thousandths                                of   a
second,        have     been very nearly annulled, and, therefore, very nearly
a    constant current of 85 amperes                  must have passed for the rest of
the time through tho outer skin of the steel bar.*                              We have thus

     This suggests an interesting and, happily, an easy problem regarding
electro-magnetic  induction in rectilinear electric current through a conductor
surrounded by an insulator.     Let the electromotive action, whatever its kind,
be so regulated that the integral amount of current crossing the normal section
of the conductor    kept constant.

no difficulty in understanding                  that there should have been amply
sufficient current through                  an exceedingly thin shell of the bar to
produce rery suddenly the high                       temperature         of the surface which
Lord Armstrong perceived, and yet that the total amount of heat
generated          was insufficient          to heat    the bar to any sensible degree
after the second          or two required for the thermal diffusion (diffusivity
"225 of a sq.          cm. per 6ec), to spread it nearly uniformly through the
body of the bar.             The heat lost        outside the bar by surface emissivity
(which is about 1/4000                 of    a gramme water thermal                 unit   per second
per sq.    cm of surface per degree of excess) would be quite ineffective
to considerably    diminish the whole quantity in the time required for
diffusion to nearly equal temperature                          throughout the bar.                If   the
dynamo had              been doing no work externally                       at the time of the
accident, the time required to get up a strong enough                                      current out
of the dynamo            to produce much heating effect would have been very
much       longer than           it   was.     The result to Lord Armstrong                       might
not have been            very noticeably different from what it was, but the

 On the Segmentation            of the Nucleus of the Third Cranial
     Nerve.      By   Dr Alexander Bruce.              (With Two Plates.)

    The   circumstance that       the oculomotor       or  third cranial nerve
supplies no fewer than seven            muscles    of the eye, two of        them
intrinsic and five extrinsic, and the fact that these muscles may be
paralysed either       singly or    in   groups    as  the   result of    central
lesions,  naturally    suggest   that each muscle       is represented     in the
micleus by a separate        group of nerve cells.          Hitherto,  however,
the   anatomical     text-books    have   been    content with figuring         the
nucleus   as  a  small indefinite group of cells lying in the anterior
portion of the grey matter surrounding the aqueduct of Sylvius.
   The well-known       experiments of Hensen and Volckers             {Graefe,8
Archiv, Bd. xxiv., 1878,       p. 1) would appear to have been the first
attempt to investigate the question. They exposed the nucleus in
the dog, and by stimulating its various portions with electricity,            they
came to the      conclusion    that   the   centres   of the various muscles
were arranged     from above downwards in the following order            : —

   In  1881   Kahler and Pick (Prag. ZeUschrift           f. Heilhunde, Bd.      ii.
p.   30), from the      observations of two        clinical  cases of paralytic
lesions of the muscles, were led to adopt          a  somewhat different, and
what appears a      priori  to   be a more     natural arrangement.         They
placed the centres in a median and a lateral group, as follow            :—

     This   appears a    more natural grouping, from the fact that the three
elevators of the eye         and    eyelid, which habitually act together, are
placed      in juxtaposition,        whereas,    as  has   been   pointed     out by
Manthner        in his    Kudearldhmung, Hensen and Volckcrs                   placed
a depressor,      the rectus inferior, between       two elevators,    thus separat
ing    it  also    from its    associated   centre,   that for superior oblique.
Kahler and Pick found             in  one case    in which the elevators         were
paralysed that the most external            of the hinder (or lowermost) roots
of the third nerve had degenerated,            and in another case of paralysis
affecting the rectus internus that the postcro-median rootlets were
degenerated.          Manthner (Nuclearlahvuintj) is inclined to accept the
arrangement         of nuclei just described. Yon Gudden (Tgbltt. der

the same side,        the dorsal or posterior with that of the opposite side.
Thus the right        third nerve would      arise from     the right ventral and
 the left dorsal      nucleus.     He further divided the ventral into two
 parts, an   anterior (i.e., nearer the cerebrum        1) and a posterior portion.

    Edinger      (WestphaTs Archiv,        1885, p.     858) describes a median
nucleus     lying between the two principal            nuclei, which sends fibres
to each of the       two nerves.      Darkschewitsch (Neurolog. Centralblatt,

 of the posterior      longitudinal fasciculus, which he regards as probably
 forming part of the oculomotor nucleus,
     Westphal (Arch.       f. psychiatrie, xviii.    p.  847) found in a case of
 ophthalmoplegia         externa that the main          part of the oculomotor
 nucleus was degenerated,          while two other groups of nuclei remained
 normal.      One of these lay a little to the side of the raphe, and is
 named medial         by "Westphal.      The other,     or lateral, lies somewhat
 external     to the posterior       extremity of the medial nucleus.              He
 apparently     does not recognise      a nucleus     altogether in the median
  plane.    (Westphal's paper contains a very exhaustive account of the

the nucleus.)
    A considerable body of evidence                  has thus accumulated       in favour
of an anatomical segmentation                  of the nucleus in question, but            no
two authors seem to be agroed on the                     position and number of the
segmented groups.              To investigate the point further,         I made    a  series
of transverse       vertical sections        of the brain of      a human foetus,      from
the lower border of the fourth to the upper margin of the third,
nucleus    ;    and a second           series,    from   an adult     human      brain,    ot"
longitudinal       transverse       sections    through the same nuclei.          The first
scries   is    the   more      instructive.        The   divisions   of  the  nuclei     are
 represented       in    figures     1-8   ;  one     of the   longitudinal    transverse
 sections    is shown       in   figure 9.     From these and the special descrip
 tion of the plates which follows, it will be seen that the nucleus                        of
 the nerve to the superior oblique muscle which lies below the most
 inferior part of the nucleus of the third nerve bears the same rela
 tion to the posterior longitudinal fasciculus as does the latter nucleus,
 but is always to be distinguished from it by the direction taken by
 its root fibres, which pass outwards and backwards along the border
 of the central grey matter and the formatio reticularis, while                          the
 rootlets of the third nerve always arise from its anterior (ventral)
 surface, and pass at once directly forwards.
     Coming to the nucleus under special consideration, we distinguish
  the following      groups      : —
                             A. An anterior         group.
                             B.    A  postero-external group.
                              C.   A median nucleus.
                              D. A postero-internal         nucleus.
                              E. A superior nucleus.
     A. The anterior or ventral group, which extends along                     the greater
  part of the nucleus (being absent only at its extreme upper termina
  tion), lies in relation to the innermost part of the main body of the
  posterior longitudinal            fasciculus, and bears the same relation to it
  throughout.         It   is  distinctly     segmented,     and may be divided into
  an  inferior    nucleus (fig. 2,       III.   i.n.), characterised by the absence of
  commissural fibres            between the two sides,             and a main       nucleus,
   which is again capable of being subdivided                   into at least three parts

 in    virtue of its     relation to the median nucleus.                Of  these three, the
 lotf&t (fig. 3) lies below the level of the median nucleus,                       and has a
 highly developed             system of commissural fibres;                the intermediate
(fig.     4, and    fig. 5,   ILL    a.n.) lies at the same level as the median
nucleus, and          has also, at least in its lower portion, a well-developed
commissural          system; while the upper division lies at a higher plane
than      the median          nucleus,    and has extremely scanty              commissural
connections          with its fellow        (figs.   6 and 7). The anterior nucleus
attains its      largest dimensions at its lowest extremity (figs. 3 and 4),
the point at        which the commissural system is most highly developed.
It   gradually diminishes            in  size as    it ascends.      It   is seen on longi
tudinal transverse             sections to be imperfectly segmented               from what
I have       termed the          inferior nucleus      ;   this is of somewhat         smaller
size than       the adjacent         portion of the anterior group.               The upper
extremity       of the nucleus under consideration is seen to fade gradu
ally away,        its volume and the number of cells diminishing                        almost
pari passu.           It   terminates altogether at a slightly lower plane than
 does a     group of cells to be afterwards described as the superior or
 small-celled       nucleus.
     B. The postero-lateral group is formed of motor cells of the same
 liie and type as those            of the anterior group.          It  lies on the posterior
 surface     of the     longitudinal fasciculus,          near its outer extremity.          Its
 length is     considerably less than that of the anterior group.                      Below,
 it begins    slightly above the inferior extremity of the median nucleus                        ;
 while above,         it is    replaced   by the superior or small-celled nucleus.
 It   begins, below, as a small circular group of nerve cells, distinctly
 separated      from        the anterior group (fig.           5, p.l.n.),   and gradually
 increases     in size upwards, attaining                its maximum         near   its upper
 extremity (fig. 6,         p.l.n.).    I have     given the name of external          nucleus:
  (fig.  5,  III.     l.n.) to a group situated external to the middle and
  upper part      of the postero-lateral group, partly between, and partly
  outside the      longitudinal       fasciculus.       This is much shorter than           the
 postero-lateral        nucleus, lying opposite its middle third.
      C. The    median nucleus (fig.            4, and fig. 5,    m.n.) lies in the middle
 line opposite          the intermediate portion of the anterior group.                      Its
  °pper    portion       (fig. 5, m.n.) has the shape            of an elongated spindle
  tapering     anteriorly        to  a sharp point, while           the posterior end          is
  somewhat      rounded.           A line drawn transversely between the centres

 tremity       of the median nucleus.                       The upper portion of the median
 nucleus is hounded laterally by fine niedullated fibres which arise
 from its nerve cells and pass along its outer surface                                       forwards              to
 enter,    partly, the root of the nerve, and partly the posterior                                      longi
 tudinal fasciculus.                It    is also connected        with     the     adjacent portions
 of the anterior group by                     a fine   network of medullated fibres.                         The
 lower part of the median nucleus (fig. 4) has an irregularly circular
 outline.  It has no lateral boundary of nerve fibres.
      D. The postero-internal or pale nucleus (figs. 5, 6,                                   7,    9,   p.i.n.)
 presents          in   sections    of the adult brain which have been stained                              by
 Weigert's              hematoxylin           a    remarkably      pale         appearance.             It         is
 wedged        in   between         the median and postero-external nuclei (see fig.
 5,   p.i.n.), but extends                to a higher level than the former.                            It    ter
 minates       above        by     a large     club-shaped head            (fig.   9, fig.        7).   (This
apparently              corresponds to the             medial nucleus of "Westphal.)                          Its
 pallor       is    due    to      the    comparative absence               of medullated               fibres
between,           and the large lymph                 spaces which          surround, the nerve
cells contained in it.                    These cells differ from those of the other
group, being more oval or rounded, containing large spherical nuclei
having fewer processes, and staining of                           a    much fainter brown by
Weigert's method.
      E. The superior (or small-celled nucleus of Darkschewitsch) lies
at the extreme upper extremity of the oculomotor nucleus, forming
a   small indefinitely circumscribed group at the outer margin of the
posterior longitudinal                   bundle.       It   deserves   a   special name from its
distinct       segmentation from the postero-lateral group and from the
small size of its cells.                 It   is   imbedded among the fibres of the outer
portion of the posterior longitudinal                          fasciculus, many of the fibres
of which evidently terminate in its cells, and                          it      forms the terminus
of many of the fibres of the posterior commissure.

partially the statements                  of Kahler and Pick           as to       the origins of the
nerve.        The roots of the postero-lateral and external group of nuclei
form the most external fibres of the nerve as                              it   passes through               the
tegmentum.               They constitute, however, the upper                         as   well as the
lower external fibres.                   The anterior nucleus sends its roots into                           the
innermost part of the nerve, while fibres from the median and                                             the

 postern-internal nuclei enter the innermost part of the nerve opposite
 the upper half of the nucleus.                I  have   searched   in vain for any
decussation        of the roots as described by Von Gudden in the rabbit.
     While it is certainly premature to express any positive opinion                  as
to the functions         of the various nuclei described,       there would appear
to be ground (see           AVestphal's case,    loe. cit.) for the belief that the
inferior, anterior,        and posterolateral      (including external) groups of
nuclei are       connected with the extrinsic          muscles   of the eyeball and
the elevator        of the eyelids, and that the median and the postero
internal nuclei are the centres             for accommodation and contraction
of the pupil           If  the view of Kahler       and  Pick   be correct,  then the
 postero-lateral       group will form the centres for the elevators, while
the anterior nucleus will be connected with the internal rectus, and
 the inferior nucleus with inferior rectus.                With regard to the two
 central groups,        the median and postero-internal, the evidence seems
 ta be    insufficient    for the view which would        place the accommodation
  centre    at a   higher level than that for the contraction of the pupil.
  The circumstance           that a nuclear lesion seems invariably to affect
  tke    accommodation         of both eyes, while a similar lesion may un
  doubtedly       affect   the sphincter iridis of one side alone, seems best
  explained      by the view that the accommodative act is controlled
  from one centre,         while there   are two centres for the contraction          of
  the   pupil.     If   this view be correct, then the median nucleus may
  form the centre        for accommodation and         the postero-internal necleus
  that for    pupil-contraction.        In  this respect the intimate relation of
  position    of the median nucleus to the main portion of the anterior
  nucleus (the      supposed centres for the associated acts of accommoda
  tion and convergence)          is of interest.
                                Description of Plates.
      Fig. 1 shows    the nuclei (IV. ».) of the two fourth nerves lying imbedded
   amongst the     outermost fibres of the posterior longitudinal fasciculus (pd.f.).
   Its root (IV. r.) is distinguished from that of the third nerve by passing from
   ttie postero-external     aspect outwards and backwards,        along the anterior
   margin of the grey matter surrounding the aqueduct          of Sylvius.   From the
   inner aspect of the nuclei, fibres (t.f.) pass inwards and forwards to enter the
    bundles of the posterior longitudinal fasciculus.     The anterior parts of the two
    posterior longitudinal fasciculi meet so as to form a process shaped like the
    capital letter U.     Into the anterior surface of this U-shaped process there

 peduncles.)
    Fig. 2. Section made almost immediately above the preceding one, through
 the lowest portion of the nucleus of the third nerve.          The inferior extremity
 of the nucleus (III. i.n.) is seen lying upon the dorsal aspect of the posterior
 longitudinal fasciculus.      At this level none of the root fibres are visible, but
 on the inner aspect there are seen fibres (i.o.f.) passing forwards to join the
 anterior fibres of the posterior longitudinal fasciculus.           The two sets of
 anterior fibres converge towards each other in the shape of the letter V.         They
 appear to be genetically different from the fibres of the main part of the
 fasciculus, for fine medullated fibres pass from their anterior surface across the
 middle line, forwards, to disappear either in the superior cerebellar peduncle,
 or, what is more probable, to terminate in a nucleus situated on the inner side
 of each of these tracts, or perhaps in a group of medullated fibres lying still
 nearer the anterior surface.      (These are not represented in the drawing. )       At
 this level there are no commissural fibres between the two nuclei, a fact which
 seems to warrant our separating this as a distinct portion of the nucleus, the
 inferior oculomotor nucleus.
    Fig. 3. Section is made at a level slightly above that of the preceding
 through that part of the nucleus at which intercommissural fibres (cf.) begin
 to appear.     An oval-shaped nucleus lies on cither side dorsally to the posterior
 longitudinal fasciculus.     Fine fibres form a rich network between the two nuclei.
 A large group of medullated fibres (a.o.f.) originates in the interior of the
 nucleus and passes inwards and forwards, internally to the V-shnped portion
 of the posterior longitudinal        fasciculus.   The fibres which arise from the
 anterior surface of this V-shaped portion pass forwards to the opposite side in
a manner similar to that described in Plate II., but appeared now in the section
from which the drawing was made, rather to end in a group of fibres imme
diately anterior and internal to the superior cerebellar peduncle.         (In addition
to these, other fibres were, seen, after crossing the middle line, to bend back
wards and outwards and become continuous with the fibres known as the deep
fibres of the corpora quadrigemina.)         This part of the nucleus (III. a.n.) forms
the lower part of the anterior group.
    Fig. 4. The section is made through the inferior extremity of the median
nucleus    (III. m.n.). The two anterior nuclei still continue to be united by
intercommissural fibres.       The anterior nucleus is distinctly increased in size.
It forms a compact oval-shaped group slightly imbedded in the posterior longi
tudinal fasciculus.      Fibres passing from its inner aspect forwards into the
V-shaped portion of the fasciculus are still well seen. In the median line,
dorsal to the intercommissural fibres, is the lower extremity of the median
nucleus (III. m.n.).      At this level it has a very indefinite form and outline,
and the cells are interspersed by a line net-work of medullated fibres.         Among
the fibres of the outer portion of the posterior longitudinal fasciculus, motor
cells are scattered in such numbers as to deserve a special name.                I have
accordingly termed these the external nucleus (III. en.). The posterior
longitudinal fasciculus, both in its posterior or oblique and in its anterior or
V-shaped portion, shows a notable increase in the number of its fibres.             Part
of this is due to fibres entering its anterior aspect from the various sources
already indicated, but more markedly to the increase of connections with the
higher levels of nucleus on the same side.            The condition of the vascular
supply of the nucleus in the section from which the drawing was made is of

the median       nucleus,   while another, placed laterally to the above, ran to each

want of space.

a loog spindle tapering         more gradually towards its posterior thnn towards
its anterior extremity.         It has on either side a bundle of medullated fibres
arising among its cells and running forwards towards the V-shaped portion
of the posterior longitudinal fasciculus.            Some of these fibres evidently arise
from this latter structure, while others as certainly pass through it and enter
into the innermost root fibres of the nerve.              The anterior nncleus (III. a.n.)
 is seen lying upon the posterior surface of the innermost three-fourths of the
 posterior longitudinal fasciculus.           Behind the anterior group lies a second
 smaller almost circular group of nerve cells, the postero-external            (III. p.e.n. ),
 of a similar shape and size.               This lies behind the outermost fourth of
 the posterior longitudinal fasciculus.             From its anterior surface a bundle
  of fibres passes inwards and forwards between                the median nucleus and the
 anterior group, insinuating         itself between the lateral fibres of the median
  nucleus and fibres arising       from the internal surface of the anterior group.
  Most of these fibres from the postero-external nucleus seem to terminate in
  the Y-shaped portion of the posterior longitudinal fasciculus of the same side.
  It is possible that some of them may join the innermost root fibres of the
  third nerve, but it is certain that none of them cross the middle line to enter
  the nerve of the opposite side.         The root fibres from this nucleus pass through
   the underlying portions of the posterior longitudinal fasciculus and enter the
   outermost part of the nerve.          A small group of nerve cells (external nucleus,
   '.5,; lies on the outer side of the posterior part of the posterior longitudinal
   funiculus.     In the wedge-shaped space, left between the posterior part of the
   median nucleus on the inner side and the posterior nucleus with its ventral
   fibres on the outer, lies a large nucleus (p.i.n. ), to which I have given the name
   of the postero-intemal      or pale nucleus.       It is characterised by its cells being
  (V)     considerably smaller than those        of   the   lateral groups, (2) staining less
   intensely    by  Weigert's method, (3) by the cells being surrounded by large
    lymph spaces, and (4) by their having              a comparatively slight intercellular
    network of medullated fibres.          The external nucleus (III. c.n.)    is   seen asa
    small nearly circular group of cells partly imbedded and partly external to the
    outermost portion of posterior longitudinal fasciculus (p.l.f.).

      anterior aspect of the three groups of nuclei towards the innermost portions of
      the posterior longitudinal    fasciculus. Some undoubtedly enter the roots of
       the nerve, others become connected with the fasciculus.

     Histologists        have   long ago demonstrated that            a  muscle is not    a
 simple histological unit, and that it consists of innumerable muscle
 fibres associated together in fasciculi, each muscle fibre being brought
into individual relationship with the central nervous system                         by its
own fibre.           Physiologists       have been    too apt to overlook        this fact,
and have regarded             a muscle as a simple          indivisible physiological
unit.       "When a muscle or its nerve are stimulated by an instantaneous
electrical shock all the librcs contract together,                     for they are all
stimulated in the same way, and at the same time.                        This   is not the
case,    according to the investigations of the author, when the muscle
contracts retlexly           or   voluntarily,     ami especially during any pro
longed contrac tion.            The individual fibres are then never completely
co-ordinated together,            and vary constantly in their " pull."              They

         appears            that the           fibres running        in   a   fasciculus are more           co-

   <     of    strong             salt solution      to one spot on the side of the sciatic
lerve.         After         a     minute or       so the fibres          within one fasciculus will
Itritch, then those                     within another, and          so on     until the whole muscle
twitches.              This        is   no doubt       due to the gradual invasion of the
pierve       by the salt solution,                    the nerve fibres lying together, and
 berefore           stimulated together,              all passing to the         same fasciculus.
   Inasmuch,                 therefore, as during           a   voluntary contraction fascicular

 These tracings alwayB                     show superimposed upon the main curve tiny,

 osculations             to indicate that the muscle as a whole                     is    in incomplete
 tetanus           during voluntary contraction, due to its receiving                             a     series

kept in oscillation at its own period, just as a swing                will be kept
swinging     when even occasional pushes            are given.      The complete
demonstration      of this truth is obtained by changing the                  record
ing    apparatus,   when     not only      will  the   oscillations be changed,
but they will be found to correspond with the period of the                         in
strument used       in   every    case.   This period     can    be   obtained      by
tapping the instrument,          and causing it to record         its own     oscilla
tions.     Loven   lias obtained variations in the           electromotive force
of a muscle during           voluntary     contraction  ;  these    variations      are
described as periodic, and are believed to support the view held as
to tho interrupted nature of the nerve impulses passing to a                 muscle.
His results differ from        those    of other observers      in  respect    to  the
period of his variations, and probably his results are due                    to the
period of the electrometer        he used.
    If then  the muscle sound, the results obtained by Loven, and the
tracings obtained by the use of levers, can all be explained by                   the
fact that the fasciculi within      a muscle are not completely co-ordinated,
there remains no proof        that   a  voluntary muscular contraction is            of
the nature of a tetanus.
Muscular Contraction following rapid Electrical Stimula

     Kronecker, Hall, Schiifer, Horsley, and others have found, when
 stimulating the spinal cord with rapid induced currents (ten, twenty,
 thirty, forty times per second), that the muscles              always responded
 by giving    a curve   showing oscillations of one invariable period, no
 matter what tho period of the stimulation may have been.                       "With
 rapid stimulation,      tho   muscles     in the hands of       the   first   named
 observers   gave oscillations of twenty        a second,   in the hands of        the
 latter observers of ten     a second.      These results are to be explained
 in the following     way.    When the central nervous            system    is stiniu

 lated, the muscles        contract    but never smoothly, for local fascicular
 movement,        as  the author has elsewhere            shown, always occurring.
 These cause the        registering apparatus to oscillate at its own period,
just as any swinging             body may be kept in motion by occasional
disturbances.         We       can thus explain how each              observer    obtained
 the    same     number       of oscillations every time             he   stimulated the
nervous       system    ;   it   was because        he   used     the    same    recording
 apparatus each        time.      "We can also see that the different periods
observed by        different     observers are due to the fact that they each
 used    a   different     recording      apparatus.      The author finds that on
 changing       the recording        apparatus     (lever or tambour) the tracing
 obtained can be         changed at will, and is practically a tracing of the
 oscillating period        of the instrument       used.
     On one       occasion the author was stimulating                  the upper dorsal
 region of the      cord    of  a rabbit  thirty times    a second,    and was surprised
 to find that,     in addition      to the main oscillations of the tambour just
 described, there        were finer oscillations at the rate of thirty            a second.
 These     disappeared on           changing the tambour or on                slowing    the
  electrical   interrupter,       or on quickening its 6peed.              They were evi
  dently due to       the tambour having some higher overtone of thirty                    a
  second at    which      it  could oscillate   ;   why other observers         had failed
 to   obtain responses from the muscles               synchronous with their stimu
 lation period       was because their levers and tambours were unable to
 respond.        "While the author was unable to obtain curves showing
 a   higher period than           thirty  a second, yet the stethoscope furnished
  evidence    that changes go on within a muscle synchronous with stimuli
  applied at a     much greater rate than thirty a second.                When     the cord
  or peduncles are         stimulated one or two hundred times               a second,   the
  muscles    respond by giving a note of exactly the same pitch.
      The ear gives better evidence                of the nature of the muscular
 response     than do such registering apparatus              as   tambours and levers.
  Nevertheless,       if  one is fortunate enough to get a tambour which has
  itself some period corresponding to the period of stimulation,                       it is
  quite capable       of registering     the effects which       follow stimuli applied
  twenty or       thirty times     a second.      If  the  tambours do not respond
   in the way        indicated, they merely oscillate at their                own slowest
   period.     The oscillations are kept up in this case not only by such
    of the motions        of the muscle, trembling           at a quicker rate, as can

   Potassium ethyl adipate was prepared            by adding the calculated
quantity of alcoholic potash to an alcoholic solution of adipic ether,
and boiling.    After  the alcohol had been driven            off on the water-
bath, the residue, when shaken up with water and ether, yielded an
aqueous solution which after concentration was used for electrolysis.
   The electrolysis was conducted in precisely the same manner as
in our former syntheses.*        A  colourless oil was observed to collect
on the top of the solution.       After completion of       the electrolysis, the
contents of the crucible used       as  cathode     were extracted by ether,
which was subsequently distilled         off and the residual oil kept for
some hours at    120\    When hot this oil smells of melted butter, but
on cooling the fatty odour disappears,         a very slight smell resembling
melons being left.     The boiling-point        of the oil is 307° (uncorr.).

   The substance has thus the composition of sebacic ether.
   A portion of it   was saponified     by means of alcoholic potash, the
potassium   salt separating out on boiling.          The acid obtained from
this salt by precipitation with hydrochloric          acid was found to melt

 On the Relation         of Optical Activity to the Character of
        the  Radicals united to the Asymmetric Carbon Atom.
       By Professor Crum Brown.
                                (Read June 2, 1890.   )
    It is obvious    that the amount of the optical activity of             a given
compound containing         an asymmetric atom of carbon depends upon
the amount      of difference in character among the four radicals united
to the asymmetric carbon           atom, so that      if two of them      are very
nearly equal       we come very near to a compound of                 a symmetric
carbon atom,       in which the optical activity is zero. The question
suggests    itself, How are we to measure this difference of character 1
We shall assume          that there is a function,         capable of numerical
representation,      derivable   from the composition          and constitution   of
the   radical and the temperature of the substance, and that it is the
 difference between the values          of this function in the        case  of two
 radicals which gives us the difference of character referred to.                For
 the sake    of brevity, we may call this function the            k of the radical.
 The object of this paper is to Bhow that,         if   there be such a function,
 there are    methods by means        of which we may hope to ascertain its
 value in each case.
     Let us represent the compound              by the formula       (C)ABrA, in
 which (C) represents       the asymmetric carbon atom,            and A, B, T, A
 the radicals    united to  it arranged in order of        the values  of k.   Now
 these radicals   may be united to the asymmetric carbon atom in either
             A                         B       B                        A
 of two ways.        One of these ways        — we have       as yet no means     of
 guessing    which — corresponds to       right>handed      rotation, the other to
 left-handed rotation.        The   one form can he changed into the other

by interchanging the positions of any two of the radicals.                                                       Now we
cannot directly interchange the positions of two radicals by                                                          any
method such that we can be sure which radicals have been                                                            inter
changed, but we can act upon one radical so as to increase or                                                    diminish
its   k, and        if,   for example, the               k   of   B    is   increased           so as to be       greater
than that of A, we have                              now          a   new compound,                     (C)A1BiriA1,
in which            Aj     is   the modified                  B,    and Bv Tv A1                     are the original
A,    T,   A    respectively.             But    we see           that we have changed the order                            in
which the radicals (arranged in order of values of                                              k)   are united    to    the
asymmetric carbon                    atom.          If       the original compound                     is   represented
by (1) in the figure above, the new compound corresponds to                                                              (2).
If therefore the original compound were right-handed, the new                                                            one
will      be left-handed, and vice versa.                             The change of sense of rotation
is    thus an indication that                   a    change has been effected in the value                                 of
the    k   of   a   radical such           as to change               the order of the radicals.
      We do not know                   very many cases of such change, but we                                       know
enough          to illustrate         the foregoing.                   In right-handed tartaric acid
there are two asymmetric carbon atoms,                                           but       as   these are        perfectly
similar in all respects we need only look at one.                                                    This   is   then our
(C), and our              A,    B,   T,   A,    are (arranging them                        provisionally in order
of mass) -CH(OH)— CO— OH, -CO— OH, -OH, and -H.                    By
treatment with acetyl chloride, tartaric acid converted into diacetyl-               is
tartaric acid.              Here the radicals are (preserving the order of union
to the          asymmetric carbon atom)                            -CH(0— CO— CH3)— CO— OH,
-CO— OH,                  -0— CO— CH„                and       -H.          Now       the diacetyl-tartaric acid
from right-handed                    tartaric acid             is     left-handed.               We shall         assume
that addition to a radical increases                                   the value of k, and that there
fore       the k of   -CO — OH    greater than that of -OH, and that k
                                                is                                                                         is
increased         when -OH   converted into -0 — CO — CH3; making these
                                      is
assumptions,              we find then that the                       k of       -0 — CO — CH3               is    greater
than that of -CO — OH.                          Again, we can convert right-handed tartaric
acid       into its ethyl ether.                     Here, preserving the old order, we have
the radicals          -CH(OH)— CO— O— C.,H6) -CO— O— C2H5, -OH,                                                          and
-H.         This ether          is    right-handed.                   From           it,   by the action of acetyl
chloride, we can obtain diethyl                                    diacetyl-tartrate.                  Here we have
the radicals          -CH(0— CO—                     CHs)-CO— 0— C2H5,-CO— 0— C2H5,
-O — CO — CH3,                  and       -H.        This      ether        is   also right-handed, but only
to    a   small extent.              We thus          see     that the           k   of    -0 — CO — CH3            is   less

than that of           -CO— O— C2Hj,             hut not much less.             Take now the
case of dimethyl              tartrate.       This, like the acid, is right-handed, hut
yields with acetyl chloride a strongly left-handed dimethyl diacetyl-
tartrate.         From this we gather that the <c of -O— CO — CH, is
greater       than that of -CO — O — CHj, although the two radicals are
isomeric
      Let us now consider              the case of asparagine.             We     do not know
which of the two formulae                HO— CO— CHj— CH(NH2)— CO— NH,
and      HO— CO— CH(NH2)— CH2— CO— NH2                                is that of asparagine;
 we shall here use the latter.*                     In   potash     solution this becomes
 K— O— CO— CH(NH2)— CH2--CO— NHj, if                                     there    were    no  dis
 sociation of the ions.                Similarly in hydrochloric              acid solution      it
 becomes            H— O— CO—CH(NH,C1)— CH,— CO— NH,,                                    also    if
 there were no dissociation of the ions.                        Here of the two radicals
 -CO — OH and -NH2                  the one is increased by dissolving the substance
  in   potash, the other by dissolving                it in hydrochloric acid          ;  and (as
  is well known) asparagine rotates to the left in alkaline, and to the
   right in acid solution.             The case of aspartic acid is quite similar.
       Another case which has been pretty fully investigated is that of
   active amyl alcohol and its derivatives.+                 Active amyl alcohol has the
   constitution        CH(C2Hs)(CHs)(CH2OH)                ;  it is left-handed, as is also,
   to nearly the same extent,                the corresponding amylamine.                But  the
   other derivatives,          in  which the fourth        radical in our formula is in
   creased (as       the bromide, CH(C2H5)(CH3)(CH2Br),                     the hydrochloride
   of   the   amylamine, and still more the di- and tri-amylamines),                           are
    right-handed.           From all of which we may conclude                     that the k of
   -CHjOH          is less than that of        -GjH;. and     greater than that of         -CH3 ;
    that   the    <c of   -CH2OH is very nearly equal                to that of -CH2XH2,
   that the k       of -CH2Br is greater than that of -C2H5.
       Active lactic acid and its salts have been examined                      in reference Ui
   their optical activity by Wislicenus.J                    He finds that active lactic
   acid rotates       in   the opposite sense from its salts — this would mean
   that    the   c of -COOH is             less than that of        -CH3,      so that the in
      *  I               formula",  and    not those in which asparagine is represented as
           use these
   a salt,  because     I  am here dealing only with         asparagine in alkaline or acid
   solution.

above the k of                -CH3, and        changes       the       order of the radicals.   If this

the k is greatest                 in the     second       and least      in   the third, so that the re
placement             of      H by OH          raises      the value of k, the replacement                              of
H.>    by O lowers                it,   and lowers    it    more than the replacement                     of       II   by
OH         raises it.
      There          is    one set of cases           to which we cannot as yet apply                                   the
method           ;   viz., where the asymmetric carbon atom forms part of a
ring,       as   in diacetyl-tartaric anhydride, asparagine                                (if   we regard         it    as
a   salt with twice the formula given above), camphor,                                           <fcc.
      Of    course we cannot as yet even approximate to                                    a    formula for the
amount of rotation in terms of the four «'s and temperature,                                                   but as
the rotation becomes zero when any two                                        k's become equal we may
presume that                it    contains the product of the differences                           of the k's.
      The first thing to be done with this speculation                                     is    to find whether
k     is    really        a   function of the composition and                             constitution         of the
radical and of the temperature                            of the substance,               or varies with the
character            of the other three radicals.                      This will require             the prepara
tion and careful examination of many active substances                                                   and their
derivatives.
                                                                                                 June 21, 1890.
      Since the paper of which the above                                is   an abstract was read to the
 Society     I        have seen          a   note on the same subject by                        Mr Philippe A.
 Guye, published in the Compter Rendus for March 31st of this year.
      There          is   a   good deal common              to       Mr Gnye's view             and mine, and           I
 take        this opportunity of acknowledging                                his priority in the points
 which are common.
       The chief difference                   is   that    Mr Guye            regards       the mass of each
 radical and the distance                       of its centre           of gravity from the centre of

 function             of the composition and constitution                                 of the radical, not
 necessarily               proportional to the mass and the distance                                of the centre
 of gravity from the centre of the tetrahedron, so that, for example,

 mass of the     radical.

                                 (Read June 2, 1890.)
    In               " On the Height of the Land and the Depth of              the
         a  paper
          r
Ocean,       read to the Society on 19th December 1887, and published
in the Scottish         Geographical Magazine, vol. iv. pp. 1-41,        Dr John
Murray gives a very detailed estimate of the volumes of oceanic
hollows and continental protuberances.              I have recently had recourse
to   Dr Murray's calculations in order to determine the position of
the contour-line which should separate the portions of the solid
earth above the general level of the surface from those below that
level       The results of this determination           were published     in the
 Scottish Geographical Magazine, vol. vi. pp.           182-187; butsince then
 the theoretical importance        of the particular contour-line in question
 his induced me        to give further consideration to the subject
     The term     " lithosphere " has been applied to the solid part of the
 earth,    and   " hydrosphere " to the oceans collectively, corresponding
                                            "
 etymologically      with " atmosphere by which the          gaseous envelope is
 familiarly     known.      If the  lithosphere were smooth and the earth at
 rest,  it would be entirely and uniformly covered by the hydrosphere.
 The amount of dry land emergent above the surface of the hydro
 sphere      depends     in  the first instance on the configuration        of the
 lithosphere,     in the second on the volume of the hydrosphere.
     The surface      of the hydrosphere is usually adopted       as the standard
 level from      which heights and depths           are estimated;   theoretically
 this is unsatisfactory, on account of the distortion          of surface caused
 by the gavitational attraction of the ridges on the lithosphere.              The
 only perfect reference surface is that of the geoid, or smooth figure
 which would result         if the ridges of the lithosphere were laid      to rest
 in  the   hollows.      In order to arrive at this mean level of the litho
  sphere     (shortly    mean-sphere      level),  the requisite   data   are   the
  volumes     of the hydrosphere and of the emergent land, together with
  the  areas occupied by each.           From calculations given at length in

the paper already cited,                  I   was led to fix the position of             mean-sphere
level at about 1400 fathoms below sea-level;                               that is to say,         nearly
midway on the very steep descent which                                 everywhere separates              the
comparatively flat-topped world-ridges from the still flatter-bottomed
world-hollows,  My friend Mr J. G. Bartholomew has drawn my
attention to the fact that recent hydrographic                                exploration          in the
Pacific and Indian Oceans has revealed the existence of                                  a  greater
                                                                                             far
area more than 3000 fathoms deep than was supposed                                   to exist when
the maps for Dr Murray's paper were constructed.                                     Hence in that
paper     the     area    with depths            between        2000 and 3000 fathoms               roust
be restricted, and the area with                      depths greater than 3000 fathoms
enlarged to the same extent.                       The other contour-lines are practically
unaltered, but the volume of the hydrosphere is greater than was
assumed, and the                contour-line        of mean-sphere           level must lie at a
somewhat greater depth than 1400 fathoms.
  It     is obvious that the two areas into which the mean-sphere                                    level
line divides the surface of the globe                           bear    no necessary         relation of
size to one another.                 If, for example, the               elevated    area were a vast
pillar    1   square mile in section, the mean-sphere                         level line would be
traced round          it very      near the base      ;   if,   on the other hand, the elevated
area were         a   mass 166,000,000 square miles in section,                          mean-sphere
level would           be close to the          mouth of the narrow pit which formed
the depressed area.
   When           a   map      of the sphere on an equal surface projection                         is   cut
out along the contour-line of 1400 fathoms of ocean depth (assumed
mean-sphere level), the area above that level      as estimated by            is,
weighing the two portions, 20 per cent, smaller than the area beneath
that level.           In this experiment, the                   red line marking mean-sphere
level on the map was visible on the portion representing the de
pressed area.             This line       was 80 inches long, and assuming that -j^ of
an inch were left on the one side, this would account for one quarter
of the difference,             leaving the depressed area 15 per cent, larger than
the elevated           area    ;   i.e,   the two areas would be equalised                     by   trans
ferring       7
              £   per cent, of the larger to the smaller.                           In   so rough an
experiment                is   not                 assumption to take the two areas
                  if it                   great

equal, but              instead of doing so we inquire into one or two other
ratios, the equality in area of the elevated and depressed region                                         is
practically proved.

                               Or  a ratio of   1 : 1 -2.
    As previously pointed out, recent researches                           show that mean-
sphere    level   should     be placed somewhat               deeper than 1400 fathoms,
and   if this depth were 1700 fathoms the result would almost exactly
correspond      to an equalisation of areas.
     Pending     the   remeasurement            of   large-scale     maps      on which the
results    of the    exploration of the Pacific at present in                      progress by
 British surveying ships can be represented,                      and pending also fuller
 knowledge       of the relief of polar regions and of the gravitational
 distortion of the hydrosphere,            it  is imprudent to do more than point
 oat the   position of mean-sphere              level as somewhere              between      1400
 and 2000       fathoms     beneath mean sea-leveL                  At     the same time it
 is to be    noted that some contour-line between                       1 400 fathoms and
  2000 fathoms       (probably that of 1700 fathoms) divides the surface
 of the    lithosphere into two equal areas — one of elevation, one of
  depression.
     This    coincidence       can    hardly      be     accidental,      and although          at
  present   I do   not  see  how the fact of the volume of the projecting
  portion of one     half the lithosphere         surface being equal to the volume
  of the     depression occupying the other half bears upon physical
  geography      and geology, the question demands,                     and will probably
  repay,   investigation.        If   the substance of the globe wero incom
  pressible and     elastic,  it would follow that              the depression     of one half
  the surface     would     elevate     over the other half          a  protuberance equal
   in volume     to the depression.            The depressed           area    is  the    region
                Dr Murray            "
   termed by                    the     abysmal area," and has distinct physical

properties unlike those of the other half of the world.                  If it were
possible to show that one half of the earth's surface was subjected
to a compressive         stress   from which the other half was free during
the period of plasticity,           the magnitude of the pressure would, be
measured         hydrostatically    by the mass elevated     over the free      half.
Except        the  pressure    of the hydrosphere on the abysmal area, no
such force is at present at work, and that pressure            is certainly    quite
inadequate to the result.
A Geometrical Method, dependent                         on the      Principle of
            Translation.          By David Maver.         (With Plate.)
                                  (Read March 3, 1890.)
    The properties of generating lines and surfaces                often afford    an
easy     and     beautiful   mode     of demonstrating    geometrical theorems
which,      if done   by the ordinary method,       would be long and tedious.
As    the subject, so far as the writer        is aware, is new, a short paper
upon it may not be unacceptable.
    The following principles will readily bo admitted            : —
    1.  Let AB and CD           be two parallel    straight lines, and      EF, GK
any lines whatever drawn              from the line   AB   to the     line CD.     If
 these    lines    EF, GK      advance    equal distances along      AB    and CD,
each keeping parallel to itself, the spaces passed over by these lines
will evidently        be equal.      Let  these spaces be represented        by *'EF
 and sGK, which may be read space generated                   by    EF    and space
generated        by GK, then we have »EF = «GK.             From this it follows
that if one side of        a  triangle be the direction of motion the spaces
generated        by the other two sides are equal, that is           if ABC be      a
triangle and BC the direction of motion sAB = »AC.
    2.   If    there  be two lines       EF, GK standing upon the straight
 line   FK,      and  if FK be the direction of motion, and *-EF = «GK,
then the lines EF, GK are between the same parallels, that is if
 EG be joined, EG is parallel to FK.
    3. If AB and CD bo two equal straight lines, and equally in
 clined      to their   respective directions of motion, we plainly             have
 *AB    = 6-CD.

      4.      If AB=CD and «AB = »CD, or if pAB = qCD and /wAB =
^.-iCD         then AB and CD are equally inclined to their respective
directions          of motion.
     5.    If   *AB    =   *CD and      AB and CD        are equally inclined            to their
respective          directions      of motion then AB            =   CD, or       generally         if
y*AB-3iCD then pXB = qCT>.
  It would appear, therefore, that of the                    three    conditions, equality
of straight lines,           equality of the spaces generated by these lines, and
equality        of their     inclinations    to their respective      directions of motion,
if   any two are           given the third is also given.
     There      are other        properties of generating lines which might be
noticed, bat to do so,              and show their application           to the solution of
leometrical          theorems,     would extend this paper to too great                 a     length.
We shall            therefore     proceed to apply what has already been gone
over.
     BA       and BC (fig. 1) are two tangents to the circle EAC whose
centre is       D. If the diameter CDE be drawn and EA and DB joined,
FA        shall be    parallel to DB.          It   is easily seen that the angle              AliD
 «=CBD.         DB be the direction of motion then, .<ED = .sCD-
                    Let
*CB=«AB, .-. since sED = sAB, EA is parallel to DB (2).
   Let the sides AB, BC (fig.
                              2) of the triangle ABC be bisected by
the straight lines CE, AF intersecting in G, then shall CG = 2EG
AG=2FG; and if BG be drawn and produced to D, AD = CD.
  AF be the direction of motion, then sCG = »CF(1 ) = sBF = sBA =
Let
&EA=2*EG, .-. since 8CG = 2sEG, CG = 2EG (5).          In the same
way        AG   =   2FG.      Again, if DB be the direction of motion, we have
*AD = «AG =               2«FG = 2«FB = sCB = «CD, . •. since s AD = «CD, AD =
CD.
   ABCD (fig. 3) is a quadrilateral, and the diagonal BD bisects the
diagonal AC in E.     If the opposite sides be produced to meet at
Fand G we have the foUowing results:                         — (1) If GD          = ?hAD         then
shall GB =           mCB, FD = mCD, and FB=mAB (2) If BI)                                     be pro
duced it        will bisect FG in K. (3) AC is parallel to FG.
        (1)   TakeDB        as   the direction of motion, then because GD = w AD
/.   *QD = msKD =                msAE   =   msCE    = m*CB   ;   but *GD   =     sGB,   .-.   sGB   =

 DA = (m+l)DA.                    Taking     FB   as the direction of motion, we have

.sGA = (to + 1)sDA = (to + 1)«DF; but sGA is also equal to sGB =
m*CB = msCF, .-. (m + l)»DF = »i*CF, and (m + l)DF = mCF (5).
Hence      (m +  1)DF

(»n +   l)DF-mDF          = DF     .-.   DF   = mCD.    That   FB   = ?nAB   may     be
shown in the same way            as    that GB = mCB.
     (2)   FG is bisected in K. Take KB as the direction of motion,
then         sGK = *GD = msAD = ms AE = ?«*CE = wi«CD = »FD = *FK,
. ". since sGK = sFK we have GK = FK.
     (3) AC is parallel to FG.              Because GD = mDA . : GA = ml) A +
 DA = (m+l)DA. In the same way FC = (m + 1)DC, and taking
 AC as the direction of motion, sGA = (m + l)sDA = (m + l)$~DC =
 sFC, .-. since «GA = sFC, AC is parallel to FG.
     Let AB, CD, EF, GK be four straight lines, and AB-CD = EF-GK.
 If CD and GK are generating lines, and equally inclined to their
 respective    directions of motion, we plainly have AB.*CD =              EFsGK ;
and conversely,       if ABsCD        =  EFsGK     then AB-CD     = EF-GK.       It  is
easy to see that this truth              is general   whatever number of factors
we may have,        and that      if A-B-C       = D-E-F then A-BsC      = D-EsF =
A-CsB      = D-F.sE =    C-BsA   =    F-EsD.
     The converse      is also evidently true, that        if A-BsC   = D-E<fF,    and
 the generating lines C,            F    be equally inclined    to  their respective
directions of motion, then A-B-C = D-E-F.
     For   the sake of brevity         it will  be convenient to use some symbol
 to indicate the      direction of motion.           In  the expression    «AB(CD)
 the symbol is     (CD), which indicates that the direction of motion of
 the generating line       AB   is   CD.
     To employ the properties of generating lines in geometrical                    de
 monstration, it is necessary to observe those angles which are equal,
and to remember          that if the      angle made by the generating line with
 the direction of motion be changed                into its supplement the      space

    The apparatus        for Impact experiments, which was exhibited                   to
the Society on 20th February 1888, has been                  greatly improved by
the substitution of a very true slab of plate-glass,           thinly   covered with
printing-ink,      for the sheet of cartridge paper.           The record is made
by a needle-point which projects from the falling body, and which
is kept in constant contact with the plate by means of               a   light   spring.
The time of rotation of the plate is given by a tuning-fork,                     with    a
small bristle attached,          which is kept in vibration          by a periodic
current, and records alongside of the other tracings.
    When     the paint is dry, the plate is used as a photographic                 nega
tive.    To correct for possible shrinkage of the photographic                    paper,
circles   of known         diameter are described on the inked plate                   at
various places, and tested when the fixing process is complete.
    The following data give a general idea of the results of                  a 4 foot
fall: — the falling body being         a block of hard wood, of 5         J lbs. mass,
which impinges on           a  cylinder   of 32 mm. diameter and 32 mm. in
length, half      of which is imbedded       in  a large mass     of lead cemented
to the asphalt floor.         The time is less for more violent impacts.

       Aitken, F.R.S.           (With    3 Plates).
                               (Read February 3, 1890.)
    The portable       dust-counting       apparatus described        in  a   previous
communication to        this Society*      was designed    with  a view of making
observations on the        air at situations where it would        be inconvenient
to work with the larger            laboratory apparatus      ;  and also to enable
these observations        to be made under conditions more favourable for
avoiding local      impurities than is possible when working in               a house.
As the construction          of this portable apparatus was completed just
 as I  was about     to start for the Continent, the opportunity             seemed a
 favourable one      for continuing the investigation into the number of
 dust particles    in the atmosphere, and extending our knowledge on
 the subject   in other countries.          The portable apparatus is reduced
 to Buch     dimensions        that    it adds but little to          one's   personal
 luggage, and can be        easily carried to the place where the observations
 are to be   made.
    This   new     form     of apparatus has        been   found to do its work
satisfactorily.      If a   new set of apparatus were made, the only altera
tions   the   past experience        would     suggest   is to omit the smallest
of the     stopcock      measures,      because    I  have     never     as   yet  had
 occasion to measure        outside air so    full of particles that the testing
 could not have      been done with the second            smallest measure.        The
 smallest   measure      should therefore be only retained          if the apparatus
is   required    to test air extremely          full of particles.        For air    of
 the country     comparatively        free from      pollution,   all the stopcock
 measure3 may        be omitted, as they are never required.                When the
 air is pure      large     quantities    of it require to       be sent     into   the
 receiver,  and the air-pump          alone is used.       When the air is fairly
 pure, such as    country air, 5 or 10 c.c. are generally required for each
 test.

to be troublesome, frequent                       polishings          being required to keep                   it in
good       working        order.         Other metals less easily tarnished than silver
have been tried, but with no very satisfactory result                                          as yet.       Plati
num does very well, and keeps free from tarnish, but it is difficult to
give it     a   very perfect polish.               Platinoid, which owing                      to its     property
of keeping bright in impure air, promised to bridge this difficulty,
but on trial it was found to be most unsuitable,                                   as   it   soon got spotted
all over.         The little drops of rain seemed to eat into                                       it,   and not
more than one test could be made                             without repolishing.                    Blackened
glass had also been                 tried again, in the hope                it     might be got to work
well, as        it   could bo much more easily kept in order than silver.
Unfortunately             it   does not act very satisfactorily, owing to the tendency
of glass to get dewed.                      As this dewing            is   not easily observed               in   the
instrument,          it   gives rise to difficulties, as               the drops are not visible on
the    dewed         surface.           And when           the surface         is       kept undewed              the
drops tend to evaporate,                      and the number counted                           is   rather low.
Further, owing to less light being reflected by the glass surface than
by the silver, the drops are not so brilliantly illuminated                                          and there
fore       not so      easily counted.                On     the      other hand, silver has been
found to require very little attention in pure air.                                            The stage has
frequently been used for weeks without                                     once being taken out                     of
the receiver for polishing, and                       it     worked quite satisfactorily at the
end of the time.
     The first place on the Continent                           at which           regular observations
were       made       with       the      dust-counter           was       Hyeres            in the south           of
France.          Hyeres        is   a   small town on the shores of the Mediterranean,
and    is    the westmost of the health                         resorts     on the French                 Kiviera.
It    is   situated on the southern slopes                       of    a   hill,    at rather more than
two miles from the sea.                       A    Hat fertile         plain extends for some                     dis
tance       from the town seawards,                        and at some places                    the shore          is
fringed by marshy lands.                      Observations were occasionally made                             at an
open window of the hotel, which                            is   situated just on the outskirts                      of
the town.             The observations of most value, however,                                  were made on
the top of           Finouillet,        a   hill situated       at about two miles to the north
of west of Hyeres.                      Finouillet     has an elevation of                   slightly     less than
1000 feet.

nent and in this country.                   In     the table is entered           the number of
dust particles, per            cubic centimetre, observed in the air of the place,
at the hoar and date               given, each of the numbers given is an average
of ten tests made            in rapid succession.           The direction and force of the
wind is also entered, as                 well    as the temperature and the humidity.
The humidity is               indicated     by the amount to which the wet bulb
was depressed            below the dry one at the time the tests were made.
These records            of humidity are not very satisfactory, owing to the
difficulty of getting              suitable positions for making the observations
at the          different     places.       In    a few cases the observations were
made with             wet and      dry bulb       thermometers        placed at a window,
and in shade             and    protected as much as possible from radiation.
In    some       cases the      humidity         was taken    with    a hygroscope,         and its
readings converted              into wet bulb        depressions        by comparative read
ings of the two             instruments.         In the   second last column of the table
is entered        the state     of the air with           regard to transparency.            These
transparency           observations are far from satisfactory, as no special
means          have    been    adopted of measuring it.                   It   has   simply been
judged by the            unaided eye, which is a very rough method of estimat
 ing   it        There are         many things which alter the                    apparent trans
parency         of   the air, and make the estimate               taken in this way very
unsatisfactory.              For   instance,      when the sky       is   clouded all over the
air looks more           transparent than under             a   cloudless sky, because the
haze      in   the air   between us and the distant scene                  is   not illuminated
 by   direct     sunlight, and therefore does not show so much.                             Again,
when looking           in the direction away from the sun, the air appears
clearer        than   when looking in the opposite direction. Only very                     a
rough scale of clearness                has therefore been attempted.                Some special
instrument            would require to be devised before more definite records
can be         obtained.
     It   will be seen from             the table that      a   great     number of particles
was observed             in the air on the 19th March, at the open window of
the hotel         at Hyeres.            This high number        was evidently due to local
contamination,              the wind at the time blowing                from the town.            On
the 21st the           wind was towards the town, and,               as    will   be seen, the air
was much              freer from dust, the number per c.c.                 falling from 46,000

      The       top    of Finouillet         was     selected     for     testing     the   air    of

the district      surrounding       Hyercs     on account of its position and
shape.     The hill is situated near the centre of a plain             ; on its south,
west,   and north sides it rises with steep slopes                   to a rather     fine
point.     Its top     rises therefore into what we might expect             to  bo the
pure air of the district.           An examination, however, of the                table
will show that no very low number                was obtained at this situation,
never less than 3500 per c.c.              The reason for this would appear to
be that the     hill    is surrounded on three sides by a highly cultivated
plain, which is dotted all over with the bouses of the peasantry, and
at many places there are villages.              The air of this district is there
fore   very much polluted with the products                   of combustion,         and
though the situation where the observations were made is nearly
 1000 feet high, and the          hill  rises abruptly from the        plain, yet it is
evident that the polluted lower air came up to the top of the hill,
 being driven up the slopes by the wind.                 This  ascent of the       lower
 air to the tops of hills has been frequently observed,                   and   will   be
 referred to later.          The rapid change       in  the   number of particles
 observed    at short intervals, showed that the lower air was rising
to the   bill  top.       On the 23rd and 25th the numbers varied graatly
 owing to the impure lower air being imperfectly                    mixed     with    the
purer air above.           It is no doubt possible     that some of this variation
 may have been due to change of direction of wind bringing                     air from
 more or less polluted parts.
    It will    bo observed        that on the 4th of April            the number        of
particles at this situation was remarkably great, the number being
 as  high   as   2:"), 000 per c.c.       This high number        was    fairly steady
 during all the tests made             on that day.      When      I   had tested the
 different parts of the dust counter and found no reasonable                       cause
 for doubting its indications, it became necessary                 to look    for some
 outside   cause for this very high          number.      On looking in the direc
 tion of Toulon, distant about nine miles, it was seen that the wind
 was   blowing      direct from that town, and bringing               the products      of
 combustion to the place of observation             ;  the smoke being traced for
 some    distance       from the town coming in           a straight line       towards
  Finouillet.
     On   the 29th March           observations were made at La Plage with
  the view of examining           the air resting on the      sea.     These observa
 tions were made at three different places near the shore.                     The first

od the beach, the        second     at 100 yards inland, and the       third at 250
 yards from the beach.          The wind at the time was directly inshore,
bat it is possible        it may have been polluted,            as there are     a few
dwellings on the islands outside.               Two observations      were made      on
the    beach    at an    interval of an hour           and a half.      The     second
observation     gave   twice the number observed in the first               This may
have been due to         many of the particles having            been  produced by
the waves, and as         the waves continued          nearly the same, while the
wind fell to about         one-half, the number of particles of spray in the
air would be       increased at the time of the second observation.                The
increase, however,      may have been due to pollution from the dwellings
on    the   islands.     At both        the situations     at a distance from       the
shore the number           was    less   than on the beach           This may have
been    due to the      air with the spray particles being diluted on its
 passage,  through the woods, to the situations at a distance from the
 beach.
    The next town at           which observations were made was Cannes.
 The position     selected    for testing the air of this district was the top
 of La Croix      des   Gardes, a small hill in the west bay, having an
 elevation of    about 500 feet.           The   hill is situated quite outside the
 town, but     it   is surrounded        on most sides by houses         at no great
 distance.     On the 10th of            April, when there was a strong west
  wind, the air was        very pure, there was only         1 GOO  particles per c.c.
 noted.     The air on this day was likely to be             as pure as   it will ever
 be at   this situation, as      it  came   with   a  fresh wind direct over the
 Esterel    Mountains,        and     from a very       thinly   populated     district.
 The lowest      number observed here was much less than the lowest at
  Hjeres, hut at the latter place the            wind on the days the       tests were
 made     never     came    from     the  least  populated district,     so   that the
  observations     taken at the two places do not admit of comparison.
 The observation        taken at Cannes on the 12 th show an entire change
  in the 6tate of matters.          The number on this day           was   very great,
  being as    high as 150,000 per c.c.             This was due to       a change     of
  wind, which       blew direct from the town, and brought the products of
  combustion      to the place     of observation.
     On the 13th,      observations were made            on the sea air at Cannes.
   The wind was from           the south, that is inshore, but it was light.
   These observations       on sea air can only be made when thero is little

198          Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                      [sess
wind,     otherwise     the    spray    produced       by   the  breaking        wave*
introduces    a disturbing element.          The place selected for      testing tht
sea  air was in the west bay, at the outer end of the small                iron     pier.
There were no waves breaking outside of the position                    of observa
tion, and the number obtained would be correct                  for the   air at      the
time.     The number was very large, 10,000 per c.c, and                when again
tested on the beacli to the lee        of  the breakers, which were       high      con
sidering there was so little wind, the number was 12,000                      per ac.
This   increase    on shore     may have been due to particles originated
by the waves.        The very large number got at this situation would
seem to suggest that the air had not come from far over the sea, but
might have been land air which had circled round                 as  the  wind      was
light,  or it might have been            the air of the       land breeze of         the
previous night returning         as a sea breeze.
   Very few favourable opportunities occurred for making observa
tions on the aiT of Mentone.           On the afternoon of the 25th         of April
tests were     made    on a    hill about     1000   feet high, situated       to    the
north-west of the town.          When     the observations began the      wind      was
from the north, that is from the mountains, and there were                        1200
particles per c.c.    in it.    A little  later the wind changed and brought
up the air of the town, when the number began to rise, and became
as great   as 7200, and was         still rising when      the  observations were
concluded.
    On the morning of the 27th           April    I took   a boat and pulled out
to some distance        seawards     of the Mentone breakwater, and tested
the air coming in from the            sea.    The number was 5000 per               c.c.
There was not wind enough to crest the waves.                   Later in the day
the wind increased        in force from the south-west, so that possibly
the air examined in the morning may have been true sea air.
    A number of observations          were made      at Bellagio on the Lake of
Como.      All  these tests showed the air to be very           full of dust for       a
mountainous district.          But during the time of my visit the               wind
always blew from the south, that is from the inhabited                      parts of
Italy;   and,   further,    it was always       light,   so that local impurities
were   not swept away.          The tests were made at an open               window
overlooking      the   lake,   when     the wind blew towards            the    shore,
and at other times they were made on the top of the                     hill   at the
Villa Serbilloni.

    The Baveno observations were made in similar weather to those
of Bellagio, that U with little wind on most days, and the air damp
and generally very thick, due to an accumulation of local impurities.
The only occasion on which a low number was obtained here was
on the afternoon of the 16th May.               This pure air     was   found at
some distance from        Baveno, at the entrance       to the Simplon        Pass,
above all the villages        near the lake.    The wind was light, but it
descended from the mountains and was pure ; owing however to the
imperfect     mixing    of the hill and valley    airs, the numbers varied a
good deaL       As will    be seen from the table, they varied from 54G to
850 per c.c
    On the 18th of May the air was tested at Locarno, at the head of
Lake Maggiore.         The   place selected  for observing was on the          hill
side above the pilgrimage church of Madonna              del Sasso, about       GOO
feet above the lake.           The wind was northerly,        that is from the
 mountains, and the air was fairly pure, only 1300 per c.c.                 There
 was thunder at the time, and there had been heavy showers                all  day.
                          The   Rigi Kvlm   Observatioim.
    Being desirous of making some observations on the air at the
 top of   mountains, the       Kigi  was selected   as the most      suitable for
 the purpose,    on account of its elevation and      isolated position.       The
 convenience    of being able to live at the top was another recommen
 dation, as   one would always be in a position to take advantage of
 any meteorological       change    which might take place.         In all   these
 respects perhaps     Mont Pilatus would       have  been a better place         for
 the purpose, as    it is more isolated and is 1000 feet higher, but at
 the time   of my visit the railway was not finished, and there was a
 difficulty  in getting up     apparatus  and luggage     sufficient for   a  visit
 of some days.       I found    the Rigi Kulm hotel a very convenient and
 comfortable place      for observations of this kind.         The hotel is       so
 near the   top of the MIL that on any change taking place one can
 be at the   top in a minute or two and have a clear view all round,
 and    the dust-counting      apparatus   can be placed in such       a position
  that it tests the true passing air from whatever direction the wind
  may happen     to blow at the time.
     As the   Kigi observations will probably be the most interesting, I
  have entered    in the table the results of most of the tests, and later

on  will   have something further to say       with   regard to certain meteoro
logical phenomena        observed   here.   I arrived    at the top of the moun
tain about midday on the 21st May.               On the way up we             entered
a dense fog at    about 2000 feet from the top.           This fog continued all
the way up, and at the top          it  was  impossible to see more than 50
yards in front.       I began    work at  2  o'clock, selecting the top of the
hill   as the most suitable place       for observing.       The result was not
satisfactory.      The number of particles was found to vary greatly,
going up       to 1300     per c.c.   and falling    to   under 500 in a short
interval.      This  at once suggested      local contamination, from which
I was    unsuccessful in freeing the observations,        by change of position,
as   the thickness     of the air prevented me seeing from what                 direc
tion the polluted air might come          ;  I had therefore     to return     to   the
hotel for information          as to the direction      of all possible sources
of local pollution.         I was then informed that the gas-work, engine-
 house, and other buildings          connected   with the hotel were situated
 on the slope of the      hill to the windward, and within a few hundred
 yards of the place of observation.          Having     ascertained   the direction
of all possible sources of local pollution,       a new situation was selected,
 well clear of all possible         contamination, and        a  number of tests
 made.      In this situation the number of particles         was fairly constant,
 being 285 per c.c. when the testing began, and falling                   to 210 an
 hour later.
    The morning of the 22nd opened bright and fine.                    The fog had
 cleared off the    hill  top, the clouds having sunk to a lower level and
 cleared away a good deal to the south; but to the                north the whole
 country was covered          with  a  nearly uniform       layer of clouds,       the
 upper surface of which was about 1000 feet below the top of                       the
 mountain.       In the morning      the number of particles was about 800.
per    c.c, at 10.30 a.m. the number fell to about 500, and in                     the
afternoon the number was 1450 and gradually                   increased     to 2300.
During      the afternoon observations      an occasional      cloud passed      over
the   hill  top.
    As will be seen from the table, the number of particles on                     the
        varied greatly during the morning observations, the successive
tests made within an hour varying from about 500 per c.c. to 1100
per c.c.     This want of uniformity in the passing air            may have been
due to the strong wind          blowing at the time,        bringing    imperfectly

  mixed masses of the impure                 air of    the valleys to the      hill top.       In
  the afternoon the -wind             fell   a  little, and the numbers            were    more
 constant, varying        from 600 to 850.
     The observations         made on the 24th show the air on the morriing
of this day to have             been much the same as it was                   the previous
afternoon.        The     wind had fallen still further, and the number
recorded     between 10 a.m. and             11  a.m. varied but     little, being from     617
to 685, showing          a more uniform           condition and      a  lower average than
the previous       day.      At     4 p.m.     the number had decreased              to about
400, and by 5 p.m.           the number tended             to  increase and become           the
same as     it was in the morninsi.
     The next day,         the 25th, being the last day of my visit                     to   the
Rigi Kulni,       I determined         to make a number of tests on my way to
Lucerne.        .Between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. observations were made                            on
the top    of the mountain.             The number observed was fairly constant,
varying      from 532 to 580.                 The wind        was  still blowing from           a
 southerly    direction,      but not      strong.      On descending to Vitznau on
 the lake,    I at   once proceeded to make observations on the air at this
 level    The result         at first somewhat astonished                me,  as    the    tests
 gave    only about         600 per c.c.           On     examining      the  conditions,       I
 noticed    that the wind had greatly increased in force, and at this
 situation was       blowing in strong          gusts, and     it did not   come down the
 lake but came        over the shoulder of the Rigi, and struck direct down
on    Vitznau, and spread out fan-like                  from the village as a centre.
 On each side       of Vitznau the wind blew from the village, and on the
 lake   in front it was off shore,                so that the air tested         at Vitznau
 had come       from near the top of the mountain and would be much
the same      air  as  that tested in the morning at the top of the hill.
     Leaving     Vitznau      I took    steamer for Lucerne, and again tested the
 air, selecting     for the purpose a position                on the lake side about a
 mile up the      lake and to the windward                 of the town.        The number
 observed       here    was     but slightly increased from               what    it was at
 ^  itznau, being       only about 650 per           c.c.     At this situation      also, the
  air came direct      from the mountains to the place of observation with
  out local   pollution,     as  it  was driven down the lake by a strong wind,
  and came to      the instrument from off the water, so that unless from
  a
    passing    steamer     there was no chance              of pollution.     The air was
   again tested   in Lucerne at the open window of the hotel overlooking

202          Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                    [sess.
a garden,   and even here the number was small, but as the                 hotel is
situated on the lake there was but little chance of pollution.
    These Lucerne and Vitznau observations showed the air                   of this
part of Switzerland         to be remarkably      pure.      We   must,   however,
remember     that on this occasion        the wind was strong, and that it
came    from   the wide unpolluted         tract of country covered         by the
mountains and valleys of the Alps.               On the day following these
tests the wind changed          and blew from the north-east, and brought
up the air from the inhabited parts of Switzerland.               The tests made
on    this day show a marked increase in the number of particles.
Though     the wind      had only recently changed, the pure air             of the
previous day had acquired          a great   increase   in dust in its passage
through the inhabited parts.           The number on the afternoon of this
day varied from 2160           to 3660 per c.c.     in   the open     country near
 Lucerne.
    The numbers obtained at all the Swiss stations, beginning                   with
 Locarno, arc small, but the number of observations are too few to
 give anything    like   a true  indication of the state of the air in that
 country.     Still  there are other reasons for supposing that the           air of
 Switzerland is very free from dust.           The vast tracts of mountainous
 country which surround it on most sides act              as  purifiers of the air,
 not only on account of the absence              of population, and the time
 given for the dust to settle out of the air, but also by the pure
 upper air being mixed with the lower impure air, by the irregular
 currents and eddies formed by the wind in its passage across                     the
 mountains.      It   seems therefore possiblo       that much of the trans
 parency and brilliancy         of the Swiss air may be due to its freedom
 from dust.
                         The Eiffel Tower Observations.
     We  have reason for supposing that the air at the top of mountains
 even such isolated ones as the            Rigi, is not pure air,      the same    as
 one would get      if they   ascended to the same height in a balloon ; but
  that along with the pure air there is mixed much of the air of
 the valleys driven         up the slopes by the wind or carried during
  calm   weather by the air heated by the sun on the mountain                slopes.
  The amount of this lower air which may be carried by the wind
  to the upper level depends          on the shape of the           hill and   other

     observations on the top soon showed     this plan to be impracticable,
     that   with anything like the limited series of tests   would be able       I

to make     it would    be impossible to find any regular          diminution at
the different heights.        I therefore   confined my attention and gave
most of my time to the variations taking place at the top, as a series
of observations made there seemed to promise to give more informa
tion than a few taken at different heights.
    It will   1)0  seen from the table      that the numbers varied greatly
from time to time, the changes taking place very quickly                  ;  indeed,
it  was  often impossible to change          the quantity      of air used quick
enough     to meet     the changing conditions.         For  instance,   when       the
particles were few for a short time, they would suddenly increase to
such a number that the quantity of dusty air which gave a con
venient number of particles for counting gave in the next test                         a
number so great they formed           a fine fog,   so dense   it  was impossible
to count the particles.        The two extremes which were counted with
any degree of certainty were 104,000 per c.c. and 22G per c.c.                     The
last and low number remained fairly constant during the taking of
the ten tests of which the above is the average.              This small number
was obtained while a shower of rain was passing over the tower.                      As
this rain was quite local, falling only over            a  small breadth of the
city, the descending drops would strike clown the                 impure city air
find at the same time draw the pure upper air downwards.                    It  seems
 probable that while this shower was passing, the top of the tower
was in nearly pure air, probably of a level higher than its top.
    An examination of the Eiffel Tower            figures show that the impure
 air of the city must rise to       a  much greater      height than 1000 feet.
 They    also     show   that   this air   does    not diffuse itself uniformly
upwards, but rises         in great   masses, the rapid rise and       fall    in the
 numbers showing that the hot city air rises in columns through the
purer air above, and that at considerable elevations over a city the
air is of   a very different character at places quite close to each other.
It   seems possible that a sensitive quick-acting thermometer might
show these changes in the passing air by the rise and fall in the
temperature.         Tins want of homogeneity, apart from            the    dust and
impurities, is one of the causes of the              unsuitableness of the air
near a city for astronomical observations.
     On the way down from the top of the tower            a halt was made at the
lower platforms, and tests made at          a height of 200 m. and at 115            m.
 As will  be seen from the table, the results of these tests are of little

value, too few observations           being obtained.      After descending from
the tower some tests were made of the lower air.                These tests, owing
to the kindness         of M. Mascart, were          made    in the garden of the
meteorological       office    in the Kue     de  l'Universit6. The situation is
not far from      the tower, and the air at this place would be much
the same as at      the base of the tower.          The number at the low level
was very great       when the       tests were made.       The number, however,
varies greatly at      low levels near the       sources   of pollution,   owing to
local circumstances, and the number varies greatly from time to time.
On this occasion the number              varied from 210,000 to 134,000 per
c.c      In  the same     situation in March the number            was much lower,
being      92,000,    tbe difference being probably due to atmospheric
conditions.       In March the air was much dryer.
                                         London.
     The only observations         of interest made in London were taken on
 the 3rd    of June.      The day was bright and dry, with a fresh westerly
 wind.     Observations were made at the window of an hotel in Victoria
 Street,   and also in a garden on the bank of the Thames a little
 below Battersea Bridge.            To this latter situation the air     came direct
 from Battersea       Park uncontaminated by immediate local pollution.
 It will be     seen   from the table that the numbers for Battersea Park
 varied from 48,000 to 116,000, the number varying a good deal                   with
 the    velocity of the wind.         It would   be interesting to   know what the
 number is at      this situation when the air is damp and heavy and
 but little    wind blowing.         As no such day occurred during my visit,
  there was no     opportunity of testing this point.
                                       Kingairloch.
      The    next   observations       entered in     the   table   were   taken    at
  Kingairloch in      July.      Kingairloch is situated in Argyleshire,       in the
  wilds of the West Highlands,            amidst the mountains        on the north
  west side of      Loch Linnho, nearly opposite Port Appin.                 At this
   situation the air is very free from local pollution,           there being only   a
   very few houses for many square            miles.    The air at this situation
   was generally     very pure, but the amount of dust was occasionally
   found    to  vary considerably at short intervals.             This was particu
    larly the case when the       wind blew     across   the valley    in which the

 206          Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                   [sbss.
 observations were made.          This rapid variation in the numbers -was
 no doubt due to the cross           currents mixing      masses of upper        and
 lower air, so that sometimes one and sometimes                the other     passed
 the instrument.       This   seems to be the probable explanation           of the
 variations   sometimes       noticed here, as they were too small to              be
due to local impurities.
     The table shows that the purity of the air, even at this isolated
situation, varied from day to day, being as high as 4000 particles                per
 e.c. on the 4th and     as  low as  205 per c.c. on the 6th. The higher
number's    were    generally got     with southerly winds and the lower
with northerly     ones.     This relation of direction of wind         to  number
of particles would seem to indicate that the higher numbers were
due to pollution     from the inhabited parts of the country, as all to
the east and south of this situation         is densely populated,        whilst in
the other directions there are but few dwellings.             It  is true that   the
distance to the densely populated parts is very considerable, yet
from the extreme slowness with which these fine particles settle, and
the short time required for the        wind    to bring them     to the place      of
observation, there seems to be         a possibility of their being carried as
far as this.    When     we remember      the number observed          on the top
of Finouillet      when     the wind     blew direct from Toulon,           we can
understand how it is possible for the dust of the densely populated
parts of the lowlands being brought to the wilds of the Highlands.
It   may be remarked that an examination              of the weather charts for
these   dates   shows    that much reliance cannot bo placed on this
conclusion,    as the   winds observed      may have been and sometimes
were quite local, and the distribution          of pressure was such that the
winds    were    light and the direction           of the   general     circulation
frequently doubtful.

there.     My visit was made on the 1st August               under fairly favour
able conditions      of weather.       The morning was dark and cloudy,
with detached patches        of mist on the hill-sides.          Fortunately   as the
day     advanced    the mist gradually          rose,   and as     I  ascended    the
mountain     it cleared away and           at last was     all  gone    by the time
the top was        reached.     The air was fairly         clear, as we could      see
Schiehallion quite distinctly on the one side and the hills of Skye
on the other, the     whole horizon within that range being clearly visible
all round.     The day, however, was favourable for transparency, as the
sky was clouded all over and the sun did not shine on and illumin
ate the little haze there was in the air.                 On testing the air the
 number of particles       counted by     Mr Omond and myself            was 335 per
c.c. at 1 p.m.   and 473 at      3 p.m.
                                        Alford.
     Observations were made from the 5th to the 15th September at
 Alford, a small village in the valley of the Don in Aberdeenshire.
 These tests were made near the Manse of Alford, which is situated
  at a distance    of about   2 miles to the west of the village.           There are
  but few houses near, so that the         air would be fairly free from local
  pollution.     An examination of the figures given in the table for this
  situation    shows that      the   air  here   was not       quite  so pure as nt
  Kingairloch.       This might possibly      be due to there being more houses
  in this locality than in the neighbourhood             of Kingairloch, but part
  wa3 also due     to the weather.       While    these    tests   were   being made
  the wind was       generally    very light, and frequently         blew from the
   east and south-east,     that is from the polluted districts, and it rarely
   came from    the mountains, so that probably the air was               a good deal
   polluted;   and, moreover, owing to the wind being generally light, the
   air was stagnant and local pollutions would tend to accumulate.                   It
   is probable that the numbers given           for this situation       are too  high
   for an average    for the district,   as the weather at the time was close,
    dull, and   thick, with     a   marked absence        of the usual clear crisp
    Aberdeenshire     air of September.
      On the morning of the 9th the            wind blew from tho south-west,
    that is   from an unpolluted       direction  ;  it  was therefore determined
    that an ascent    of Callievar should     be made that day,       for tho purpose
    of testing    the air at the top.         Callievar is      a somewhat isolated

rather steep on the north and west, and attains                                       a    height of 1747

midday there were only 262 per c.c. by the first test and 336 by
the second,               which            was taken         shortly   afterwards,          each          of   these
numbers being                     as       usual the average           of     ten tests.                 On    again
testing the air at                     2    p.m.,   two sets of tests gave the same average,
namely, 475 particles per c.c.                              This gradual      increase         was probably
duo to local contamination.                              When   the first tests were made the                  wind
was south-west,                  and came over an uninhabited                    district, whereas by
the time the last tests were made                             the    wind had veered to the west
ward, and brought the smoke of the dwellings                                      in the Don valley
towards the hill top.                        The view from the          hill   on this day was                 fairly
clear, the Cairngorms and Lochnagar being quite distinct,                                                but seen
through       a       good deal of haze, which was illuminated                            by   a    bright sun,
shining in            a   cloudless sky.                 On returning to the foot of the                  hill and
again testing the lower air                         it   was found     to have 900             particles per
c.c.     It   seems therefore                   probable that the lower air at this situation
is considerably contaminated by local causes.
                                                         Dumfries.
     The last series of observations entered in the table were made at
Isle, near Dumfries.                        The site of these observations is quite in the
country,          at        a    distance of six             miles, up the        Nith valley, from
Dumfries          ;    it is not near any village, but is surrounded in all direc
tions by farm and other houses.                               The site being on the banks of                       a
river, the air at it               will      have the peculiarities belonging to such situa
tions,    such              as   greater         humidity,      less   air circulation,              and lower
temperature               at nights than at more exposed                    situations.
     An examination of                      these Dumfries          figures    shows the air at this
situation         to have          been         remarkably       impure for       a       country district.
It   was probably much more                              impure than it generally                  is,   owing    to
certain meteorological conditions                             prevailing      during       the time these
tests were being made.                          The table shows that the air was very pure

           On the    Pollution of       the Atmosphere by           Artificial   Causes.
     Cm    looking over the numbers given in the table one is struck by
the amount          of dusty pollution introduced into our atmosphere by
human means ;              and one cannot help feeling that the earth's atmo
sphere is         profoundly modified by                the vast    quantities     of    dust     it
holds in suspension, much of which owes its origin to the presence
of human beings.               When we         ascend into the higher atmosphere, or
go    to    uninhabited          districts,        the quantity     of   dust    in the atmo
sphere is comparatively                small, but whenever we approach human
habitations          the     quantity       increases,     and     near cities     the air       is
laden      with these floating particles.                At the top of the Rigi, and in
the    wilds of Argyleshire, air              was tested    which had only         a   little over
two       hundred         particles    per c.c.       On the top of Bun Nevis, on
Callievar, and in Dumfriesshire,                    the number was occasionally only
about three          hundred, but when we get near villages, the number
goes    up to thousands, and in cities to hundreds of thousands.
     Though         the    number      of     particles in       the atmosphere increases
enormously          as we approach the centres                  of human habitations, yet
when we look more closely at the numbers in the table, we find that
the increase, though great, is not by any means                          in proportion to the
increase      of the sources of pollution.                 A    small village or town may
make the passing air nearly                   as   polluted as a large city.           Now why
should the pollution not be in direct proportion                          to the number of
fires and other sources of contamination.                        Is it possible that when
the number           of particles      becomes        very great, so that they are very
dose together, that many may unite and form one                              1   so that what
we     count as one,         in city air, may really           be a vast number adhering
together.          As yet we have no information                 as to whether these very
fine dust particles ever do attract and adhere to each other or not.
There       is,   however,    an evident reason           why the particles do not in
crease in number            in direct proportion to the amount of the pollution,
which       is    this, — with the increase in the           size of the city there        is   not

only an increase          in the number of particles in the air, but there is
also an increase         in the depth of the polluted stratum of air, over the
city.       The Eiffel Tower tests showed that the polluted air                                   of Paris
rose to a height of more than 1000 feet.                             Probably on the day the
tests were made          it    may have extended to many times that          height, as
extremely polluted air came to                      the top of the tower from time to
time.       The larger the city the greater                      will    be the mass            of heated
air rising over          it,   and the greater          its ascending power, so                   that the
depth of polluted air leaving                  a    city must be very great,                    while that
leaving     a    small town will bo much less.                       So that when we add to
our knowledge of the number of particles, the greater depth                                          of the
polluted stratum of air over cities, we are better able to understand
why the air of cities           is   not more impure than the tests show                          it to    be.
   When the Eiffel Tower                   tests were            made     the air was           fairly dry,
which favoured the ascension                       of the heated              air.    When, however,
the air     is   damp,    it   seems      probable that the products of combustion
will    become loaded with condensed                    moisture, and this will counteract
the     ascending tendency of the heated                          air, and the thickened                   air
during this weather will probably keep lower down and give rise to
the     dull thick town          atmosphere          of damp weather, and to town fogs
when the wind falls, especially                    if   the condensation              is   intensified     hy
the cold produced by radiation.
   It    may hero be asked,               Is 200 particles              per c.c. the lower           limit
of tho purity           of our atmosphere,              or   is    there such          a    thing as      air
absolutely free from dust?                 The air at extreme elevations never has,
and probably never              will     be tested; but nature has provided                         a    test
which shows that even at very great heights dust                                is   present.      Where-
ever    a   cloud forms we know there                    is      dust, and as clouds form at
great elevations we may conclude that dust                               is   present at even these
great heights.           It    has been shown in             a   previous paper that conden
sation may take place in dust-free air                       ;   but while this            is   so, yet the
conditions under which this                    is   possible are such as never happen
in nature,        because       before    it   can take          place    the air requires to be
greatly supersaturated,              and be put into rapid oddying movements, or
receive      some violent         shock,       a    condition      of things never likely to
happen in the upper strata                     of the atmosphere.                     And further,         if
condensation did take place,                it     would not take the cloudy form bnt
the     rainy one   ;    that     is,   the centres of condensation would be few

and widely separated, so that each                  particle would be large and fall
rapidly as rain.           At   present therefore all the evidence points to the
conclusion that dust            is present in our       atmosphere    at whatever eleva
tion clouds form.
  3iow though           this conclusion        may be true, so that on the one Lai-d
we may      have evidence that at very great heights                  in our        aticvephere
there     may be enough               dust to form clouds,    and that while exp-eri-
ment      showg      there may be only 200 particles per              cc         in the air, we
are yet without         any guide         as to what is the number of parti-iIes                  in
pure unpolluted air.              The air at tops of mountains, and even at                   gr>s»i
heights away from mountains, may be polluted                         by artinrial           causes.
The dust of the            lower air will be carried by ascending                   currents to
great heights,        and much that is present in what we have called pure
air may be          of terrestrial origin. But even supposing the lower a;r
never carried         dust to great heights, yet there will be dust there, due
to the    disintegration of the vast quantities of meteoric matter, which
is daily    showered down into our atmosphere,                        where         it   becomes
highly heated           and       dissipated, thus       forming     fine        meteoric     dust.
What the number                 of particles of this meteoric          dust may be, we
cannot say,          nor can      we tell what its proportion          to terrestrial dust
may be at the           different elevations,       but it seems probable that the
meteoric     dust      will vary in quantity from time                to time,           with the
earth's   position in space.

     When       I   made     my last communication to the Society on atmo
spheric    dust,*       reference       was   made to the close relation wh:ch                  was
observed        between the transparency of the air and the number of
particles of dust          in   it,   when the tests were made at ColmoneiL                       At
the same        time    it   was pointed out that this relation was                      likely   to
bold good       only under certain conditions, that the amount of vapour
in   the air,       or rather the humidity or degree of saturation, would                         le

moisture before the air is cooled to the dew-point, that                                       is,   condense
vapour in unsaturated air.
     It   is   evident, therefore, that           if   the ordinary dust of our atmosphere
has an affinity for vapour, and causes                         condensation to begin while
tbc humidity of the air                    is   some distance        from the dew-point, that
the condensed            moisture will increase                the size of the particles, and
by so doing cause                a    decrease    in   the transparency of the                   air, under
conditions which at present are not understood.                                It will     be        therefore
necessary for us to bring                  a    considerable amount of evidence to bear
on this point, as the opinion generally held                          is     that though condensa
tion may be caused to take place in unsaturated air by the artificial
introduction           into   it     of certain vapours and gases, yet condensation
does not as        a   rule begin in our atmosphere                   till   the air      is   saturated.
     The question then comes to be, Is there any evidence                                            to show
that condensation really does take place on the ordinary atmospheric
dust, before the air               is   saturated,     and    if   so at what stage of                relative
humidity         does   it    begin to take place         1    The dust-counting apparatus
evidently places in our hands                     a   method of investigating this                     point;
indeed, without            it,   it     would be nearly hopeless to attempt its solu
tion.      During       the      investigation         this   is   one of the points to                which
attention was closely directed, and the conclusion come to,                                             from
all the evidence              that has been collected                so far,        is    that we have
been far too much in the habit of supposing that condensation                                             can
only begin just at or immediately beforo saturation         reached.                           is
This investigation distinctly points to condensation beginning long
beforo saturation             is   attained, and while the air                 is   still dry enough
to give    a     difference of some degrees between the wet and dry                                     bulb
thermometers.
     In   order to get the necessary information                        to enable          me to come
to   a   conclusion on this point,               it   was customary to enter               in the note
book, along         with      the number of particles observed,                      as   many of the
meteorological conditions                  as possible.        Amongst         other things noted

the      transparency        of the air, especially when                          one    is constantly
changing the position where the observations were made, and where
the -risibility of      hills at different distances cannot                       be noted.     Though
these      observations   do lack accuracy, yet they point in a rough but
perfectly       distinct way to the conclusion that it is not necessary for
the air to be saturated                in order that condensation may take place                              ;
they rather indicate              that at almost all             states of        humidity the dust
has    some      moisture         condensed          on    it,    and that as the humidity
increases       the    amount of deposited moisture increases with      and                       it,
increases     at   a   rate much quicker than the humidity, especially when
the air    is   approaching the point of saturation.
    It   may be remembered               that in the Colmonell                    observations    it    was
noticed that          the transparency          of the air depended,                    on the number
of    dust particles    in it; with 9000 particles per c.c. the air was
extremely       thick, with 5000    was thick, and was clear only when
                                           it
the number            fell below 1000.               The Colmonell                observations      were
made     in   winter, while the air was damp, and its humidity did not
vary enough           to have a great influence on the transparency.
     To illustrate      the effect of humidity, let us turn to the observations
recorded        in this paper.           Taking the Hyeres observations                          first,   it
¦"ill be    at once         seen that the humidity has                       a   powerful modifying
influence       on the effect which the number of particles has on the
transparency           of the atmosphere.                 It     is   true       that owing to local
pollution the numbers observed at                     this station may be too high, and
only correct          for the air near         the    ground.           We shall take only the
Finouillet and   La Plage observations as of any use, the others being
too   polluted from local causes.  It will be seen from these that air
with even more than 4000 particles per c.c. may be very clear and
transparent        if  it   is   very dry — with that number of dust particles and
a   depression         of the wet bulb of             10 degrees             or more, the air was
very transparent, as on the 21st                 March and 3rd April.                     It   may be as
well to note here that the observations                          taken on the 4th of April,
when the number           of particles was very great, are of no value for
our present        purpose, as on this day the wind brought the smoko of
Toulon direct to the top of                Finouillet, and while the air generally
was clear,       yet in the direction of Toulon                   it   was thick.
     The effect         of humidity       is    very clearly seen in the observations
 taken at     Cannes.            There was no very great difference in the number

of particles on the mornings of the 10th and 11th April — but the
air on the 10th was very clear, owing to it being very dry, the wet
bulb being depressed 13°; while the morning of the 11th was thick,
owing to       a gTeat increase            in the humidity,          the wet bulb on this
occasion being depressed                only   2°.
  The Bellagio and Baveno observations show the same result, but
not so satisfactorily.             Though every precaution was taken to test the
air where it was free from local pollution, yet it is evident this was
not possible under the conditions at these stations.
   Coming now to the Rigi observations, it                         will    be noticed that the
air was thickest on the 21st, when it contained the fewest particles.
This thickness           was owing to humidity, a good deal of moisture being
deposited      on the dust.           It will      be noticed that there         was a depres
sion of l°-5 in the wet bulb at the time, showing that the air
was not saturated.                 As this     was the      first occasion     on which     I had
made observations on this dense form of condensation,                                I   carefully
noted the state of the air with regard to dryness.                             The depression
of the wot bulb given in the table may not be quite correct, though
taken as carefully            as   possible under the conditions.              It may     possibly
be too great, owing to the air having been heated locally.                                 It   was
observed       that all objects in the open air were quite dry, not only
stones which might have been kept                         dry by   heat communicated from
beneath,       but all surfaces,            such     as   wooden fences,       &c.       The only
exception to this was the grass, which carried drops of moisture at
the tips of its blades,              but this came from within the plant, there
being no indication                of the other parts of the blades being wetted
by fog.
   It   is,   however, very evident that though all exposed surfaces were
dry on this occasion,                it    does not necessarily follow           that the air
was     not        saturated.        The     reason       why the fog particles did not
wet the exposed              surfaces      may have been           that these surfaces          were
all heated          by radiation, and the fog particles would be evaporated
in the hot air in contact with the exposed surfaces, as radiation                                can
undoubtedly              penetrate    a    great     depth    of    fog.   I   regret that        no
observations were made in this direction.*                            It   may be noticed in
passing,      that the Swiss Meteorological                   Report       for the Rigi Kulm
shows the depression                 of the wet bulb at one o'clock on the 25th
               *
                    It   lias, however,    been confirmed     by later observations.

 to have been        0°'9   C,  or almost exactly the same as found by me.
 But as the thermometer           at this situation is exposed in a metal box,
 it   also would be     exposed to radiation and slight heating. As there
was a      considerable amount of light at the time, there would be but
little fog overhead.          It seems therefore probable         that radiant heat
would penetrate         and heat all surfaces and keep them dry, and heat
the    air in contact with them.              The wet bulb depression recorded
was therefore       probably too high.
      On the morning of the 22nd there were far more particles in the
air than on the 21st, but the air was clear owing to an increase in
the dryness,       the wet bulb being now             depressed   6°.  As the day
advanced        the  air got hazy, owing        to an increase   in both dust and
moisture.        On the 23rd the air     was very clear, both dust and moisture
having decreased.            The dust and moisture            remained   much    the
 same      till the close of the observations, and the air retained its
 clearness to the end.         So clear was it that occasionally Hochgerrach
 was    visible, a condition of the atmosphere which, to those who know
  the   Rigi,   will be  a good indication       of the transparency.
      At Lucerne on the 25th the dust and moisture were both very
  low and the       air was very     clear.    On the 26th the dust increased
  considerably, while the humidity remained nearly the same, and
 the    air was hazy.
      No conclusions      can be drawn on this point either from the Eiffel
  Tower or      the London observations.
      Passing over the tests of city air, we shall now enter more into
  detail of the     Kingairloch     observations, as the air at that situation
  was less     polluted,   and the observations are better suited than the
  previous      ones for showing      the effect of dust and of humidity on
  the   transparency of the atmosphere.             First let us consider the effect
   which the number         of particles has on the transparency of the air,
  and see     if the conclusion contained in the previous paper is con
   firmed by these       later observations.        This conclusion was that the
   greater the number of particles          the thicker was the air.       For this
   purpose, as already explained,         we must select observations made        on
   days when the      humidity   was the same.        Taking those days on which
    the wet    bulb was depressed     4°,  namely, on the 6th, 10th, and 15th
    of the month, and arranging         them in the order of the number of
    particles, thus —

     It will    be seen that with a humidity corresponding to a depression
of 4°, that         if     there were 550 particles the                 air was clear, and that
as   the number of particles increased                          the transparency decreased.
Again, take the 12th and 13th; on both of these days the humidity
was the same, namely, 5°, but the one was clear which had                                    only 710
particles      in    it,   while the other was thick owing to there                        being 3000
particles present.              Again,    there      was        the same        humidity           on the
morning of the 5th              as at 1.30       p.m. on        the    6th, but on the 6th                the
air was clear owing to there being only about 300 particles                                          in it,
while on the previous day                 it     was thick            owing to the presence                of
more than four times that number.
     These figures all tend to confirm the conclusion previously arrived
at from the Colmonell observations,                        namely, that the transparency                   of
the air depends              on the number of particles of dust                   in it.         We shall
now     see    how far the Kingairloch observations support the other
conclusion, that the amount of moisture in the air has also an effect
by     increasing            the size    of the      particles,          and    so     reducing         the
transparency.               We shall    use those    Kingairloch             figures and see       if   this
affinity of the dust for moisture has practically                               an}' effect        on the
transparency             of the atmosphere.
     When       the observations began               on the 3rd of              July       there    was    a
good deal of dust in the air, about 3000                               per c.c.      This    degree        of
impurity continued next day, but fell to about one-half on the 5th
and to one-third on the morning of the 6th.                                  Kow, though the dust
gradually decreased during these days,                          it    will   be observed          that the
thickness gradually increased                    from       a   haze on the 3rd             to    thick   on
the 6th.            The reason for this decrease in the transparency was the
increase       in the humidity which took place with the decrease in the
dust, the        humidity        falling from       a      depression         of 13° on the 3rd to
4° on the           6th.      Here the decreased transparency produced by in
crease   in    size due to humidity more than counteracted                           the effect of the
decrease in numbers,               showing how powerful the influence of humi
dity    is,   even when the humidity                is     some degrees from saturation.

     This   dependence      of transparency on humidity may be illustrated
by these         observations in another way.  Taking days on which the
number of particles was nearly the same, but on which the humidity
was different.               On the 5th, with 1500 particles and                       a   wet bulb
depression of 6e, the                air was thick      ;   with about the            same     number
of particles on the 8th, but with                   a   depression of 9°, the air had                     a
medium clearness ; on the morning                           of the 10th, with 814 and                     a
depression of          only    4°, the air was medium clear ; whereas at 1.30 p.m.
on the 16th           it was very       clear,   with the      same amount of dust,                 but   a
depression        of   7\       "With      500 particles and        a   depression of 4°, tho
air was clear          on the 15th, but very clear on the 17th with the                             same
number         of particles          but    8° depression.         It will       bo    noticed that
when there was a depression                      of only     4°   the air was thick, unless
there was less          than 1000 particles per c.c, and that                    if   the numbers
increased and the              air   was at all clear there was also an increase                          in
the dryness.
     It will     be observed that the number obtained                      on the morning of
the 9th does           not    agree very     well with the others.               The number on
this morning            was high and the dryness not very great, and yet the
air had a medium                clearness.       "We, however, leave tho figures                   in the
table,    and the only explanation                  we can offer is that this number
was      local    and due to an almost entire absence                    of wind at the time,
though      it must be admitted that the numbers                        are ratl>er constant to
be    explained in this way.
     The Alford observations point to the same conclusions.                                    I    must,
however, state here that the figures entered in the columns                                        headed

which has been kindly supplied                          to me by    Dr Buchan.                 Further,
the      temperatures          are the maximum              temperatures for the day, and
the humidities are the maximum                       humidities         for the day calculated
from the morning and evening readings considered                                  with reference
to the maximum temperature.                        The temperatures will therefore                     be
 higher than           if they had         been taken at the time the dust tests were
 made,       and the          wet bulb depression             will also     be    much greater.
 We can therefore               only compare these Alford                tests    amongst them

   The most interesting of the Alford tests are those made on the
16th of September.           On the morning of that day the air was medium
clear,   with bright sunshine, and the number of particles was 1125

gradually thickened and lost its transparency as the day advanced,
and in the afternoon it was extremely thick,                   but clear overhead
and free from clouds.           When the air       was tested    at 5.30 p.m.    the
dust particles were found to             have increased      to a higher   number
than had been observed at this station — the number was 5700 per
c.c.    The great increase in the thickness of the air which took place
during the day was evidently             due    greatly to this increase     in the
amount of dust.          Increased humidity may possibly have had some
etlect, but probably       it  was not the chief cause, as the wet       bulb was
only depressed       l°-5 more at    9 a.m.   than at   9 p.m.
   An examination of          the Dumfries     series  of observations   bears   out
the   conclusions      we   have come      to   from    the   other figures.    The
relation between the transparency and the dust                   and humidity is
evident, but the figures obtained at the last situation are not so
clear on this point, probably owing to the air not being so free               from
local pollution.       The Dumfries observations might have been omitted
if it  were not that they give us information             on some other points.
It   will be observed      that the numbers at Dumfries            were  generally
very     high,   often extremely        so, for    a  thinly populated country
district.    An examination of        the figures in the column headed        wind,
shows us that these very high numbers generally occurred when the
wind was slight or variable,         as on  the 13th, 14th, 16th, 18th, and
19th of November.          The increase in the amount does not seem to have
been entirely due to the direction of the            wind bringing    the air from
impure sources, as the lower current as well as the general                   upper
circulation varied on these days from south by west to nearly north.
These largo numbers may therefore have been greatly due to an
accumulation       of purely local impurities, as it will be seen that
whenever the       air was very impure it always got much purer when
ever the wind increased.          These Dumfries observations are evidently
of less value than the Kingairloch ones for investigating the relation

between           the transparency             and the dust and humidity, because                       the
air at the former place being polluted by local causes, it is probable
there       would       be awant of uniformity in the air at different points
near each           other, and in the air from time to time.  This was con
firmed by the observations.                      The numbers varied                a good deal at short
intervals.          The effect of the wind in reducing the number of particles
may be          noticed also in the Kingairloch and Alford observations.
     There is a point of some interest brought                               out by a comparison of
the Dumfries and                Kingairloch observations to which it may                        be worth
while directing attention.                       It   is,   that while the transparency of the
air depends on the amount of dust, and on the humidity, or degree
of saturation           of the air,       it   would        appear that the thickening                effect
of the humidity depends on the temperature, that                                     is   on the tension
of the vapour.                 For instance,          a   humidity which gives             a   depression
of    4°   at   a   temperature of 60° has                   a    much greater thickening             effect
than,      the same depression at 50°.                      This might have           been anticipated,
but         was      only while the Dumfries                        tests were being made           that
                                                                                                           it it
      it
was thought             that the air       was clearer for the same                  humidity than
was at          Kingairloch.             An examination               of the figures in the table
supports this conclusion.                      For instance, take the following examples
when the air had                 about the same amount of dust and about the
same       depression of the wet bulb.

      Compare the above observations when the dust and the wet bulb
depression           were similar.             In July, when the temperature was over
60", the air was               thick, whereas in October and November, when the
temperature             was 10°          lower, the air was clear or medium.                           The
other figures mostly                point in the            same direction.           The air observed
 on Ben         Nevis would probably not have                            been     nearly so clear   if     its
 temperature had not been low.
      This result       I       have said might                 have been anticipated, because
 at   the higher temperature                   with the           same    wet bulb depression the
 vapour tension             will    be considerably               greater than at the lower, and
 each      particle      will attach to itself              a   greater amount of water.            These

conclusions, however, require many more, and much more carefully
conducted experiments to prove them satisfactorily.                                  The objections
to the Dumfries observations are many.                            First,     the situation is        low,
and    the dust        would tend to collect there                      to an       undue amount.
Second,     the humidity           is too high, owing to this station being                          near
water, so that while               the dust-counter and                the thermometers              gave
the condition         of the air in the valley, the tests for transparency
were necessarily            made     through      a   higher stratum of air, in                     which
both dust and humidity would probably be less.                                     Then again,         the
difficulty of estimating transparency,                      and    also in comparing these
estimates       made       at different stations.            The different hills visible at
each station should have been graduated                           off, and used as a scale              of
transparency.          This, however, was not done till the last observations
were made.
   Though these results should be received with caution, yet                                    I   think
it will   be admitted that they clearly point to an interesting line                                    of
enquiry, and encourage                  us to push on our investigations into                          the
dust in the atmosphere.                   I    may remark that              it   is advisable       not to
make comparisons                of these tests when the wet bulb is depressed only
about     1°,    because        when the saturation is so great, accuracy                             can
not be attained,           as    local conditions, such           as   wet trees, the exposure
of the bulbs, &c, may cause an error equal to the whole depression.
   The Dumfries observations show an interesting relation between
the weather          and the amount of dust in the air.                           During    the whole
time the weather remained dull and thick, the air was highly charged
with dust.           Another        important         point was that when the clouds
cleared     away,          dense   fogs       formed, owing            probably        to   the      great
radiating power of the air, due to the great amount of dust in                                      it It
will   also be noticed that on the fine days the air had generally                                   little
dust in it.
   The conclusion forced                  upon us by          a   consideration of all these
observations         is that the dust           in our      atmosphere            condenses       vapour
when      the air is far from being saturated.                         It   seems probable that
in all states of humidity the atmospheric dust has some moisture
attached        to   it,   and that       as   the    humidity          increases       the     load    of
moisture        also increases      ;   and further, all observation seems to point
to this form of condensation producing even                             a   very thick condition
of the atmosphere               before the air        is   quite saturated.            The observa

tions   made on      the Rigi, when the mountain top was covered with
cloud, p)iats to the formation             of even this dense form of condensa
tion in unsaturated             air.   It    must     be    admitted    that    the  Rigi
observations of the         humidity      on this day are not very reliable, and
the subject      might      be dismissed        were    it not that    there   are many
observations made          by other     observers,    on Ben      Xevis and    elsewhere,
which point to the same conclusion-
    There    is  another      point to which          I   can   only call attention at
present, as it has       not yet been investigated. It has reference to                the
effrct of the     direction of the wind on the thickness of the air.                     It
has teen      sometimes thought, while these                  tests were    being made,
that with certain          directions of wind the air was unduly thick for
the number of particles and the humidity.                       This would imply that
the dust     particles brought by certain directions of wind were larger
or    more    hygroscopic        than those       brought from        other   directions.
 This   seems    passible, as it is the winds from inhabited districts that
 are suspected      of being unduly thick.               As   these bring    the sulphur
 products formed          in burning       coal,   it  seems     possible they may be
 charged    with vapour condensing particles.                  This point, however,       is
 one that requires       further investigation.
           Apparatus       for Testing     ttie  Condensing Power of Dust.
      ¦While   on the subject         of the condensing power of dust, or the
 affinity of atmospheric dust for vapour,                   I  may here refer     to some
 experiments made a year or two ago on this point.                         The principle
 I   then tried to develop was to collect the atmospheric dust on glass
 plates, and test       if  water vapour condensed              on the deposited dust
 in unsaturated air.          The following was the plan adopted of carrying
 out this idea.        First   as to the method of collecting the dust.               This
  was   done    by placing glass plates inside a thermometer screen, a
  rxiin, or  wherever it was desired to get the dust to be tested. These
  plates were     sometimes placed horizontally, and the dust allowed to
  fall on them.        Another       plan of collecting the dust was to deposit
  it  on the glass plates       by the method used in my thermic filter.                   If
  it was desired to collect the dust inside a room by this method, the
   glass plate was      placed vertically and in close contact with ono of
   the panes    of glass in the window.             The plate was kept in its place
   by means     of a little india-rubber solution.             As this  plate was colder

than the air in the room the dust was deposited upon it.                                    If it    -was
desired    to collect the dust         in the outer air, the plate of glass was
attached    to the         outside of the window pane, but kept at a distance
of two or three millimetres from it.                    It      was held        in its   place   by the
india-rubber solution, four pieces of sheet india-rubber being fixed at
the corners to keep the plate away from the window glass.                                        By this
arrangement        the       outside air circulated in the space between                             the
outside plate and the window, and as this air got heated                                         on the
window pane            it   was   warmer than the plate and deposited its dust
on its cold surface.              It   may be mentioned that the plates used for
collecting the dust were small pieces of glass mirror about 10 cm.
square.     Mirrors         were used, as the condensed                    vapour is more easily
detected on them than on clear glass.
   Having collected the dust in either of                        these ways, its condensing
power was tested in the following manner.                                  A   small cell was pre
pared     about    4    cm. square and          l-5    cm.       deep, and open at the top.
The top edge of the cell was covered with a thickness of india-rubber.
The dusty plate was placed so                  as to    form       a   cover to the cell, being
held down by means of spring catches                       ;    the india-rubber enabled the
plate to make          a    water-tight joint with the celL                     The cell was pro
vided with two pipes, one for taking in water and the other for
taking away the overflow.                  A   thermometer was fixed with its bulb
occupying the centre of the cell                ;   and further the cell was provided
with a stirrer.            The whole arrangement was almost exactly the same
as a    Dines' hygrometer.               The dusty plate, before it was put in its
position, had the dust carefully cleaned                         off one half of           it,   so that
when put in its place one half of the glass covering the cell was
dusty and the other half clean.                     Cold water          was then run through
the cell and the temperature                   of the plate gradually lowered, the
plate    meanwhile being closely watched to                            see     when condensation
began     on the       dili'erent halves, and the temperature                       noted when        it
began on the dusty half and when                      it       began on the clean           part, and
the difference,        if   any, noted.        In this          wa}'

densing power of the dust was obtained,                           as the difference          between
these two temperatures                 gives the temperature               above    the    dew-point
at which the dust condensed                 vapour.
  It will    be noticed that the plates                        for collecting the dust             were
much larger than the cell.                 By this      means the              cooled surface over

the cell was surrounded                by an uncooled part of the plate, and any
change      in   the appearance of the cooled dust could be easily detected
by contrast with the surrounding area.
     The first thing to be done was to test the working of the
apparatus,        and see how         it acted with dusts of known composition
and     known condensing power.                 For this purpose smoke of burning
magnesium,             gunpowder,       and    sodium      were   used — the    first    on
account       of its small affinity          for water vapour,      the second     for its
condensing           power.       It  is well known that the smoke from                gun
powder is far more dense in damp than in dry weather, the difference
being due no            doubt to the condensation which takes place on the
 smoke       when the air is damp.               While sodium smoke was selected
 on account         of its great affinity for      water.      The smoke of these sub
 stances was produced                by burning a little of them in an enclosed
 space,    the test       plates were placed in the enclosure, and the smoke
 allowed       to    fall on them.         The mirrors      with the deposited dusts
  were then        tested, and their condensing powers measured,                with the
  following         result   : — Magnesia      was found       to condense    at   almost

  hegan to       show signs of condensing at              a  temperature   5° above the
  dew-point ;         while the soda condensed vapour from air at a tempera
  ture 17° above          its dew-point.       In making these tests it is necessary
  that the air         in the room, where the testing is done, be very dry,
  otherwise       the beginning of the condensation on the dust cannot be
   detected,     because       the dust surrounding         the cooled surface already
   has some       moisture condensed on it.             To overcome this difficulty it
   was customary          to heat and dry the plates before testing them.
        The  different kinds of dust, when tested in this way, having thus
   shown     a   distinct difference in their affinities for vapour,          tests    were
   now made           of the dust collected from the atmosphere.               It    is un
   necessary       to go     into the detail of       these   experiments, as although
    they   distinctly       point to atmospheric          dust   having an affinity      for
    water vapour,        and this affinity seemed to vary with the dust, yet the
    method      of testing is not very accurate.            As the condensation begins
    by imperceptible           degrees,  it is very much        a question of quickness
     of perception,       and carefulness of working, that determines when the
     first appearance       of condensation      will  be detected ; and even the first
     appearance       is not the real beginning, but only the state at which it

 has become visible to the observer.         It  may, however, be     mentioned
 that dust collected in a smoking-room showed a decidedly greater
 condensing power than that from the outer air.            Of    ten tests  made
 with dust from     the  smoking-room, the dust that had the least con
 densing power showed condensation at a temperature of 2°-2 above
 the dew-point, whilst the most powerfully             condensing     dust    con
 densed at 4° '5 above the dew-point, while the mean of the ten              gave
 3° above    the dew-point.     Of    the  ten tests of   the    dust from     the
 outer air, the lowest showed       a  condensing point of       1° 8 above the
 dew-point, and the highest of 3°'2, and a mean of            2° '3.   It should
 be mentioned that the depth of the          deposit did not seem to have
 any influence on the condensing power of the dust, as the aniouut
 of dust that collected in one day gave about the same effect as that
 collected in thirteen days.
    This condensing power of dust would            seem to explain     why it is
 that the glass in picture frames, and other places, frequently looks
 damp when the air is not saturated.            The same damp deposit may
be easily seen on windows during cold weather,           particularly    if they
 have not been cleaned      for some days.        The damp-looking        deposit
 can be easily detected    by cleaning    a   small part of the pane.        The
 cleaned   part will remain undewed, while the surface surrounding               it
 will be damp, and be greasy when rubbed.             I need    not say that      a
 certain degree of humidity      in the air is necessary for seeing          this
 clearly, as  the glass  must be cooled       by the outer air to near the
 dew-point of the air in the room.        Again, this condensing power of
 dust may in part explain the reason why it is so necessary              to keep
 electrical apparatus   free from dust,      if  we wish   the    insulation    to
be good.     The damp collected by the dust will decrease the insulat
ing power of the glass or other insulator.

    We have    seen that these observations all point       to the conclusion
that moisture is deposited on the particles of atmospheric dust in
air which is not saturated.       This condensation      seems to take place
while the air is comparatively dry, and the amount deposited in
creases   with  the  humidity.     The deposit which takes place under
these   conditions will probably be caused by the affinity           — chemical
or surface — of  the particles for vapour, while true cloud condensation

seems       only to begin when the air is near                             the point of saturation.
There seems no definite degree of                         humidity       necessary          for the first form
of condensation              to begin, or            if there      is,   it   begins while the air                   is
Tery dry, and            by such imperceptible                  degrees,      it    has not been noticed.
There       is   no hard and fast line between what we call clear air and
thick      haze.         The clearest air            has some        haze, and the effect of                        in
creasing         humidity       is   to increase the thickness                     of the air.        But from
clear air up to cloudy condensation                               there       is   no real difference in
kind,       only in the amount, of the thickening.                                    But when cloudy
condensation             begins,     a    real change in the nature of the condensation
takes place.              The dust particles               have now no tendency to condense
the   vapour; each particle seems to have got its affinity satisfied, and
true condensation begins, owing                             to the tendency of the saturated
vapour          to condense.              The affinity of the particles has now little
influence, but the size of the different particles has                                    ;   the larger ones
getting the most moisture deposited on them.                                         All      the particles at
this stage seem to cease to attract the vapour, and the vapour                                                 is    no
longer deposited on the whole number of particles                                       ;     but   a   compara
tively small proportion, and these the larger particles, receive the whole
 of   the   condensing molecules.                        This    seems to be the reason                    why at
about saturation              a   change occurs            in the    appearance             of the condensa
tion,       a    sudden       thickening            of   the air takes              place     along with an
increased          light reflecting power.
      It   might be thought that                 if      this incipient condensation, due to
affinity, took place before the true condensation, then there ought
to be some          evidence of           it   in    the    every day phenomena of nature.
For        instance, does the upper moving                        front of     a    cumulus cloud show
this incipient stage                  of condensation?                   At first sight               we       might
expect      it     would.       I    do not      think, however, that                it   has been noticed,
possibly          owing to the conditions                       necessary      for seeing        it   not being
easily obtained.                We cannot expect to                  see      it    at the upper surface
after       the     cloud       is   formed, the            transition             at that      surface         from
saturated to dry air                 is   far too sudden.            If    we are to            see     it,   in the
formation           of   a   cumulus cloud, we must look for                           it     just before the
 cloud          begins    to show,            iu the clear and rising                         air, where        it   is
 possible we may find                     a    thickening         taking place before, and                      at       a
 lower level, than that at which the true cloud condensation                                                  begins.

gradual thickening has been frequently seen.                                 At the Italian lakes,
on many occasions, %vhen the air was damp and still, there has been
noticed in close proximity every stage of condensation, not divided
by the hard line usually observed,                       but where           it was impossible to
say where the thick air ended and the cloudy began.                                    Again, this
gradual change              can      often be seen in the sky overhead.                        With
approaching change                of weather,      the sky is often seen to                change by
imperceptible             degrees from perfect             transparency to
                                                                                    " thick," and
then to cloud.             It   is very doubtful           if    we are entitled to expect to
find     any well          defined      haze   in the air immediately surrounding
clouds,    as wo       do not know sufficient about the conditions                           existing
there.        It    may    bo as well to note              here that on all occasions               on
which     I                       of making observations on this
               have had an opportunity
point, that the transition from moist air in the cloud to dry air
immediately outside it was very rapid, so rapid as to give only a
sharp outline.
                                                   Haze.
      The conclusion to which these observations point is that haze is
caused        by the dust in our atmosphere,                      and that this dust has in
almost all degrees of humidity more or less water attached to it.                                    A
thick    haze may be the result                of much dust and little moisture or of
little dust and much moisture, but                   the moisture less than saturation.
According to this view, in most conditions of our atmosphere,                                    haze
is but an attenuated or arrested                   form of condensation — arrested for
want of moisture, or it may be                  a decayed         form of condensation, that
is,    cloudy condensation changed                   to haze           by the reduction of its
humidity,           possibly by rise of temperature,                     and the fog particles
evaporated,          till they hold only             the water of              attraction.     If   the
humidity be decreased still further the haze clears more and more,
but the            dry dust still has          a    hazy        or thickening       effect    on the
atmosphere.
      This conclusion           is   confirmed by an examination of the figures in
the table,          where    it      will   be seen that whenever the air was                       dry
and      hazed       there      was     much       dust in        it,   and that      as     the dust
decreased the             haze likewise        decreased.         It    is   well known that hot
weather       is    often accompanied           by   a   thick     haze.       The explanation of
this would appear to be, that during hot weather we have generally
much dust in the air,                  and further as has been already explained

this dust owing to the high temperature has much moisture attached
to    it,   even though the                air   is   what   is   called dry.        The conclusion we
have come to is,                 that though there may                be other causes of haze, yet
dust       is   generally        the cause of it.
                                      Notes from Hie              Rigi Kulm.
     WMle         at the        Rigi Kulm,       I     observed      a   few meteorological pheno
mena         which may be briefly referred to here,                                 as   they have        some
bearing on our subject.                          On my arrival at midday on the 21st of
May, the             hill top was covered with clouds, and we                                 remained      all
day in          a     thick fog. However, as the afternoon                                   advanced,      an
occasional glimpse was obtained of some                                  of the higher Alps of             the
south, standing clear above the mass of cloud which                                           filled in the
valleys, and from time to time enveloped                                  the place of observation.
These unfortunately were but limited and passing glimpses, and all
 to the west was blocked                          with clouds.           At   last,      however, shortly
 before the sun                dipped      below the horizon, the clouds began to clear
 overhead,           and at last they rolled away,                       and the         top of the       Rigi
 stood          clear    above     a     billowy       mass of clouds, and the                western      sun
 suddenly burst out                      brilliantly, dissipating in            a        moment     the   dull
     chill oppression of the fog.                     So sudden and welcome was the change,
 that the few who were waiting on the mountain                                        top,   in   the almost
 forlorn hope of seeing the setting sun, raised                                 a    cheer    of welcome      ;
 a     cheer      which rose simultaneously from every                              one, and could not
 have been more real, spontaneous,                            and stirring had we been               a    body
     of   sun- worshippers            welcoming our divinity.
          The change, however, was momentary, for soon another mass                                          of
     cloud passed             across the     hill top and          obscured     the view, but not for
     long, and          it,   in turn,    was followed by another, each succeeding                        mass
     being less          than the previous one, while each glimpse showed                                  the
 west to be             clearing, and at last no clouds rose above the mountain,
     and   a    magnificent        view was obtained all round.                     Occasional openings
     in   the clouds          below gave passing views of the lakes and valleys low
     down near the base               of the mountain, but on this occasion the great
     attraction was the cloud scenery.                         In most directions            there extended
 a     vast sea         of clouds, the upper surface of which was slightly lower
     than the        point of view.              This wide         area of clouds extended             nearly
     level      as      far as the eye could                  see,   its upper surface             brilliantly

illuminated         by the setting sun.             It   looted like a vast sea over
whose waves gravitation had ceased to hold sway, and whose waters
were luminous         with      condensed       sunshine.
   "When the         hill top      began    to emerge       from the clouds and to be
only occasionally covered             with      fog, as each fog mass cleared                away
to the east and let the sun shine on us, we saw our shadows cast by
the setting sun on the retreating bank of cloud, " glories surround

ing the          shadow-heads.        Around       the   shadow         of his     head       each
observer     saw a coloured halo            ;    near the shadow-head there was a
small luminous but colourless halo, and round this                            a   rainbow-like
circle of colours,         violet being inmost and red outside.                    When this
coloured circle was             brilliant another circle of           colours     immediately
outside     was seen, and having the colours                 in the        same order as the
first.
      After this display of colour in             the east had come to an end, and
no more          clouds passed over the hill top, owing to the air being
now clear to the west, an interesting display of colour took place
in the west.          At    a    point between      the sun and the observer,                there
was a break         in the cloud stratum, and               the air seemed to be rising
through this opening,             and tearing the eastern edge of the cloud into
fragments,        which it carried from the dark shadow up into the sun
light.      Here these fragments were rapidly dissolved in the dryer air
above, and as they dissolved they gave rise in their dying moments
to a     brilliant display of         opalescent     colours,        the different parts of
the vanishing fragments taking on the most                           brilliant    colours,     and
changing from one colour to another,                  and then vanishing            so   quickly
that it was impossible mentally to follow the rapid display.
      The display of opalescent colours in the sky has been commented
on a good deal during the last few years, and Professor                             Tait     has,   I
think, remarked that it must take place oftener than is imagined.
There does seem to be a probability of it occurring often, but the
conditions necessary for the eye perceiving it do not seem to                                   be
frequent.          On this occasion the colours were                  seen against       a    dark
background, formed by the shadowed eastern edge of the cloud.
These colours were seen near                the sun, at only           a   small angle from
it,   and   it   would appear       they are produced           in    the same way as the
colours in halos seen round the sun.                     In experimenting artificially
with these halos,          it   may be observed       that the particular colour              does

not depend on the angle at which                             it is   seen, but that        it    depends
also on the size         of the fog particle producing it. For instance, if                              we
produce a           cloudy condensation in a closed vessel placed between                                 us
and a light,              the    light      is surrounded by a coloured halo, but the
colour at any             particular angle is not constant, but changes as we
change            the    size of the fog particles ; so that if we have two
quantities of air, each                    with different      sized particles     in    it,    and both
of   these seen           at the same angular distance from the sun, we                           will   see
different colours at the same angle and close to each other.
     This mixture of colours producing the opalescent                                   effect    may be
produced           artificially.           All   that   is   necessary   is   to place    a      vessel of
hot water nearly                in   a   direct line between the observer and a bright
light       As the condensed vapour rising from the hot water re-evapor
ates,    the particles which were at first too large to give colour effects
shine out          in brilliant colours when vaporized to the size necessary to
give the          result As the rising strata of air having different sized
particles         in them are close to each other, different colours are seen in
close    proximity, and as the size of the particles diminishes rapidly the
colours change                quickly.        These colours are best seen when the steam
is   seen against a             black surface, and the eye shaded from the direct
light        of   the lamp.
     On this evening on the                      Kigi brilliantly coloured rings                were also
seen     surrounding the sun when just setting.                          The rings changed too
rapidly for anything definite to be noted.        These rings did not appear
when      a   foggy cloud passed over the sun, but when there was only fine                         a
haze     ;    that      is,   the cloud particles were too large to produce colours,
and      it   was       only when they were nearly vaporized that the effects
were produced.
     All      the      brilliant display of colour             we were favoured           with     on the
 21st.     was         gone by the following             day.        The morning of the 22nd
was fine, the                 clouds had all settled down to              a    much lower level,
to about 1000 feet below the top                             of the mountain, and the upper
 surface          of    the cloud           stratum had now            become      more         irregular,
 cumulus shapes tending to form at different places.                                      During         the
 rest of my             visit to this station the clouds gradually cleared away
 and the weather                was fine, and there were no other opportunities for
 seeing these            interesting colour phenomena.

one frequently observes                         a great   difference         in the condition of the
upper and lower airs               ;    and while making the observations on                                 the
transparency of the upper air which are entered in the table, a                                             note
was at the same time kept of the state of the lower air as                                       it changed
from hour to hour.                     As        these latter observations bear directly                       on
our subject,         I    shall here make some extracts from my note-book,
and owing to the kindness of M. Billwiller of the Swiss Meteoro
logical Office, Zurich,                I am       enabled    to give the condition of the                      air
with regard to humidity at different places at the lower levels                                                on
the dates corresponding to the                       Rigi    observations.
     Of the Swiss          observations,            those taken at Lucerne and Gersau are
the most suitable for our purpose,                          as   Lucerne is situated down the
lake while Gersau is up the lake and on the opposite      of the                                side
Rigi. So that, while the Lucerne observations may be taken to
represent the condition of the air towards the north of the Rigi,
and the more open and inhabited parts of Switzerland, the Gersau
ones    will       represent       the condition             of the          air    to    the south           and
mountainous parts.
     On the 21st, owing to the fog, no view could be got of the lower
air.    On the morning of the 22nd the view was still closed by the
stratum of clouds covering the country to the north.                                            In   the after
noon, however,             these       clouds cleared            away sufficiently to show the
condition of the lower air.                         In my    notes      it    is recorded       that the air
high up was fairly clear                    ;    but on looking down to lakes and valleys
it   was decidedly thickisb, and           in the evening the air to the north,
east, and west was             very thick, while to the south it did not thicken.
Turning now              to the Swiss Meteorological Report for this day,                               I     find
that    at 1 p.m. the        air to the north gave                a depression            of the wet bulb
of 4°'2 C.,Jwhile that to the south gave 3°-0 C.                                    But     as the evening
advanced           the humidity             at Lucerne increased,                 and at    9   p.m.   the de
pression was only 1°               C,    while at Gersau the depression had increased
to 7°   "6    C.     Here we have a clearly indicated relation between the
transparency and the humidity.                              The observations on the                    hill   top
being made in the afternoon, the air to the north would be more
nearly saturated            than it was when the                      1 p.m.      readings were taken;
that    is,   the depression            would be less than                   4°    C,    and as stated the
air looked thickish.                   In       the evening      it   got very      thick owing         to the
humidity           increasing, the wet bulb                      depression         decreasing         to only

    °
 1    C.    Now note the difference, the air to the south did not thicken
in the ereoing,           this was owing to the air on this              side   of the
mountain getting dryer as the evening approached.
      On the morning           of the 23rd the air low down was thick all
round, owing         to the humidity being high on both sides                   of the
mountain.         At Lucerne the depression was only 2° C, and at Gersau
only     r-4.    In the afternoon matters changed, and became much the
same as they       were on the afternoon of the previous day.                  The air
to the south      was clear low down, but to tho north it was thick and
hazy.       To the north the wet bulb depression              was 5°-2 C. at    1  p.m.,
and fell to 2*      at 9 p.m., while in the south it was           3° 7  C. at  1 p.m.,
and increased        to 70-7     C. in the    evening.    Here again may be ob
served the same         relation between the transparency and the humidity.
The only difference           of importance in the air       on the 22nd and 23rd
was a strange       blackness in the air to the north on the 23 rd which
had not been        observed on the previous day.
      On the 24th and 25th nothing special was noted                 in the lower air
 in the different directions.           On both of these days tho air was clear
 both     high up and low down, and on looking at the Swiss Meteoro
 logical    Report   I see   the humidity was low on these days in both direc
 tions.      At Lucerne the wet bulb          depression  at  1 p.m.  was as much as
 7 C-8C.     on the 24th and 8° -4 C. on the 25th, and at Gersau            it was 9°1
 C. and 9° -6    C. respectively, and in the evening the air kept fairly dry
at both places.           All  through these observations of the air below tho
 mountain we find           the relation between the humidity          and the trans
parency to hold good               Increased dryness was always accompanied
by increased transparency.               I was  much struck while making these
 observations       with the      difference   in the   appearance    of the air low
 down when looking north and when looking south of the mountain,
 and thought        it might      be due to the amount of dust in the two
 directions, the         thickest air being towards the inhabited parts of
 the country.          At the time       I did  not expect this difference       in the
 humidity of the air at the two places which tho Swiss observations
 show.        It would be difficult to trace the causo of this difference in
  the humidity of the two places which are so near each other.                      Any
  attempt to trace        it to direction of wind would        be difficult owing to
  the     influence    of the surrounding         mountains      in producing      local
   currents.     It  is quite possible the difference       in  tho air to tho north

and south of the mountain may have partly heen due to the amount
of dust in    it,   and the blackness noticed on the 23rd may have heen
due to this cause, as at Lucerne               the wind      in the early morning           of
that day was blowing from the north, and would bring polluted air
up from the populated parts of the country.                      This north wind did
not seem to penetrate into the mountainous parts south of the Rigi,
as the wind at Gersau was south-west.
  It   may be asked,        Is   the air at the top of       a   mountain polluted to
any extent by the valley air             1    Is   the air on the mountain        top the
same as wo breathe           in the valley, only reduced            in pressure   t     No
very direct answer can be given to this question.                          There seems
however,     to     bo   very little doubt that the valley               air frequently
rises to the tops of hills, but this valley air               will generally      be more
or less mixed with the purer upper air, the amount of impure air
depending on the height, the shape of the hill, and other causes.
  It will    be observed         from the observations           made on the 25th           of
May on the Eigi Kulm and at Vitznau at the foot of the mountain,
that there was no very great difference                  in the amount of dust in
the air at the two places.               When allowance       is   made for the higher
pressure at the lower station, there was less at the foot at midday
than at the top in the morning.                     For practical    purposes     we may
look on the dust on these two occasions                 as   being the same, showing
that in all probability the air tested at the foot of the mountain
was the same as at the top.               This, however, does not prove that the
air of the valley ascended                to the mountain top, because on this
occasion    a   strong wind was blowing and the air was coming from
the unpolluted area of the Alps, so that both the upper and lower
air might have been free from local impurities.                      The observations
made on Callicvar           showed there was much less dust in the air                      at
the top than at the foot           ;     still they   also showed    that the air came
up from the valley as the numbers increased with                     a   change   of wind
from   a   populated direction.              The observations made on Finouillet
show the air at that station to be frequently very impure from the
ascent     of valley air.        The Eigi observations also show that in all
probability       the    valley air came to the hill top of course more                     or
less diluted with         pure    air.       When   there was little wind, as on the
21st, the     amount of dust was small; but on the 23rd, when                           the
wind began to blow, the amount of dust gradually increased                             to   a

fair number of particles,           and only decreased          after blowing      some
time.
     When      on the   Rigi it    was also noticed when there were clouds
in the valley, that the wind in driving them along, also drove them
up the slopes        of the mountains,        sometimes      to the very top.       The
condensation of the        moist air in the clouds supplied        sorno of the energy
necessary     for the ascent, as in some       cases the   clouds were seen to leave
the hill-side     and rise nearly vertically.          We therefore seem to have
very good reason       for supposing that even at such an isolated position
as the    Eigi Kulm the air is more or less polluted with valley air.                 At
stations    on the tops, or on the slopes of long ridge-shaped hills, the
air will be     practically valley air when         the  wind is    at right angles to
the ridge.
    There is another       point which      I  noticed at this elevated situation,
with which       I  shall   close these    Rigi   notes.     It  has reference   to the
colouring     of earth and sky seen at sunrise and sunset when observed
from the top       of mountains.         I think   the general     impression is that
 the colouring      is much finer      on these occasions when seen from an
 elevation    than from the valley.          Now    the result of my observations
 during my      stay at the Rigi Kulm all point the other way.
     The weather      was favourable for seeing           the sun rise and set on
 all the days      I  was there, and yet on none of them did                 I see  any
display     of colour    ; indeed,   I was    much struck by the want of it.
 On the 24th,       which    was the finest sunrise during the time,           the dis
tant snows       were tinged slightly red for        a few minutes only while the
sun was just       on  the horizon;     immediately it got       a very littlo clear of
the horizon       all colour was     gone.     The same was the case with the
sunsets,     greys    predominated over other colours.              Now during this
time    I was    told that,   as seen from Lucerne, the sunsets were remark
ably    fine for colour effects.         This would      seem to indicate that the
 colouring,     at least   under the conditions existing during my visit,
was    mostly done by the lower air — that the pure air between                      the
 mountains and the sun robbed the sun's rays of but                     little of their
 blue    light, and that it was the lower impure air between the hills
 and the observer       to which most of the colouring was due.
     This supposition, that the lower dusty humid                    air is the chief
  cause of    the colour in sunset effects is supported by other observa
  tions.     When on the top of the mountain                 I  frequently saw largo

cumulus clouds; the near ones were always snowy white, while                                     it   was
only the distant ones that were tarnished yellow, showing                                   that the
light came to these clouds unchanged, and it was only the air between
the far distant clouds and the observer                     that tarnished themyellow,
it required       a great      distance    at this elevation to give oven      a alight
colouring.        It    seems probable that the          lurid light of thunder clouds
owes its colouring to the dust and                   humidity of            air being
                                                                         the lower
excessive     at the time, and that these               clouds are really white, if we
saw them      near enough,            it being the     heavy moist air near the earth,
which changes            the white to a reddish colour                  in its    passage       to the
observer.      We        seem therefore to have             good        reason     for supposing
that the colouring at sunrise and sunset will be more brilliant when
seen from the valley than from the mountain top.
                                      Dust and Wind.
     It   may now be asked, Are              there any other meteorological                     pheno
mena connected              with   the amount of dust in our atmosphere                     ?    It     is
evidently rather soon to begin drawing conclusions on the relation
beween dust and many of the complex phenomena                                in   nature,       as the
number of observations               yet taken is far too small, and many of them
are not free from local influences,                  which greatly reduce their value.
There are, however,                one or two points to which we may here refer;
but it must be clearly understood that anything we have to say in
this part of the              paper     cannot be taken            as    indicating        anything
final.      They are given more            as suggestions         as    to some of the many
points in connection with our subject which await investigation.
     One of the first tilings a meteorologist                is   likely     to ask       is,   Do    you
find any      relation between the amount of dust in our atmosphere
and the distribution               of pressure   %    Has the air in cyclonic and anti-
cyclonic areas the same amount of dust                  ?    The answer to the question
is   easy and direct, but the interpretation of the answer                           is   more diffi
cult.      There       is   no doubt from the observations here given that,                            as
a    rule there    is   less dust in cyclonic than in antieyclonic areas.                             For
instance,     when the observations                  were made at Kingairloch,                   on all
days      on which the number of particles was                           low,    a   cyclone          was
passing      near, and        on all days the number was great the circulation
was antieyclonic or complicated.
     To illustrate this, the diagram given on Plate No.                          1   has been pre-

pared.     At the bottom of the diagram are the dates on which the
observations were made, and underneath the date is marked whether
the station was     in a cyclonic or anticyclonic area, A. indicating anti
cyclonic, C.   cyclonic, and ? indicating that it could not be said to be
in either the one or tbe other.            In the diagram is shown the number
of particles observed on each day.               Each observation, given in the
table referred    to   in a previous part of this        paper,   is indicated in
the diagram     by a small circle, the height of the circle above the
base   line indicating       the amount of dust on the date, the scale
being shown on the         right hand       side  of the diagram.      These dust
observations are     all connected by means of a dotted line. It will
be noticed    that in a general way the numbers were least in cyclonic
areas.
    Plate Xo. 2 illustrates       the same thing for the Alford observa
tions.    Here the circulation was anticyclonic for the first four days,
and the    number of particles was high               A cyclone    passed  on the
 9th, and the   number fell to about one-third.             The circulation    was
 doubtful on the 10th and 11th, but on the following                  days  it was
 generally anticyclonic,       but it will      be observed   that the numbers
 were  low during the beginning of this period.             A  curious point was
 the great increase     which took     place    on the 16th      The number in
 the morning    was    11 25, but   it rapidly increased during the day, and
 rose to 5700   in the afternoon.         In connection with this it may be
 interesting to note that on the previous day the centre              of the anti
 cyclone had passed        over this station, and on the 16th lay imme
 diately to the east of it.
    Taking now the Dumfries              observations,    which    are shown on
 Plate   No. 3,    it will    be  noticed that       the relation between      tha
 dust and the barometric distribution            was more marked than in the
 previous   cases.     The    circulation      was  cyclonic  on the following
 dates— October 29th, 30th, 31st, November 1st, 2nd, 5th, 6th, and
 loth,  on all of which dates there was little dust.          On only other two
 days was there      little dust, namely, on the 25th October and 9th
 November.       On    these   days   the number was low and circulation
  anticyclonic.    The    high numbers were all got in anticyclonic             or
 complicated areas.
     Now comes the question,         What interpretation       are we to put on
  these facts?   If the anticyclonic       areas have more dust     in them than

236              Proceedings               of Eoyal Society of Edinburgh,                                 [sess.
the cyclonic, then this at first sight might seem to indicate                                                 that
anticyclonic           air    is more impure than cyclonic;                           that    is,    that air
moving from areas of high pressure, which                               is     generally supposed to
come from the upper strata, has more dust than that near the earth,
which would be equivalent to saying that meteors                                      falling       into our
atmosphere           produce         more dust        in     the upper strata          than     is   thrown
into the lower by all the sources of pollution on the earth's                                         surface
in country districts.
      There    is,   however,            evidently another interpretation of these facts.
One marked difference                     between       a   cyclonic and an anticyclonic                      area
is,   that the isobars in the former are much closer together                                        than in
the latter;          that    is,   the barometric gradient                is   steeper in the cyclonic
areas;    or what this                   indicates      is   that there        is   more     wind        in    the
cyclonic than in the anticyclonic areas.                           That   is   to say, that in cyclonic
areas there           are high           winds and little dust,                while in anticyclonic
areas there          is   little or       no     wind, and the amount of dust                       is   great.
Accepting this explanation of the greater or less amount of dust
in    the two areas,          let us       see    how   it   is   borne out by the observations.
      In order         to investigate this point we may lay off a series                                          of
points        representing the                   distance     between          the    isobars,       on        the
different dates.              The height of this curve would bo inversely pro
portional to the velocity of the wind.                                Instead of using the baro
metric curves, we will use the observations of the velocity of the
wind observed                at the stations.               These observations are entered                        in
the     diagram and connected                         by     a    fine line.        It will    be seen            in
diagram No.           1     that the fall in dust which took place on the 6th
was accompanied                by    a    rise    of wind, and that            the fall of the       wind         on
the 9th was accompanied                          by an increase           in the dust.           The wind
increased      on the 10th, and the dust                      fell; but    on the 12th, 13th, 15th,
and 16th both curves rose and fell together.                                     In diagram No.               2   it
will    be seen that both wind                      and      dust rose and fell together                   from
the 5th to the 9th, but on the                          9th the wind increased                and cleared
away the high dust that had prevailed for some                                       days.       From          the
9th to the 13th the dust increased                                 whenever the wind got                      less,
but on the 16th              a     great       increase      in dust took place with                 a    slight
increase in wind.                   When, however, we come to diagram No.                                 3,   the
relation between                   the    wind      and the dust           is    much more marked.
It will       be observed            that almost every rise of wind                     is    accompanied

by     a  fall in dust, and a fall in wind with an increase of dnsL                       It
seems therefore         that the amount of dust is not so much a question
of cyclonic or anticyclonic           areas, as of wind          velocity.     It will   be
noticed       that the exceptions        in the Dumfries observations on the
25th October and 9th November, when the numbers                            were small and
the    distribution of pressure         anticyclonic, have no existence where
we adopt the          wind explanation.
     Having traced         the connection between            the number of particles
and      the    velocity     of the wind        at low     levels,    the question still
remains,       What is the action of        the wind     1    Two explanations        seem
 possible.        The wind will evidently mix the upper and lower airs,
 and may thus prevent the number being great, either by preventing
 the dust      in the upper atmosphere            from settling into the lower, or
 it may prevent the accumulation of local impurities, from which
 no locality       is entirely free.    The latter of these suggestions              seems
 to be the more         probable, as the atmospheric dust is so excessively
  fine that     it is likely  to take long to settle, and the duration of calms
  does not seem        long enough for it settling from the upper strata.
  There is no doubt that for          all  the dust to settle       out of even     a  few
   feet a very      long time is necessary.          It  must, however, be kept in
  mind, that while           all the dust     takes    long to settle,        the heavier
  particles     will fall quicker, and      these no doubt        in   calm weather    will
  add something         to the impurity of the lower air.              It, however, seems
  probable that the absence of wind               will  act chiefly in allowing       local
  impurities to accumulate and keep near the gTound.                        It  may be as
  well to recall here, that on the            Rigi Kulm, the lowest number of
  dust particles was recorded         in   calm weather ; and that with increa.-*
   of wind        increase    of dust took place, which              increase   continued
   till  the   wind had blown some time, thus indicating the power of
   the wind to make the upper air impure, and the complement                        of this
   will   be  to make the lower air purer.
       That the increase of dust during calm               periods     is principally due
   to the    accumulation of local impurities, seems to be supported by
   the difference,      already pointed out, of the etfect of wind               as shown
    in  the three      diagrams.     At Dumfries          the   relation     between    the
    amount of       dust and wind velocity is constant all through, while at
    Kingairloch      and Alford there were marked exceptions                 to it.   Now,
    Dumfries is a much more polluted district than the others, and it is

polluted in all directions, whereas the other stations are not polluted
equally in all directions.              It   seems, therefore,         to be on this       accumu
lated local impurity that the wind acts.
     Another point which is shown in the diagrams Nos. 1, 2, and 3,
is the influence of the direction of the wind on the amount                                of dust
At      the foot of these diagrams            are entered arrows showing the                 direc
tion of the wind at the dates.                 The lower arrow shows the direction
of wind       as    observed       at the station.         The upper one is from the
weather charts            issued    by the Meteorological Office.                 These upper
arrows     will probably       represent      the general air circulation,              while the
lower ones          will frequently      be purely local.               It will   be observed
that when the wind came from populous parts of the country, the
numbers were              generally large.         Taking        the   Kingairloch observa
tions, — all the country from the south to the east is thickly popu
lated, but in all other directions there are but few habitations.                              On
the 9th, with        a    light wind from the south, the number was great                           ;
whereas,     with     a   light wind from the east or north, the number was
less.     The high numbers were all with southerly winds.                           At Alford,
the most densely           populated direction is from east to nearly south,
and it will be observed that it was with winds from these directions
that the greatest amount of dust was observed.                            The low numbers
observed     at this station, when the wind w;is slight from the 11th to
the 14th, was probably due to the air coming from a comparatively
poorly populated district.               This      seems to explain          why        on these
days the number of particles was not great, as is generally the case
when the wind falls.               It will   be noticed that the           wind was south
when the great increase of dust occurred on tho 16th, with increase
of wind.       The effect of the direction of wind is not                    so    apparent in
the Dumfries          observations,      probably owing to this                  station    being
surrounded on all sides by towns                     and villages.          It    is,   however,
interesting to note that the northerly winds which were pure at the
other stations were found to be impure hero.                            The reason       for this
probably      is,   that many towns,          as   well    as    iron and other works, lie
in that direction.

was found      a    great quantity of dust.               This   is    what we should now

expect, as fogs are formed               when the air is still, and we have seen
that when this happens                  the quantity          of dust      increases.      The ex
planation of the          formation of fogs would appear to                    he, —calms      tend
to increase       the   quantity of dust and moisture in the air                        near    the
ground, and as the dust               increases     the radiating power of the air it
soon gets        chilled to the condensing point, when fog forms.                              The
density of the          resulting fog depends in part                on the quantity       of dust
present,     as    town fogs are thicker               as well as blacker          than country
ones.       These remarks         only apply to radiation                 fogs, and not to fogs
resulting from the            mixing of hot and cold air, nor to                    fogs    formed
by reduction           of pressure.      Fogs seem to be much more frequent in
town than         in country air.         This possibly may               be due   in part to the
greater     amount       of dust in the city air increasing its radiating power,
so causing        it to become colder than country air, when there is no
protection         above it.       If    the air was clear and perfectly                   diather-
manous,      then the radiation would be only from bodies on the earth's
surface          The     air would then            be    cooled by these           surfaces,    and
deposit      its vapour on them as dew                   ;   but when there is much dust
in    the air, these      particles acting as radiating surfaces get cooled, and
the vapour         being deposited on them, fog is the result.

      Another question which may be asked                           is,   Is there any relation
between the amount of dust and the temperature of the air?                                       It
has been shown that                  there   is    a    distinct connection between the
amount        of in the air and its transparency. We are, there
                   dust
fore, led to expect that the dust will have some effect on the
temperature, by the alteration    will effect on the diathermancy
                                                  it
of the air. In order to see any information can be gained on this
                                          if
point from these              observations, there are entered in the diagrams,
Plates      I,    II    and   III,    the maximum             and     minimum       temperatures
of the air on the days on which                    the dust observations were takea
 It   is   evident that there are two distinct                     effects   of the dust which
 we must distinguish.                 First, its   effect     on the heat received by the
 earth from the sun           ;   and second, its effect on the heat radiated into
 space      by   the earth.       We may expect the former of                  those effects    will
 be     best seen      in summer, when the sun                is   high, while the latter will
 be best studied          during night temperatures and during winter.

     For investigating whether the amount of dust in the air has any
  influence    on its temperature            while the sun is shining,          the    only
  observations illustrating        the point are those made at            Kingairloch      in
  July  ; the   others     made      in   September,       October, and November,
  when the sun was low, shew no marked effect from its rays.                        When
  we examined the Kingairloch                observations,    we    were struck    by the
  marked relation        shown between            maximum        temperature     and the
 amount of dust.          It will    bo observed      that the curve of maximum
 temperature       shows four maxima, and that the dust curve has also
 four maxima,       and that three of these maxima of dust happen on the
 three days of maximum temperature.                    On the 4th, 9th, and 13th            it
 will be seen both dust and temperature               were above the average.           The
 same thing       though not so marked, may be noticed in the                      Aliord
 observations.       At    the beginning of the observations both dust and
 temperature      were high     ;  both fell towards the end, and just at the
 finish both rose again.
     These considerations point to a connection between                    the amount of
 dust and the temperature          ;   the greater the amount of dust the higher
 was the maximum temperature.                  But what explanation are we to put
 on this?     Is it a case of cause and effect? or are both due to one cause                 ?
 or is it merely      a  coincidence      ?    One would have expected that the
 phenomena      are far too complex for any such effect to show out so
 clearly  as it seems to do     in   these records.      Amongst other influencing
 causes besides dust, there          is the wind.       The force of the wind does
 not seem to assist in explaining               the agreement        between    the dust
 and the temperature curves in these cases              ; the   direction of the wind,
 however,    seems to have        some effect.        For   instance,     the  wiud    was
 somewhat southerly with the high temperatures,                    but southerly winds
at these stations are generally accompanied               with much dust, while the
northerly ones have        a lower temperature,        and   little  dust.    This, how
ever, does not dispose of the whole question, as the greater                       or  less
dust iu the different winds may be in part the cause of the difference
in their  temperature.        We   do not find any influence of the dust on the
maximum temperature            in the Dumfries observations; when the                  sun
is low, the direction of the wind seems to be the principal influencing
cause.     Most of the high temperatures                occurred with southerly          to
westerly winds.

temperature          apart from its effect as a vapour, as a high humidity
will    increase     the effect of the dust by increasing the size of the
particles,        while a low humidity will decrease                        the influence.      The
records of observation                are as yet too fragmentary                    to warrant the
drawing of any general conclusions on this subject.
     Before the      relation between the dust and the temperature can                           be
settled with         any degree of certainty, far                    more        data are required.
We would require to have, along with the dust tests, records of the
strength of the           sunshine taken by        a more accurate                method than the
ordinary      black-bulb vacuum thermometer                      ;   and also records of the
hours of sunshine, the direction and velocity of the wind, not made
at long intervals          but continuously.
     We shall now turn to the diagrams, and see                             if    the earth's radia
tion at night is influenced              by the amount of dust in the air, but
oar information           is too   meagre for a correct interpretation                 of the varia
tions in temperature.               The fall of temperature at night being due
to     the   earth's      radiation,     before we        can compare               the cooling on
different nights,          continuous records of the amount of cloud in the
«ky are required, as well as the direction                   and velocity of the wind.
As     no records       were kept of the clouds at night, and only imperfect
ones     of the wind, any conclusion we may draw from these curves
will    be   of little value.          The Dumfries observations will                      be most
suitable for        studying the night radiations,           as they were taken during
the long      nights of winter.           At first sight there              does not seem to be
any relation between the amount of dust and the cooling taking place
at night          The     reason for this    is,   that there are other influences at
work besides dust, aDd one of these                 is    the velocity of the              wind — a
high velocity preventing               an accumulation       of cold air            near the earth's
surface      by mixing the cooled air with the warmer upper air.                               The
Dumfries observations show that on     all nights when there was wind
the fall in temperature was slight, and that great falls only took place
in calm weather.     To get the effect of dust we must therefore com
pare    only nights on which there was no wind or only slight airs.                              In
order to assist         our inquiry, there         is   placed       in the diagram of the

 taken       by   means    of   a minimum      thermometer placed on the grass.

of the earth's             radiation on the                   different       nights.        As       the        air    is
partly       cooled        by its passage                over surfaces           cooled       by radiation,
we might expect                  the    fall of     temperature               from the previous day's
maximum          would            be    proportional               to   the   difference          between          the
minimum temperature                     and the minimum temperature                               on the grass.
This, however, will only be the                                case      when all other things are
equal, such as amount and duration of cloud, diathermancy of                                                 upper
air, radiating power of lower air, and velocity of wind.
       Selecting the nights on which there was little wind, let us see                                                  if
we can trace          any effect duo to dust.                            On the 30th October there
was very       little      dust, and        it will       be noticed there was a great                       fall in
the temperature             on the following night, though the wind does not
seem to have fallen very low.                            On this date the air was the purest
observed       at this station, and on the following                               night the radiation
was the greatest                 observed.          The fall in temperature                        of the          air,
though considerable,                   was not the greatest recorded                    ;    but we are not
entitled to expect it would be,                          as   the fall in temperature                 of the air
depends       on the duration as well as on the intensity of the radiation.
No very satisfactory conclusion                                can       be   drawn         from the other
observations,         as on the occasions                     when the amount of dust was low
there       seems     to    have        generally been                  some wind,          and    this would
check the       fall of     the thermometer on the grass.                             Further          the       dust
observations were                 not taken              at    sufficiently      short        intervals            for
ascertaining whether the air at night had the same amount of dust
as     ou the previous evening, or on the                               following morning.                  It    may
be as well to notice here, that on the 12th November                                              there was            a
fair amount of dust, and yet the temperature                                     fell considerably at
night.        The reason for this would seem to be, that though there
was a good          deal         of dust,     it    was        probably confined to the lower
stratum of air,             so    that while the lower air was                          a     good      radiator
from the amount of dust in                         it,   it   was unprotected above                    by    dusty
air.       The reason for stating this                        is   that on the following               morning,
mo     1   3th, when the amount of dust was great, there was                                      a   dense fog,
but this fog was only low down, while immediately overhead                                                        the
sky looked clear.

                                                    will be noticed that the amount
   of dust       was small, and the night

   while the small        amount of dust continued.            But on     the 16th, the

                                                                              dust took

                                                   minimum temperature, which,
  instead of falling to a lower
                                          point, was the following night higher
  by    nearly     12°.    We      must not, however, conclude that
                                                                                   these

  be  noticed that the wind was
                                               occasionally northerly while the
 low night temperatures
                                  lasted,  and that on the 15th the direction
  changed to      southerly.
     In   the previous     remarks there is something like a
                                                                         contradiction,
            it may be as well to explain here.
 which
                                                         It is stated that the wind
 decreases      the amount of dust, and also that it
                                                               raises the minimum
 temperature.          It is further stated that a decrease in dust is accom
 panied by        a   low minimum temperature.              This apparent contra
  diction disappears        when we consider that it is only when the
                                                                                   wind

  a low
           temperature,
     Yfe might      sum up the results thus         : — 1st, During the summer
 there was
                generally a high maximum           temperature when there was
 a maximum
                   of dust    in the air.     2nd, There was a tendency to a
 low   temperature at night when there was little
                                                                   dust in the air.
 3rd,   During the time of the Dumfries observations
                                                                      the mean     tem
perature was        high, and the amount of dust great.
    Stated in another
                               way, it amounts to this, that dust increases
the day
              temperature and checks the fall at
                                                            night, thus increasing
the mean
                temperature.       If this be so, then it looks as if the dust
absorbs the sun's         heat during the day, but does not
                                                                           radiate the
earth's heat at      night.     We might expect that the condition of air
that got
               highly heated by the sun's rays would be
                                                                      greatly cooled
at night
              by radiation.      It will   be as well,     however,     to remember
that at present
                       we  are  in great ignorance      as to the      diathermancy

passage of heat          through it          ;   whereas,         at night, an opposite                  action
takes place.          The chilling tends to deposit moisture on dust, and
so impede        terrestrial radiation.
     In connection with this                 subject,        there        is a point that has              been
observed     for some years, with regard to the earth's radiation, which,
as is bears      on our subject, we               ma}'       refer    to here.          For      some     years
I   have taken the usual meteorological observations, and along                                            with
these there has been kept a record of the earth's radiation at                                           night.
When taking           the readings          in    the evening,            it    has been        noticed that
on the evenings              when there            were      no      clouds,       that     the       radiation
effect was strongest           just about          sunset.           If    it    was observed           shortly
afterwards, the radiation                was almost always weaker,                           even       though
the     sky kept clear.               This would              seem to indicate               that the          air
is more      diathermanous to terrestrial radiation just about                                           sunset
than it is    later.         The explanation which                    I    would now offer of this
is,   that at sunset the air            is       more diathermanous than                    it   is   later, on
account of the dust in the air holding little moisture.                                           After       the
sun has been set for some time the air chills, and the dust particles
increase in size by the vapour deposited                             on them        ;   and this increase
in    size tends       to check        the        free passage            of the earth's heat into
space.      It   is   evident we cannot here attribute the decreased diather
mancy,     with       the advance       of the evening, to the action of the water
in its    gaseous form, as there                  is   at that time no sudden increase                         in
its amount in the air.                 It    would rather appear to be due to change
which then takes place in the condition of the moisture from vapour
to liquid.       I     have said        the air         is   more diathermanous                   just    about
sunset     than    it   is   later.     Probably          it    is   more diathermanous to the
earth's    variations during the day than                         it   is       at sunset   ;   but observa
tions on this point are difficult                      to make, owing to the complications
introduced by the sun's heat radiated and reflected                                             by our    atmo
sphere.
      At first sight,     we might          think that          the truth or falsehood of                  these
conclusions might be easily determined.                                    If    dust increased the           (Jay
 temperature          and decreased the fall at night, then ;he mean                                   tempera
 ture will bo increased by                  a    large amount of dust.                      Can   it   then     be
proved from general meteorology                         that this         is   the easel        Do    inhabited
 countries have         a    higher mean temperature than uninhabited                                      ones,

risen since coal has come            into such extensive             use ; or is the tempera
ture of a placehigher when the wind brings dust-laden air to it
from a populous district than when it brings pure air ; or has the
temperature in the populous parts of New Zealand or Australia
increased with the increase             of population           1    Unfortunately this is           a
case where,      while   a positive      reply might support the conclusion,                         a
negative        one does     not weaken           it,   because      the dust from human
habitations       keeps near the ground, and                    if   there    is   no protection
above     it,   its effect   will probably              be, not     to keep up the night
temperature,         but rather to lower                it,   on account of the increased
radiating power        of the atmosphere            caused by the dust.
  There     is   still another      reason why we must move here                    with caution.
Should the       possibility       here shadowed forth*become                 a   reality, then we
should find       entering the arena of one of the most highly contested
                 it
fields   of scientific speculation — we should find   claiming to be the it
great    regulator of the earth's climate in bygone ages.                              Meteorolo
    would be disputing with astronomers, and claiming for their
gists
domain the cause of the great changes which geologists tell us have
taken place       in the earth's climate from time                   to time.        They would
 no longer      ask the astronomer           if   he could       tilt the earth's axis          so as
to bring first one part and then another under the influence of the
inn's rays.   All the meteorologist would have to do would be in
imagination to steer the solar system into    part of space where    a
 meteoric       matter was         absent.    Were cosmic dust absent from the
earth's    atmosphere, the earth's heat would have   freer passage into   a
 space,   and   glacial climate would be the result.
                 a                                     To change this,
it   would only be necessary           that the system passed to where meteoric
 matter     was      abundant,       when the earth's atmosphere,  now full of
 cosmic     dust, would        conserve the sun's rays and its own heat, and
 thus cause the glacial conditions                to disappear.
     Such are some           of the problems             suggested       by this investigation,
 none     of which are worked           out, and some only suggested.                      It   is   of
 course possible,perhaps probable, that many of the conclusions here
 set forth may be quite wrong.    The whole phenomena are too con-
 plex to be solved so easily, and   will require continued records of
                                                  it
 all the meteorological phenomena, extending over long periods, and
 under many different               conditions, before many of these conclusions
 can be     satisfactorily established.

                                              Conclusions.
      The    following          are some         of the conclusions arrived at                in this
paper       :—
      1st, The earth's            atmosphere         is greatly polluted with dust                pro
duced by human agency.
      2nd,   This dust           is carried      to considerable      elevations        by the        hot
air rising over cities,                 by the hot and moist air rising from          sun
heated       areas of           the    earth's     surface,   and    by winds driving the
dusty air up the slopes of hills.
      3rd, The transparency                of the air depends on the number of dust
particles in         it,   and also on its humidity.             The less the dust the more
transparent          is    the air, and the dryer the air the more transparent                          it
is.     There        is    no evidence        that humidity         alone   — that      is,   water    in
its gaseous condition, and apart from dust— has any effect on the
transparency.
      4th,   The      dust particles             in the    atmosphere        have    vapour       con
densed on them though                    the air itself may not be saturated.
      5th, The amount of vapour condensed                        on the dust in unsaturated
air depends on the                " relative
                                             humidity," and            also on the
                                                                                          " absolute
                 "
humidity             of     the air.       The higher the humidity                and    the higher
the vapour tension,                   the greater     is   the amount       of moisture held by
the dust particles when the air                     is   not saturated.
      6th, Haze           is   generally produced          by dust, and      if   the air be dry,
the vapour has but                little   effect, and the density of the haze depends
chiefly on the number of particles present.
      7th, None of the tests made of the Mediterranean sea air show
it    to be very free from dust.
      8th, The amount of dust in the atmosphere                             of pure country dis
tricts varies with the velocity and the direction of the wind.                                    Fall
 of wind being accompanied                       by an increase in dust.          Winds blowing
from populous districts generally bring dusty air.
      9th, The        observations are still too                 few to afford           satisfactory
 evidence        of the relation between the amount of dust in the atmo
sphere and climate.

                                                  APPENDIX.
      Being desirous            of getting more observations on the                                    effect    of
humidity when the temperature is low,                                  in order to check the con
clusion come to              in the           paper,    I made     a   visit to the west of Scotland
in the end of             January             last, in the hope of finding                     the conditions
suitable for the purpose.                         Garelochead was selected for these obser
vations.            This situation is fairly                    free   from local pollution so long
as the     wind is not south, south-east,                         or east.        In    all other directions
it   is   fairly free from contamination.
     The observations were generally made                                on the hills above Gare
lochead        ;    the site    for   each day being always selected                               to the wind
ward of the houses.                           Unfortunately, the weather                     was    not suitable
for the special              purpose intended, as during most of the time the
temperature was                 high           and the weather extremely                           stormy.      As,
however, the observations                          were    taken in exceptional weather, and
the results           show peculiarities,                 they may be thought                       of sufficient
interest       to be recorded here.
      The observations were begun on the 23rd of the month.                                                On this
day the        number of particles was 2360 per c.c., and the temperature
34°;      hut unfortunately                   the wet-bulb depression is doubtful, owing to
the temperature               of the wet-bulb being below the freezing point                                    The
wet-bolb           fell to 32', where it remained steady.                              As the temperature
was       falling fast,         the conditions              would       be all         changed before the
water on the wet-bulb was                              all frozen, and it was therefore                     useless
to    wait to         see     how far it would                   fall below        32°.        Fortunately,        I
had a hygroscope                exposed at the same time, and it showed                                a   reading
corresponding               to a wet-bulb depression of                   fully        3°.
     This is the only observation obtained at this situation                                               suitable
for illustrating              the influence of temperature                         on the effect of the
humidity,            and it      confirms the conclusion                         previously          arrived     at.
We have shown                    that when there was                     a       wet-bulb          depression of
about       4°,     and   a    little over 1000 particles per c.c, that the air                                 was
thick     if       the temperature               was 60° or more             ;   clear or medium              if   it
was about 50°; and,                 in the        case here recorded, the air was clear,                       with
nearly double the number of particles, and the air not quite                                               so dry,
but at      a       temperature of               34°       It    seems       probable from             this     that
observations              made on Ben Nevis and                         in cold climates generally

     In making out                 the table given with                   this paper, the humiditj
miglit have been shown in other ways.                                     For    instance,         in place        o:
entering the              wet-bulb           depression,          the    relative humidity                 or thi
dew-point of the air might have                                  been     given.        It     was, however,
thought better to enter the wet-bulb observations themselves,                                                 since
either of the                others      can     be      easily calculated              from       them.          At
ordinary temperatures                    the relative humidity and the dew-point are
approximately proportional to the depression                                     of the wet-bulb,                 the
dew-point being nearly twice                          as     much        as    the wet-bulb below the
temperature           of the air.         But for low             temperatures         the proportions do
not agree so well.                  For      instance,      the dew-point at the temperature
of 60° is        1   -88 times        the wet-bulb depression                   below the temperature
of the air; at 50° it is 2-06 times                          ;   while    if   the temperature              is 34*,
it is 277        times.           So that for low temperatures                     part of the clearness
is due not only to the lower vapour pressure, but also because, for a
given wet-bulb depression,                      the dew-point is really farther below the
temperature            of    the air with a low than with                          a    high temperature.
For      instance,        taking the above examples with a wet-bulb depression
of     4°, the       dew-point at         G0° is 7°-5        below the temperature                    of tho air,
at 50°     it   is 8°     -2,   while at 34°      it   is    fully 11°;        and when the tempera
tures      are       still lower         the difference            increases       rapidly.         The result
is   that, when there               is   a    small difference           between            the wet and dry
bulbs while the temperature                           is   very low, the dew-point
                                                                                                       is
                                                                                                       a         con
siderable        distance         below the temperature                   of the air.           For    instance,
at   a   temperature             of 20° and        a   wet-bulb depression                     of ouly      1°, the
dew-point            is   fully     8° below the                 temperature        of the air.             If    the
temperature            had been 53°, in order that the dew-point might be as
many degrees                 below the           temperature             of the         air,    the     wet-bulb
depression            would require to be              4°.
     We must              therefore       only use the wet-bulb depression                              for      com
parison when the temperature                           is    over       50°, below that temperature
allowance            must be made.              In    the future, perhaps, either the depres
 sion     of the dew-point or the relative humidity would be                                            a     better
figure to use           in      these tables.
       Returning now to the table in the appendix,                                     it   will   be observed
 that on the 24th that there were 725 particles per c.c. and                                           a   depres

sion of only       2!-5,   and the air       was   clear.     The tests on this day
also confirm oar       conclusion regarding         the less effect of the humidity
when the       temperature       is low, but the numbers are not extreme
enough to show         it in  a marked degree.
     The observations       made on the 25th are interesting,              as they were
taken in     exceptional conditions, and gave exceptional results.                    This
day     will long be remembered as one of the stormiest                       of a very
stormy     January.        From    the table it    will  be seen that at no time in
tie day was the         number of      particles   over    1000 per c.c, and        it will
be also     noticed    that the air     was dry, giving        a wet-bulb depression
of   felly 5'; and yet, contrary to all previous experience,                 the air was
thick,     the  hills at little over        three   miles being invisible.           As  to
 the    cause  of this thickness with few particles and dry air, it is at
 present     difficult    to   say    anything      definite.     It,   however,     seems
 possible that the size and the nature               of the particles may have had
  wmething to do         with it.     The gale would enable the air to hold in
  suspension     large particles of dust, and the atmosphere                  would also
  contain salt       spray.     It   was noticed that         the    air had   a   peculiar
  glistening appearance,         quite unlike the usual look of thick air.              On
   the   evening    of this day   the air became much clearer, due possibly to
   tiere being     fewer salt particles, as the wind had veered, and the air
  hid to travel a greater distance            over land before        reaching the place
  oi observation.         Part of   the greater      clearness was doubtless         due to
  the    increased dryness which took place in the afternoon.
       On the 27th the wind was again                high, blowing strong from the
   north-west.        The number of particles          had fallen to 250 per c.c, and
   the air   had become much clearer.
       The 28th is principally          remarkable for being the day on which
   was recorded        the smallest     number of particles yet observed.               The
    storms had      now passed, and the wind fallen to             a gentle  air from duo
    north.     These tests were made             on the     hill-side   to the north       of
    Whiatlefield.        On this    occasion there was great difficulty          in getting
    dear of artificial pollution, the great purity of the air enabling the
     existence    of a house      at a distance of half             a mile   to   be easily
     detected.      The site selected for the observations had to be changed
     a number of times before one was             found free from local impurities,
      from the instrument revealing the               existence     of dwellings hidden
      away at   a   distance among the hills.

           The air on this day being very pure, all the tests made are                           i
       in the table, and not averaged,            as   is frequently the        case     on th
       days.    Of   course, each of the tests             given is      as usual      an ave
       ten readings.       The lowest test gave 86 per c.c, being the n
       for the purest air yet observed by me.
           When this small number was obtained the barometric distril
       was very complicated.             While the tests were being made the cj
       of the previous days had passed away to the north-east, at.
       anti-cyclone had appeared on the west coast of Scotland.                                 Tt
       tested seems to have been true anti-cyclonic air, which was                           but
       contaminated      by local pollution.

Larix euxopaea as a Breeding-Place for Hylesinus pini
             perda.          By William Somerville, D.CEc, B.Sc.
                                      (Read    July 7, 1890.)
    The special point that             I  wish to bring before the Society relates
to    a case     of the common larch being                  made   use of by Hylesimus
piniperda for purposes of oviposition.                       As  occasion   demands,    this
insect has been found to utilise as a breeding-place                      every species of
Pinus, but, so far in Europe or North America, no case has been noted
of    anv trees belonging to the genus Larix having been similarly
attacked.           In Asia   an observer,       namely,     Hiddendorff,    has recorded
one case      which       came under his notice in the district of the Boganida,
 in Siberia,       in  71° north latitude         (Sibirixche Reisen, Band iv. Theil
 L p.   603).
     In the beginning of April of this                  year,   in the Upper Ward of
  Lanarkshire, on a south-west              slope, at an elevation      of some 800 feet,
  I  found that several           larches, which        had    been   felled during     last
  winter, were attacked by large numbers of this insect.                       In its  com-
  panv   I  also found Hylastes palliatus, but by far the greater number
  of galleries were the work of Hylesinus piniperda.                     During   the past
  three   months        these trees have been           kept under close observation,
  with    the    result    that   I  find one or two particulars in which tho
  attack of this insect on the larch differs from its mode of attacking
  the Scots pine.
      The greater       abundance      of fluid resinous matter in the larch,             as
  compared      with     the Scots pine, seems to have considerably interfered
  with the work of forming galleries.                    I  noticed that all the trees
  lying in the wood were not attacked, but only those at one side,
  where they were within             the shade       cast by a dense wood        of pines
  situated to the south.          This,    I  believe,    to be due to the fact that
  the   cambial       activity   and     formation      of resinous       solutions were
  retarded in these trees owing to their not being directly reached                     by
  the   sun's    rays; whereas the cambium and cortex of those trees                  fully
   exposed to the sun were so saturated              with resin     as to   be safe from
   attack       Even in some of the trees attacked                 I  found   unfinished
   galleries quite     full of  resinous      secretions,    and containing the dead
   bodies    of   the male and female insects, which had doubtless been
   drowned or suffocated by the resinous               exudations.

 256              Proceedings of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                                            [ssss.
    Another peculiarity in the galleries made by the parent insect                                          in
the larch, is that           in    a large    number which        I   have    examined              I have
only on one occasion found an air-hole. This                      is somewhat remarkable,
because, when the galleries are made                         in the natural food-plant                      of
the insect, at least              one air-hole is present in each, and, as a general
rule, they contain two or three.                   I   am somewhat          at a loss to account
for this, because, half-smothered by resin as the insects are in their
galleries,     the admission of air would appear                      to be a most desirable
consideration.          It   is probable that here             also the great amount of
resin    in   the cortex      of    the larch interferes with the normal formation
of the galleries.
    As   to the cause of             //. piniperda attacking            the larch,            I    believe
a   satisfactory reason             can     bo   given.       About     ten       years           ago     the
southern counties            of Scotland were visited by                 a succession               of    ex
ceptionally severe gales, which                   overturned enormous                numbers of
pines and other trees.                 Partly owing          to the glutted state of the
market,       and partly           to the difficulty        experienced       in dealing with
such     a large      amount of fallen timber, the woods                      were allowed to
remain undisturbed in their devastated                         condition for        a    number of
years.        These    dead        and dying       trees     furnished       an    exceptionally
favourable breeding-place for H. piniperda,                             which       consequently
increased at a prodigious rate, each average-sized                        pine being capable
of producing, it is said,              as    many      as   80,000 insects.          "Within the
past year       or two the last             of this fallen timber        has been removed,
with the result that the huge army of forest insects, by which the
country is overrun,               cannot be accommodated                with      the         breeding-
places    which       they prefer, and            have      therefore    been compelled                   to
oviposit on        what       they must          consider most          unsuitable material
Thus, owing to stress of circumstances,                         H. piniperda              has           been
driven to attack the larch, and in this country                         I    have       also       found
Scots pines, not exceeding eight years of age,                    infested by           it,   although
hitherto trees of        a    less age       than fifteen years          have      seldom           been
known to be attacked.

"disease germs."           He says: — "We might hope to find that the
action and growth of the bacilli [of phthisis] might be inhibited by
certain    substances, and then, by inject in//          these  substances    into the

     In Part   II.  of this   paper    {Proc. Roy. Soc.      Edin., vol. xv.    p. 34),
 the following       words will       be  found : — " The principle of            these
 researches    is to find     some germicidal agent          capable   of destroying
  the microbes     of  disease, which have        been proved to reside         in   the
 blood,    and are    the causes (directly       or indirectly)     of   certain con
 tagious diseases.       At  the same time, an aqueous          solution of such an
 agent,    while destroying       the microbes      of disease, must have very
 little   or  no detrimental action          upon the blood.          Having found
 such    a substance,     the   rationale is     to  inject    (hypodermically)        a
 solution of the microbe-destroyer            directly    into the blood.        By   so
 doing, the destruction of the pathogenic organisms                in situ would      be
 the result"
      Having once more alluded to the rationale of the proposed method
 of treating those contagious          diseases whose microbes         reside  in   the

soluble in water, alcohol, ether, and chloroform.                      It  crystallises
from water in microscopic needles belonging to the prismatic system.
These      crystals are extremely deliquescent.              The alkaloid forms         a
platino-chloride having the composition (C10H1TN, HC1)., PtCl4.                       It

     I  have   already   shown (Inc. cit.) the action of disinfectants on               a
number of organisms, but          a much more efficient germicide has recently
been reported       on by Bouchard.
     Bouchard (Compter         Rendus,    vol.   105,    p. 702)    found that 0-33
gram, of /8-naphthol in 1000 c.c.            of various cultivating        media   pre
vented the development of several              species    of " bacteria," including
those of —

more than        250 grammes, and it is only slightly           more ]ioisonous when

    The.se results          have     heen   confirmed    by Dr      J.   Maximovitch
(Compies Rendus, vol. 106, p. 1441).                We   may, accordingly, conclude
from the above investigations                that  /3-naphthol is a true germicide,
and is capable (to a certain extent)             of being injected into the system
 \rithcnd    toxic    effects.
     We have thus          at our command       several reagents which have been
 proved to destroy the microbes of some of the worst forms of disease
 which afflict man and animals.                 We may then, perhaps, look for
 ward to physicians             putting into practice     the  ideas given in these
 papers     of destroying       the disease germ     by the injection     of  a   germi
 cidal agent.
     At this point,       we consider    the action of certain       reagents    on the
  growth and development of various microbes.
                                (a) Bacillus tuberculosis.
      I  have   found (for a second time) that solutions of salicylic acid
  (natural), potassium iodate, and sodium fluosilicate (in the propor
  tions already mentioned in this paper) destroy Bacillus tuberctdosis.
      It  is impossible       to inoculate tubes      containing    sterilised    blood
  serum plus 3 per cent, of salicylic acid with Bacillus tuberculosis              from
  a pure    cultivation     or from sputum (from the worst form of phthisis).
  This clearly shows the germicidal nature of the reagent.                      I  have
  performed      the same experiments         with Bacterium allii, Bacillus        sub-
  tilis, Bacillus    cedematis maligni, and Deneke's          Spirillum,   and found
  that their growth was inhibited in           a  precisely similar way.
                           (b) Bacteria    of Infantile  Faxes.
      On April 13, 1888, Dr Baginski             read a paper, before       the Berlin
  Physiological Society, on the cultivation of Bacterium laHis (obtained
 from infantile fseces) in a sterilised solution of pure milk-siiL;ar.
      After fermentation,         no lactic acid but acetic acid was found as
  the result of the life-work of the micro-organism in this particular
  medium.        The microbe in this medium is both aerobic and ainerobic,
  and     always   produces acetic      acid.    The   gaseous    products of the
  fermentation      are carbonic    acid gas, hydrogen and marsh gas.
       Baginski    says   that when the microbe is cultivated            in gelatino,

acetic    acid proves               a germicide.            Therefore the product of its                    own
life-history plays the part of                   a   powerful toxic agent on the further
life of the bacterium.
     From Bagiuski's researches                      may we not draw the inference                           that
in certain contagious                   diseases

is due to products formed by the microbes,                                   which act detrimentally
upon any further growth and development.

1886, Pasteur stated that                   "a   largo          number of microbes                apparently
give rise, in the media where they grow, to substances                                          which       have

(Copenhagen meeting),                    held on August 11, 1884, M. Pasteur                               stated
that "    the process            for isolating the microbe                    is    still    imperfect,      and
the difficulties           of its cultivation                   outside the          bodies      of animals
have not yet been got rid of, even by the use, as pabulum, of fresh
nervous matter."                 Then, again, in            a    paper      read before         L'Academie
des Sciences          on February            25, 1884, Pasteur stated                        that in micro
scopical      sections         of   a   rabid medulla there                   are     numerous minute

     From the researches                  of Pasteur, we note that the microbe                                  of
rabies has   very different life-history from other micro-organisms.

    From    the.se details,    it appears that the medium in which the un
discovered microbe          of rabies resides is essentially          nervous      matter,
and     not in the blood          system.     Hence       the hypodermic        injection
method is useless as         a means     for preventing or curing this terrible

    In continuation of        the experiments         recorded in Part      II.   of this
 paper,   I  have found that the vitality of certain micro-organisms                    is
 considerable.
    Portions of     a pure   cultivation of Micrococcus           chlorinus (growing
 on white of egg) were mixed with                 calcium     sulphate    and calcium
 carbonate     (the mineral     ingredients      were previously sterilised          at a
 temperature of 135° C.) and placed             in  a  number of sterilised        tubes,
 which were then hermetically         sealed.     Twelve of these tubes each con
 tained from 8 to      10 grammes of the      mixture.       Twelve sterilised tubes,
 not hermetically sealed (see Part        II. of this paper), also contained the
 same    quantity of the mixture.         The twenty-four tubes were kept at
 a dry heat     of  32° C.  from one to eight months.              Two hermetically
 sealed   tubes and two of the         "         " tubes were
                                                                    opened after an
                                          open
 exposure    at 32° C. for one month.          Four     tubes containing sterilised
  nutrient beef-broth were inoculated          from the contents        of the tubes.
  In   the two inoculated      from the "open" tubes, growths of Micro
  coccus chlorinus (proved by staining,        microscopical      and macroscopical
  appearances)     made their appearance           after    nine  days'   incubation.
  Growths of Micrococcus chlorinus also made their appearance in the

two tubes (inoculated from the contents of the sealed tubes) after
thirteen days' incubation.                Four more tubes were opened after an
exposure for two months at 32° C. (dry heat).                              Inoculations         from
                  "
two "     open       tubes     revealed        the     vitality of this microbe                 after
sixteen      days'   incubation ; — and inoculations from                      the     two     sealed
tubes proved the vitality of the micrococci                       after   the lapse     of twenty-
one days'       incubation.        The remaining tubes                   were examined           in    a
similar manner after the lapse of three, four, six, and eight months
respectively.
    After     an exposure        at 32° C. (dry          heat)     for three,      four, and six
months,       the   vitality of Micrococcus chlorinus                     was not        destroyed.
And finally,        after   being dried up for eight months,                     the vitality of
this microbe was completely destroyed                       ;  for no growths made their
appearance        in sterilised nutrient             beef-broth kept at           a   temperature
between 32° and           3GQ   C. for nearly three months.
    A similar      series of experiments             were performed          with other micro
 organisms      (the final inoculations being made                      in different        media     so

    From these experiments,                it will    be seen that various microbes are
 capable of being dried up in the dust of the atmosphere                                for   several
 months without losing their vitality.
     M. Duelaux (Complex Rendus,                    vol. 100, pp. 119 and 186) proved
 that the germs          of certain species of Tyrothrix,                 especially Tyrothrix

264            Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                     [sess.
    It  appears that certain microbes         are able to withstand the severity
of a low temperature,         although their vitalities       ([proved by a longer
period of incubation) are impaired.
    It has been stated that Bacillus anthracis retains its vitality after
being exposed to       a temperature       of  - 110°   C.
      V. Electrical Experiments on Certain Micro-organisms.
    The    following     results     concerning     the    action     of the    electric
current      on   the     vitality     of   certain     micro-organisms        form      a
continuation      of those      recorded     in Part    II.   of this     paper.     The
experiments were performed              upon pure cultivations of three micro
organisms.
     (1) Bacillus   tuberculosis      growing     in previously sterilised          fluid
blood-serum      was   killed by     an  E.M.F. of 2T6       volts.
     (2) Bacterium      allii growing in previously sterilised              pork-broth
(neutral) was     killed by an E.M.F. of 33 volts.
     (3) Bacillus   subtilis growing in previously sterilised pork-broth
 (neutral) was    killed by     an   E.M.F. of    2 '72 volts.
     The temperature of the laboratory was 17°              G,   and the current was
 allowed to pass for ten minutes in each             case.
     The " electrified    "
                            micro-organisms were then "transplanted"                    to
 a certain    number of tubes containing the above cultivating                   media.
 After    an incubation, at 35°          G, for twenty      days, no growths made
 their appearance in any of the tubes.
      The above experiments show that the electric                  current proves        a
 powerful germicide.
              VI. The Micro-organisms of the Atmosphere.
      The method used in these experiments             for determining the number
  of "colonies" (of micro-organisms) in               a known volume of air,          was
  that    devised     by    Hesse      (Mittlieilungen      am     dem     Kaiaerlictten
  Gesundheifsamte,      1883, bd. ii.).
      After August      6, 1888,      a  similar method        to the    one described
  by Dr P. F. Frankland            in Nature (vol. xxxviii.         p. 235), was used
  in the experiments.

    the following         :—

266          Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                        [sess.
   (1) That     there   are a larger number of micro-organisms                    in   the
summer    than either in the spring or winter.             They appear to reach
their maximum number during the month of August.
   (2) The number of micro-organisms found in the atmosphere
decreases the higher one ascends.           Hence near the Lincoln Cathedral
there are fewer      micro-organisms in the atmosphere                (on any given
day) than in the valley of the         Witham (Table (a)).             The same re
mark also applies to the number of micro-organisms                      found in the
atmosphere     on the top of the Trocadero Palace, Paris, where there
are fewer than      in  a  low-lying, but crowded,        thoroughfare like the
Boulevard St Germain.
   (3) There are      a  larger number of micro-organisms              in    the    atmo
sphere of crowded centres          than in less densely populated centres                  ;
hence more     in cities than in     the country.
   (4) The number of micro-organisms                are fewer when the air is
" at rest
          "
             than at any other time.          For instance, there were fewer
micro-organisms in         the  atmosphere        of tranquil     places,      like    the
cemeteries of Pere la Chaise, Montparnasse, and Montmartre, than in
busy streets like the Rue de Bennes, Boulevard Voltaire, &c.
   During    my researches,        attempts     have     been     made      to    isolate
pathogenic    microbes      from the atmosphere,        but up to        the present
without success.
  VII. Hytodermic Injections              ok Salicylic Acid for Phthisis.
   R. Wood, M.D.,        L.R.C.P. (mentioned in Part II. of this                  paper)
reports that he has cured a girl of phthisis by injecting a saturated
solution of salicylic acid into her system.            He  sa}'s,  in  a  letter dated
September     2,   1888: — "   I  have been injecting salicylic         acid     twice   a
week on a   girl fur    one year,  and   she is now better."
   l)r Wood       is injecting    salicylic acid into the blood of another
phthisical   patient.      On September        4,   1888,  he sent me a bottle
labelled — "Sputum of a girl, Webb, phthisical night sweats, age 14.
Has spit blood.       I  am injecting a saturated solution of salicylic acid
daily. — R. Wood."
   I found iu the sputum        a considerable      number of tubercle-bacilli.
   There is little doubt that salicylic acid (natural) is                 a powerful
germicidal agent.
   In Part II. of this      paper   I  gave   the details of certain injection

          "                  "
  of a      lung disease        of thirteen years' standing, which became dis
  tinctly tubercular several years ago.
      Although       Mr Snodgrass       was  greatly relieved, and his life pro
  longed,      by   the   injection methods (Proc. Roy.        Soc.  Edin., vol. xv.
  p. 53),     yet there was hardly any hope of a permanent cure                   in his
  ease.      He suffered from        a  complication  of   diseases,   which caused
  him to discontinue          the injections of salicylic    acid (Part     II., p. 62).
  The disease proved fatal on           May  24, 1888.

   no effect    in curing phthisis.       During its passage throngh the system
   salicylic acid becomes        altered.
      It  combines      with glycocine forming salicyluric       acid, thus —

                                                                              of disease
                                                                 germs
   in the blood      (i.e., where they reside).
       Since   the reading of my last paper on this subject, before the
   Royal     Society    of Edinburgh,     I have injected into my own system
   two other substances
                                (besides salicylic acid), without any ill effects.
   One of these was 20          minims of a O'-t per cent, solution of sodium
   fluosilieate.      We have already      seen that this   substance is a power
   ful germicidal agent,        capable of destroying Bacillus tuberculosis.
      The other substance injected          was 20 minims of an         1 '0 per cent,
   solution    of sodium salicylate.
       Sodium salicylate is far more soluble        in water than salicylic acid,
   hut   it is not   a  germicidal agent.
       ScKlium    compounds (as a general rule), with non-poisonous acid
   radicles,    have little or no action on the blood when used in small
   quantities.
       It  was the    suggestion of    Dr Wood that sodium salicylate might
   prove a valuable        antiseptic, but my experiments have all failed to
    show that     it possesses this property.
       On the other hand,          Dr Grandeau and others         have    shown that
    when    pAamurn compounds are injected into the blood, they para
    lyse the heart     and striated muscles (Kemmerich's        Archiv   fur Physio

logie,   bd.    ii.   p.  49).     This  action     occurs   even when     dilute    solu
tions   are  injected into the system.             The blood contains normally            a
small percentage of potash, but certain limits must not be exceeded,
or poisonous         effects are the results.
    From     the above        it will    be seen that a solution of potassium
         *
iodate      (which is a germicidal agent of great power) is useless for
injection purposes.
     VIII.     Sugar and Cellulose, two Products formed during
                THE LlFE-HlSTORY OF BACILLUS               TUBERCULOSIS.
    About six years ago M. Pouchet extracted                    sugar (C^H^O,;)     from
the lungs      of phthisical patients.           And Dr Freund discovered             that
Bacillus      tuberculosis      forms    cellulose     in the organs     and   blood of
tuberculous         persons.     I  have also proved       the presence of cellulose
in the sputa of phthisical patients                (Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin., vol. xv.
p.   36).     My     experiments      on this point have been repeated several
 times, and always with the same results.
            IX. The Infectious Nature of Human Sputum.
    There is little doubt that the expectorations                of phthisical patients
 are of an infectious nature           ; as  it  has been proved       that when      sus
 ceptible animals are fed on tuberculous matter, they become infected
 with the disease.
    I  think it accordingly advisable for physicians attending phthisical
 patients to give full instructions for nurses and others to disinfect
 the   urine, feces, and sputa,             so  that there may be no chance             of
 infection.       It    would not     be   a   difficult task for nurses attending
 consumptives           to immerse      all handkerchiefs after         use   in   water
 containing carbolic acid.
       X. Bacillus tuberculosis in the Breath of Phthisical
                                       Patients.
    I   have already shown that the salica                  of  consumptive     patients
 often contains the germs of phthisis (Proc. Roy. Soc.                  Edin.,   vol. xv.
 p.  55).     I   have also obtained         growths in blood-serum,         exhibiting
 all the macroscopic and microscopic                appearances of tubercle bacillus
 from the breath exhaled by            a person     in  a state of advanced phthisis.

   Professor    Giglioli (Fermenii               e   Microbt) describes the production
of tolufJe     ferments by living                micro-organisms.               What         have       the

   We know that vegetable                    diastase (produced in the first instance
from    albumin by the action of living cells) is capable of converting
starch   into dextrose, and cane-sugar into dextrose and levulose                                   :   —

     These    substances       are     of a definite            chemical        composition             and
formed by the        action of non-organised                     ferments.          Therefore, may
we     not infer that the alkaloids of disease                       are possibly produced by
 the   soluble ferments secreted             by pathogenic microbes.

 (AttidellaR. Accademia dei Lined, 1886)                                have    thrown consider
able    light on this all-important but most obscure subject.
      Recently,  N. Kravkoff {Journal of the Russian Pliysico-Chemiad

 inquiry into the properties and action of pure vegetable diastase.
      The production         of al/caloids by pathogenic microbes                             is        most
 important;       for "one of the most interesting facts observed                               in the
 growth of        septic     micro-organisms               is    this,       that     the     products
 of    the   decomposition           started and maintained                     by    them have             a
 most detrimental           influence on themselves,                  inhibiting their power of
 multiplication    ;   in    fact, after     a   certain amount of these products has
 accumulated,       the organisms            become        arrested      in their growth, and
 finally may be altogether killed.                       Thus the substances             belonging to

 produced      in the      course     of putrefaction of proteids, — have                      a        most

   There is little doubt that the most rational method                       of treating
 contagious    diseases (whose       microbes        reside   in the blood) is by      the
injection     of some germicidal            agent.       When the microbes             are
destroyed     the disease would be at an end.
   My investigations         on this      subject are still incomplete,            but    I
sincerely    hope that they will be found interesting and                  full  of sug
gestions for the pathologist        and physician.
   My     apology     for bringing       them       (in their present incomplete
condition) before the Society,            is  in    the words of Lavoisier: — "A
man would never give anything to the public if he waited till he
had reached       the goal of his undertaking, which is ever appearing
close at hand, and yet ever slipping              farther and farther      as he draws
nearer."
On the Solution of the Three-Term Numerical Equation
        of the rath Degree. By the Hon. Lord M'Laren.
                               (ReaJ March      17,   1890.)
   The method of solution developed                  in this paper, while perfectly
general    in its character      as  regards     three-term       equations,   may also
be considered       as a  solution of the complete               equation   of the    5th
degree  ;   because, by known         methods        resulting from the theory          of
equations,    every    equation     of the 5th degree is reducible to              three
terms.
   I may be permitted here to make an introductory observation                         on
the supposed       superiority of an algebraic             to a numerical solution.
The algebraic       solution has undoubtedly an aspect of theoretical

completeness            ;       but in point of utility                            there is very little          difference.
Supposing that                       an equation of the 5th degree could be solved
algebraically so that                      x is       expressed               as   the 5th root of         a   function of
known quantities, a,                        b, and           c.        If      we write          for a,   b, and      c    their
values, and            proceed to find the 5th root of the function, there is no
known method of obtaining                                    the root except                     by the use of logar
ithms.           Now the extraction of the 5th root by the division                                                         of    a
logarithm is equivalent                          to the solution of the transcendental equa
                      lly
turn    a= 10°'             ,   which is only possible because tables of values of ij to
the argument                    x have     been computed.
  The solution                       which        I    here           offer        is    obtained by the use of
differential logarithms, and is not different                                               in   character       from that
which        I   have considered.
   It    is not an approximate solution, as                                         I understand          the expression;
because the             value found for x is obtained by one operation, and is
incapable         of being made more accurate by applying corrections to it.
   The value found                        for x        is,   however, only true on the assumption
that the          tabular values are true values.                                        But this limitation of                 the
accuracy          of the solution                     is   not    a     consequence               of any imperfection
 of    the method,                   but results solely from the fact that the tabular
quantities            which are assumed to be known                                        are quantities which do
not admit             of exact numerical expression,                                     or which,       in other      words,
cannot be          completely expressed in                              a      series of powers of the number

  It    seems desirable               that quantities which                 are of general application
should be denoted                   by symbols not liable to be mistaken                                     for the

  In        the        numerical examples             given          in this      paper       I     have          made
use of Zech's               Tables      of   Logarithms          of Addition                 and Subtraction
(Berlin, li>G3), in which the argument (in)       given to five signi           is
ficant figures with proportional parts, and the logarithmic difference
(Xoy)   is      given to seven significant figures.
  The property of these functions which attracted my attention,                                                    and
led to this new application of them                             is   this   :   that for any function,
log    (a   +    b),   or log (a.c"     +   fix*), the logarithmic                   difference             does not
depend on the absolute values of a and                                b,   or ax" and /3aj\ but solely
on their ratio.
  For       if    we denote        a   logarithmic difference (as above) by                             Xoy^
                                                                                                                   we
have,       XoyA = log        (A    +   L)   - log   A   = log                   =   l°g    f  1   +    j),       what
ever may be the absolute                     values of     ll    and       A.
  By        means of this property we are enabled to eliminate the powers
of x from the logarithmic equation, and to obtain equations                                                  between

     On the Reflexion-Caustics                       of Symmetrical Curves.
            By the Hon.         Lord M'Laren.             (With Two Plates.)
                                     (Bead   April  7, 1890.)
     The caustics here considered             are those resulting from the reflexion
of systems           of  parallel rays.        The subject       is   purely geometrical.
The caustic is considered             as a   derived curve, and is defined            as  the
envelope       of   a  system of lines drawn from the primary curve, whose
inclination        to a  given line is double         the inclination       of the normal
at the     incident      point
     It  is comparatively          easy to find an expression            for a caustic in
mixed coordinates.                But, where       the   coordinates      of  the   primary
curve     have to be        eliminated, the problem           becomes more         difficult,
and unless        this condition       be fulfilled the expression         cannot    be con
sidered      a   true analytical       solution of the        locus.      In   the   present
paper,     differential and algebraic expressions are first found contain
ing the coordinates             of the focal point corresponding              to a point in
the     primary or reflecting           curve, and      the coordinates       of the latter
are then      eliminated       between the differential and algebraic equations.
     So far as      I  am aware,     very little has been written on the caustics
of reflexion        for parallel rays.
     Professor        Cayley's investigations relate to the caustics                of con
 verging     and diverging pencils,           and include refraction-caustics.             In
the recent        paper    of Mr Mannheim, published in               the Transactions     of
 the Accidentia         dei Lincei, the author develops              a method      of deter
 mining a series         of points which are the foci of the reflected rays for
a given        curve or surface        ; but his method           does not furnish        the
 equation of the          continuous caustic or locus of focal points which                 I
conceive        to be geometrically        the only admissible          solution.     I  may
 add that a       method      analogous     to that here employed            was   used by
 Mr Childe,        in his Treat ise on Refected Ray-Surfaces and their Rela
 tion to    Plajie Refected Caustics, to determine              the caustic by reflexion
 fflt a radiant        point which is coincident with tho pole or origin of
 polar coordinates         of the reflecting curve.         From the examples given
 hy Mr Childe             of the application of his method,                it is evidently
 applicable generally to two-term polar eopuations                  ;  though the author
  does not       directly announce        this limitation, nor does he treat at all

of the caustics by reflexion of pencils of parallel rays.                    It   appears to
me that the case investigated                   by Mr Childe, and the      case of    parallel
rays     here treated, embrace all that can be found by the method of
auxiliary curves, and my paper may therefore be regarded                          as comple
mentary       to this part of           Mr Childe's work, although           the auxiliary
curves used and the proofs are quite different for the two cases.
     The general solution here given (which is essentially geometrical)
was suggested by my solution of a particular case, that of the
 Reflexion-Caustic of the Parabola,                     which appeared in the Monthly
 Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society for 1887.                            The solution
 is general       for the parallel-ray caustic of any reflecting                curve   which
 can be expressed as a two-term polar equation.                       The equivalents of
 the polar equations             in Cartesian       coordinates  are then determined         for
 the curve of any degree n                ;   and it is shown that these include funda
 mental forms or types of every class of symmetrical                     algebraic     curves,
  whether      these be linite or infinite in extent, central                   or parabolic.
  The solution may             be held       to apply generally    to algebraic      curves of
 perfect symmetry,             if   we consider      those curves    only to have perfect
  symmetry        whose      axes of symmetry            are separated by equal        angular
  intervals    ;   in other words, curves whose branches are all equal                      and
  are   symmetrically disposed about                  a centre.
                      1. Differential Equation of a Reflected Ray.
      I  begin with the fundamental expressions                   for the length (L) of        a
  reflected ray, from the incident to the focal point.                     These are
        L=   i/>!Cosi       .     .   .      (1);         L=|p2seci      .    .    .   (2),
   where plt      p.,  are respectively         the greatest and least radii of curvature
  at the incident point, and i is the angle of incidence                    or reflexion.
      For    surfaces       of revolution, to which these investigations                     are
   usually confined, the relation (1) applies to the focus of consecutive
   reflected rays in a principal plane ; and the relation (2) applies to
   the focus of consecutive               rays reflected     from  a cyclic section of       the
                  surface

   It: Ac.,  vol. xv. p. 97).           I   shall deal only with the form (1) applicable
   to reflexion in a          principal plane, it being evident that the cone of
   rays represented           by (2) has its vertex or focus in the axis of                  the
   surface of revolution if the incident pencil is direct, and that if                       the

not intersect             at all, except in a principal plane.
      To simplify the investigation                        the pencil of parallel rays                  will, in

(X) of the reflecting                    curve, which is also taken as the axis of polar
coordinates.                The solutions are then extended to the                         case of      oblique
pencils.             In   the notation of this paper,

               from the pole on the tangent.
     In      the                  relation (1) we have
                        fundamental                                          a       variable origin (the

radius         of    curvature),         whose      direction varies from point to point of
the       reflecting curve.                The transposition to              a       definite   origin and    a
fixed               line (X) may bo effected by finding an expression
             reference
for    the difference of position of  point (S) of the reflecting curve

reflecting curve may be                     next considered.
     Let      /3   be the          inclination of the pencil to the axis of symmetry,
then the           inclination of the reflected ray to the normal                                               is        <u+        /?,   and
the distance             of the new focal point,                           C,       is      - cos    (co   +    /3)   .

angle, the             new point       C        lies on the circle                        2S0Q, but              is       nearer the

telescopic            field), and these all lie on                        a    circle    in   a   principal               plane
whose diameter                is     the principal               focal length.              For   a   reflecting sur
face of revolution the field                            of view           is   accordingly the surface                       of   a
sphere whose diameter                       is   the focal length.
     From       a      note     communicated                     to    me      by    Professor Cayley,                       and
quoted in the above-mentioned                               paper,        it   would appear that this                        is   a
property             of all reflecting            surfaces.               It   may now be added                         that      if
any other             point     St    on the reflecting                    surface       be taken, the foci for
all pencils reflected at this point in                                    a    principal plane also lie                    on     a
circle whose diameter                     is   half the radius of curvature at the point.
     This property              is   not confined to the polar curves bere investigated,
because         it    results      from the general equation                            for the length of                    the
reflected ray as given by                        Sir William Hamilton in                          the paper above
referred to.              This       circle corresponds                   to the generating             circle of            the

    When these x-and-y equations are fully expanded, they                          are found
to be central homogeneous equations of the 10th degree, each having
ita distinct combination of + and                    - signs.    Numbers (1) to (5) are
all hyperbolic curves without inflexions, and having the branches of
each     curve     all equal and all symmetrically disposed about a centre.
These characteristics          evidently apply to all curves of even integral
degrees so obtained.
    In   (1) there are 10 asymptotes, with angular intervals                     of 18°, and
 10 real branches.
     In  (2) there are 8 asymptotes, with angular intervals of 221°, and
 8  real branches.
     In  (3), (4), and (5) the number                 of asymptotes      and branches are
 respectively       G,  4, and 2, and the angular            intervals are 30°, 45°,       and
 90", the circle         being   always      equally divided.         The curves of         the
 equations       containing two cosines               have not    been examined.           The
 above are all the symmetrical homogeneous                        hyperbolic curves that
 can be formed in the 10th degree, and                      for any degree the number
 of such curves is evidently nj'2.                    They   are  all curves of " perfect
 symmetry" in the           sense   defined in the introductory paragraph.
     If  m exceed n, as,      for example, in the expression ai0             = rv> cos (\20),
 we obtain by transformation             to rectangular coordinates a homogeneous
 equation      of the second class (so termed in my paper on this subject),
 i.e., of the form        ij>„(x,y) =   4>ll(.r,  y),  or ^"V*'   ^=    1.  The number        o£
 such curves (all traceable) for any degree, n -j>, is infinite.
   For    the equations      of  the form        rn = a" • cos (m6)   or a"  =  r" sec (mff),
                                     above considered,
  we    also    obtain     homogeneous           Cartesian     equations     of   the  second

      The synthesis        of the diethyl ether of this new acid was effected by
the electrolysis             of    a    strong      aqueous          solution of potassium                    ethyl
sebate,        COOC2H;,(CH2)8COOK.                        This salt was prepared by adding
the       calculated quantity of alcoholic potash                           to an alcoholic solution
 of   diethyl sebate.             After      some time the potassium                    ethyl salt began
 to
      separate      out  :    the whole was then boiled, allowed to cool, and
filtered.        What        remained         on the filter was dissolved                     in water       ;     the
aqueous         solution was extracted                  twice with ether, and then evapo
rated to       a   concentration            suitable for electrolysis               (cf. this vol.          p.   54).
      When the electric                current was passed through the cold solution,
it    rapidly diminished             in intensity, and in                  a   few moments                ceased     to
flow altogether.                 This we found to be due                    to tho fact that the pro

that an     investigation of the thermal               conductivity      of aluminium
and its alloys       should be made, but before obtaining the neorssarv
bare a   smaller bar was obtained            from   experiments        on whi :h a pre
liminary notion was got of the thermal                   conductivity     ;  this hzizz

the    long bars used        in Forbes's method of conducting these experi
 ments.
    The present note gives the           result of this preliminary experimer.:.
 The small      bar used was furnished by the Aluminium                      CczLjany.

 contained nearly 98 per cent,           of pure metal, the chief impcrity be:r.r
 iron.    The method employed for finding the conductivity wig ^zh-
 stantially that     of Forbes, the only difference being th3t the                 cx>r
  end of the     bar was inserted in a cold            bath.    The bar used.       Hr.g
  20 inches   long and     1  inch square in section, was of such         a ler._-.h that
  it could be also used        for the cooling experiment.            Four holes were
  drilled in the bar, separated         by intervals of     3 inches.      The thermo
  meters   used   were those employed           in Professor Tait's and my            on.
  previous work.        The source of heat was simply a Bunsen                    barter,
  applied to one end       of the bar.
     For such a preliminary experiment                it is unnecessary      to give all
  the data   regarding rates of cooling, values of tangents, &c                 ;  ar. i  it
  will therefore     suffice to state simply the result               By these ex:*ri-

     At     the suggestion        of Professor          P.     G. Tait,
                                                                      I      undertook the further
investigation of an experiment,                       an account            of which he communi
cated to this Society on Monday, the 15th of                                April      1878.
     In this     experiment       a     platinum plate of moderate thickness                             is    in
serted between         the electrodes of an electrolytic                         cell,      so as   to com
pletely fill the cross-section.                    This platinum plate thus becomes the
common electrode of two cells, and on perforating                                 it   it   is   found that
a    comparatively        small hole at once changes its functions to that of
an obstacle in one cell.
     It   is   interesting to study experimentally                        as    fully    as   possible the
complete         chain of events from the first perforation to the total
removal of the plate.
     The interposition            of    a     platinum plate of the same dimensions
as    the electrodes        (namely,          1    sq. cm.)        reduced      the strength         of    the
current        to about    one-half.            The plate was then perforated                        with       a
tine needle, readings being taken for each perforation.
     The strength of the                  current         is     observed      rapidly to rise, the
quantity passing through the plate rapidly and regularly decreasing;
a    transition period        ensues, after               which the whole current passes
through the holes.                The polarisation remains                      practically constant
for the experiment           as    long       as   the area of the perforations                     is   small
compared to that of the plate.
     The results thus obtained                  were plotted as curves, the deflections
of the galvanometer           being measured along the axis of ordinates, and
the nuin l)er of holes along the axis of abscissa?.
     The first curve (A) was obtained                        by using       one central plate of               1
sq. cm. area,       the currents being obtained                     from storage cells arranged
to give 10 volts, and the deflections                          were measured on             a    Helmholtz
Tangent Galvanometer.                    Seventy          perforations         were made, each hole
having approximately               -5   J<y   sq. cm.     section.

   This curve        shows that only the first few points obtained                 show
any    rapid     rise in current strength,          the curve      tending   to become
parallel to axis         of  abscissae,    which it does when the plate is re
moved.
    In  order to more          fully  elucidate    the first points on this curve,
three plates,      of  1  sq. cm. each, were interposed instead of one, the
storage cells being           used,   arranged     in    the  previous manner,       the
results    for 10 holes       being embodied         in curve     (B), the deflections
 being those       of Sir William Thomson's Reflecting Galvanometer of
 22 3   B.A. units resistance, shunted through               a resistance   of 1 ohm.
     Since the mechanical           disturbance      due to the liberation       of gas
 bubbles    vitiated the results obtained,            the experiment      was repeated
 with the     current from two Bunsen cells whose E. M. F. was about
 18 volt each; the size of the plates remaining the same, the results
 for nine holes      in each plate      are plotted    in curve (C).
     For the first      two holes in the plates the curve is practically                a
  straight line, a great        part of the current still passing through the
  pUtinum; for the next three holes we observe the transition period,
  and after    that the whole of the current flows through the holes, the
  current    slowly    and    regularly increasing        in strength    as  the  cross-
  section of the     liquid passing through the holes is increased.
      This experiment        was repeated      under the same conditions with
  much larger plates        (having an effective area of 24 compared to            6  sq.
  cm.).     The curve (D) did not give very satisfactory               results, it very
  quickly    becoming a straight line.
      The experimental        difficulties were greater than at first suspected,
  especially    in finding a means for firmly securing the platinum.                This
  was   finally achieved        by making the whole cell out of              a  block of
  paraffin, the     platinum being firmly imbedded             along the edges in the
  latter.    Great care had also to be taken              to keep the surface of the
  platinum clean       and to ensure the electrolyte passing               through the
   holes when made.
      In conclusion,      I must    express    my best thanks to Professor Tait
   for his advice and the        facilities placed      at my disposal     during these
   and   other experiments;        likewise to Dr Peddie, for the interest he
   has taken in my       work.

     " There     were but few land fowls.         We saw none but eagles of         the
  larger sort of birds, but five or six sorts of small birds.            The   biggest
  sort of these were not bigger than larks, some no bigger than wrens,
  all singing with great variety of fine shrill notes          ; and we saw some
  of their nests with        young ones in them.           The water-fowls        were
  ducks (which had young ones now, this being the beginning of the
  spring in these parts), curlews, galdens, crab-catahers, cormorants,
  gulls, pelicans,     and some water-fowl such         as  I have    not seen any
  where     besides."     Such are the quaint remarks of the              celebrated
  British    navigator,   Captain William Dampier, when in Shark's               Bay,
  August 1699, on his second visit to New Holland.                 This is probably
  the   first recorded     note of   the avi-fauna of Western Australia, or
 indeed     of any    part of Australia,      if we except Vlaraing, who          two
 years     previously introduced into Europe the black swan for                    the
 first time.       Vlaming    in 1697      discovered   and    named     the    Swan
 River (upon which Perth, the capital of Western Australia,                 stands),
 on account of the number of these exceedingly                handsome      birds he
 found upon that water.
    Gilbert,     the  worthy    coadjutor of the immortal John Gould,
between       the years    1839-42 worked up the bulk of the ornitho
logical notes       of Western      Australia     which we are in        possession
of, and      which are embodied         in Gould's Birds of Australia. By
reason of the number         of aboriginals he had to assist him, Gilbert's
work was very accurate and complete.                 On the 28th June          1845,
poor Gilbert        met a premature       death at the hands of treacherous
natives     during Leichardt's expedition to North Australia.                 Gould
pathetically adds, "and         so  I  lost an able coadjutor and science a
devoted follower."

Webb of Albany,             W.A.,     have added much interesting information
to   West Australian ornithology.
    And now        I humbly       beg, through this learned             Society,   to add to
the heap of         knowledge my worthy forerunners have built, a few
pebbles       chiefly with regard to the geographical                 distribution of the
species.       These     pebbles    were    gathered       during a brief research          of
four months spent           in "Western Australia last year.
     Another consideration has induced me to forward some of my
observations        to Great Britain, namely,             the fact of the
                                                                                " Enabling
 Bill" for the self-government               of Western          Australia, now before
 the   Imr#rial      Parliament, towards which no doubt the attention                      of
 many    persons      is directed   ;  therefore,     any information,        scientific   as
 well as      political, about the great western              territory, may perchance
 not be altogether        devoid of interest.
     The   following fifteen species of birds               are   now recorded       for the
 first  tune as      West Australian, namely            : — Mditkreptus        brevirostris,

     The following        having been omitted          from Western Australia in             a
 Tabular      List of Australian Birds lately issued, are now reinstated,
 namely     :—  Tinnunrulus cenchroides, Layenoplastes arid, Petrmca

     With regard to the emu, it may be noticed                      that Gould records
 only one      species,   Dromaius irroratus        ;  while Dr Ramsay questions
  the existence     of the common or second species (D. novai-hollandice).
  From reliable        evidence,   as   well    as from      personal    observations,       I
  have been      able   to establish     for  a certainty       the latter bird as well.
  It is the more common in all parts of Western Australia, whereas
  the spotted      emu (D. irroratus)         has a more        restricted   range, being
  principally    confined inland to what is known as the                   " silver  grass

    In  reference   to the range of distribution        over the other parts of
Australia    of the West        Australian   birds,   the Table is chiefly      the
results of observations      when on brief excursions      to the other colonies
during the      many years       I  have been working       at the   " Oology     of
Australian     Birds."    But    where    personal   knowledge of    an}- species
did not exist,    I  have referred      to Gould's and    Dr   Ramsay's   tabular
lists, so as to render      the distribution as complete as possible up to
date.     For, no doubt,    as   the various    colonies  are further explored
and    opened    up,  so   there    will  be  many extensions      of localities,
and    probably     not  a   few new       species    or varieties   discovered,
especially   in the far interior and the north-west of our vast island
continent.
    It occurred to mo that the divisional line between west and north
west might be conveniently drawn about the Tropic of Capricorn or
the North West Cape.            The same imaginary line is also used              to
subdivide North from South Queensland.
    At some future time I hope to furnish a more complete list                    of
 the north-west birds of Western            Australia, because, knowing         the
 nature of the country,       I  am sensible that many hiaius occur in that
column.
     There are     between      760   and    770    known     Australian    birds.
 Rather more than one-third, or about 280, occur in Western Australia
 (in that portion south          of  the   Tropics), and     are  distributed    as

     It   is necessary      for    a clear    understanding of the chemical changes
which occur on treating morphine                          in   various ways, and for compar
ing its physiological action with that of the bodies so formed,                                  that
we should           summarise           at   some length the exact position of our
present knowledge                regarding     its chemistry          and pharmacology.
     Morphine         has        the    composition            represented    by    the    formula
CjfHjgNOy            It     is generally supposed to crystallise with one mole
cule of water,        but there is reason to believe that the composition                          of
the hydrated          base is really 8 C1TH19N03, 9 H20,                       the water      being
present     in the proportion of               1   \   molecule.       Morphine is    a monacid
base,     forming neutral and readily soluble salts with all the stronger
acids.      Like all alkaloids, it is built                      up on the ammonia           (NIIa)
type, and is a        tertiary amine, all the hydrogen atoms having been
replaced      by more or less complex radicals.     This is shown to
be the      case by the fact that when treated with methyl iodide, the
latttr body becomes directly united to the morphine molecule,                                    com
bining with the nitrogen and so forming a quaternary                                  ammonium
base,     analogous to tetramethyl-ammonium iodide.                             Such alkaloidal
derivatives        are therefore         to be regarded as addition                compounds,      as
indicated        in the formula C^HjgNOj, CH3I.       To How belongs the
credit of       having  been the first to form these compounds, by acting
on morphine,          codeine,          strychnine, and other alkaloids with alkyl-
iodides.         He fell into the error, however, of regarding                       them as sub
stitution compounds,               in which hydrogen               had been replaced         by the
different       alcohol radicals.
     Although        the     constitution of morphine is not exactly known,
much       information            has    been      accumulated          regarding    it,   and    our
knowledge          of certain of the groups                    contained     in the molecule       is
considerable,        and of practical importance.                     The first distinct advance
in   such knowledge               was made by Beckett and Wright,                     who found
that      by    treating     morphine with acetic acid and acetic anhydride,
first     one    and then another                hydrogen atom were replaced by the

acid   radical,   such derivatives      being substitution      compounds.          The
substitution could not by any means             be carried   further.     That    is to
say, monoacetyl-        and diacetyl-morphine were formed,             but not       the
triacetyl or any higher derivative.           Butyric and benzoic anhydrides
were tried with        precisely   similar results.      Whence it is manifest
that the morphine molecule             contains    two hydroxyl      groups, a fact
which has been confirmed              by the experiments         of Hesse      and of
Gerichten.        On referring to the        original    paper    of Beckett and
Wright,     it will bo observed       that these chemists adopt          the double
formula C34H3SN206 for the molecule of morphine, so that they use
the terms diacetyl- and tetracctyl-morphine for what we have called
monoacetyl-       and diacetyl-morphine.          In   a former     communication
to this Society we have         fully  discussed    the objections    to the higher
formula.       It seems to be clearly established         that the third atom of
oxygen is either connecting or ketone oxygen, i.e. oxygen                 which    acts
as the   connecting link between two atoms of carbon, or otherwise
has   its combining powers saturated              by union with one atom of
carbon.       The next important point to be noticed is that those two
hydroxyl groups in the morphine molecule                have different values —
fulfil different     functions.     It  had long been known that morphine
is readily soluble        in solutions of the caustic alkalies and in lime
water, but it was reserved for Chastaing to show                   that this ready
solubility is due to the formation of definite              compounds      with the
alkalies.      These bodies have the general composition            M, C^H^XCXp
H.,0 or MOII.CjjH^NOg,             where    M  represents     a monatomic       metal
such as sodium.          That is to say, that while the morphine molecule
contains two hydroxyl groups, only one of these is capable of having
its hydrogen replaced           by  a metal.     In this    respect and in some
others, such      as its coloration    with ferric salts, morphine resembles
a phenol.       Indeed the readiness with which morphine                reacts   with
potash, evolving heat and forming a crystalline compound,                     is very
suggestive of phenol (carbolic acid).            In the same way that phenol
(CgHjOH) forms ethers, as methyl-phenylether (CJIjO.CH,)) so mor
phine (C17HlsNO.,On)            gives us ethers, the morphine-methyl ether
being codeine       (C17HlsNO.,.OCH3)        which is found along with mor
phine in opium.           By a study of the products of decomposition               of
codeine uuder different conditions, additional light is thrown on                 the
constitution of morphine.            Anderson first showed          that  codeine    is

Pfeckett and      Wright,     by acting     on codeine    with acetic anhydride,
found    that they could only introduce one acetyl                group,   the other
hydroxyl hydrogen (of the morphine molecule)                  having been already
replaced    by methyl.         For   the same reason,       Gerichten found that
by submitting         codeine    to the action      of phosphorus     pentachloride,
he was    able only to replace one hydroxyl by chlorine, the compound
obtained     having      the    formula C18H20ClNO.2 (chlorocodide).               By
continued    action of the pentachloride, the compound C1SH10C12N02
was   obtained, whence it is evident that the third atom of oxygen in
the  morphine molecule         does not exist as hydroxyl.
    By oxidation of morphine Chastaing obtained picric acid, proving
that   morphine        contains    the   benzene chain.        Wright    and   Mayer
obtained    pyridine on distilling morphine            with potash.      By distilla
tion with      zinc dust Gerichten and              Schrotter obtained      pyridine,
phenanthrene,         pyrrol,    trimethyl-amine,       and    other    compounds.
Although up to the present time               the constitution of morphine has
not been    certainly determined,         there is reason to believe       that it is
 fciwntially a phenanthrene         derivative,    containing alkyl and hydroxyl
groups.     Phenanthrene consists,           as  it were, of three benzene      rings

 The nitrogen       probably replaces one of the           CH   groups   as  in pyri
 dine, and   it would     appear from the number of hydrogen atoms                  in
 the morphine molecule          that the latter must be      a hydro derivative,    as
 piperidine   is of pyridine.        We    are aware that it has been recently
 suggested that      there are a methyl and an ethyl radical directly com
 bined  with the nitrogen, in which case the nitrogen could not be
 combined     as  it is in pyridine      and chinoline.       In view of     the fact
 that   pyridine      has  been     obtained     from morphine, and from the

analogy that several of the other              alkaloids are known to be pyri
dine or chinoline derivatives,          one is inclined to regard           morphine        as
of the same class until conclusive             proof is advanced to the contrary.
                        Physiological Action of Morphine,
   There is now complete            agreement      among     authors regarding            the
general symptoms          observed     after    the administration         of morphine,
although many points of practical,              as well as theoretical,      interest still
require     elucidation.      All   recent     observers    state that        the    central
nervous     system     is the part primarily affected, and have                   described
the   symptoms        as   divisible    into     two stages — a narcotic              and    a
tetanic.
    Frogs.  — After 2-5      centigrams      of  a soluble   salt of morphine           have
been given subcutaneously           to a frog, the animal becomes                 in  a few
minutes dull and heavy, and shows a distinct inclination                        to remain
quietly in one position.          When pinched or otherwise               irritated, it     at
iirst jumps quite well, but very shortly loses its power of accurate
muscular     co-ordination.       It  then ceases      to move       away      even    when
pinched, and         if  placed    on    its back      remains      in   that position.
The corneal reflex becomes abolished,               while the spinal reflexes             are
diminished, but seldom             wholly      disappear.     All     these     symptoms
indicate depression of the brain and spinal cord, and                   Witkowski         has
pointed out that the cerebral               lobes succumb       first, the other parts
of the central        nervous     system      becoming     involved in order from
before backwards.
    The    frog   remains     in this helpless         narcotised      condition for         a
varying time until the second stage supervenes, the spinal reflexes
gradually becoming more and more exaggerated until tetanic spasms
occur spontaneously         and on stimulation.          After    a longer      or shorter
period exhaustion ensues, the frog then                 responding       to stimulation
by a mere twitch.          It  may finally die or gradually recover.
    During both stages the brain is deeply narcotised,                  as    irritation of
the cornea during the tetanic            condition brings on a general spasm
but no closure of the eyelid.             The spasms are spinal,           as section      of
the cord at the atlanto-occipital membrane does not stop them;                           the
succeeding      exhaustion     also arises from the spinal cord, as the motor
nerves     and   muscles     are found to bo only slightly               diminished        in
electric   irritability.     A very distinct peculiarity of               the morphine

tetanus      is that after each spasm a period                   of exhaustion ensues, and
there is no        further tetanus           —either        spontaneous    or reflex   — until      a
short interval               Not only, therefore, is the spinal cord
                        has elapsed.
abnormally easily excited, but it is abnormally easily exhausted.
A healthy frog will react to stimulation time after time in an equal
degree and          gently, while the morphinised frog gives out all its
energy     for the time being in one prolonged                     and exaggerated         spasm.
According          to   Witkowski,            the    apparent     stimulation is in reality
a   kind of paralysis,           and is simply a failure on the part of the spinal
eord    to   husband and properly distribute                          its resources,     this dis
arrangement          resulting in an unmanageable and violent explosion of
nerve energy.             Hence it requires                a rest until   more is stored       up.
We have observed,                 however,          that   the smaller    the dose by which
tetanus is    induced, the less marked                      is the teudency to exhaustion,
and    if the animal survive a few days this tendency to exhaustion
after each spasm wears                  off, and     the tetanic      attacks   cannot    be dis
tinguished from those of strychnine.
    Smaller        doses        cause    only narcosis          and    depression,     followed,
generally on next day or earlier, by a marked increase in the reflex
eicitability,       not amounting to tetanus.                     Very small doses simply
cause   alight narcosis.
    That small doses of morphine depress the reflex                             and conducting
powers of the           spinal cord can be shown without much                          difficulty.
Meihuizen, using decapitated                frogs (Tiirck's method), found that
there was          depression,      followed by increase of reflexes.  This has
been confirmed            by Witkowski and by ourselves in many experi
ments.       To confirm these results obtained                     by Tiirck's method, we
administered morphine to decapitated frogs, and found that, although
in many cases the spinal reflexes were very slightly                             depressed, yet
in others the depression                was extremely          marked,    and was succeeded
in due time by tetanus.                   As in      these cases the brain was removed,
the primary depression               and subsequent tetanus must have been quite
independent of           it,   and due solely to an action on the cord.                Moreover,
email doses         of morphine directly injected into the aorta of decapi
tated frogs (so as to make                   the results      independent of irregularities
in   absorption from the stomach or subcutaneous                          tissue) gave similar
results.      Thus —

    There gradually ensued indifference              to mechanical       stimuli.      At
first a slight pinch with forceps was felt, later                  it   was   not    felt,
and had gradually to be increased in severity to elicit a reaction.

    12.30. — Is now      much      exhausted; only gives a slight spasmodic
twitch on stimulation.
    In  such experiments          the cutting off of the blood supply to the
 cord   causes    much more rapid exhaustion                than would otherwise
 ensue.    Similar results were got with doses of              5  milligrammes.
    In  the descriptions      of the morphine        action   hitherto published it
 has always     been assumed         that the occurrence and         sequence of the
 two stages    of narcotism        and tetanus     are   a necessary     result of the
 action of the drug on the nerve             cells, the explanation given being
 that morphine "first depresses
                                          "
                                             and   "then stimulates "       the spinal
 cord.    Witkowski      advances the opinion that both stages are really
 the   result    of   paralysis.       We    have     found, however,        that    the
 sequence of depression and tetanus is entirely a question                   of dosage,
 and of how much         morphine reaches the spinal cord.                 As  we have
 seen,  an ordinary dose of the alkaloid first depresses the cord, and
 this is followed by tetanus.              When     a  minimum narcotic         dose   is
 given the narcosis       is not deep, but no tetanic stage ensues               on the
 narcotic,   and hence       it  is   evidently necessary to give a          dose  of a
 certain   size  if we wish to get both stages.               When such       a dose   is
 given, what happens          is that the morphine          is but slowly absorbed
 from the stomach or subcutaneous tissue, only a small portion reaches
 the spinal     cord   at first,    and   hence the depression;           but  as more
 morphine      becomes     absorbed,      more    of it comes in contact with
 nerve cells of the cord, and as a result we get tetanus.
     Tetanus,    we have      found, can be induced at once without any
 preliminary depression if the morphine be thrown into the circula
 tion so as to immediately reach the cord in sufficient quantity.

Hence it is by no means a necessary consequence                            of the action of
morphine that depression               succeeded by tetanus          should occur.       The
following      experiment shows this decisively.
     Expt.    2.— The brain of a frog was destroyed.                     Next day it had
recovered       from       the    pithing.     A    ligature was       passed    round the
lumbar region,           excluding the lumbar nerves             ;  the right aorta was
tied ; a    cannula was inserted into the left aorta.
     11.40.— 0-035 grms. morphine               hydrochlorate in        1  cub. cent, water
was injected        into the cannula.          At   once there was rigid tetanus.

feebler.
     12.45.  — Quite       exhausted.       No  response on stimulation.
     It is necessary        to tie the vessels in the lumbar region               to ensure
 that sufficient       of the morphine solution reaches the cord at once,
and also      (although this is not of such importance)                     to protect the
 motor nerves        from the depressing            influence   of the morphine.           If
 this precaution        be neglected      the experiments       never succeed so well,
 as the   greater part of the morphine, instead                 of going to the spinal
 cord,   gets    distributed        over   the whole       body.      Tetanus     generally
appears     in such     cases,    but rather late, although never nearly             so late
as   when the morphine is given subcutaneously.
     In the present           state   of  our   knowledge it is useless            even to
speculate      as to    what changes morphine brings about in the nerve
substance      of the cord.          Small amounts         of the alkaloid coming         in
contact      with     the     grey   nerve    cells    interfere with       their   vitality
and chemical changes               only in so far      as to  inhibit     or depress their
proper    activity, whereas larger amounts                cause much more profound
changes,     apparently leading to irregular and violent chemical action,
which leads to similar irregular                 and violent       discharges     of nerve
 energy,   followed by extreme exhaustion.                  During     the first condition
 the cells are more         or less incapable of conducting impulses or acting
reflexly, whereas         in  the second they are completely changed in these
 respects, and respond            vigorously to the slightest impression.              It  is
 impossible     to characterise the changes more definite!)'.
     The delay     in   the tetanus when morphine is given subcutaneously
  or  by the stomach can be accounted                for, however, in two ways.

      We have seen that a certain amount of morphine is necessary                                        to
cause      the       tetanus,     and     therefore     (1) we       may      suppose         that    the
nerve      cells     have a special          affinity    for the        morphine,   that           they
abstract      it from        the blood and store        it   up, and     that it is only           when
they have            absorbed       and retained        sufficient      to    bring about            the
requisite        changes       that tetanus comes on            ;    or (2) we may            suppose
that    the morphine is not stored                    up in the nerve cells,                but    that,
passing frequently through them dissolved                           in the blood, it gradually
brings about changes which result in tetanus.
      With     regard     to the action        of morphine on motor nerves great
differences          of opinion have been expressed                     by different          experi
menters.            The older observers, finding that the motor nerves were
considerably           depressed        in electric     irritability     at the          end of      the
poisoning,          concluded       that the alkaloid had a directly depressing
effect on them.              Witkowski,      however,        is of opinion that this is due
to exhaustion after               the    prolonged       tetanus,      for on        dividing      one
sciatic nerve, and             then     administering a large dose of morphine, he
found         that     the      divided     nerve      had     remained           perfectly    excit
able,      while       the    undivided       nerve      was    more         or   less    depressed.
Vulpian        also     found       that in rabbits the              motor         nerves     remain
unaffected.
      We      have     repeated       Witkowski's       experiment         frequently, with             a
result similar to his, but we are of opinion that his conclusion is
erroneous.           The result must be due to the morphine not reaching
the     terminations of the               motor       nerves    in     sufficient        quantity to
paralyse thcni markedly, for we found when we injected a solution
into the aorta,         so    as to make sure         of it reaching the terminations                of
the motor nerves, that these were paralysed.                            The amount required
is,   however,       large, and the end-organs of motor nerves are certainly
not very sensitive to the action of morphine.                           The following         is   one
of the experiments.

muscles      are   also diminished      somewhat       in irritability,     but not to
anything like the same extent as the nerves.
     1.5. — Sciatica     not excitable at      0.   Muscles contract         fairly well
to moderate      current
    In    another    frog, when 0"0425        grm.   in   li   cub. cent, water      was
injected into the abdominal aorta, the sciatics were                    inexcitable to
strongest    current in     11 minutes,    while the muscles of the legs were
still quite excitable to direct stimulation.             Small doses, such       as 0O1
grm., given      in   same way had a scarcely           appreciable      effect on the
motor nerves.
    In another frog the following experiment                was performed        as con
firmation.
    Erpt. 4. — Frog pithed       ;  left femoral      artery tied   ;   sciatic   nerves
excitable    at 220 mm.
    2.28.  — 0O5       grm.   morphine      liydrochlorate       subcutaneously       in
solution.
    3.40.  — Both     nerves excitable    at 220 mm.
    The frog passed through the narcotic               and tetanic stages.         Xext
 day completely       exhausted.     Left (protected)      sciatic nerve stimulated
at 100     mm. gives       good contraction       of leg muscles      ;  right (unpro
 tected) sciatic at 0 mm. gives scarcely perceptible              twitch of muscles.
    In this experiment both sciatic           nerves were subjected          to the ex
 haustion    consequent on the tetanus         ; but the right nerve, in addition,
 was exposed to the action         of the morphine       circulating in the blood.
 The protected       nerve   diminished very much in excitability (in con
 sequence of the tetanus plus the cutting off of its blood supply), but
 the unprotected       nerve wholly lost its excitability, and this difference
can   only be attributed to the action of the morphine                on the latter.
    On repeating        Vulpian's experiment        on rabbits, we got (contrary
 to his
          results) paralysis of the motor nerves.            Thus —
    Erpt.   5. — Rabbit      was   put under ether.           At   12.5     the    right
 femoral    artery     was tied and the right sciatic           nerve    divided.     A
 cannula was      inserted into the left femoral artery, and the left sciatic
 nerve divided.         Both nerves excitable at 90 mm.

 left femoral artery.

Muscles are equally excitable on both sides to direct stimulation.
  In     another experiment                 of the same kind             0-l    grm. abolished             the
excitability of the sciatic nerve in eighteen minutes.                                   It    is evident
therefore that very large doses of morphine                           do paralyse the termina
tions of motor nerves, but that ordinarily death ensues before                                             the
depression is very marked.                    With      small therapeutic doses it is hardly
possible that even a trace of this action is present.
   On sensory nerves and their terminations                              morphine,       oven in large
doses,     has probably           a scarcely appreciable             effect        The condition              of
affairs is no doubt much the same as with motor nerves, — that                                          is, if
large doses could be applied directly to the nerve terminations, the mor
phine would act as            a   paralysant to the nerve tissue, but by the ordinary
methods of administration its effect                      is   practically nil.          It    is   evident
during the tetanic            stage that the sensory nerves are perfectly                        acute, as
the slightest stimulation of the skin brings on                          a   spasm.      The     common
method of applying opium fomentations as an anodyne has probably
no action except what results                       from heat and moisture,                   as the alka
loids cannot penetrate the skin, and even                        if   they did do so, would not
be in sufficient amount to paralyse the sensory nerve terminations.
   Mammalia. — The higher animals                          are affected        by morphine            in   the
same way as frogs,             but there          are certain differences         in the       symptoms,
depending        not on       a   different action of the poison, but on differences
in the nervous system, and on the closer interdependence                                              of its
various      parts      in the higher               animals.        Frogs live long after                  the
respiratory          centre    is      paralysed,       whereas mammals                die at once,           so
soon as this centre               is   thrown out of action, hence the longer                           con
tinuance        of    the     symptoms            and    the marked            development            of   the
tetanic     stage     in the former.               The greater importance of the                      spinal
cord relatively to the brain in batrachians                               has no doubt also                   an
effect in modifying the symptoms.                              Rabbits,        cats,    and dogs        pass
through     a   narcotic and            a   tetanic stage      if   the dose be large enough.
With       small       doses only           the first     stage     is   seen.         (For    doses       and
particulars,         see Tables        of Experiments.)
  The condition of affairs                   is   the same as with frogs.                 Small        doses

  the cerebrum       in the same way remains            doubtful,   as  death    occurs
  early in such cases from paralysis of the respiratory centre.              The only
  method of determining        this point would be to apply morphine directly
  to the brain.     We were unable to carry out such experiments, but the
  results of certain      observations    by Deguise, Dupuy, and Leuret           seem
 to show    that large doses of morphine applied to the brain directly do
 produce convulsions.            In Part II. of their      paper, Experiments 11,
 12, 13, 16     and others (dogs and rabbits), the injection            of morphine
 solutions    into the lateral ventricle, or their application to the cortex,
 produced     well-marked convulsions of an epileptiform character.
    For purposes       of  comparison    it  is necessary to refer briefly to the
 action of    morphine on some of the other systems.               In dogs and cats,
 nausea,    vomiting, and slight diarrhcea           are   always   very prominent
symptoms, unless the dose be very small.                 In  man, as is well known,
small doses cause constipation,           but nausea and vomiting, with some
 times slight     looseness of the bowels,        are not infrequently observed.
The exact        reason of      this is still to be explained,         but    Alt   has
 recently shown        that morphine given hypodermically is very rapidly
secreted     into the stomach, and no doubt the consequent                  irritation
is  sufficient to account for the intestinal symptoms.
    The   heart and blood-vessels          are affected    very slightly, and only
secondarily      to the nervous      system.      Owing to dulling of the vaso
motor centre there         is slight loss of tone in the arteries, accompanied
by a correspondingly           slight fall of blood pressure.          The pupil is
contracted      during the narcotic stage, but        as soon as tetanic   symptoms
develop,     it begins to dilate,      and often      is fully dilated during the
greater part of the poisoning.             The respiratory     centre is very much
depressed, and        respiration greatly slowed, even with small doses.
    As the object of our research was to compare                 the action of mor
phine    with the actions of         a  number of bodies closely related to it
chemically,      we thought that the best plan to obtain an accurate idea
of their relative       toxicity and effects would be to ascertain the mini
mum      dose     which     produced     visible   symptoms,      and by gradually
increasing     it until the minimum lethal           dose was reached, wo had a
complete picture        of the general action of the substance.        Owing to tho
large   number of alkaloids investigated              by us, it was necessary to
confine our experiments            almost    entirely to frogs and rabbits,         the
information        thus obtained       being sufficient       for purposes    of com

                               Physiological Action                 of      Codeine.
                        (Methylmorphine C17H17NO.OH.OCH3).
     The action           of codeine         obtained          directly from opium has been
investigated            by     many        experimenters                 (see        Bibliography).             We
found that            artificial codeine prepared from morphine has identically
the same action as the                  natural product, and hence a comparatively
small number             of experiments        was sufficient for our purpose.
     Its action         is    exerted        on the central                 nervous         sy3tem, and          has
a close          generic resemblance              to that of morphine.                          Schra-Jer and
others      have       pointed out that it causes an evident                                    narcotic      stage,
followed          by    a     condition        of increased                 reflex     excitability           which
amounts to tetanus                 if    the dose be               large        enough.          The      narcotic
stage      is,   however, shorter and much less deep than                                   with morphine,
and    if   large      doses be given to animals                       is     often        hardly noticeable
or quite         absent
     The narcotic            action of codeine on man                    is   much feebler           than that
of   morphine,          and only in one               case    (a   child) has its tetanising effect
teen observed.
     Its paralysing             influence        on      motor         nerves         in    frogs      has     been
pointed out            by several observers, and                       is    very much greater than
that   of morphine.               In    frogs the heart        is      slowed; in Mammalia blood
pressure         is    not    affected,      and        the    pulse-rate            only very slightly.
This     is      probably      due to depression                   of the cardiac motor                    ganglia
(   Schroder).          In     dogs and          cats   it    produces           marked          vomiting and
diarrhoea,        much more so than morphine.
      Frogs. — Our own experiments on frogs confirmed Schrceder's to
a
     large extent.  We found that very small doses, such as 0'0013
gnu. had          no apparent           action    at the time, although next day there
was    a   very faint increase in the reflexes.                              Larger doses of              5   milli
gram       and     upwards caused            a   characteristic              stage of depression with
diminished            reflexes.         This     is    not deep, lasts but                 a   short time, and
is   followed         by increased reflex.               When           the dose was             0   01    gnn. or
more, the         narcotic stage was followed by tetanus.
     Schrceder states           that    if   as much as            2   or   3   centigrms. be given, the
narcotic stage          is    never developed,               but that tetanus comes on almost
at   once.        This, however, depends entirely on the rate of absorption.
We found that                much larger doses (even                    O'OG grm.)             occasionally      had

  336           Proceedings of Royal Society               of Edinburgh.                [sess.
  marked      narcosis    preceding      the tetanus,      while    2 centigrms.       might
  give tetanus      almost at once.          It  is clearly a question of rapidity          of
  absorption.
     With     the smaller doses the tetanus is exactly like that of strych
  nine  ;  but with larger amounts             there is great tendency          to   exhaus
  tion, just    as with morphine,          so   that soon no tetanic spasm            can be
  induced,     the   frog    responding       to    stimulation     by a mere twitch.
  This condition depends partly on depression of the cord                       and partly
  on   depression       of  motor      nerves.      When      the   codeine     is  injected
  directly into the aorta tetanus occurs at once.                  Thus,

 jerk on stimulation.
     1.0. — No response on stimulation.                 The cord is quite       exhausted.
 The brachial nerves (unprotected)                are  quite excitable at 180          mm.,
 the sciatic nerves (protected)           also excitable     at 180 mm.
     Experiments made in the same way with                    1, 2, 3, and 5 centigrms.
 gave similar        results,   but exhaustion ensued              more      rapidly,   and,
 especially    with the larger       doses,   the motor nerves          were completely
 paralysed,      or very much depressed in excitability.                     When      small
 doses such as \-'2        milligrms. are administered             by the aorta,       there
 occurs a stage of depression,              followed by an increase of             reflexes,
just   as  in the   case   of morphine.
     With    regard, therefore,       to the action of codeine          on the cord,      we
find   (as  with morphine) that small doses depress its reflex and                      con
ducting power, while larger ones cause tetanus.                      If a   large dose    be
thrown at once into the substance                    of the spinal cord by injecting
it directly into      the aorta, then no preliminary narcotic stage occurs,
but an increase of reflexes from the very first.
    The action       of codeine        on   the    motor    nerves    in   frogs   is very
distinct.      When the codeine is injected directly into the                    vessels   it
occurs very rapidly,          but   if   a large      dose (about 5       centigrms.)     be
given subcutaneously,            paralysis     or very marked         depression     occurs

one sciatic nerve be         cut before administering the codeine, we found
that it did not become so much paralysed                   as   the other     which was
left intact
     A  dose of 2 centigrms.       and upwards was fatal in most cases.
     Rabbit*.  — The action       on rabbits is essentially          similar to what we
have seen      in frogs.       The narcosis     is slight, the animal can easily
 be aroused,     and when the dose is increased, this, instead of deepen
ing the narcosis, causes a condition of increased                    reflex  excitability.
 The    animal      in consequence        gives    frequent starts,        or may      have
 tetanus.      As a result of the continual disturbance,                    the    narcosis
 becomes     distinctly lighter, although it does not wholly disappear.
     The most      typical effects can be got by giving the alkaloid in
 divided doses.
     A careful comparison          of the results       of previous        experimenters
 shows    that the minimum lethal dose varies from 0'06 to OT grm.
 in rabbits.       When such large doses          are  given at once, the narcotic
 stage is   very   ill  defined or entirely absent, the tetanus              supervening
  almost   at once.
     The effects     of small doses     are seen    in the accompanying          Table.

    From the foregoing it is evident,          as  Schroeder    and others     have
 previously pointed out, that the action of codeine              is qualitatively
 very similar     to that of morphine.          Its tetanising action      and    its
 action on motor nerves are very much greater, while its toxic effect
 is at least about three times larger.         On the other hand, its      narcotic
 power is about     four times less than that of morphine (in rabbits).
 In   man the narcotic effect is probably even much more diminished,
 but exact experiments       are wanting to determine        the extent.
     Ethyl 'morphine (Codethyline         of Grimaux and Bochefontaine).
     This  compound     is the analogue of codeine, being the ethyl           ether
 of morphine, whereas         codeine   is the   methyl ether.     "We   prepared
 the base by treating together         morphine,    soda, and ethyl iodide, in
  molecular    proportions in alcoholic solution.         The base was further
  separated and purified in substantially the same way as described
 under methocodeine.           The hydrochloride was found           to be very
 soluble    in water, which fact interfered with its purification              from
  that   menstruum.       From     the hydrochloride,     which    had    been    re-
  crystallised both from water and from alcohol, the chloroplatinate
  was prepared.
     (a) '433 grm. (dry in water-bath)           gave on ignition     -0822     grm.
  Platinum = 18-98 per cent.

     The alkaloid itself was prepared from the solution of its muriate
  by precipitation with ammonia,          and  recrystallisation from      alcohol ;
  by which process it is obtained          in well-defined prismatic       crystals.
  In  the air-bath the crystals fused at, or near, 190° C.
                   Physiological Action of Ethylmorphine.
     The only observations       on the pharmacology       of this substance      are
  contained     in a short      paper   by Bochefontaine, who obtained              it
  from Grimaux.        He found that in frogs doses of 0007               to 0012
  grm.   caused violent     tetanic   convulsions like those of       strychnine.
  Babbits died after 0-11 grm. subcutaneously,            the   symptoms      being
 again violent tetanus.        He considers     that its action is the     counter
  part of the strychnine action.

  ifS9-£xi]       Mr Dott and        Dr Stockman         on Morphine.                  339
      Our experiments,         while confirming those          of Bochefontaine           as
 regards the effect       of large doses, have led us to the conclusion               that
 ethylmorphine         has     an   action     identical    with    that    of    codeine
(methylmorphine),           and that   if   the dose be properly chosen one can
easily distinguish        in animals     a narcotic     and   a tetanic   stage,   just  as
with     the   other members          of the group.       Bochefontaine used            too
large    doses,    thereby      completely     masking     the    narcotic effect.       It
seems    to be   indifferent, therefore, whether a molecule              of methyl or
ethyl    be  introduced so long           as  they   replace    the same     H   atom in
morphine.
    In  our experiments         we used the hydrochlorate of ethylmorphine,
which is quite       soluble in water.
    Frog*. — With       doses of 0-005     - 0*025 grm. the narcotic stage is well
marked ; the       animal becomes lethargic, the reflexes are diminished,
movements are         not    so  active, respiration is less frequent,          and    the.
pupils diminish       in size.     With    the smaller doses this is followed by
an increase      in reflexes, with the larger by tetanus.                 As   the dose
increases the      narcotic stage gets shorter          and less pronounced,          and
the   tetanus     supervenes      more rapidly.        Exhaustion      follows just      as
with codeine.         The convulsions are spinal, and occur or continue
after division      of the spinal cord at the atlanto-occipital membrane.
    The pupil     is small during the first stage, but dilates             as the reflex
excitability increases.
    During the poisoning the motor nerves gradually become impaired
in  excitability.       To avoid repetition we may simply state that they
are affected    just   as  with codeine.
    With doses of O'Ol         - 0'015 grm.      the heart is considerably slowed,
and the    strength of the beats lessened.
    Direct injection of a solution into the aorta (O'Ol grm.) brought
on tetanus     at once without previous           depression.
    The minimum        lethal dose for     a frog is generally    about   2  eentigrms.,
 although smaller        doses sometimes         prove   fatal,   probably from ex
 haustion after the tetanus.
    The   following experiment shows its action              : —
    Expt, 8.— Frog, 24 grms.

     3.18.  — Pupil still smaller ;          more sluggish     ;  jumps very heavily ;
 placed on back, struggles             but cannot recover its position.               Reflexes
 are much      diminished       ;  only responds slightly to pinching             toe.
     3.25. — Lies on       back without struggling, otherwise about                   same.
     3.45. — Reflexes       increased.       Frog is having almost continuously
 slight tetanic jerks.            Pupils   are very dilated.          Position is      that of
 a frog poisoned        with strychnine.
     4.5.- — The     slightest     touch   causes one tetanic         spasm, leaving        the
 frog much exhausted.
     4.50.  — Same, but        becoming more exhausted.
     The duration and onset of the two stages vary a good deal even
 with the same dose, this being doubtless due to differences in the
 rate of absorption        of the poison.
     Rat/hitx.  — Hero      also the      action    is similar    to     that of     codeine.
 \N hen     small     doses    are    given the animal           becomes      drowsy       and
 lethargic    or sleeps quietly, respiration is slowed, while the heart and
 pupil are but slightly affected.              It  can always be easily roused.
     When larger doses are administered                there is considerable       narcosis,
 intermingled after         a short     time    with increased reflexes, which            may
 proceed to clonic and tonic convulsions.                    During       these the pupil
 dilates.
     When      a  lethal dose is given the animal quickly dies in                    tetanus,
just     as  with strychnine.           About 0T grm. is the minimum                    lethal
dose for medium-sized               rabbits.     The following        experiment,        along
 with the subjoined Table, gives              a  tolerably correct idea of its        general
action     :—

of methyl- or ethylmorphine,           it is unnecessary       to go into further
details.
                                  Acetylmorphine.
    The acetyl       derivatives of morphine were first investigated                 by
"Wright         In our first   experiments     we prepared acetylmorphine by
the    action    of boiling glacial    acetic    acid   on morphine for several
hours, but we found on analysis            of the substance      prepared     in   that
way that        it evidently contained       morphine.       Better    results    were
obtained      by heating     together   at 100° C. equivalent proportions             of
anhydrous morphine and acetic anhydride.                   After reacting      for an
hour, water was added, and ammonia              in slight excess.     The mixture
was    then shaken        up with ether,      in order     to remove     the acetyl
morphine,       and the ethereal solution agitated with hydrochloric acid,
which caused the acetylmorphine to separate               as hydrochloride.       This
salt is rather sparingly soluble in water.             The chloroplatinate       dried

 to that of codeine, but they do not show what relationship qualita

other members of the morphine group.

the two stages, although neither the narcotic               nor the tetanic condi
tion     is very pronounced.         With 0'015-0-025        grin, there is marked
lethargy and depression         of reflexes, followed in a very short time by
violent tetanic spasms.          The larger the dose the more rapidly does
 tetanus ensue.

    Rabbit*. — In rabbits the narcotic action                   is developed          after the
very small        dose of one milligrm.            The stupor is by no            means        pro
 found, but the animal remains                drowsy for some hours             ;  the pupils
 are small,     and the respirations       are diminished in frequency.                    When
 the dose is gradually increased there occurs                 marked     narcotism,          with
great weakness in the limbs, and remarkable slowing of the respiration.
The respiration may be              so   much       slowed     that   the    blood         is not
 properly aerated and dyspnoea results.                  When the dose is            increased
 to   0T5-0-25         grm.   the    narcotic stage         is much        shortened,           the
 increase of reflex excitability comes on more quickly, and proceeds
 to clonic or touic          spasms     and     death.     The heart        becomes very
 feeble towards the end.
    Just    as  with other members of the morphine group, the                      narcotised
 condition of the brain does not wholly pass off during the                               tetanic
 stage,   although it     seems    to be a good deal lessened, probably by the
 constant      irritation and state of disquietude in which the animal                             is
 kept by the spasms.
    Dogs.    — In    a spaniel  weighing      13   kilogrms.,    1  milligrm.     subcutane-
 ously caused slight drowsiness            ;  larger doses     (1-4   centigrms.),           while
 having     a more      marked     narcotic     effect, had a distinct         tendency           to
 cause nausea and looseness of the bowels.

    Pud-mortem.      — Appearances of asphyxia.
    In acetylmorphine            the same hydrogen             atom of morphine has been
replaced as     in methyl-            or ethylmorphine,            but by an acid radical
(acetyl) instead     of an alkyl radical.                  Its action is much        nearer   to
that   of codeine than to that of morphine.
    Compared     with morphine, its power of causing                         tetanus   is much
increased,    while its narcotic effects, although visible after smaller
doses, are    not nearly          so   deep.        As   soon as we increased         the dose
for   the purpose       of deepening the narcosis, the increase of reflexes
was    developed and disturbed the narcotic effect.                           The depressant
action which      it exerts on respiration is much greater than that of
morphine.
    Compared      with        codeine,        an equal      narcotic effect is induced in
rabbits by about one-tenth                  of the dose, while about             a three  times
 larger  dose is necessary            to cause tetanus.            Qualitatively, therefore,

we find that acetylmorphine closely resembles the other members of
the group, differing chiefly quantitatively and in some slight matters
of detail, — that is to say, it acts on the same systems and                 organs
of the body, and affects them in         a  similar manner.

    Pierce also made         a few experiments           on dogs with this alkaloid,
and obtained       much the        same results     as  with acetylmorphine.
    Our experiments          were made on frogs, rabbits, and dogs with                 a
solution of    diacetylmorphine in acetic acid and water.
    We found      its action to be exactly similar to that of acetylmor
phine, and      hence a detailed         account     is superfluous.      It seems to us
to be   slightly more active, both as a narcotising and totanising agent,
but otherwise there is no difference.                 The lethal dose is about the
wine, and the same very remarkable                   slowing of the respiration was
 observable.

    This body        was    originally     prepared      by the      action   of benzoyl
chloride on morphine.              The process has the disadvantage               in that,
if  an excess of alkaloid be used, there is apt to be a very small yield
of the desired product, while, on the other hand,                  if excess of benzoyl
chloride be employed,            there    is sure to be formation of a certain
amount of dibenzoylmorphine.                   It  occurred    to us that the method
 which succeeded          with alkyl chlorides might also bo applied with
 chlorides of acid radicals.           Accordingly 30 grms. of morphine wero
 dissolved      in alcohol with       4 grms.     of caustic soda, and        14 grms.    of
 benzoyl chloride added.             The mixture was allowed to stand in the
 cold for twelve hours,        then heated to boiling and evaporated.               Water
 and a    little sodium carbonate were added to the residue, the mixture
 shaken      up with     chloroform, filtered, and the chloroform separated
 and evaporated.           The residue      so   obtained was purified by crystal
 lisation from hot alcohol.            From the product          a  chloroplatinate was
 prepared      and dried at 130°.           Of this     '373 grm. gave        -0G05 grm.

  crystallisation      even   after several       days.     From these results         it is
  evident    that the above method              of double decomposition proceeds
  with benzoyl chloride as          it does with methyl chloride.
                    Physiological Action of Bemoylmorphine.
     The physiological action of this substance has not been previously
  investigated.       After   a few experiments            it  becamo     evident     to us
  that the action       is practically identical with that of acetylmorphine.

   Filehue has stated that benzoylmorphine is                                 a   local ana;sthetie,
but after      a    number of             experiments     on ourselves                and on animals
we are unable to confirm his results.
   Benzoyl, like acetyl, is an acid radical, and our results seem to show
that it is of little consequence as regards action which of them is intro
duced, so long as they replace the same hydrogen                              atom        in   morphine.

     It  was attempted          to further    purify    the compound by treating
with alkali,        washing the       precipitate,    and dissolving       the   same in
alcohol.       Crystals formed         very slowly, were rather dark in colour,
and     gave    a   platinum salt, which yielded only               13"5    per cent,   of
metal      on ignition       ;  whence     it is probable        that the      dibenzoyl
¦lerivative      is somewhat        prone    to   decomposition,     and is therefore
not a very       satisfactory compound          to work with.
                   Physiological     Action of Dihenzoijlmorphine.
    So   far as we could judge, the action of this substance given by
the stomach resembles             the action of benzoylmorphine.              It  was im
possible     to cany out exact observations,              as the   attempt to form a
soluble salt of dibenzoylmorphine                 by adding acid resulted          in the
compound being broken up and benzoic acid precipitated.
           Methylmorphium Chloride (Morphine Metlwchloride).
     When      methylchloride is brought in contact                with morphine in
 solution,     preferably      under   pressure, direct combination of the two
 compounds         takes place.       If  morphine methochloride were a com
 pound      strictly    analogous      to morphine       hydrochloride,       wo   should
 expect     that     the   former would yield, on treatment                with    potash,
 potassium       chloride, methyl alcohol, and morphine.                As   a matter   of
 fact, however,        we obtain potassium          chloride and methylmorphium
 hydroxide (morphine methohydroxide), no precipitate                        of morphine
 }*ing     obtained      under any circumstances.             When      a morphine or
 methylmorphine           salt is heated      in  a sealed tube with hydrochloric
 acid, apomorphine           is the chief product of the reaction.           On heating
 mtthylmorphium            chloride in the same manner, wo have found that
  no apomorphine         is formed.       The compounds        formed by the union
  of an   alkaloid with an alkyl haloid were described by Crum Brown
  and Fraser as      methylmorphium iodide, ethyl strychnium chloride, &c,
  to  indicate that these are analogous to the corresponding                  ammonium
  compounds,        the alkaloids from which they are derived being analo
  gous    to ammonia.           The     compounds      in   question     are   now more
  usually    described      as morphine methiodide, strychnine ethochloride.
  &c., these names        being considered        more systematic      from a chemical
  point of view, but the nomenclature                adopted    by Crum Brown and
  Fraser    is   probably the better, from a pharmacological                  standpoint,

  A  curious    error has crept into several text-books referring to these
 additive compounds           of alkaloids, an error          which amounts         to   a
 misrepresentation        of the investigation of Crum Brown and Fraser.
  In  these books       the compounds       are referred     to as substitution com
 pounds,    in which hydrogen has been replaced by an alcohol radical,
 whereas     they are addition compounds.                  Stolnikow,    in his   paper
 on morphine, and           Boehm     (Herzgifte,     p. 3),  have made this same
 mistake.
     The methylmorphium chloride employed in our experiments                         was
 prepared     as   follows.    Morphine      was     dissolved in hot methylated
 spirit with    a  proportion of soda, and gaseous methyl chloride               passed
 into the solution.        The alcohol was then evaporated, and the            codeine
 extracted     by means of chloroform           ;  after   which    the solution was
 neutralised      with hydrochloric acid, and            faint excess of ammonia
 added.      By this process the morphine was separated, and on                  evapo
 rating the mother-liquor, methylmorphium chloride crystallised                     out.
 The salt was purified by several crystallisations                  from water,      and
 was obtained        in colourless, well-defined       prisms.     The solution    gave
 no precipitate       witli  ammonia      or sodium       carbonate,   and   otherwise
 behaved like a methylmorphium salt.
    The salt lost weight by exposure              in the water-bath,       but even    at
 1 20' C. was not completely           dried.      On raising the temperature          to

  The only previous investigation into the action                                   of this body is
that of         Crum Brown and Fraser.                        Our results       confirm        theirs    in
some respects,              but differ materially in others, and hence it may                    be     well
to give a summary                   of their experiments.             They used the iodide and
sjlphate of methylmorphium, and performed                                   the following experi-
mi:nts     with them              : — 20    grains of the iodide were given subcutaneousiy
to a    rabbit, suspended            (but not dissolved) in 2 drachms water ; 30
grains were                given per os.  Dr Fraser took A and 1 grain. In no
case       was        any     visible        effect    produced.      The      iodide    is,    however,
owing       to        its insolubility,            an unsuitable salt for experiment,                   and
would dissolve so                  very slowly that its effects might              be inappreciable.
 Hence these observations                       may be left out of account.             To get rid of
this fallacy, they                 used the sulphate,         which    is   quite soluble.          Doses
 of   2,   3,    4,   5,    and    8   grains    gave marked        symptoms,       while      10 grains
 was    fatal to rabbits in 55 minutes,                     and 15 grains in        7   minutes.
      On frogs they performed                        four experiments.         One grain of iodide
 of   methylmorphium                    caused paralysis, followed by recovery              ;   2   grains,
 paralysis,       followed by death.                   Two experiments          made with        1    grain
 of    the sulphate               caused death,         preceded     by paralysis.          In neither
 case was        the duration of the symptoms                      observed.       Their conclusions
 are given            as    follows — " :       It    has been proved in       a   most satisfactory
 manner that sulphate                       of methylmorphium             possesses no convulsant
 action    ;     for neither in the experiments                    we have described            in detail,
 nor       in   any of the others                  we performed       with this substance,              was
 there     any trace of spasmodic action or of exaggeration                             of the retiex
 function.             It,     however,         undoubtedly         causes hypnotic symptoms,
 it    would therefore                  seem that sulphate           of methylmorphium               agrees
 with morphia                in    possessing      a   hypnotic action, but differs from              it   in
 producing             paralysis and in being free from all convulsant action."
 They hold                 that the         most      prominent action         of methylmorphium
 consists        in paralysis of the terminations of motor nerves, and that
 this      is   the cause         of the general paralysis.

      Our results      agree with        theirs    as   regards     the    fact that methyl-
  morphium retains the narcotic action of morphine,                           but we find      that
  it  also retains    the tetanising action             to a very marked           degree.       As
  Crum Brown and Fraser point out, the action on motor nerves is                                   a
  markedly paralysing one, but,               as we      shall show, this obscured              the
  tetanus     and led them           to incomplete        conclusions.         The four      frogs
  on which they experimented                received too large doses,            and were not
  observed for a sufficient           length of tiino to show the proper develop
  ment of the action of methylmorphium.
      Our experiments were made on frogs and rabbits with the chloride
  of methylmorphium, which is a very soluble salt.
      Frogs.  — "When     a small dose of          5    milligrros., or       a larger   dose, is
 given subcutaneously             to a frog,     the symptoms           are very      much     the
 same in all cases.         The animal speedily              passes    into    a more     or  less
 flaccid condition, and remains so for a length of time varying with
  the size of the dose.
      On examining moro particularly into the causes of this paralysis,
 and into what parts of the nervous                     system      are affected, we found
 that     these depended         greatly     on the amount            of methylmorphium
 administered.         When       a small     or medium         dose is given, the brain
 and     spinal   cord   are depressed          in very much the same way               as by a
 small dose of morphine,              while the motor nerves are left practically
 unaffected.        The depression          is followed by slight increase of the
 rellex excitability.
     This is shown in the two following experiments                         : —
     Expt.    16. — Frog,     31 grms.         R.,  22   in 10 seconds.

equally excitable at 100 mm.
    Next day. — Has recovered greatly            ;  active   and lively    ;  slight in
crease    in reflex excitability.         Both sciatic nerves are equally excit
able.
    From these experiments          it  is evident     that  the brain and        spinal
cord are much        depressed      in activity, the motor nerves being left
intact, or   nearly   so.    The paralysis and narcosis are duo entirely to
the action on the nerve centres.
    After larger doses deep narcosis quickly supervenes,                  with greatly
diminished reflexes, indifference          to painful     stimuli, and contraction
of pupils.      Much later, complete paralysis            or marked depression          of
the motor nerve        termination comes on, but              as   soon   as   this has
pissed off the reflex      excitability is    seen   to be greatly increased.
    These results are     shown in the following experiment: —
    Expt. 18. — Frog, 24 grms.
    12.3.  — 0'01 methylmorphium chloride subcutaneously.
    12.10.  — Lying quite flaccid ; both pupils small ; reflexes greatly
diminished.       When pinched crawls away.
    12.15.  —  Makes very slight response to severe pinching.                       Both
sciatic nerves    quite excitable at 120 mm.
    12.45.  — Faint twitch of        muscles    when sciatic       nerves    are  stimu
 lated.
    1.20. — Sciatic nerves      inexcitable to strongest current.
    Next    day. — Reflexes       are   slightly increased.         Frog active      and
lively.
    Third day. — Reflex excitability is now markedly exaggerated.
    In  another experiment          in which     the same dose was given              the
 motor nerves were        never    completely      paralysed,    although much de
 pressed in electric    excitability.

    When 0'02 grm. and upwards                   is given,  there is marked            depres

 motor    nerves    begin      to be impaired, and finally their excitability is
 entirely abolished.          With     the smaller      of these doses the paralysis
of motor nerves passes off next day, and the frog is found to                             be in
 a condition of greatly increased              reflex   excitability, but       if the     dose
 be 3 centigrammes          or upwards it generally dies before the paralysis
 has passed off.

    Third day. — Found           dead.
     When the alkaloid is given subcutaneously                  the reflex excitability
is never      so  much      increased      as  to amount      to tetanus,       the    reason
 being that doses large enough to cause tetanus                  kill the animal before
 the   paralysis     of motor nerves has passed                off.    If,    however,      the
 motor nerves be protected, and the methylmorphium be then injected
 into the aorta      so   as   to reach the spinal cord at once, we get im
 mediate violent tetanus, just as we have seen                  with morphine itself,
or with codeine        and other       morphine derivatives.            This proves        con
clusively that methylmorphium still retains                    the convulsant action
which is simply masked by its paralysing action                       on motor nerves.
The following experiment              may serve as an example            : —
    Expt.     20. — Frog      decapitated     ;    body ligatured, except             lumbar
nerves    ;  right aorta tied     ;  cannula in left aorta.
    1 1.10. — O   O.'i grm. in     1  cub. cent, water injected         into left     aorta.
    At  once there       was rigid tetanus,          which lasted till 11.21,            when
it  became somewhat           relaxed.
    11.25. — Each stimulation causes one tetanic spasm.
    11.34. — Response much feebler to stimulation.
    12.0.  — A faint twitch          on stimulation.         The lumbar nerves              are
still quite excitable         to electric     stimulation, hence the             exhaustion
must be due to paralysis            of the spinal cord.
    Two centigrammes            administered        in the same way gave              similar
results, but small doses such             as   5   milligrammes caused           depression

      RaJihit*.  — On rabbits methylmorphium                      chloride      has the same
  action   as  on frogs, but owing to their higher organisation the details
  cannot    be  worked out in the same complete                     manner.       When     2h   to
  5 centigrammes         are given subcutaneously drowsiness and narcotism
 ensue,    apparently without            any paralysis          of motor nerves.           With
 larger doses      there is marked narcotism,           probably some depression                of
 motor nerves,          and a tendency to increased                  reflex   which is never
 very   pronounced.           Probably it is obscured by the depression                   of the
 motor nerves.           As    soon, however,       as the dose is large             enough     to
paralyse the        motor nerves death occurs rapidly from asphyxia.

     From the foregoing experiments               it is obvious that the addition of
a molecule       of methylchloride to morphine does not alter its physio
 logical action       so   profoundly       as  has been stated.         The paralysing
action on motor          nerves     is considerably increased          and the narcotic
action is lessened, but qualitatively its effects on the animal organism
 remain similar to those of morphine.
     Looking at the matter from              a chemical   point of view, this is what
 one would expect.             Here, just as in the case of methylmorphine               or
acetylmorphine,          etc.,   we    have    not made       any    profound   chemical
 change iu the intimate structure                of the morphine molecule.             We
 have simply added on a radical                to one of its outlying        groups, and
although the addition has altered the quantitative                         action it   has
left untouched         the qualitative.

It   is not very soluble        in water, and was decomposed by treatment
with sulphate of silver, when iodide of silver was thrown down, and
the easily soluble          sulphate of methylcodeium was left in solution.
After purification and several recrystallisations it was obtained                       in
the form of large colourless           crystals.     It  is an addition compound,
the sulphate of methyl being simply added on to codeine.

    The only experiments              which have been previously made with
thi3 substance are those             of Crum Brown and Eraser who worked
with the iodide and the sulphate.                    With     the iodide of methyl
codeium         (a tolerably soluble salt) they saw no symptoms                         in
rabbits after 5 grains subcutaneous!)', while 10 and 15 grs. caused
some      degree    of paralysis,    followed by recovery in          a few hours,    and
 20    grs.   was fatal in        13  minutes.      With     the   sulphate,   4 grains
 subcutaneously had           no effect, while 8 grs. caused some degree of
 paralysis,     and 10 grs. deatli in 19 minutes.
    On frogs four experiments             were performed        : two of these with
 2   and     2|    grs.   iodide of methyl-codoium            and    two with      1   gr.
 sulphate.        In all   the result was death, preceded by paralysis.              The
 paralysis     commenced in from 11 to 21 minutes               after administration,
 and    in no     case   was the duration of the symptoms               or the time of
 death observed.           They sum up thus        :
                                                      " We learn from our experi
 ments that the        iodide and sulphate of methyl codeium have                a   very
 different     action    from    codeia.   We have         never   observed   any hyp
 notic effect     follow their administration, and, in place of convulsions,
 we    have     seen that they produce           paralysis.     This, indeed,    is the
 only marked         symptom      that follows their administration, and it is
 apparent     that it does not depend         on an effect on the muscles             nor
 on the     cerebral lobes."       They conclude that it is due to an action on
 the   terminations      of motor nerves.
    These      conclusions,      however,   as   we     shall presently      show,    are
 drawn from        experiments       made with     very large doses, doses which
 (especially     in frogs) were much too large to show clearly any effects
 except those       resulting from paralysis of motor nerves.              Our experi
 ments with        sulphate of methyl-codeium have shown us that the
 addition     of methyl sulphate to codeine does not alter the action of

the latter so materially          as    one would expect           from the description
of Crum Brown and Eraser.
    Codeine, as we have already seen, besides acting on the                       brain    and
spinal cord, exercises      a considerable        depressant power on motor nerves.
In   the case of methyl-codeium              sulphate the depressant action on the
spinal cord and motor nerves is much more marked and occurs with
smaller    doses,   while that on the cerebrum is lessened.                     Increase of
reflexes    also   occurs     after     methyl-codeium           sulphate.     With     small
 doses this increase is seen only after about 24                    hours in frogs, while
 with larger doses it is obscured or wholly masked by the paralysis
 of motor      nerves.      If  the motor        nerves be protected,          however,     by
 tying the blood-vessels           of     a   part,    and     the   alkaloid    be thrown
 directly into the circulation           so   as to reach the        spinal cord at       once
 in largo amount, then           we immediately             get marked     tetanus,   just   as
 with other members of the morphine group.
    We now give an account of our experiments                          from which       these
 conclusions     have been drawn.

 motor nerves      are   unaffected,       and next day the reflexes are slightly
 increased.      Sometimes       the increase of reflexes lasts two days.

amounts to tetanus.

   The amount required               to paralyse motor                nerves is therefore very
 large,   the paralysis soon passes off, and as soon as it has done so
 the increase      of reflexes can        be, and        is,   manifested.

      Small doses, or largo doses given subcutaneously, always depress
  the cord       as  the    first stage of their action.           If, however, methyl-
  codeium        sulphate in sufficient dose (2 centigrammes) be injected
 directly into the aorta (after protecting the motor nerves) we get
 tetanus at once without any preliminary depression                        of reflexes.
      Five    centigrammes          is the    usual   lethal dose for     a frog.     This    is
  larger than the lethal dose of codeine, but smaller amounts of it
 than of codeine produce physiological action.                        It  may therefore be
 regarded        as  much more            powerful     than codeine      (in frogs).       The
 reason of its lethal dose being so               large probably is that the paralysis
 of the motor nerves prevents the tetanic                      spasms, and thus protects
 the frog from the exhaustion consequent                      on convulsions.
     Babbits. — Crum             Brown and Fraser found that methyl-codeium
 sulphate had no hypnotic effect on rabbits.                         This   is    hardly    the
 case,   however,      although it is diminished to             a very great extent.
     Thus the large dose of              1 decigramme       had almost no action of any
 kind     beyond     causing       slight quietude.
     When 0'2 grm. is given the narcotic action is well marked, and
 is    accompanied        by     a    certain degree of increased           reflex.    There
 seenied      to be also some            depression      of the    motor nerves       which
 obscured       the symptoms rather.

The crystals       were pressed,   and purified by recrystallisation             from
water and from alcohol.          So obtained, the salt was nearly free from
colour, and       when    examined under       the    microscope       the   crystals
appeared to be all of the same form.

 molecule      of water, although dried at 120°,    a  portion of the compouud
 was exposed        in the air-bath at gradually increasing temperatures,
 but there was no distinct loss of weight             till  1 60°  was reached,      at
 which temperature         there  was also distinct       evidence     of decompo

     The alkaloid itself was obtained by dissolving the hydrochloride
 in water, and adding slight excess of ammonia.                 A viscous     precipi
 tate     separated,   but after standing      some      hours, with       occasional
 stirring, it became      a mass  of small prismatic crystals.           These    were
 washed       with cold water and dried in the air.               The air-dry     sub

   ened in    colour, yet the loss       of weight was only            a   fraction of a per
   cent., whence     it is almost certain that           the   alkaloid        is precipitated
  in the  anhydrous       state.
      It will be observed that the chloroplatinate and the hydrochloride
  appear   obstinately     to retain water in the proportion                 of one molecule
  to two   molecules      of alkaloid     ;  so   that, so far     as    our results go, the
  alkaloid    may    have the composition             C^H^NjCL.               If   that be the
  case, the   equation above        noted should be —
         2CI,H,1N03.CH31           +  2KHO       =  C^H^NjO,          +   2K1     +  ILO.
     Whether the water is merely combined as hydrate, or has become
 a  constituent      part of the molecule of the base, is                   a  point we have
 not    had   opportunity of absolutely determining                    ;   but the pharma
 cological    results are more in harmony              with   the latter theory.

     The chemical         change      represented       in methocodeine              completely
alters the     action characteristic of the            morphine group — so much                 so,
indeed,      that points of similarity              are   hard to find.            The     distin
guishing features          of morphine-poisoning             are   wholly        absent   ; there
is no narcosis        and no tetanus.            The symptoms are due chiefly to
poisoning of the muscles,              and, to a less extent, depression of the
spinal cord.
     In our experiments we used the hydrochlonite,                            or the alkaloid
dissolved in acetic acid and water.
     Frnijg. — A dose of 5 milligrammes usually had very                           little action.
The animal         became     rather less active, but           as   a    rule little further
change was observable.
     When       1   centigramme        was      given,    however,         the frog        shortly
became       sluggish, there was            depression of       reflex       excitability      and
poisoning of the voluntary               muscles.        The muscles at the place                 of
 injection were         first   affected,    their    electric    excitability          gradually
 becoming        diminished      until it completely disappeared.                      This   con
dition slowly spread to all the other voluntary muscles.                                A similar
 mode     of action on voluntary muscle                has been       observed        in the   case
 of caffeine,     benzoylecgonine, and           a  number of other alkaloids.
     The following         experiment        shows the usual course of poisoning

still excitable, for, when stimulated,                          the   muscles which     are not     in

      Rabbits.       — On rabbits           no narcosis           was ever observed             and no trace
of increased              reflex.      The alkaloid           seems to act chiefly as a muscle-
poison, and to produce death                          by gradually          poisoning the muscles.
At    the same time the cord is somewhat                              depressed.              After     5    centi
grammes the animal showed no symptoms except slight quietude.
     When        3—5 decigrammes                were given to small rabbits death occurred
after a longer or shorter period from paralysis of muscles of respirat ion.
If   the alkaloid be injected at both sides of the thorax the respiratory
nmscles are quickly paralysed                         and death soon occurs, but if injected
into the         thighs, for instance,                death       is considerably delayed.                     The
muscles          in    the       neighbourhood of the injection first pass into                                     a
condition         of rigor mortis, which gradually spreads to other voluntary
muscles.          The urine was always of                          a deep     emerald-green              colour,
owing, no             doubt, to some green-coloured                        product from dimethyl-
morphine being formed                      in   the body and excreted by the kidneys.
     Apomorphine, as is well known, also tends                                  to decompose                into    a
ffreen-coloured             substance,          and    is also in      a    very marked degree                      a
muscle-poison.                   Methocodeine,            however, has not an emetic                     action.
Even large             doses        had    no    effect     on dogs beyond              restlessness          and
anxiety.          Harnack            has    pointed         out    that apomorphine, although
used      entirely          in      medicine for its emetic                action,      is essentially a
muscle-poison, and that the emesis produced                                 by it       is,   as   it   were, an
accidental           circumstance.              Its chemical formula            is
                                                                                   C17H17N02 (that
is,   morphine            minus H20), but the change                       is   probably much more
profound than the removal of                          a   molecule    of water      ;   and there            is,   no
doubt,      to   some extent a rearrangement                         of the morphine molecule.
Methocodeine               probably resembles               it    in chemical constitution, just
as   it   does   in pharmacological action.
                                      Morphine-Sulphuric              Acid.
      We have so named this compound, as                             it    appears to be morphine
in    which      a    hydrogen atom              is   replaced      by the radical HSO:j.                     It   is
described            by     Stolnikow           as    Morphin-dtherschice/ehciure, and                             we
exactly       followed his directions in its preparation.                                 20 gnus,           mor
phine and         8    grms.         caustic     potash were         dissolved in 25 c.c. water,
and to the            solution was added                  gradually    15 grms.           finely powered
 pyrosulphate of potash.                        After      12 hours the solution was diluted

from hot water.              In two      successive experiments we obtained a very
small yield of material.                  However, it was sparingly soluble,                           did
not give the morphine colour-reactions, and gave                                   a   considerable
precipitate when             warmed       with barium chloride and hydrochloric
acid,    so that we have no doubt the substance                              was practically the

it contains,       and       contends       that when             the    H. of this          hydroxyl
is substituted              alkyl radical another physiologically active
                        by an
element    is    introduced into the molecule. But if a physiological!)'
inactive substance (such as he assumes HSO;j to be) be introduced,
then the action is very materially altered.
  He found in frogs that doses of                  5    milligrammes of his compound
were almost        inert,     but that after       3     to 5 times          this dose         tetanus
occurred    almost at once.               He ranks it among               the tetanising group
of opium         alkaloids.         From     his experiments Stolnikow                      concludes
that with the hydroxyl group (OH) in morphine is bound up —                                             (1)
its narcotic properties, its property of acting specially and chiefly
on the cerebrum          ;   (2) its poisonous         properties.
  Although our experiments confirm Stolnikow's to                              a   certain extent,
viz., that the activity of morphine                is   diminished by the substitution
of HSO.. for H., yet           it   is   not diminished to anything like the extent
which he states, nor           is   the hydroxyl group so important                    a   constituent
as he makes out.              The new body retains the morphine action—                                 a
narcotic and tetanic stage — perfectly, although its toxicity                                   is    less

                                   Chlorocodide.
    We first tried     to prepare this compound by the action                of    strong
hydrochloric acid on codeine, after the manner described by Wright-
The solution of the hydrochloride was precipitated in fractions, but
each of the fractions gave a chloroplatinate                indicating     a different
molecular weight        ; whence   it was concluded that the substance was
a   mixture,    a fact  which was confirmed       by the physiological            experi
ments.       We then tried the method           of Gerichten.         13 5 gnns. of
codeine     hydrate was dried at          120° and mixed with            10 grms.         of
pentachloride of phosphorus         ;  50 grms. of oxy chloride of phosphorus
 was then poured over the mixture, whereon               a violent action ensued.
 After some hours the clear solution was diluted, ammonia                         added,
 and the precipitate received       on a filter.    The precipitate      was washed,
 pressed, and dried by exposure          to the air  ;  then dissolved in chloro
 form, which was left to evaporate.           On adding alcohol to the          residue,
 it  became filled with crystals,      which were purified by pressure                and
 recrystallisation.       The   substance    so   obtained       yielded     a   chloro
 platinate,    which after drying in exsiccator           lost   no further weight
 at 100°.

                      Physiological Action of Chlorocodide.
     Gee    has    previously    made    a  few experiments with             this sub
 stance.     He gave       9J-  grains   in  divided     doses     to  a   cat,    which
 ultimately died in convulsions, the chief symptoms being                   salivation,
 dilatation of the pupils, restlessness, and           a mixture of tetanus           ami
 paralysis.      Consciousness     was    unaffected.     In    Gee's    opinion,      the
  action is exactly like that of codeine.              A   dose of    \  grain per      os,
  and subcutaneously in man, had no effect.
      For our experiments       we used a neutral solution in acetic acid             and
  water.

off, leaving    only tetanus.        The same thing has been noted              as  occur
ring with morphine.
    The following experiment            will  serve as an example         : —
    Erpt. 30.— Frog, 27 grms.
    1.50. — 0'005 chlorocodide subcutaneously.
    2.0. — Pupils      very small    ;  respiration ceased      ;  reflexes dull.     Lies
on back     if turned     over, struggles     if pinched.
    2.7. — Spinal       reflexes    now    a good      deal   increased     ; no corneal
reflexes.
    2.10.  — Least touch         causes   violent jerk, but frog lies quite ex
hausted and       flaccid after it.      Pupils   are mere slits.
    3.30— Same.
    5.30.  — Gives faint tetanic jerk when stimulated.
    Second day. — Reflexes greatly increased.
    Third day. — Greater increase reflexes.
    Fourth day. — In violent tetanus.
    When a larger dose, such as            1  centigramme,        was given, there was
 jreat depression       of the cord, so much        so  that only a faint indication
 of the   tendency to tetanus was observablo               in many       cases, although
 in others     it   was    well marked.         One centigramme           by the mouth
 caused    well-marked but not extreme             depression,     followed shortly by
 tetanus.
     Two centigrammes injected into the aorta                     produced tetanus       at
 once.
     The paralysing        effect of chlorocodide on motor nerves                is about
 equal    to that    of codeine;       15 milligrammes         injected into the iliac-
  artery   destroyed      the electric excitability        of the sciatic nerve in        a
  few minutes.
     So far the action of chlorocodide closely resembles that of codeine,
  but is more depressing to the spinal cord.                 In addition, however, it
  is a very     decided muscle-poison.             When Injected subcutaneously
  the   muscles     in the immediate neighbourhood                   very soon     become
  poisoned and        cease to respond       to electric stimuli, while         those at a
   distance seem to be        little affected.
      The heart also is very much depressed.
      In  frogs   1 centigramme sooner or later proves fatal.
      Rabbits.  — In rabbits        doses of    2-5    centigrammes        caused marked
   weakness in legs,         depression of the spinal cord, slow and weaker

 372           Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                         [ses?.
 action of the heart, and a great inclination to lie down.                      There     was
 no narcosis.
    When larger       doses, up to     1  decigramme,      are given, the depression
 of the spinal cord is extreme, hut there is also               a tendency to        tetanic
jerking.      The symptoms are exactly as               if   a spinal stimulant           and
depressant had been given together.
    When still larger          doses are given tetanus            of a very decided
character    is seen, hut towards the end of the poisoning becomes very
 feeble owing to the marked weakness of the whole muscular system.
    The following experiments             show the action of large doses          : —
    Expt. 31.— Rabbit, 1800 grnis.
    12.5  — 0-15 grin, chlorocodide subcutaneously.

depression.
    11.59.  — Lying      flaccid,    and    evidently    suffering      from     muscular
weakness.         Occasionally gives       a slight start.

    12.40.  — Has frequent clonus of head;                   the   rest   of body       less
affected.
    12.55.  — Tendency        to  spasm      much greater.          The jerkings         are
almost continuous.          Had one severe tetanic 6pasm with              opisthotonos.

body contract     very slightly to strong electric currents, and even this
feeble    amount of contraction disappeared            in about five minutes.
    Chlorocodide      therefore partakes       partly of the action of codeine
and    partly of the action of apomorphine.
                                Trickloromvrphide.
   There     do not appear to be any published results giving experi
ments on the action of phosphorus pentachloride or oxychloride                       on
morphine.        W hen     anhydrous      morphine       and phosphorus         penta
chloride are mixed and heated, there is evidently some action                    ;  but
we could     not obtain in this way any considerable            amount of material
other than morphine, or possibly one of the polymerised morphine
bodies described hy       Wright.       It was impossible to try any experi
ment     on a solution of morphine, as there is no known solvent for
that alkaloid     which is not at once attacked             by the pentachloride.
We therefore adopted the method              used by Gerichten          for the pre
paration     of chlorocodide.        13 grrus. anhydrous morphine and                17
grms.    phosphorus pentachloride were mixed, and several                    grins,  of
oxychloride     of phosphorus      poured over the mixture.            The mixture
was    left for some hours, with occasional              agitation, until solution
was complete.       It  was then diluted with water, and ammonia added.
The precipitate     so obtained was slightly washed,            dried, and treated
with     chloroform.     On     evaporation      the    chloroform     left   a    non
 crystalline residue, from which a platinum               salt was prepared          Of
 this compound        '091    grm.   gave   0T6     grm.    Pt. = 1 7-58    per  cent.
The portion of the precipitate undissolved by the chloroform                        was
treated    with boiling     alcohol,   which on evaporation left          a  partially
 crystalline coloured residue.        This yielded     a  chloroplatinate of which
 '1575 grm. gave      -0275 grm.     Pt = 17-45 per cent.

    It  would be too much to assume that that is certainly the com
 position   of the substance obtained,       as  it is quite conceivably a mix
 ture.    We anticipated that the two hydroxyls              would be replaced by
 chlorine   atoms,   but the chlorination         seems to have       gone further.
 As from the formation        of  methocodeine,       there appears to be in the
 morphine molecule       a non-hydroxyl       hydrogen atom which is more
 readily   replaced   than the others, it has possibly in the compound

as   of considerable           value, as they indicate the general                modification
in the action of morphine caused by the substitution of chlorine
for the hydroxyl groups.
                      Physiological Action of Trichloromorphide.
     Frogs. — Trichloromorphide               acts primarily on the central nervous
system, causing          depression        of the spinal cord, followed by tetanus.
It   has, however,        even in moderate doses, a marked paralysing                           effect
on motor        nerves, which tends to obscure the tetanus while                          it    lasts.
The paralysis           is,   however,     somewhat       slow in appearing,             and soon
wears off, usually leaving the animal in violent spasm.                             In   addition,
trichloromorphide has some slight action                     as   a   muscle-poison.
     The following experiments               show its action in all these respects: —
     Expt. 33. — Frog, 30 grms.
     12.8 — 0'005. grm. trichloromorphide                   subcutaneously.
     12.12.    — Reflexes slightly diminished.
     12.15.    — Reflexes very distinctly depressed, but frog still                        moving
about.
     12.20.    — Sluggish; lies           on back   ;   pupils smalL        Reflexes       slightly
increased.
     12.25.    — Slightest       touch causes violent start.
     12.30.    — Spontaneous             tetanus,       followed       by   great        flaccidity.

 artery, and      5   milligrms. be given, the protected nerve               is   not    paralysed
 while all the others            are.

    Rabbits. — In         rabbits 1-4 centigrammes             caused     slight  narcosis,
and     very      slight      tendency       to   increased      reflexes.     Respiration
diminished greatly in frequency, and the heart slightly.
    Doses      of from 8-25        centigrammes         caused      varying     degrees   of
increased reflex without            marked narcosis.           The larger the dose the
less   tendency there was to narcosis, but the more to paralysis of
motor nerves        with     consequent     paresis and depression.

  Rreat depression.
     7.0. — Increased reflex gone.
     8.0. — Still great depression.
     Next day was quite well.
     In this experiment, as in others with large doses, it was evident
  that the      partial paralysis of the motor nerves                  prevents    the  full
  manifestation of the tetanus,             and probably thereby prevents             death
  from convulsions.
     The action of trichloromorphide              resembles qualitatively that of the
  other morphine        derivatives    ;  its action on motor nerves is markedly
  paralysing,     and   it is in addition       a not very powerful muscle poison.

                   Nitrosomorphine.— C^Hls(NO)NOs.H20.
    This compound        was prepared     by E. L. Mayer by passing nitrous
fumes (prepared        by action of nitric acid on arsenious         acid) into a
solution of morphine.            The composition indicated is the same as
that of morphine nitrite, and there seems to be some little doubt
as to the    purity of the substance.
                   Physiological Action of Nitrosomorphine.
     Nitrosomorphine        is  a  very    insoluble   substance,   and we        had
difliculty in getting      a   proper solution for subcutaneous       injection in
frogs.      We therefore       gave  it by   the mouth iu substance.          When
0-015 grin, was so given, the animal gradually developed                a narcotic
condition, followed in due time by increase of reflexes and tetanus.
     In rabbits      4  or   5  centigrammes      subcutaneously caused         light
 narcosis,   lasting four or five hours.         We found it difficult      to give
 larger doses.
     These     experiments, although         not very satisfactory,    show      that
 nitrosomorphine has the same qualitative effect            as morphine.
         Physiological Action of       some other   Morjjhine Derivatives.
     C. R. A.     Wright     prepared    a   number of morphine derivatives
 which were examined by M. Foster and by R. Stocker.
     D(vrymorIjllia.--^C,:}iKyO,(Ci:U1.^0^.
     Deinjcodeia.    — C18H.,1,N02.
     With    these substances       Foster found that     5 centigrammes     causeil
 in cats excitement, while           1  decigramme      caused   convulsions      anil
 excitement.
     Bromotetramorphia.        — C(i8H-rI5rN4012     (4 molecules    of  morphine
 coalesced together       and one H. replaced      by Br.).
      Bromotetracodeia. — CT.,H8,BrN4012.
      Chlorotetraro,leia.—C7Jl^C\y:iOl2.
      These all acted in same way.           The hydrochlorates were      used.
      In  cats   1  decigramme     caused excitement      and symptoms       similar
  to   morphine.       Iu  rabbits the      same   amount caused       only    slight
  excitement.
      Stocker     experimented      with    dicodeia (2    molecules    of  codeine

 1SS9-90.]        Mr Dott and Dr Stockman                on Morphine.                   377
coalesced       together), trieodeia and tetracodeia,             on    cats   and dogs.
These     all had a very similar action to codeine.
     The       substances         C6SHS1IN4010.4HI            from       codeine        and
CSjHSJIiN40jfl.4HI            from   codeine   and    morphine       in  doses of 1-3
decigrammes had           little effect beyond causing looseness of the bowels
in dogs.
     The experiments are not sufficient to enable us                to determine the
action    of these substances beyond saying that they have a generic
resemblance to morphine and codeine.
     Oiydimorphin.        — CS4H30N3Ori     (2   molecules      of morphine          minus
2H).       This is the oxymorphine (CirH19N04) of Schiitzenberger.
     According to Diedrich            this substance      has   no    narcotic      action.
It weakens         the heart and causes           diarrhiEa and vomiting.               The
emesis occurs         after subcutaneous      injection, and, according to I>ied-
 rich, is due     to an action on the medulla.           Its frequent intravenous
 administration         caused   changes   in   the gastric     mucosa,      hyperemia,
 swelling, and ulceration.           Probably,     therefore,    it  is excreted       from
 the blood      into the stomach        and bowel, and      by its local irritation
 acts as    an emetic and purgative reflexly through the vagus.
      Nothing is known         as to its constitution, but it is probably allied
  to apomorphine         more closely than to morphine.
      Marme      and Diedrich        express    the   opinion      that    morphine       is
  converted     into oxydimorphine in        the blood, and hence           its frequent
  nauseating     and purgative effects when given subcutaneously.                      It is
  more probable,        however, that the excretion of morphine into tho
  stomach     (Alt)   causes these symptoms independently of any chemical
   change.
                                        Summary.
      L   The methyl (codeine),        ethyl (codethyline), and amyl ethers of
   morphine     form a group of substances having exactly similar actions.
   In all  the same     hydrogen atom has been replaced in morphine by an
   alkyl radical    ;  they are therefore substitution derivatives.               It  seems
   to be a matter      of indifference which radical is introduced,             so  long as
   it replaces the same       hydrogen atom in morphine.            In all   the narcotic
   action of  morphine is much diminished, the tetanising action and the
   paralysing action on motor nerves are increased, while the lethal dose
   (on  account of the greater tendency to convulsions) is much smaller.

378              Proceedings of Rayal Society              of Edinburgh,                      [sebs.
  The action           is,   however, of essentially the same nature                     as the
morphine action        ;     the same parts of the central nervous                 system        are
affected, and in the same way as by morphine, but not                          in the         same
degree.
  This      is   what one would expect from chemical considerations,                             for
in making these substances no profound change has been                                  effected
in the morphine molecule, but simply an alkyl radical has been intro
duced into one of the outlying groups which compose it.
  II.     Acetyl-, diacetyl-, benzoyl-,              and dibenzoyl-morphine             form         a
group of substances               having exactly similar actions.              In them          one
or both of the hydroxyl hydrogens of morphine have been replaced
by an acid radical.
     Comparing them with morphine, their action                      is    the same    in kind
but differs in degree.              Their tetanising power          is   much greater, vrhile
their narcotic action, although visible after smaller doses,                    is   not nearly
so profound.            Increase of dose, instead          of deepening         the narcosis,
brings on tetanus.
     Comparing them               with    codeine,    they induce an equal             narcotic
elfect (rabbits) with about one-tenth                 of the dose, while        a   dose about
three times larger           is   necessary to induce tetanus.             Their     depressing
action on motor nerves              is   about the same.
     It   seems quite indiiferent which radical              is   introduced, and whether
one or both of the hydroxyl                  hydrogens are replaced.            Just    as    with
codeine and its analogues,                no great    change       has been     made     in    the
 morphine molecule,               but simply in the outlying hydroxyl groups.
     III. In      morphine-sulphuric acid and nitroso-morphine the                      radicals
 HSO., and        XO    replace the hydroxyl          hydrogen atoms, and the             action
is    modified much in the same way as by the introduction of                                other
acid radicals  (II.).
     IV. Chlorocodide             and Trichloromorphide           are chlorine derivatives       ;
in the former CI replaces the OH of codeine, while in the latter                              both
 hydroxyl groups, and in addition one                  II atom     of morphine, have          bceD
 replaced by       3   CI.
     They retain the characteristic               actions of morphine on the nervous
 system, but are in addition marked muscle poisons.
     V. In       metho-codeine        two methyl molecules have been                 introduced
 into morphine, one of which replaces                    a   hydroxyl        hydrogen        atom,
 while the other replaces an               H in   the body of the morphine molecule.

                 Mr Dott and Dr Stockman on Morphine.                            379
This completely        alters the character of the action,       as metho-codeine
has the    action   of  a muscle   poison (like apomorphine).
   "VI.   Methylniorphium        chloride and methylcodeium sulphate              are
addition products, formed by adding on methyl chloride and methyl
sulphate     respectively to the intact morphine or codeine molecule.
The action      is not profoundly altered by the chemical change.
   The paralysing action on motor nerves is considerably                  increased,
and the      narcotic action is lessened, but qualitatively the effects on
the animal      organism remain similar to those of morphine or codeine.
   The chemical       change made in the intimate structure           of the mor
phine     molecule    has not been profound         ;  there has been simply the
addition of a radical, and hence one would scarcely expect the action
to be much altered.
    VIL    Other morphine and codeine derivatives                which have been
examined       by other investigators       seem to retain essentially      the mor
phine action.
    W   ith regard to morphine, it seems certain that so long as
 the chemical         changes are restricted to what may be called
 die outlying groups of the molecule, very little alteration
 takes place in the physiological action.
    The      change     which    does     take place       does not depend        so
 much on the         substituting      body, as on      what part of the mole
 cule is    substituted.
    When a change is made in the kernel or groundwork of the
  molecule,     then the action is much more profoundly altered.

    We do not include in this list papers which are of purely toxi-
  eological   or therapeutical      interest.    Certain writers have already
  published    a considerable    portion of the morphine literature,          and as
  their papers     are easily   accessible    to scientific workers wo do not
  enumerate here the papers        which they mention.

 A New Method for Determining Phosphorus in Organic
       Phosphorus Compounds.                     By Prof. E. A. Letts               ami
       R. F. Blake, Esq., Queen's College, Belfast.
                                  Read  July 21,  1889.
    la   the phosphines and their derivatives, which we have inves
 tigated    from   time to     time,    considerable uncertainty       has    always
 attended     the determinations of phosphorus by the ordinary methods
 recommended        for the purpose.      In  fact, we never felt any confidence
in   the result, for no matter how carefully the             determinations were
made, duplicate analyses led to different numbers.
    The uncertainty depends           partly upon the difficulty of oxidising
the phosphorus in such compounds to phosphoric acid.                      For,    as a
rule,   in any dry combustion          process which     may be employed,       vola
tile oxidation products,         containing phosphorus, are formed of great
stability, which frequently pass over the red-hot               oxidising mixture
 almost unchanged.         Moreover, the glass of the tube is attacked by
 the oxidising      mixture, and this undoubtedly leads to inaccuracies,
probably of considerable          magnitude.
    If  any moid combustion process is resorted to, only a part of the
phosphorus is converted into phosphoric acid.                 A  more certain and
trustworthy process than any of those which are in general                  use was
therefore desirable,      and    in some of our investigations, where          every
thing depended upon         a correct    estimation of the phosphorus, it         was
essential.      It occurred to one of us that the difficulty in finding          such
a process     ought not to  be so great    after all, for by burning    a substance
 in the ordinary way with oxide of copper, the phosphorus ought                      to
 bo completely oxidised, and should be found at the end of the opera
tion   as phosphate     of copper, in which it could be estimated           without
 much difficulty by the molybdate method.                 In addition   to the sim
 plicity of such a method, it should also possess the great advantage of
 permitting the simultaneous determination of carbon and hydrogen.
    Our anticipations have been fully realised, and the new                 process,
based on the        above  principle, if     somewhat      tedious,  we believe     to
be accurate, of general application, and easily carried out.              We    shall
describe     it with   the necessary detail, and         then give some of        our
results obtained      with it.

1559-90.]       Prof. Letts and         Mr Blake     on Phosphorus.               38.')
    At the outset we experienced              some   difficulty in obtaining pure
oxide    of copper     ;   for any commercial        samples   we    examined, even
when     called   " pure " by the manufacturer,             were   invariably   found
to contain      phosphorus       or arsenic,    often in considerable       quantity.
We therefore       prepared it for ourselves, as        follows : —
     Commercial      sulphate of copper was dissolved in water, and the
solution saturated          with chlorine.      On evaporation and crystallisa
tion,    fairly pure       crystals were     obtained, but we preferred to re-
crystallise them once.            The cold saturated     solution of this salt was
then    electrolysed in       a large beaker or shallow        glass  dish, the elec
 trodes    being platinum        plates,  of the size generally used in the cell
 of a Grove's     battery.      The gas engine used to drive our dynamo was
 1J horse-power,         and with it we obtained about 100 grms.              of pure
 copper     in 7-8 hours.           The   copper was      then    dissolved   in pure
 nitric acid    in   a    platinum     dish, the solution      evaporated, and the
 residual nitrate of copper calcined at a             dull  red heat   with constant
 stirring.      The resulting oxide formed         a  black crystalline powder.
     In making       the    phosphorus determination,         a narrow tube about
  50 cm,     long and 7-8 mm. bore was employed, which was found                     ti >
  contain, when properly charged,            about 25 grms. of oxide of copper.
  It  was drawn out in the usual way, and sealed at the posterior end                   ;
  then charged        first with     about 5 cm. oxide of copper,          afterwards
  with about 10-15 cm. of the mixture of substance                    and oxide, and
  finally with the pure oxide, the whole being kept in its place by                     a
  plug of copper        gauze.      The combustion       was   then proceeded      with
  in the ordinary         manner, and       a current     of oxygon passed       at  its
   conclusion.
      When cold, the tube was removed                from the furnace, the plug of
   copper gauze hooked out, and the remainder of the contents shaken
   into   a beaker.      The tube     was then washed       two or three times with
   hot nitric    acid, to dissolve every trace of adhering oxide of copper.
   To   do this,   the broken (tail) end was sealed up again, the tube filled
   with nitric acid, and heated in front of an ordinary fire.                The nitric
    acid washings were added to the contents of the tube, which                     had
    been shaken into the beaker, and a further quantity of the same acid
    added — sufficient to dissolve the whole of the               oxide of copper, for
    which about 100 c.c. in all were usually required.                 Solution of the
     oxide was effected       by boiling.      When all had dissolved, about 200

placed   in a  bath with     a thermo-regulator at 50° C. for about twenty-
four hours.     The precipitate was then collected, and the phosphorus
converted in the usual way into pyrophosphate of magnesium.
   In our first   experiments       we aimed       only at determining the phos
phorus, while later we determined carbon and hydrogen in addition.

   These examples         show that even when small quantities of                     the
phosphorised compounds are submitted to analysis,                     fairly accurate
results   are obtained — far more            accurate,  indeed,    than might      have
been anticipated, considering the very large                 quantity of nitrate       of
copper    with which       the    phosphoric       acid was diluted previous           to
precipitation by the molybdate.                 It  is probable    that with    larger
quantities even better numbers would have resulted

List of the          Fossil Dipnoi and Ganoidei of Fife and the
              Lothians.       By R. H. Traquair, M.D., F.E.S.
                               (Read   July  21, 1890.)
    Xo district of Great        Britain is    so rich   in  genera and species of
Carboniferous        Dipnoi and Ganoidei       as  that of Fife and the Lothians,
and    in the frequency      of   entire   specimens     of these lishes it is only
approached by         North Staffordshire.
    Another      feature of the greatest geological         interest   is the abund
ance of      fish remains     in estuarine      strata  below the horizon of the
Millstone       grit,  whereby a means of comparing the Ganoid                     fish
fauna:-   of the Upper and Lower             divisions of the Carboniferous for
mation is afforded.          Lower Carboniferous Ganoids and Dipnoans
occur,    it is true, in the western         part of the great central Scottish
carboniferous        area, and a very remarkable assemblage               of fishes of
tbat    period     was discovered      not many years ago in the district of
Eskdale and         Liddesdale in the south.          But in England and Ireland
and in     other parts of the world generally, the Lower              Carboniferous
 fish remains       known to us are mainly those of marine                Selachii, so
 that an    especial interest attaches to the Carboniferous fish-fauna of
 Scotland, and        particularly   to that of the district        with which the
 present    list has to deal.
    A list of the fossil fishes of the Edinburgh              district, compiled by
 the late    Mr Salter, is given in the Memoir of the Geological Survey,
 explanatory of Sheet 32 (Scotland), and published in 1861.                       Since
 the    appearance      of this Memoir, now nearly thirty years ago, no
 collective      list of the fossil       fishes   of this    part of the      country
 has been      drawn up, though the amount of material               amassed by the
 labours    of many collectors ha3 enormously increased                  during those
 pars.       Among those who have contributed, by their work in the
 field,  to an     augmentation of the material for           a new and expanded
 list of the fossil fishes     of this district,    I may mention, besides Messrs
 Bennie      and Macconochie,         collectors to the Geological Survey of
 Scotland,      Mr W. Tait Kinnear,          Mr W. Anderson, now of the Geo
 logical Survey of New South Wales, Mr T. Stock, Mr James Kirkby,
  and the late Mr Robert Walker of St Andrews ; while I myself,
  daring the past       sixteen years, have been able to procure               both for
     vol. xvu.                                                               2 B

the Museum of Science and                     Art    and for my own collection, a very
considerable      number of specimens                    from the localities round Edin
burgh.
  One result of this large increase of material is that                              a    number         of
undoubtedly new species have to be chronicled.                               Another result                is,
that the increase of knowledge which this increase of material                                         has
brought with          it,    induces me to withdraw                 several   species which             I
myself had previously named, but which                          I   now must place among
the synonyms.           Where species have been otherwise rectified,                           I     have
not considered        it     necessary, in      a     list like this, to occupy            space         by
giving the entire synonymy.
   As  I     hope to take up the cataloguing of the Selachii next session,
the present list       is     restricted      to the Dipnoi        and Ganoidei, including
the     problematical         Acanthodei,            which      ought perhaps,            as    in     the
opinion of many, to                be    rather considered        as   Elasmobranchs.                 The
list itself cannot          be supposed         to be complete,        but   it   will,   it   is   to be
hoped, be of      a   certain       utility for     a   time.
                                              Horizons.
   The Upper Old Red Sandstone (U.O.R.) cannot       think be asso           I
ciated with the Carboniferous rocks on account of its fish remains,
which have       a   greater general resemblance                 to those of the Lower Old
Red of the North of Scotland, in spite of the well-known uncon
formity which exists between                        the two sets of strata.          In        the Car
boniferous system two great divisions — Upper and Lower — may                                          be
adopted,      and these again subdivided according                     to the plan in use               by
the Director-general and Officers of the Geological Survey.                                     In    this
arrangement        the Lower Carboniferous falls into two subdivisions,
the Calciferom Sandstone Series (OS.) extending up to the first
Gilmerton Limestone, and the Carboniferous Limestone Series
(C.L.) extending            from    the last-mentioned horizon to the Millstone
Grit, or Eosslyn Sandstone.                     And in their turn             the     Upper          Car
boniferous rocks fall likewise into two subdivisions — the Millstone
Grit    below, and          the Coal Measures            (CM.)    above.     I     have given          no
contraction for the Millstone Grit,                      as
                                                         I      have seen no         fish remains
from this set of rocks in the East of Scotland.
  It    is   certainly worthy of note that in this list not one                            species      is
common        to the Upper              and   Lower Divisions          of the Carboniferous

 formation.      So far as fish-life at least is concerned,   there certainly
 occurred    an important      paheontological break     at the      base of the
 Millstone    Grit.   And my friend Mr Kidston tells        me that the same
is true   with regard to the plants.

         Notes on     Some   of the Species in the Preceding List.
     Acanthodi's mlcatus, Ag. — The type specimen                  from Wardie, in
 the Oxford       Museum, is     so  poor   a  fragment that the reference                   to
 this species      of the now       pretty numerous and tolerably                     perfect
 examples      of Acanthodes     from the Calciferous Sandstone Series                       of
 the district    is more a matter     of guess-work than of              absolute       scien
 tific proof,    though at the same time there             is no real reason for
 doubt.      The fish attains to a very considerable               size, and is very
 closely allied to A. Wardi, Eg., of the Coal Measures.                          The little
 " sulcus " or
                   groove on the scales, figured by Agassiz, and upon
 which lie founded the specific            name, is very inconstant, and                   can
 hardly     be  used   as   a character  ;   in fact, the only tangible                  mark
 which    I  can find to distinguish sulcatus       from Wardi is a somewhat
 greater straightness      and slenderness     of the " styliform " bone.
     I  am of opinion that the remains of Acanthodes which                           occur in

 the Carboniferous               Limestone Series               are specifically distinct         both
 from     Wanli and guteaim, but unfortunately they are not sufficiently
 perfect to       warrant the application of a new name.
       Sagaudut.        — At     the suggestion          of    Mr Smith Woodward,             I adopt
 the term         Sagenodus, Owen, for Ctenodont                          fishes   of the     type of
 ^iy«ac,Atthey,and                 quinquecostatus,           Traq.,in place of Hetnic.tenodus,
 Jaeckel.         Sagenodus inequalis seems pretty certainly to have been
 founded by             Sir E. Owen on a microscopic                    section of a young speci
 men of         Ctenodus        vbliquut, Atthey    (Trans. Odontolo. Sue, vol. v.,
 1867, p. 395,            pi.   xii.), while on the other hand one cannot feel sure
 that    Jaeckel was correct in referring Atthey's                          species to his genus
Hmictenodus.
      Pltaneropleuron. —         I      include Phanernpleuron with                   CfrntvJus and
 its   allies   in     the family Ctenodontidae,               because the recent observations
 of    Whiteaves, Jaeckel,                and myself on             specimens        of Ph. curium,
Whiteaves, from                 the Upper Devonian                 of Scaumenac       Bay, Canada,
clearly show            what  I    had long suspected in the case of                 Ph. Anderzoni,
Hnxley,         that      the configuration of                the   palatal bones       and palatal
dentition         was essentially the same as in                         Ctmoilus and Diptenm.
Marginal         teeth have,       it   is   true, been also described by             Huxley in Ph.
Andersoni          and by "VVhiteaves in                Ph. curium, but      I      do not consider
that this character                excludes        it   from the family.           The name Cteno
dontidae         is,
                  I       think,    preferablo          to   Pander's "     Ctenododipterinae,"        as
Dipiervg         is     the only member             of the family known               to us in which
the     dorsal fin       is   differentiated into two.
      Vraiemidte.         — Notwithstanding                  the great external resemblanco            of
Uronemm to Phaneropileuron,                        I     am constrained to put the former
in  distinct family, owing to the fact that the dentition does not
     a
assume the form of
                       " ctenodont " plates, and the shape of tho
palatal bones             is     quite       different.       In    Uronemus        these    bones    are
broad plates,            with only        a row of teeth along the outer margin,                      tho
surface         internal to which             is   simply granulated.              Details   as   to the
structure of Uronemus                    will   be given in         a   subsequent    memoir.

of subjacent         vascular   channels.        Associated   with these scales       is a
small tooth, shaped as in Strepsodus sauroides, but with the                    striation
of   a much more delicate character              (Museum of Science and Art).
     Afegcdichthys Imvis, n.       sp. — I apply this       term to a comparatively
small species of Megalichthys, whose more or less disjointed remains
are not uncommon           in the ironstone nodules contained in the              "roof"
of the Dunnet oil shale worked at Straiton and Pentland.                          Its dis
tinguishing specific character is the thinness of the scales and the
absence of the usual            prominent rib or keel on the under surface.
In    fact, these scales, when seen from below, are almost indistinguish
able from       those of Bhizodopsis.              Externally     they are brilliantly
ganoid on the free portion of the surface, as in other species.                      Type

     Elonichthys nemopterus, Ag. — After puzzling for years over in
numerable       specimens of the Robisoni type of Elonichthys, which is
 so common        in the Lower Carboniferous            liocks of central      Scotland,
 and in vain seeking for definite characters towards dividing them
 into " good species,          I
                 "
                                  have been reluctantly compelled to abandon
 the quest, and to seek for a solution of the question                     by reuniting
 them all, with the exception of E. Bucklandi (Ag.), which can always
 be easily recognised          by the strongly-marked            and deeply-cut      orna
 ment of its scales.
      It is no doubt easy enough to put together a set of extreme forms,
 which any      one    might readily be tempted to adopt            as distinct   species,
 and in fact       I  did  so myself at the commencement of my investiga
 tions   ;  but the more material           I  obtained,   the more and      more unre
 liable did     I   find every character turn out upon which                I  had fixed
 as diagnostic.        For   example, the relative fineness or coarseness of the
  fin-rays, and the relative         distance of their transverse         articulations,
 are characters which are quite                inconstant.     As   a ride, the fin-rays
  are proportionally        more slender         and more distantly articulated           in
 young specimens, though this condition sometimes persists in                        adult
  forms.     Also, no reliance        can be placed on the relative extent                to
  which the scales are striated                or punctate,     or upon whether         the
  punctate    area is nearly       smooth       or thickly covered with punctures.
  Unfortunately the relative           size   of the scales and the number of          rays
 in each fin       are   characters which can only be accurately              ascertained
 in exceptionally well-preserved                specimens,    as a certain    amount of

 distortion    is common        to the greater number of those specimens                  as
 they occur     in the rock.
    All  the forma       which    I  include under Elonichthys nemopterus are
fishes  of  a tolerably deeply fusiform shape, with large fins, the dorsal
and anal     triangular, and high in front          ;   the fin rays longitudinally
striated, save      in   some cases the proximal parts of those of the lower
lobe of the caudal ; the           principal rays of the pectoral articulated            up
to  their origins.         The scales are finely serrated on their posterior
margins ;     their ornament          is delicately   striato-punctate,      as  shown in
my   description        and figures of those of the variety ttriolaius (Carb.
Ganoids, Pcd.        Soc, 1877); but, as remarked above, there is an infinite
variety    in the relative extent of the striation and punctation. As
a rule    the most anterior scales are entirely striated                ;  those of the
middle of the body striated towards the               anterior margin and punctate
posteriorly     ;  while those towards          the tail    become nearly smooth.
 The cranial roof bones are          for the most part finely tuberculated         ; those
 of the face      striated, and very considerable          variety occurs here as to
 ihe closeness      and prominence        of the striation.
    As well marked          varieties   I may   retain the following : —¦
       a.   E. nemopterus, Ag. type. — Fin-rays slender, rather distantly-
              articulated,      striated   ornament       prevalent     on    the   scales.

       6.   Var.     gtriolatus,    Ag.  — Fin-rays       relatively      coarser,    very
              closely articulated, scales delicately           striate-punctate.       The
              Palcp.onisnis Robisoni of Hibbert and Agassiz                 [Eloniehthys

        As    to       E.    vvatus, Traq.,        I   abandon        it   altogether,      as being pretty
                certainly a form with                        the body shortened               up by distor
                tion.
     Elmiichthys midtidriattts, n. sp. — The remains of this remarkable
and undoubtedly new species which have as yet been found, consist
of fragments                of fishes       more       or less distorted, and also disjointed
scales and bones.                   The former set of remains indicate that the body
was     deeply fusiform,                   the   fins        large    and composed            of numerous
closely striated rays, and the head bones resembling in shape those
of    E.     pectinalus,            Traq.        But the scales              are     altogether peculiar.
Those of the flanks are higher than broad, more or less rectangular
in form, the covered area narrow, the exposed portion covered with
fine sharp raised               striae     or ridges, which                are sub-parallel, frequently
bifurcating             and     also     anastomosing,               and    cross    the    surface    of the
scale obliquely from above                        downwards and backwards.                         From     the
upper margin of the scale, and rather                                      near     the    anterior superior
margiu,       there projects             a strong           pointed and grooved articular spine;
the posterior margin is entire and without serrations.
     When          I   first saw the scales of this fish, their form and manner
of ornament                 strongly suggested Platysomid affinities, but the maxilla
and cast of the                 mandible lying with them in the same slab clearly
showed        that we had to deal with a member of the                                       Palaeoniscidae.
Other specimens,                    as aforesaid,            indicate that the safest              genus to
place      it in        is Elonichtkys.                It    must     have    attained a considerable
size.

     Elonichthys               striatus,     Ag. — I              formerly     separated        this   species
under the generic                   term    Cosmoptychius,                 owing to the presence            of a
small plate, which is wedged in anteriorly between the operculum
and the quadrate plate beneath                              it,
                                usually reckoned as suboperculum.

As in the        Lower Permian genus Rhabdolepis of Troschel, this plate
extends hack            the whole way to the opercular margin,                                           and com
pletely separates the                   operculum from the quadrate                            plate beneath.
I    considered        it    as the          true " suboperculum,"                      and     reckoned           the
quadrate        plate       as    " interoperculum,"               an       opinion which                I    subse
quently recanted             in my paper on Chomlrosteus* in which                                   I    restored
the term       "suboperculum"                 to the quadrate               plate, and considered                  the
small intermediate                    one    as    accessory.           I    had not, at the time                     I
instituted       the genus              Cosmoptychiw,            observed              this little triangular
accessory plate             in        Eluniehthys,         but since               then    I    have         seen    it
frequently,          and in consequence                    I   feel     that there is no sufficient
ground         for separating               striatus from the other                     species of the last
named genus.
     Rhadiniehthys               ornatissimus,           Ag. —   I      have long          had no doubt as
to my         former        R.    lepturus         from    Burntisland                 being only         a   young
specimen of           R. ornatusimus, and therefore                          cancel the species.                   Ex
ceptionally          line specimens of R. ornatissimus                             have recently occurred
in the niof          of the Dunnet shale at Straiten and Pentland.
         Shwiinkhthys carinatwt,                   Ag.— I      much regret that a similar fate
 must        befall R. Geikiei from                    Eedhall; but            the accession             of a fine
    senes    of carinatm from Pumpherston has so                                       much added to our
 knowledge           of its characters, that it has become clear that the little
    specimens from           the        former         locality, which             I   named     in honour of
    the
           Director-general of the Geological                         Survey, must be absorbed in
    the     Agassizian       species.             In   Agassiz's        type of this species from
    bardie, as well as             in   other      specimens from that locality, the outer
    surface     of    the    scales          is imperfectly shown,                       hence       I    formerly
    described    it   as    entirely smooth or nearly                       so ;    but the Pumpherston
    specimens,       which        I    cannot      avoid referring to carinatu*, from the
    general    appearance and contour of the body and fins, clearly display
    the same     character of scale ornament                       as   I had          previously attributed
    to     Geikiei (Proc. Roy. Soc.                Edin., ix.        1877, p. 439).              I   also,    in my
    piper on the           Eshdale Ganoids,                doubtfully              identified the common
    RliwJinkhthys           of the Glencartholm beds with the supposed species,
    ¦fi-
           Geikiei, and     it    has been long evident to me that this doubt was
    amply     justified.          Though closely allied, the Glencartholm fish has
 a
         considerably coarser serration of the posterior                                       margins        of    the

error to another             species,   it   cannot now be adopted                         for any member
of the genus,           so    that for the more southern species                             I   must adopt
the name eleganttdus,                previously given by me to one of its varieties.

    Acrolepis semigranulosus,                 n. sp. — From                 the roof        of   the Dunnet
shale at Straiton, the Edinburgh                          Museum possesses                  a slab    covered
with scales of             a large   Acrolepis, the sculpture of which is different
from that of any other member                              of the genus               with which          I     am
acquainted.            These scales, which have the size and form of                                         those
of A. Hopkimsi (M'Coy), are covered                                   on their exposed             area      with
innumerable            closely-set       fine    ridges,            often tortuous, and                tending
constantly to break up into tubercles                           ;    their main direction              is,   how
ever, as usual, obliquely across the scale from the anterior margin.
    As my Elonicldltys ortholepis from Glencartholm turns out                                                to be
a   young specimen of            a   large Acrolepis, there are now four species of
Acroleins known, or at least described, from the Carboniferous rocks
of Great Britain, viz., — Hopkinsi, M'Coy; Wilsoni, Traq.; ortholejnt,
Traq.  ;     and seinigranulusus,            Traq.
 I     may hero mention that             I      can see no radical distinction between
the scales of the fish from the Carboniferous Limestone series of                                              the
West of Scotland, which                 I     described              as    Acrolepis Rankinei (Ag.),

according to the         traditions of the Glasgow geologists, this species

    Drydeniut       ineignu, n. gen. and sp. — When               my attention was
first drawn     to the vertebrate           fossils of the Borough Lee and Loan-
head    Blackband Ironstone,          I   attributed certain small jaw-fragments,
showing     peculiar bent cylindro-conical and conspicuous                     teeth,  to
Gmtdodw macrolepw,               Traq.    ;  but after collecting    a large     number
of those   little dentigerous        bones,      it began to be clear to me that        I
had,   on the      other hand, to deal with a new fish,               of which more
or   less  entire     specimens       with      the   teeth  in situ began also to
turn up.
    The most entire example             I   have seen is 4 inches in length, and,
but for the      peculiarity of the dentition to be presently described,
one    would indeed        be inclined to refer        it to Gonatodus.      The scales
are exactly,      as  in that     genus, nearly smooth,         with finely serrated
posterior margins ; the fin-rays              are proportionally rather coarse and
also smooth      ;  the cranial roof bones are ornamented                with flattened
tortuous ridges.          It is in  the bones of the jaws that the peculiarities
reside,   which      have induced me to elevate the species also to the
 type    of a genus.         The hinder part of the maxilla forms                 a short
 expanded plate,       from the middle of the anterior aspect of which the
 narrow anterior         or suborbital process extends,           so   that the tooth-
 bearing margin         is posteriorly bent          suddenly downwards at         a con
 siderable angle.          This margin is set         as  in Gonatodus with      a single
 row of proportionally            stout     cylindro-conical pointed        teeth.    The
 dentary element          of the mandible is rather stout, and shows on its
 upper margin a row           of similar teeth.        The splenial element presents
 a dental    armature which          I  have not seen in any other palseoniscid.
  The bone      is narrow,      rounded        posteriorly, concave externally,       and
  tapering to a      point in front, its upper straight margin being set with
 a single   row of short conical pointed teeth.                But the inner, or oral
 aspect,   shows an area about               the middle, and occupying        more than
  \  of its length,     from which        a   row of six powerful cylindro-conical
  teeth arises,    behind which         are    three or four small    ones.     The large
  teeth seem     disproportionally large for the small size of the fish, and
  are  conspicuous even in the most crushed heads.                   They are strongly
   curved  with the convexity inwards.

   As already mentioned,         I  have seen no such dentition               either in
Gonatudus     or in any other palseoniscid        fish, and consequently          I  have
considered     it advisable    to constitute the new genus,           Drydenius, for
this little fish.      The name is taken from the Vale of Dryden,                  which
is in close proximity to the ironstone              mines of Borough           Lee and

    Eurynotus crenatus,       Agassiz.   — The original       specimen     of   E. fim
briates,   Ag., from Wardie, in the Oxford Museum, is                    a   very poor
fragment, upon which no specific             characters     distinguishing       it from
E.    crenatus     can  really be founded, especially            if  one takes       into
account the enormous         number of other specimens of the genus from
the Scotch Lower Carboniferous rocks which                     have been collected
since    Agassiz    wrote the Poissons Fossiles.           These    specimens       show
 very great differences        in many      respects    ;  but the result of my
 puzzling over them for years is that, with the exception of                 a  peculiar
 form from Loanhead, all must be referred                    to   the  same      species,
 namely,   E.   crenatus, Ag.     In   some cases the scales are comparatively
 smooth,   in   others   more ornamented       ; in some the crenation of their
 edges in the dorsal region is extremely coarse, in others this character
 is not so marked.         With    regard to the fin-rays,        the same remarks
 apply which       I made   in the   case  of Elonichthys nemojiterus, namely,
 that in young specimens these are more slender                   and the transverse
joints   more distant than       in adults, in which also there is no fixed
 condition   as regards    this particular.      In   many instances       the rays of
 the dorsal fin are serrated posteriorly, but          I  cannot venture to found
 a species on     this.

                                           Preliminary Note.
   In      the coarse         of an extended            series    of investigations into                     the
relations         of magnetism           and stress, part of which is already pub
lished in the              Transactions (voL xxxv.), I was led to consider the
effect     of a current        passing along a wire upon its longitudinal mag
netic intensity.               "Wiedemann,           Buff, and        Villari*          have      discussed
this problem             in some of its aspects.           It    does not seem possible, how
ever, to         deduce from their results completely satisfactory conclusions
as to the         effect of the current upon the apparent longitudinal                                       per
meability.           The question, as it presented itself to my mind, was not
so much as to              the effect of a varying current along the wire upon
the       apparent longitudinal              moment,       but rather             as to the       behaviour
of the wire              in various longitudinal          fields      according         as   it   was carry
ing a current or not.                 It   was to be expected, in accordance                          with the
results of previous                investigators,       that a diminution of longitudinal
 intensity         would     be an    evident accompaniment                  of   a   steadily sustained
circular          magnetisation.            In other       words,       the       susceptibility             to a
 longitudinal magnetising                    force would, in all probability,                     be smaller
 when         a current       was passing        along the wire.              This      has been            fully
 established             in the experiments,            of which this forms                   a short pre
 liminary note.               Other effects, however, have been observed, which
 are       (so   far as  Iknow) novel, and which may lead to cleaver views
 regarding          the internal structure of magnets and magnetised matter.
      In the experimental              work   I      have been assisted by                Mr Tsuruta,              a
 graduating          student of physics in the Imperial University.
      The wire to be experimented                        with was carefully annealed, and
 then      inserted as the core of               a   solenoid of copper wire of                       1   38 coils
 per      centimetre length.               The wire and solenoid lay magnetically east

 suspended           mirror with small magnets attached to its back served in
 the usual          way as the magnetometer.                    The deflections              were measured

over a scale at a distance                of    W     metres     from the magnetometer
mirror.         Before the wire was inserted,             the electromagnetic              action of
the coil on the            magnetometer         was corrected          by a small adjustable
coil in circuit with the solenoid and set close to the magnetometer.
The wire was then inserted and subjected to cyclic variations                                            of
magnetic        force.     The magnetising current was changed continuously
from      a    given positive value to an equal negative value, and back
again to the original              positive value.        The variation was effected                    in
a   gradual manner by means of                    a   liquid    rheostat,       consisting of             a
column of dilute sulphate of zinc with zinc electrodes,                                       through
which a steady current from a battery of Daniell cells was                                         con
stantly flowing.            By    means of a sliding zinc electrode, the necessary
current was shunted through                     the   solenoid circuit.              The      tangent
galvanometer             included in this circuit was, of course, far removed
from the solenoid, and was so placed that the operator in adjusting
the rheostat could easily read the galvanometer                          deflection.
    In    the earlier experiments              careful attention was paid to the first
effects, as well as to the permanent                      cyclic condition, which                 soon
becomes established               after a few cyclic changes of the magnetising
current have been gone through.                     At suitable        stages   in   the variation
of the current, the current was kept steady until the corresponding
deflection of the magnetometer                     needle      was observed           and      noted.
These remarks            will    suffice at present to indicate the general method
adopted        in studying         the   cyclic changes which have been                       so fully
investigated by Warburg and Ewing.
    One of my objects               was to study the modification                    produced        on
this cycle, and on whatever else may be associated with                                 it,   when   a
current        is   passed along the magnetised                wire.      This linear         current
(as we shall call          it)   was derived from one or more Bunsen cells.                          It
entered the iron wire at the end furthest removed from the magneto
meter, and returned along two copper wires stretched                             parallel       to the
iron wire, and very close to it.
    A    complete set of experiments consisted                  in —
         (1)   Taking     a   permanent      magnetic     cycle when no linear current
                was flowing along the wire            ;
         (2) Observing the initial effect when the linear current                                 was
             made to flow in one direction along the wire, and taking                              the
                permanent         magnetic     cycle, with this current kept steady;

          (3) Observing the        initial   effect  when the linear current was
                broken, and taking again the permanent magnetic cycle,

      It  was    soon found that         in good experiments       the  permanent
  magnetic cycles        in  (1), (3), and (5) were practically identical; so
  that in later experiments          (3) was omitted.      It was also established
  by direct    experiment      that the permanent magnetic cycle in (2) was
i quite   independent       of  the magnetic condition of the wire when the
  linear current     was   put on.
      Some of the     features of the case arc shown in the curves given.
  This is chosen as      an average type,        the departures from which,  when
  the relative     magnitudes      of linear current and field are altered, will
   be   briefly indicated     below.      In  these curves magnetic force (.§>) is
   measured     horizontally ; magnetic intensity (%) measured vertically.
   The   magnetic force is given in electromagnetic c.g.s. units, and the
   magnetic    intensity (very roughly) in the same.

  Curve (a) corresponds to the permanent magnetic cycles (1), (3),
(5); curves (b) and (r) give the cycles when the linear current is
flowing first in the one and then in the other direction.                                                The
current used in this experiment was about                                    2 amperes.
     A   glance at these curves is sufficient to teach                               us that the linear
current modifies the properties                         of iron in relation to the               magnetic
after-effect          in three well-marked ways.
     First,        the total     range of magnetic                 intensity produced by          a given
cyclic variation of magnetic force is markedly diminished when                                           the
current is flowing along the wire.                                 This      means     a diminution          in
susceptibility.              Here also may be mentioned the fact that the                               first
effect of putting on the current when the wire is strongly magnetised
is a diminution              of longitudinal magnetic intensity.
     Secondly,         when the linear current is flowing, the average                           magnetic
intensity over a whole cycle no longer corresponds                                     to the condition
of zero polarity,              as   in the normal              case,       when no linear current            is
flowing.             For    the one current the magnetic                       intensity oscillates,         so
to speak, about a large positive polarity                              ;   and, for the current in the
reverse direction,             it   oscillates     about a       nearly equal negative polarity.
If   we       reckon polarity in the usual                         way,      as a directed quantity
measured             from the south pole to the north, then the direction of
the linear current is in the same direction as the average polarity
which         it     sustains,      when the wire                is subjected         to   an absolutely
symmetrical cycle of magnetising force on each side of zero.
     Third! y,        the   curves      (I)     and     (c)   are no longer symmetrical on the
side of the zero line of magnetic                              force.       The closed curve           (b)   is
more         pointed at its positive end than at its negative end                                  ;     the
curve        ((¦),   on the other hand,               is    more    pointed at its negative             end
than at its positive.                      If    we     turn the figure              upside down,        the
general        appearance           remains       the       same as before.            Thus, the    effect
of the linear current                 is   such    as very distinctly            to modify the form
of the ascending             and descending                 branches.         The descending      branch
of (b)       is      very similar          to    the ascending              branch of      (c)
                                                                                             ;   and    the
ascending           branch of (b) very similar to the descending branch
                                            is
of   ('•).         We may connect this peculiarity with the peculiarities

is more                  pronounced          when         the     wire is acquiring               a longitudinal
polarity in                the opposite direction to that in which the linear current
is flowing.                 Hence, during any cyclic operation,                             the wire tends                to
acquire             an average polarity in the same direction                               as    that in which
the current flows.
     These effects are more pronounced the stronger the linear current
is as compared                    with the magnetising                     field.     In    a moderate cyclic
field, the effect of the linear current may be so strong as to prevent
\!ke      wire ever acquiring                       other than one kind                    of polarity.              For
example,            this effect         was        produced       in   a   field + 4, with a current of
nearly          2    amperes.               For     the        linear current in one direction the
 (b)    carve never              dipped below the zero intensity line                             ;   and      for the
current         in the other direction the curve (c) never rose above it.
     On       the other hand, in stronger magnetising fields, from 10 and
upwards,             the (b) and      curves for the same linear current of
                                                 (c)
2    amperes          tend to terminal coincidence, but diverge at the inter
mediate stages.                   It   is   proposed to study more fully these relations,
and to        extend the investigations                         to nickel and cobalt.
     In     the course           of    these experiments, an effect was noticed,                               which
 demonstrates              the extraordinary                   complexity of magnetic                 distribution
in   a    magnetised wire.                   If, before          the wire has been magnetised                         at
 all,   a   current        is   passed along             it,   no appreciable         longitudinal polarity
is      produced,          as measured              by    a     magnetometer           needle      placed       as    in
 the above           experimenta                 Suppose, however,                  that the wire has been
pretty strongly                 magnetised         ;    and     that, in the manner discussed                        by
 Auerbach,               and     used,       almost            universally          now,    the       wire     is    de
 magnetised                by    reversals             of gradually diminishing                       magnetising
 currents           until the magnetometer nocdlo                             stands       almost exactly at
 ffito.       It     is,   of course, generally                  recognised          that the wire             so    de
magnetised               cannot be regarded                as    being in anything like the same
 condition           as    it   was    in its originally unmagnetised                           state, although
it      appears to have           lost polarity.                That this view             is   correct      may bo
  at     once       demonstrated            by simply            passing      a      pretty strong current
 along the wire,                when     a   very pronounced polarity will be evidenced
    by                                              deflection of the magnetometer                           needle.

              comparatively              large
 Reversing           the current            will    reverse this polarity.                 Heating        to   a     red
  heat can          alone truly demagnetise                     an iron wire.

       Closing Address.                  By The Hon.             Lord McLaren.
                                    (Read    July  21, 1890.)
    As   the Chairman          for this evening,          I   have   been asked by the
Council to lay before you a brief summary of the events of                                  the
session, -which       will  conclude       the public business of the session.
    In this retrospective view the                   most     interesting     point    is the
number and variety of the papers which have been read.                              Of   these
there were in all 74 papers, of which 19 were in the department of
Natural     Philosophy,         16 in Mathematics, 11              in   Chemistry,       1    in
Geology,     9   in Zoology,      1  in Botany,      6  in Physiology,      2  in Anatomy,
5  in Meteorology,          2   in Physical        Geography,      and    2  in   Philology.
These contributions,          I  may say, in the opinion of competent judges,
are calculated to maintain                the reputation of         our publications for
originality      and   accuracy.         In   the    present     session,    moreover,       we
have had two important contributions in the department                          of philology
and literature, for which we are indebted to Professor Blackie.                              In
these papers        the author emphasised              the remarkable fact that the
Greek language,          as   now spoken          and    written, is substantially the
same language as the Greek of Lucian and Plutarch,                          having under
gone no material change during the elapse of 2000                           years.    A    late
learned     and enthusiastic            French      Hellenist,     Monsieur d'Eichthal,
held the opinion that Greek                (I will not call it Modern Greek, which
I   take   to be a misnomer)              will   one day take the place of          Latin      as
the    medium        of    correspondence          between       cultivated     men    of all
countries.        "Without going quite so far, we may at least point to the
vitality of the ancient Greek tongue and its power of adaptation                               to
modern requirements as an answer                    to the arguments          of  those who
 seek to discourage        the study of classical literature at our universities,
on the ground of the supposed discordance                       between the ancient and
the modern         modes of thought and expression.
    A  more true explanation                of the     comparative decline           of pure
 scholarship and the preference accorded                    to the more      recondite and
perhaps     more      laborious       researches      which      are   necessary     for the
development        of scientific truth, may be found in this observation of
M. Benan       : — " The intense satisfaction attending scientific work
arises   from the assurance            which the scientist feels that he labours

at   work    -which reposes on an eternal basis of fact, and of which the
object     at least is eternal,       — a work which all civilised nations                feel
bound to pursue."
    There      were     12    admissions of new Fellows this session.                    Last
session    the admissions amounted                to 18    ;   whilst   during the three
preceding sessions the admissions                  attained the average number of
36.     The high          rate,    therefore,     which      characterised     those    three
sessions    has     not     been     maintained        either in     this session or the
 immediately       preceding        one.    But     the admissions      have been       more
tLaa    sufficient to maintain the numerical efficiency of the Society,
notwithstanding          the inevitable diminution of its numbers through
death.     It   is  with     regret that      I have to record the fact that during
 tie past session      the .Society has lost ten Ordinary Fellows and one
Honorary       Fellow       by death.         Of    these    obituary notices       will   be
 forthcoming       at   the     proper     time     and   place, but      I  may     be per
 mitted to say a      few words regarding              some of the deceased Fellows
 who are   personally, as well as from their public position, known to
 most   of us who are here engaged                 in carrying on the work            of the
 Society.
    Sir Henry       Yule,       an  Honorary Fellow of this Society, was born
 at Inveresk     in May 1820,            He was destined for an Indian military
career,   and    in December 1838 he joined the Bengal Engineers.
 He served     in the Sutlej          and Punjab         campaigns,      and    during the
Mutiny,     and      was      afterwards        successively      Under-Secretary        and
Secretary of the      Public Works Department in India.                       In   1875    ho
was   appointed a     Member of the India Council.                    He was editor of
the Travels
               of Marco Polo and of               many      other   books of mediaeval
adventure     in Asia.        His Glossary        of Anglo-Indian Terms is con-
sidered  a very    valuable work.
    Andrew Youxo,            a man      of   true literary and poetic feeling,          died
on  Saturday, the 30th November 1889.                     He had attended        a ineetin"
of this  Society on the Monday              preceding.        After   a  brilliant    career
in arts and    theology at the university of this city, where he gained
in Professor      Wilson's       class the prize for the best poem on
                                                                                      " The
Highlands," he was appointed to the Head-Mastership of                             Niddrie
School,    and afterwards became               English    Master in Madras College.

He regularly attended our meetings, and was much esteemed by his
friends and fellow-citizens.
     Many amongst us will remember the portly presence and genial
manner      of  Patrick Don Swan, who               was    provost    of Kirkcaldy
continuously from 1842 to 1886.              The celebrated Thomas Carlyle
assisted    him    as tutor in his early life    :  the friendship of tutor and
scholar    was unbroken to the last.            During the provostsbip of Mr
 Swan,    Kirkcaldy    became prosperous largely through his efforts, and
 he   will long   be remembered there for the civic improvements he did
 so much     to effect, and for his munificence        to the poor.      He   died on
 the 17th December        1889.
     It will   not be necessary for me to say anything further regarding
 our much esteemed associate Dr Andrew Graham,                       as an obituary
 notice of him has already been communicated                 to the Society.
     James     Leslie   was educated at the University of Edinburgh, his
  uncle   Sir John Leslie       being then    professor     of mathematics       there.
  It would      occupy   too much      time   even to enumerate         the    various
 engineering      works with which be was connected.                These   consisted
  chiefly in the construction of docks, in increasing             the water    supply
  of cities, and in fixing the limits of estuaries.                Among his      other
  undertakings, he designed         a plan for the Monkland Canal, by which
  empty    boats could      be conveyed      by an inclined plane instead              of
  through locks.       This ingenious     expedient, which foreshadowed              the
  ship railway, has been much             admired by         engineers.    He    was a
  liberal    subscriber    to    every   public    purpose.      He died     on    29th
  December      1889.
     The career of Dr James Lorimer is too well known                       to renJer
  it  necessary for     me    to do more    than briefly        advert to it      here.
  After studying at the universities of Edinburgh,                  Geneva,     Berlin,
  and   Bonn, he was called to the bar of Scotland in 1845, and                     was
  appointed     successively     to the Principal Lyon Clerkship and to              the
  Chair of Public Law in the University of Edinburgh.                   His  principal
  works    are   the Institutes    of Law,    wThich    has been translated         into
  French and Spanish        ;  and his Institute*     of the  Laic  of Nations.      He
  was the only Scottish Professor to whom the high distinction of                     an

honorary         degree was accorded        by the University of Bologna at its
octo-centenary in 1888.               He died on February           13, 1890.
     Sir Peter Coats            was Paisley's foremost          citizen, esteemed alike
ioT    his charitable benefactions          to the poor of the town, as well as for
his    princely gifts to the community.                  The manufacturing firm of
which      Sir Peter     was at the head employs            about 6000 persons.            It
was to     his liberality that Paisley is indebted for the buildings of its
Public     Library and Museum, costing with the site about £18,000
In recognition of this gift he received the honour of knighthood.
He died         on 9th March          1890,    at   Algiers, in the        82nd year of
his age.
    Di Leonhabd Schmitz               was born at Eupen, near Aix-la-Chapelle,
in 1807,      and settled in England in 1837.                In   1814,     he published
horn     the notes     which      he had taken in the class-room             at Bonn two
 relumes      of Niebuhr's Lectures on Roman Historj',                    for which tho
 King of Prussia awarded to him the great gold medal for literature.
In 1846 he was appointed                 rector   of the Royal         High School        at
 Edinburgh.         He was selected         to give lectures        in   history to     the
Prince     of Wales and to the Duke of Edinburgh,                      while    the    Due
 d'Aumale,     the   Prince    de  Joinville,   and the Due de Nemours placed
 their sons     under his tuition         at the    High School.          After leaving
 Edinburgh he        held various appointments           connected      with the higher
 education     of the country.          He was       projector and        editor of The
 Ckmcal Museum, wrote several                  historical works, and contributed
 largely    to   the  great     classical    dictionaries,     to   the   Encyclopivdia
 Britannica and other publications.                He died at the       age  of 83.
     On looking      over    the   work    done in      the   last session,      and the
 papers    in our Transactions         recently published,          we cannot     fail   to
 remark that some        of  the most important communications come from
  the  laboratories of the     Universities of Edinburgh and              Glasgow,     and
  from    the   laboratory recently founded in this city by the Royal
  College    of Physicians.        The Firth of Forth also, which Professor
  Ray Lankester        has, called     "  tho   classic   sea    of naturalists,"      has
  furnished    materials in its fauna for important biological work.

Professor Tait, on the Theory of Knot Forms, have induced other
scientists in England, in the United States of America, and              on  the
Continent, to follow him in the same department of research,             and  to
give to our Society valuable communications on these subjects.                 I
think     we may    also attribute   to   the same   source   the   revival   of
interest in the abstruse       subject of the    Quaternion Calculus with
 which the name of my distinguished friend is largely identified.
    It  is also pleasing to observe that many papers have been received
 from comparatively young men, who, after distinguishing themselves
 at   the   university,  now    hold   important   appointments in distant
 colonies and dependencies       of the Empire and among          the old and
 rapidly advancing nations of the extreme East.
    I  have now only to announce        the conclusion of the public business
of  the session of 1890.

                                       PRIZES.
       The  Gunning Victoria Jubilee Prize for 1887-90 was presented to
    Professor  Tait, for his work in connection with the "Challenger"
    Expedition, and his other Researches          in Physical Science.
      The President,     on presenting    the Prize, said   : —
      This  work was primarily undertaken by Professor Tait, for the
   purpose   of correcting thermometric observations affected in a com
   plex manner      by the severe and         varying pressures       to which     the
  instruments were subjected,          and deducing the hue temperatures            of
  the water at the great depths         explored in the "Challenger" expedi
  tion.    Even had the investigation been confined to this object alone,
  it  must have     included highly interesting researches regarding the
  thermoelastic qualities of water, mercury,           and glass.        l!ut a mere
  knowledge     of  the  temperature     at  all depths   in    the seas   and oceans
  has comparatively        little interest or importance in science without
 knowledge      of   physical properties of sea water, such as compressi
 bility and thermal expansivity at pressures            corresponding to nil the
 depths.      Particularly the temperature of maximum density for any
 ?iven pressure, which is a property calculable from the other two, is
of supreme importance in explaining the observed results of thermo
metric    determinations in water over submarine slopes and under the
levels   of the lips of submarine basins, and using the results for the
theory     of the great oceanic circulations.            Accordingly, Tait has
included all these subjects in his investigation, which, carried on
with exemplarily determined             perseverance, and with peculiar skill
and inventiveness,        through six years, has added to science a valu
able body      of results regarding the compressibility and expansivity
of fresh    water and sea water at different temperatures and pressures,
the   compressibilities of water with different proportions of common
salt  in solution, and the compressibilities of glass.
    Many of us, who have seen something of the work from time to
time, will remember with vivid interest the great Woolwich                    and the
small   Edinburgh guns, and the wonderful appliances for producing
and measuring         the enormous pressures up to 457 atmospheres (3
tons    weight per square inch) which were used, and their effects on
 the   apparent    bulk of mercury in         glass.  But     I  am afraid     I have
 misused the     word apparent       : we saw neither mercury nor glass, but
     vol. xvn.                                                             2 d

 were tokl they were there, screened from our eyes by 43 millimetres
 of steel.  Electric contacts made by mercury on fine platinum wires
 as it rose in the glass tube, forming a long neck to an inverted
 bottle of water, showed, by electric signals outside the gun, tie
 volumes of the compressed mercury as measured by the less com
 pressed glass measure, with the different pressures shown by a proper
 pressure measurer at the times of the electric signals.            Tait con.-
 municated this novel and ingenious method of measuring an unseen
 liquid by an unseen measuring vessel in a space subjected to a
 pressure of hundreds of atmospheres to Amagat, at a critical time in
 the course of his great work when it was much needed, and proved
 most valuable.     In return, Amagat gave Tait the pressure-measuring
instrument, which was as great an acquisition to him as Tait's inven
 tion was to Amagat.
    The Royal Society awards to Professor Tait for this work the
                                                 I
 Gunning Victoria Jubilee Prize. It will, am sure, be gratifying to
 Dr Gunning, the founder of this prize, that so valuable a contribution
 to science has earned it fur the period 1887-90.
    The Keith Prize for 1887-89 was presented             to Professor Lett-,
 for his Researches    into the Organic Compounds of Phosphorus.
    Professor Crum Brown, on presenting the Prize, said : —
    The Council has awarded the Keith Prize, for the biennial period
 1887-1889, to Professor Letts, for his papers on the Organic Com
 pounds of Phosphorus.          The work was difficult, and has been very
thoroughly done, and the results are of great interest.           The special
dittioulty arose  from    the   nature  of the substances to be dealt with,
and also from the want of a trustworthy            mode of detenuiniug the
quantity   of  phosphorus      contained    in them.    The latter difficulty
Professor Letts has completely got over, and has devised a method
by means of which the phosphorus in these compounds can be
accurately determined.        The special interest of these investigations
depends on the remarkable .similarities         and equally  remarkable   dis
similarities shown by the corresponding compounds of phosphorus
nitrogen, and sulphur.         It was indeed the desire to trace out these
analogies   and  differences     through a large series of  compounds    thai
led Professor Letts to undertake what has turned            out to he a very
laborious piece   of work.        This steady purpose has given unity    to a
considerable   series of papers, in some of which Professor Letts        bad
the collaboration of his assistant.      Messrs Collie, "Wheeler, and  Blake
have thus successively      shared in this important investigation.

    The Neffl Prize for 1886-89 was presented to Mr Robert Kidston,
for his Researches in Fossil Botany.
    Professor    James Geikie, on presenting the Prize, said : —
    In  Scotland,    geological science has been for many years prosecuted
chiedy    in its physical    departments.        Nor is this to be wondered at
when one considers the generally unfossiliferous character of Scottish
rocks, and, on the other hand, the many interesting problems                 which
the  intricate structure of our country presents. Dr Hutton, the father
of physical geology, is the characteristic product of such a country
as this, just as William Smith, the father of historical geology, is
the  typical product of England, with its long and orderly succession
of   fossiliferous systems.         The richly fossiliferous Mesozoic and
Tertiary strata, which occupy so large a part of the sister country,
are  very sparingly developed         here.    The palaeontologist with us has
to content     himself with much older strata, which, after all, are only
locally    fossiliferous,   and    with    a  few meagre      representatives    of
younger systems.         Limited     as  are   the opportunities for the pro
secution    of palasontological    research   in Scotland, we have yet never
wanted     able investigators     in this branch     of science.    Few of these,
however, have worked much in the department of fossil botany.
Doubtless this is largely due to the difficulties that beset the study
itwdf.     The evidence with which the palseophytologist has to deal is
often very hard to understand, and its interpretation demands a
wider and more profound knowledge of the structure of living and
extinct forms than is generally required in the study of invertebrate
pakeozoology.        When     one glances     over  the contents    of a pakuon-
tological    museum, one can readily understand why the study of
extinct animal life has come to be more assiduously cultivated than
fossil botany.       The contrast between the more or less perfect state
of preservation of many of the corals, shells, and other invertebrates,
uud the    fragmentary character of the plant-remains — the ilotsam and
jetsam of vanished rivers, lakes, and seas— is quite sufficient tu
account for the preference that is given to palieozoology.          When a com
 petent  investigator, therefore, devotes himself to the difficult study
 of fossil botany he is deserving        of every encouragement;       and when
 his researches    have resulted    in eminent success, they must claim the
 ungrudging appreciation of all who wish well to geological science.
 The researches in which Mr Robert Kidston has been engaged have
 made   his reputation     amongst geologists everywhere.             Trained in
 botanical   science   by  the   late   Professor   Dickson,    under   win 'in he
 studied  for some years, Mr Kidston took up the somewhat ungrateful

420            Proceedings   of Royal Society of Edinburgh.               [sess
study of pateophytology,          devoting himself more particularly, as
 might have been expected, to palseozoic botany.          In this department
 of science he has contributed upwards of thirty papers — all of which
 are characterised    by accurate    observation and clear definition ami
 description.
     One of the principal objects of his studies has been to determine
 the affinities of palaeozoic genera and species with those of existing
 forms.     With this view he has described the fructification of a
 number     of carboniferous ferns and      lycopods,  and    has also given
 special   attention to the     arborescent lycopods of the same great
 system.      Another   important object he has constantly kept before
 him has been the working out of the horizontal and vertical distri
 bution of the carboniferous plants of Britain.        He has consequently
 been led to compare the plant-remains of the several British coal
 fields with each other and with those of the coalfields of other
 countries,   and has thus    thrown much     wished- for  light  on the rela
 tive age of widely separated areas of carboniferous strata.
     Mr Kidstou's more important papers have generally appeared in
 the TransaHiom of this Society.           The first of the series, dealing
 with the fossil flora of definite areas, was his " Report on the Fossil
 Plants collected by the Geological Survey in Eskdale and Liddes-
       "
 dale     (Trans. Hoy. Soc. Edin., vol. xxx.), which was followed at
                                 "
 intervals by papers on the Fossil Flora of the Radstock Series of
 the Somerset and Bristol Coalfield" (Ibid., vol. xxxiii.), "On some
Fossil Wants from Teilia Quarry" (Ibid., vol. xxxv.), and "On
the Fossil Flora of the Staffordshire Coalfields" (Ibid., vol. xxxv.).
Several papers treating of the fructification of ferns have likewise
appeared     from time to time     in the publications of this Society and
the Royal Physical Society, as also in the Annals and Magazine of
Naiural History ; while the same subject has been dealt with by Mr
Kidston in his papers descriptive of the flora of various coalfields.
His wide and accurate knowledge of his subject was recognised by
the authorities of the British Museum, who requested him to pre
pare the Catalogue      of Paheozoic Plants in the Museum (188G).
    For  the great zeal with which he has pursued his researches, and
the extensive     additions to our knowledge which have resulted          from
his labours, the Council of the Society has deemed Mr Kidston              well
worthy to receive the      Xeill Prize.

                            (Read January    20, 1890.)
   Another of our Fellows has gone to his rest.            Dr Andrew Graham,
Fleet Surgeon, Retired, died at his residence at the Albany,           Piccadilly,
 London, on the 1st December 1889, in the 73rd             yeprof his     age.     He
was  also a  Fellow of    the Royal Geographical Society, London.
   He came of    a  family of medical practitioners.        His grandfather, Dr
Andrew     Graham, settled in Dalkeith upwards of            a  century ago, and
after some   forty  years of extensive practice, died in 1824, leaving five
sons,  four of whom were graduates            in medicine in      the Edinburgh
School.     The eldest of     these,  Dr Walter Graham,         the father   of   the
subject  of the  present notice,     assisted his father for many years, and
lied of fever contracted in practice at Dalkeith in 1827, while the
subject  of our notice    was but a boy of about ten years of age.             After
passing the earlier stages of his education, the latter prosec uted his
studies at the   University of Edinburgh.            At  the medical classes he
was a  diligent and successful     student, and in 1837 became a licentiate
of the  Royal College, of Surgeons.        In the following    year he graduated
as  doctor of medicine ; and shortly thereafter,        on the 19th November
1838, he entered      the service of his Queen and country as an assistant
surgeon in the Royal Navy.           He became staff surgeon on 27th July
1817, and fleet surgeon on 22nd         June   1864 ; and, after a     full period
of service, retired (with retired pay) on 1st         April  1M70.
   He served for some time in the Mediterranean and East Indies                      ;
and during the Russian war he served as surgeon               on board     the Hag
ship in the Baltic, under       Admiral Sir Charles Napier. At              a later
date he served    in the West Indies in H.M.S. "Agamemnon,"                  under
Captain Thomas Hope,         Pinkie.
    He received    the Baltic medal, and also Sir Gilbert           Plane's gold
medal.
    Wherever   he served, he proved himself an able and accomplished
navy surgeon, admirably cool in danger, and attentive, botli in times
of  peace and  war, to the health and welfare of those under his               care.
    He was of a quiet unassuming disposition, and endeared                 himself
by his goodness of heart to all who were acquainted with him.                    He
died a bachelor; but though many of his friends had gone before,
he is survived      by many — friends, relatives, brother officers,             and
fellows — who will sincerely mourn his         loss.

Sir James Falshaw, Bart. By Bailie                 J. A. Russell,         M.A., M.B.
                             (Read January   6, 1890.)
    Last Juno Sir James Falshaw, Bart,              J. P.,  D.L., who had            been
long and honourably known in connection with railway and muni
cipal matters    in Scotland, died in Edinburgh,                at the age        of   79.
He was the son of a wool merchant in Leeds, where he was born
on 21st March      1810, the sixth of a family of fourteen              ;  but     it was
in Scotland that he won fortune and reputation, and that he finally
settled.    At school     he   sat  on the     same     bench       with     Sir John
Hawkshaw        under    Mr Jonathan       Lockwood,         and at the           age    of
fourteen ho was articled for         a seven     years'    apprenticeship to Mr
 Cusworth,     architect and surveyor.          At this time           he     laid     the
 foundation of his first success by mastering               the subject of skew
 arches.    He then    became agent in charge of a section             of the Leeds
 and Selby Railway for the contractors Messrs Hamar & Pratt, who
 subsequently    appointed him to the entire charge of the construction
 of the "Whitby and Pickering          Railway.        In this bit of work              he
 gained   experience    of steep gradients,     curves,     and other difficulties
 which afterwards stood him in good stead.               Thereafter he obtained
 the   position of chief-assistant     to  Mr G. Leather,           engineer       of the
 Aire  and Calder Navigation, Goole Docks, &c.                   During      the seven
 years ho was with      Mr Leather    he had      a share      in preparing many
 important     engineering schemes,       among       which       were     the      Leeds
 Waterworks, involving a tunnel of            1^   mile, the Bradford             Water
 works, and tho Stockton ami Hartlepool Railway, of which Mr (now
 Sir John) Fowler      was resident engineeer.         "When      33 years of age,
 just at the time when the great outburst of railway construction
  was in progress, he began business        on his own account as              a  railway
  engineer   and contractor,     and achieved considerable success.                     He
  then joined    the  staff of Messrs     John      Stephenson & Co. in                the
  making of the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway,                  which now          forma
  part of the London and XorthAVestem              Trunk Line.          This     engage
  ment brought him into contact with          Mr    Brassey and      Mr     Mackenzie,
  who    were   associated    with   Mr   Stephenson,         and with         the    first
  named    well-known      engineer he     enjoyed      a   life   long     friendship.
  Under the auspices of this firm, Sir James Falshaw                  took     a leading
  part  in  making     large   portions of the        Caledonian        and      Scottish
  Central Railways      and Scottish     Midland Railways.               In    1851     his

connection      with the firm of Messrs John Stephenson &             Co.    ceased,
and     Mr Falshaw joined Mr Brassey as contractors for the construc
tion of the Inverness and Nairn and Elgin Eailway, Mr Falshaw
taking the entire management.             By himself       he contracted    for the
upkeep for seven years         of the Scottish Central and Scottish Mid
land Lines, and for the construction of the Denny branch Scottish
Central Eailway,         and the     Portpatrick,      Stranraer,  and Glenluce
Railway.        With Messrs Morkill & Prodham, two former              assistants,
he contracted for the Berwickshire             Railway and     the  Blaydon      and
Conside     Branch of the North-Eastern.
     He became     a director of various minor railways, manufacturing,
hanking, shipping, and insurance companies,                but never forgot the
duty which he owed, to devote a portion of his time to the public
good,    and took the opportunity of         a  four years' residence    in Nairn
to enter the     Town Council, whereupon           he was elected Senior Bailie.
In    1858   Sir James Falshaw      settled in Edinburgh, and at once began
to interest     himself in the affairs of the city.          He was returned to
the    Town Council in 1861, and three years later he was elected                   a
Bailie,    and on the resignation         of   Mr James Cowan         to   become
Member       of Parliament     for the city in 1874, ho was         elected   Lord
Provost.      At this time    the Town Council had to face many ditlicult
questions,     including   the promotion of no less than three             bills in
Parliament; and the city of Edinburgh owes much to the energy and
sagacity shown by      Sir James Falshaw in all        departments   nf the city's
work.      He showed great zeal in making preparations when cholera
threatened to visit      the town, and ho had a considerable              share   in
passing    the   Improvement      Trust Act, which has done so much for
tlie   health and amenity of Edinburgh.             Among     the improvements
executed during       his reign   as  Lord Provost       may be mentioned the
widening of Princes       Street, the widening of the North Bridge, the
opening of     West Princes Street Gardens           to the public, the covering
in of the Waverley Market, and the purchasing of the Arboretum.
Undoubtedly, the most           important      work    of Sir James    Falshaw's
municipal     life  was the introduction       of the Moorfoot water supply
into    Edinburgh    —a  scheme    in which       ho took a deep interest,      and
which was completed after his term of office as               Lord Provost had
expired,    but while he was Chairman of the Works Committee of
the Water     Trust.    His Baronetcy      was conferred upon him in 1876,

xxviii        Proceedings       of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
on   the   occasion     of    the  visit   of the     Queen to      inaugurate     the
equestrian    monument erected in Charlotte              Square  to the memory of
the   Prince Consort.         Sir James    also rilled the honourable        office of
Master of the Merchant            Company.       He    was long connected         with
the North       British Railway Company, of which he was elected
Deputy-Chairman in 1881, and subsequently Chairman, an office
which he held until 1887, when advancing                 age led  him to vacate the
more    onerous   position to again       become      Deputy-Chairman.         It  was
during his tenure of the chair that the Tay Bridge was opened, and
he had a    lively interest in     the  still greater undertaking promoted by
the  Forth Bridge Company, of which he was the first Chairman.
    Sir James Falshaw was elected an Associate of the Institution                    of
Civil Engineers in         18f)4, and became        a  Fellow of this     Society in
 18G6.
    He was twice married — first, in 1841,              to a daughter of the late
 Mr Thomas Morkell of Astley, who died in                 18G4;  and again in     1871
to a daughter of      Mr Thomas Gibbs, Norwood.                 Sir James   was pre
deceased     by Lady        Falshaw,     and left      no   family.    He   was     not
 only recognised      as   a   man   of sterling integrity,      but   one of high
 Christian    character,     and though of       a brusque demeanour,         he had
 many friends.       He     was a Wesleyan         Methodist,     and in politics      a
 Conservative.      In   the     conduct of public         business   he  was clear
 sighted and hard-headed,           utterly fearless,      and full of energy      and
 determination, and the           results of his reign — both at the Town
 Council    and   Railway       Board — were     generally excellent, though          it
 must be confessed,      in the words of the Scotsman, that his impatience
 of long speeches and his laconic methods of conducting                     business,
 occasionally staggered the advocates of liberty of speech.                  In   grati
 tude for his services to the city, his portrait              was painted by sub
 scription among       leading citizens,      and now hangs         in  the   Council
 Chambers.

 London, and his mother Eliza Anderson, daughter of James Anderson,

which he went abroad,         and studied at Giessen, Jena, Berlin, Heidel
berg,   Zurich, and Paris.       At Giessen he was the fellow-studeut of
Hermann        Kopp, Fresenius, Will, and other well-known chemists.
He returned       to England    in 1840, and lectured on chemistry at St
Mary's    and the Middlesex         Hospital.      In  1849    he was appointed
professor of       chemistry in Queen's College, Gahvay.             In 1856 he
gave   up his professorship, and took over the Bonnington Chemical
Works,     where the tar and ammonia liquor of the Edinburgh                     Gas
Works were dealt with.           At the expiry of the contract Dr Ronalds
retired from business, and lived            at Bonnington        House until his
death,   on 9th September        1889.      He  was a constant attendant at
the meetings       of the Society, and although ho rarely took an active
part   in its proceedings he always took a lively interest in every
thing    that    went on.     He had     an admirably appointed laboratory,
with    the   use    of which    he   was most generous        ; and among       the
numerous chemists who, either as students or teachers, have                    from
time to time      resided in Edinburgh during the last thirty yours, there
are  none who do not remember            him with affection.
       Joseph       J.  Coleman.        By Professor M'Kendrick.
   Joseph     J.  Coleman died on 18th December 1888,                 in tho 49th
year of     his age.     Trained   tirst  as a  chemist and druggist, ho was
early   led   to the study of chemical            science,   and so soon as in
his 22nd year he contributed            papers   on chemical subjects to tho
Proceeding*       of the British      Association.      In   course   of  time    he
became     chemist to the Young's           Paraihn    Light and Mineral         Oil
Company, and in this capacity made original                investigations on tho
gases   produced in the distillation         of bituminous       shale.   By    sub
mitting these to great        pressure,   at a low temperature,      Mr Coloman
obtained     highly volatile liquid hydrocarbons. This investigation
ltd him      to the problem of the mechanical production of low
temperatures, and to the invention           of tho well-known         machine by
which     a  low temperature is maintained in the holds of steamers
conveying large cargoes of fresh moat            from America and Australia.
 Along with      Mr James Bell, the method         was successfully carried out,

xxx            Proceedings    of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
 and  Mr Coleman's dry-air mechanical refrigerators           were fitted up in
 many steamers.        Mr Coleman acquired         a modest   fortune from his
 invention, and, retiring to Bearsden,        near Glasgow, he     built  a small
 private laboratory in connection with his house, and devoted him
 self entirely to original investigation.          He contributed numerous
 papers to the Philosophical       Society of Glasgow, to this Society, to
 the Society    of Chemical Industry, and to the Institution of Civil
 Engineers.      For many years Mr Coleman suffered from weak health,
 and at length his    frail body succumbed      to a complication   of disorders.
 He was   a man    of bright and lively intelligence, who took an original
 view of any scientific question to which his mind was                  directed.
 Although eminently practical        as a  chemical engineer, he had a great
 regard for the first principles of science, and even for those problems
in chemistry and physics that          are of merely speculative interest to
 most men.       Few were more gifted with the power of recognisiug the
 practical applications of scientific theory, and          it was this    quality
 of mind that led him to the invention              of the machinery for the
mechanical transference        of heat with which his name will always
 be associated.
   Franz Cornelius Donders.                 By   Professor M'Kendrick.
    This distinguished physiologist and ophthalmologist was               born iu
 North Brabant on 27th May 1818, and died at Utrecht                    on 24th
 March   1889.      Educated in the Dutch Koyal Hospital for Military
Medicine     and Surgery, he practised for a time as arm}*           surgeon     in
Vliessingen and in the Hague         ;  but an anatomical and pathological
investigation on the nervous centres           having attracted the attention
of the authorities, he was soon appointed lecturer on anatomy and
physiology to the lioyal Military Academy in Leyden.                  This  office
ho held   till  1848, when he was appointed professor extraordinary in
the   Medical     Faculty of    the   University of Utrecht; in         1852 he
became an ordinary professor        ; and   on the death of Schroeder         van
der   Kolk, in    18G2,   he was called to the chair of physiology.            He
filled this chair    till  1889, when he retired       in compliance with     the
law of the universities in Holland, by which no professor can occupy
a chair after attaining his seventieth year.         Soon after his retirement
his health gave way, and he died after a series of apoplectic attacks.

    In   1843, when physiologists         were    much occupied       with the cell
theory of Schleiden          and Schwann, Dondere carried on researches
with Mulder,        more    especially in the chemical examination of the
tissues   while    under the microscope.         He   also about this time came
under     the influence       of the great German physiologist Johann
Miiller,    whose     doctrines, more especially those relating to the
nervous system and the senses, have largely moulded the life-work,
not    only of Bonders, but of Helmholtz,              Carl Ludwig,       and many
other physiologists       in Germany.        In  these early years, also, he was
much occupied        with the study of the dynamical           characters   of living
beings, and     in   a well-known     paper on the Metabolism of Tissue as
the Source     of  the proper Heat of Plants and Animals, he showed how
the   skin acts   as a  regulator of bodily temperature,         and he discussed
the    relation between heat         and work      in  the   living  tissues.     The
fame    of Donders largely rests, however,          on his researches      on vision.
In 1846 appeared         a paper   on the Movements          of the Human        Eye,
mil this was followed            by many similar contributions            through    a
series   of years.     In  these papers, which were largely devoted to the
problems of single vision, the nature of the horopter, the conditions
of stereoscopic      vision, and the mechanism         of the movements        of the
eyeballs, Dondere substantially          laid the groundwork of our present
 knowledge of these subjects.          He   also wrote on the Relation between
 Convergence       and Accommodation, the Regeneration of the Cornea,
and on the    Use of Lenses in the.Treatment of Squint.                 After a visit
 to  London     in    1851,    when   he   became acquainted with the dis
 tinguished    ophthalmologist       von Graefe, ho resolved         to devote     his
 life chiefly to this department of the medical           art, and for many yours
 he enjoyed    a large    practice  as an   ophthalmic surgeon.          For twelve
 years he   edited the Nederlandsch Lancet, in the pages of which many
 important     communications on ophthalmological                subjects appeared
 from   his pen.     The great work of his life, however, was a volume
 entitled Anomalies       of Refraction and Accomuwdation,             a  translation
 of which    was published       by the New Sydenham Society.                Familiar
 with the     researches      of Gauss,    Listing, and Helmholtz,           Donders
 investigated mathematically and by experiment the optical conditions
 of the normal      eye, and showed how these were modiliod in myopia,
 hypermetropia,       and astigmatism.         He   also   discussed    theoretically
  the influence    of age upon refraction and          the mechanism       of accom

modation,      and he gave precision to the optical methods                for ascer
taining     and estimating anomalies             of refraction.      In all of these
researches lie not only showed himself to be an able mathematician
and physicist, but he enlisted the interest of the medical profession
at large     by the careful clinical records           given of individual cases
suffering from anomalies              of vision, and by         the   ingenuity     and
efficiency     of the      means     devised    for  their relief.     Bonders     also
contributed papers on Physiological Time in Psychical Processes, the
 Nature of Vowel-Tones, Speech, and the Cardiac Sounds.                       All    hi?
 writings are characterised            by exactitude of statement,         facility in
 illustration,    and     graceful diction.       The subject is always treated
 with    the hand of a master.             Of commanding stature, a dignified
 presence, a large        Apollo-like head with a luxuriant wealth of hair,
 dark somewhat           rugged    features,   and eyes that sparkled with the
 lustre of genius, Bonders was a man whose personality is not likely
  soon to fade from the memory.              Eminent among physiologists, chief
  among     oculists,   a great teacher,     and  a good    citizen, his life-work is
  thus summed         up by  his friend Moleschott :— "Of him it would               be
  difficult to pronounce       whether he was greater or more prolific as an
  investigator, or clearer or more effective            as an    expositor, or, lastly,
  more duteous        and helpful      as a healer   of that     organ  which   is the
  portal of wisdom and love."

                                  (Read January 5, 1891.)
      James Grant was the third son of the Rev.                    Dr Andrew     Grant,
   proprietor of the estate of Limepotts, in the county of Perth,                   anil
   minister successively       of Portmoak, Kilmarnock,            Canongate,   Trinity
   College,   and St Andrews, Edinburgh,             Dean of the Chapel Royal,
   and    Chaplain       in   Ordinary     to    George    III.,    George   IV.,    and
   William IV.
      lie  was born       in the manse of Portmoak,            Kinross-shire, on   '23rd
   January     1800, and     when     James was quite a child, his father           was
   translated to Kilmarnock.             He   there  received     the elements of his
   education,    and on his father's       subsequent     translation to Edinburgh

he    was    sent     to the       High School of this city,               and    afterwards
attended      the University,           both in Arts and Divinity.                His  career
there was marked with, distinction,                especially in the field of Classics,
and in Greek he was a class-fellow and                   rival of     I)r William Veitch
of   Jedburgh, the learned author of the well-known                           work on the
Greek     irregular      verb.       It   was    a tradition     that, at least in one
session,   James Grant           succeeded      in standing first, while Veitch           was
second    in the Greek         class.
    He was licensed           by the Presbytery           of Edinburgh,          and  almost
immediately thereafter,            in   1824, was ordained minister of the firj-t
charge    of South Leith.             There he remained        with      much acceptance
to the   large congregation for nineteen years, notwithstanding some
tempting offers of translation.                  Ho early    was     acknowledged        as  a
leader in the Church            Courts, and in 1837 was one of                 a  deputation
(which      included      I)r    Chalmers        and other eminent divines) who
 presented     in  person     the congratulatory address from the Church of
 Scotland    to Queen       Victoria      on her accession.         In   the same year he
 was one of a deputation                sent  by the General Assembly to inquire
 into the religious condition of the people of the Island of Skye.
                                                                                             "
     By this time the troublous               events   of the "      ten years' conflict
 had commenced,          and      Dr Grant       was much engaged            in its various
 controversies.        Many of        these are now matters of somewhat remote
 history, and      it would       be improper      in  a notice such as this          to stir
 embers of former          fires.      It  may be enough to mention that when
 the party opposed        to those with whom Dr Grant acted proceeded to
 the extreme act       of deposition of        some ministers      in tho Presbytery of
  Strathbogie,     Dr Grant         and    his friends denied         the   legality of the
  proceedings, and deliberately visited               Strathbogie for the purpose of
  holding   ministerial       communion with the deposed                  ministers.      For
  this ecclesiastical    offence the majority of the Assembly inflicted                   the
  nominal    punishment           of    suspension     from    judicial      functions     for
  nine months.         During his         suspension    he received        a largely-signed
  address of    confidence from his Hock, and the same year (1842) the
  University of Glasgow conferred on him the degree of D.D.                                At
  this time     also   he was        appointed     chaplain     to the      Highland and
  Agricultural     Society of Scotland, an honour which he much valued,
  and which      he retained        till his   death.     Next year (1843)           saw the
  end of the ten years'        conflict.     The parish of St Mary's, Edinburgh,

xxxiv         Proceedings        of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
had become vacant by the demission of Dr Henry Gray, who                          had
gone out     with the Free Church, and Dr Grunt                was offered by the
Town Council the presentation.               After full deliberation   he accepted
the translation, and the rest of his active ministerial life was passed
in St Mary's.      At   a later period of the same year he was offered by
the Town Council         a  presentation to one of the charges of the High
Church     (St Giles), but       ho   declined the offer.      He was also then
appointed Collector         of the "Widows' Fund of the Ministers                 and
Professors, an office which           he   held until 18G0, and in which his
remarkable talent for business found congenial scope.                 For  ten years
after his removal to Edinburgh              he was much occupied in a contro
versy which,     in its   day, excited bitter feeling, but which is happily
now nearly forgotten — viz., the Edinburgh Annuity Tax question,
in  regard   to the    manner in which funds for the payment of                   the
stipends of the ministers of Edinburgh were                raised.    Dr  Grant, as
one of these     ministers, was        a  prominent figure    in   the discussions,
and ultimately when the controversy was settled                  by legislation    on
the footing of the payment of a capital sum by the Corporation of
Edinburgh,     the interest of which was to take            the place of the old
tax, and to be applied           by   a  newly-constituted    Ecclesiastical Com
mission, Dr Grant was at once elected a member of that Commission,
and   ultimately    became        its chairman.      This was the period of his
greatest   activity, both in parochial work and in the Church Courts,
and in 1851 he became Moderator of the General Assembly.                         The
same year he received         from Oxford at Commemoration the honorary
 degree of   D.C.L.,    the only other recipient of that degree among the
clergymen of the         Church      of Scotland having       been    Dr  Chalmers.
 In  1SG0 he began         to retire    from active life outside      his parochial
 work.    His  attendance       in Church Courts almost ceased, and in           that
year he resigned      the Collectorship        of the Widows' Fund.         In  1871
he resigned     his parochial charge, and for the last nineteen years               of
his life he lived in retirement           from active ministerial work,       devot
ing himself much to the management of various religious, charitable,
 and educational institutions, in the governing bodies of which                    he
 held  a seat.    He  was for more than fifty years an Honorary Fellow
 and Chaplain of the Harveian              Society, and at the annual       meetings
 of that body he came in contact with many of the most                       eminent
 medical men in Scotland, including many Fellows of this Society.

     He became a Fellow of our Society in 1851, and for many years
was a     regular attender at the meetings, and he served for several
years on     the Council.        Although     not himself     a scientific worker, ho
took much,         interest in hearing of the          progress    of science in the
world,    but the      papers on the literary side of the Society, then more
numerous than of late years              they have been, probably had greater
attractions      for him.       He   passed    away on 28th        July  1890, at the
ripe     age    of   ninety,    preserving     his intellect      unclouded and      his
interest    in life   unabated     to the end.
     Although he could not be described             as a great preacher,    his pulpit
ministrations were appreciated            by his successive llocks, and his kindly
interest    in their welfare      secured the affection of many.         Probably his
most    characteristic quality was his sagacity            as a counsellor,   whether
amid the      turmoil of    ecclesiastical  strife, or, later in life, in the manage
ment     of the numerous societies and institutions with which he was
connected.         His memory wdl           be   cherished     as  that of   one    who
realised     the dignity of his high profession, and                exhibited    in his
 [itrson some of the best qualities of a Scottish clergyman of a school
 now fast passing        away.
               Professor Kolbe.            By Prof. Crum Brown.
     Professor Herman          Kolbe    was the eldest       son of the Kev.       Carl
 Kolbe of Elliehausen, near Gbttingen, and was born on the 27th
 of September         1818.     He was educated        at homo      by his father till
 his fourteenth      year, when he entered the Gbttingen Gymnasium.                  In
 April    1838 he began        the study of chemistry, under Wbhler, in the
 University of Gbttingen, where              he also acquired a thorough theo
 retical and      practical knowledge of physics and mineralogy under
 Listing and Hausmann.
     In  1842    Kolbe    was appointed assistant to Bunsen in the chemical
 laboratory of the        University of Marburg.            He took the degree of
 Ph.D. in that university in the following year, the title of his
 thesis being " On the Products of the Action of Chlorine on Bisul
 phide of Carbon."
     In  the autumn of 1845            he removed      to London       as assistant   to
  Lyon Playfair.         In  the spring of 1847 ho returned for a           short time
  to  Marburg,       and in the       autumn     of the     same year     removed     tu

Brunswick,      to undertake the editorship          of the great Dictionary of
Chemistry, begun by Liebig and Poggendorff in 1837.
   In   1851     he  was   called to Marburg          to   succeed      Bunsen,      who
had been translated          to    Breslau.     He remained in Marburg                 till
18G5, when, on the unanimous request of the Faculties of Medicine
and Philosophy,        ho was       called to succeed      Ktihn     as   professor      of
chemistry in the University of Leipzig.
   In   1870 he added to his professorial work that of the editorship
of the Journal       fur  prdktische        Chemie.      He died very        suddenly,
of heart disease, on the evening of the 25th November 1884.
   This short     notice of the principal        landmarks in Kolbe's life lias
been taken from the        full and interesting      account given by his son-in-
law, Professor E. v. Meyer, in the Journal               fur praktiache      Chemie.
   Perhaps the most striking            feature   of Kolbe's     scientific character
was its independence.           1 lis opinions and views        were his own, and
were    to   an extraordinary         degree   unaffected    by the opinions and
theories    of others.    This independence gives a peculiar value to his
theoretical writings, but it had also its disadvantages.                       The in
dividual     character   of his style of thinking and writing certainly
confined his immediate influence very much to those                 — comparatively
few — chemists who took the trouble to learn his                        language     and
understand his methods.              The ideas which he originated have now
been    to   a  great   extent translated into the            language      of modern
chemistry       and form      part     of  the   common        doctrine,    but many
chemists are unaware         of their source, and would scarcely              recognise
them in the form in which                they were     first published.        The    loss
to science was temporary,           and Kolbe's fame may be safely entrusted
to future historians       ;  but the misunderstanding,            which was      a mis
understanding        on  both sides,       led sometimes       to  a   kind    of   strife
painful to all the friends of those involved in it.
    It is not possible,      within     the limits   of an obituary notice,         to do
 more    than very briefly indicate the general character               of the    groups
 of investigations made by Kolbe, and of the theoretical conclusions
 he drew from their results.
    Kolbe's first great research, published            in   184-5,  was    on the    com
 pound formed by the joint-action               of chlorine and water          on bisul
 phide     of carbon.     This      substance    has   the composition CC14S0?
 and its investigation       formed the natural sequence to his graduation

by successively       replacing the chlorine by hydrogen, CHCL/SOjOH,
CH,C1S0.20H,          and CH3S02OH.
     A great series of investigations, beginning with            a joint work by
Frankland and Kolbe on the action of caustic potash on the cyanides
of the    alcohol radicals,    led Kolbe to theoretical views as to the con
stitution and relation to one another of the group of acids now known
as   "carboxyl compounds" and the corresponding aldehydes, alcohols,
ketones, etc.       These considerations profoundly iniluenced the history
of chemistry, although, for the reason already mentioned,                Kolbe   has
not even      now obtained full credit for what he did.         It is true that we
are   very apt to read old papers in the light of recent discoveries and
to   find in them more than their writers intended, and the composer
 of an Ri>ge      is specially liable to this error      ;  but it is impossible
 to read    Kolbe's    papers   without seeing that ho fully recognised,          at
a   time when no one else had a glimpse of the              truth on the matter,
 what is the real relation of the        " sulphone " and "    carbone
                                                                          "

 sulphuric      and carbonic       acids  respectively,    and   expressed     these

 the    discovery of the secondary          and tertiary alcohols     ;  and when
 Friedel published        his discovery, that acetone gives,         by treatment
 with nascent       hydrogen,    a  propylic alcohol, Kolbe at once declared
 that this must be one of his secondary           alchohols, and that on oxida
 tion it must give, not propionic aldehyde and acid, but acetone,                  as
 was soon after found to be the case.
      A  very early and most       interesting investigation by Kolbe, on the
  "                                    Valerianate    and Potassium        Acetate,"
     Electrolysis of Potassium
 belongs to the period of his short residence           in London.        The most
 striking result was the synthesis of the hydrocarbons R2, if we write
  the potassium      salt electrolysed    R'COOK     ; but the products of the
 electrolysis     were   very carefully examined by Kolbe, who detected
  among them the ethers         R'COOR.
      Another important and extensive series of researches bear upon
  the "oxy-acids."        His investigations on lactic acid, and the long and

  it  is right to note that it is to     Kolbe that   we owe our knowledge of
  the antiseptic action of salicylic acid.
       Besides numerous scientific papers, chiefly published              in  the Anna-

                                 (Read January 5, 1891.)
      The story of      a long life, spent    in the service of science, for the
 inost part tells it own tale, and is more or less independent of the
 biographer     ;   but it is different when       a  young worker, broken              in
 health,    and    thus hampered in his efforts, succumbs            before    reaching
 mil Idle age.
     Born in Aberdeen, Mr Matthews              commenced      life   as an architect
in the office of his father (ex-Lord Provost Matthews of Springhill),
intending to follow this profession.              At the age of nineteen, how
ever,     he   suffered    from a severe attack of typhoid              fever,    which
greatly enfeebled          his   constitution,   and permanently          injured hi*
lungs.      Though he made several          long sea-voyages       to Australia      and
America fur the benefit of his health, he only partially                    succeeded,
for the chest-affection        continued slowly to progress.
     Though     in   feeble   physical health, his active mind was            eager for
action,     and he was led to pursue            microscopical work.           He    then
entered       Aberdeen       University,     and   studied     various       biological
subjects    — ('specially      zoology — which     was     taught      by     Professor
Ewart, then newly appointed, and with whom                   a   friendship      sprung
up.      Greatly interested       in the subject, he resolved to devote               his

                                  Obituary Notices.                              xxxix
whole energies        to zoological pursuits.          His first    essay — communi
cated     to the British Association            at Southport      — was on " Wool
Plugs     and Sterilised Fluids," a subject for which his conscientious
exactness     and ingenuity        peculiarly    fitted him.        He concluded by
expressing      doubts as to the efficiency            of wool      plugs as filtering
agents when a strong current passed through them.
     When      Professor      Ewart was transferred to Edinburgh,                   Mr
Matthews        followed      him  —  becoming Demonstrator in Zoology in
the   University.         While in this position,        ho won the favour of the
students     and others        by his unvarying         courtesy,    punctuality,   and
attention to duty.           Professor Prince, now of St Mungo's College,
Glasgow,      who was associated with             him in class-work during the
summer of         884, writes of     him   thus   :—
                                                      " One of the brightest
                1                                                                 spots
in my      Edinburgh       experience    was my daily association        with Duncan
Matthews, a devoted and                unwearied worker amidst all the dis
advantages        of   ill-health   and bodily       weakness.        Ho   was a most
 accurate and painstaking           zoologist,   a  skilful draughtsman,       and was
 well acquainted with          foreign ichthyological        literature.    Edinburgh
 never had a more worthy and accomplished,                     or a more   unobtrusive
 and    kindly, professorial       assistant.      His published       papers  give  no
 idea of his      laborious     industry and      devotion to zoological work —
 work which social and other circumstances                  rendered    by no means    a
 necessity."
      Along with Professor Ewart he drew up and published                       a series
  of directions for the students of the Practical Class on the examina
  tion of various invertebrates— similar             to   those   used   in University
  College,    London.        The    critical   acuteness     of   Mr Matthews       was
  well fitted for this work, which, indeed, mainly fell on his shoulders.
  Yet    at this time he seemed to experienced               eyes to he on the verge
  of grave thoracic complications, and one could not but feel for the
   young    assistant gallantly       adhering to duty in the absence of his
   senior when the cold winds of spring told so heavily on his cough.
   Nevertheless,     no complaint        fell from his lips, and ho performed
   every task cheerfully        and well.      He subsequently, however, had           to
   interrupt his labours, and obtain partial relief of the symptoms by                  a
   visit to the quiet grounds of Springhill.                   Next    year  (1885) he
    published   a  very interesting paper on the presence of an oviduct in
    an adult male skate,       besides another series of the        joint  notes for the

  xl             Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.
  students on the dissection of the skate.                  These notes       gave    him
  even more labour than the previous publication on the invertebrates.
     Besides his duties in connection with the class of Zoology in                     the
  University,     he was    employed by the Fishery Board for Scotland                  to
  carry on      various    researches     on fisheries'     subjects    and     tabulate
  results, but he was not responsible for certain of the deductions
  made from the latter.           His singularly clear and cautious mind made
  him slow to arrive at         conclusions — especially in cases fraught with
  both   doubt and difficulty.          One of his earlier papers         on fisheries'
  questions was a most careful and methodical report on the sprat-
  fishing   of    1883-84.         He   accurately      pointed    out    the    various
  distinctions     between the sprat and the herring           (with the      exception
  of the pelagic egg      of the sprat — then unknown), and concluded                  by
 demonstrating that in the Firths of Forth and Tay, and in                            the
  Moray     Firth,    the   sprat    fishermen     captured     during     the    winter
 months 143,000,000 young herrings.
     Ho continued his         researches,   notwithstanding      very feeble health,
 in 1885,    and — his father being then Lord Frovost of                  Aberdeen     —
 he besides      took much interest in the arrangements for the meeting
 of the British Association at Aberdeen in the autumn of the                       same
 year.     He    attended     many of the        meetings    of the Association —
 especially    in Section    I)  (Biology)  — though      he did not communicate
 any of his papers.           He had much         to  do, however,     in aiding      his
 father in his entertainments at Springhill, and in making his                    guests
 (amongst     whom were Sir Lyon Playfair, President of the Associa
 tion, Lady Playfair,          and   Lord Rayleigh)        spend   a  most pleasant
 week.
     Now fairly entering into            the   spirit of the fisheries'       work,   he
 took up the question of the varieties of the herring.                 In   the skilful
 hands, and by the exact methods,            of Mr Matthews certainty          took the
 place of doubt, and though difficulties            still remained,   he at any rate
reduced      the errors     from limitation of observation to           a   minimum.
 Heincke's paper on the varieties of the Baltic               herring did not      come
into his hands before his own observations were nearly completed,
but he was able to make            a comparison of the methods.            The labour
involved      in this   paper     may be estimated        when it mentioned         that
16,000      measurements         and    20,000   subsequent      calculations      were
included, and that the general             size, dimensions of the head, differ

                                  Obituary     Notices.                              xli
ences   in the position of the fins, and other points, were elahorately
investigated       and tabulated with a tenacity of purpose                 and   innate
skill in the       manipulation of figures which were prominent charac
teristics   of Mr Matthews.           He cautiously concludes this preliminary
paper     hy    the    statement     that the     winter    and    summer      herrings
slightly differ, viz., in the        more    posterior position of the fins, the
doubtfully smaller          head     and   slightly   lesser   size of the      summer
herrings.
    About this time he also investigated the kindred subject of the
whitebait      of the Thames and Forth, and published, in conjunction
with Professor Ewart, his results in a short paper.                   The percentage
of sprats    and young herrings in these localities is given             — the   former
largely predominating.             In  the winter fishing of the       Firth of Forth
the   young       herrings     are   practically    absent,   and    in   that   of  the
Thames       they are in the proportion of only               6 per     cent.    As the
season advances         the number of young herrings increases              — reaching
in  Hay and June           80 per cent, of the shoals, but again             decreasing
in  July.
    He continued his persevering             researches on the supposed races of
the herring        in Scottish      waters, and    issued   a second      paper on the
subject     in  the   Fishery Board's      Report for 1887.          Here, again, the
careful nature of his work, his respect for the observations                  of others,
and    his    own sound deductions are noteworthy.                    As the result of
his laborious       tables   and long-continued attention to the subject,             he
states that there is no true          racial distinction between the herrings of
the various       localities around our coasts, and that the slight differ
ences     indicated in his former paper do not — after more extended
observations     — warrant him in making            a distinction.      The variations
in the position of the dorsal fin during the growth of the herring
would      alone     have   rendered     the   observer   careful   not to place too
 much weight         on the slight differences        formerly indicated, and one
 can almost sympathise with the earnest               young worker who so faith
 fully plodded through such a mass of materials — skilfully handling
 every available       point — yet with only a negative result           as the reward
 of his free expenditure of labour.                He, however,      had a talent for
 figures,   and his deductions were           always    characterised      by conscien
 tiousness and exactness.
     His investigations       on the herring had rendered          him familiar with
                                                                              d

the   anatomy     of the fish, and     more    particularly with the skeleton
and    its   variations.      Accordingly,      at   this    time     he    drew       up
an   elaborate     account of the       skeleton of the         herring,      detailing
every    bone     individually     and    in  relation     to    its   neighbours —
the    whole     illustrated     by   seven    plates,    for     he   had     a facile
and    accurate     pencil.    The   amount of patient and monotonous
work in this treatise is great, and must with his other labours                    have
taxed    the delicate frame of       Mr Matthews        to a dangerous        extent —
careful as ho was to       husband his energies — solely for            the advance
ment    of science.      The skull, vertebra1, fins, and other parts                  are
minutely described and figured, and the more important dilferences
occurring in the twaite and the allis shad, the pilchard and                         the
sprat, are mentioned.         This investigation     alone would have entitled
 Mr Matthews — as        a  skilful comparative      anatomist     — to   the respect
of every zoologist.
   This year (1887) was his most prolific one, for in addition to the
foregoing laborious papers he produced two others.                     The first con
sisted of a report on the examination of 400 stomachs                     of whiting,
the contents      of which were carefully tabulated.               His   observations
led him to believe       that the whiting     fed   for the most part on small
fishes and crustaceans,       thus differing to somo extent from the                 cod
and   haddock, both of which             had   a   more    varied     dietary.      The
second paper gave an account of the nest, eggs, and newly-hatched
larvse of the Kalian Wrasse (Labrus maculalus) from Broadford in
Skye.      Mr Matthews       was thus the first observer who recorded               this
feature in our country.
   The efforts of 1887 just recorded, and of the previous years — when
he several    times    lectured for Professor Ewart,         as   well as conducted
the class of Practical Zoology — proved too severe a strain, and he had
to retire   to Springhill,    his quiet walks amidst the beautiful             gardens
and grounds of which had formerly restored                  a measure      of   health.
There, as his brother-in-law,       Dr Ogston, tells us, he lived amongst his
specimens     and    aquaria  — " converting his      rooms     into extemporised
workshops and laboratories,          where    his investigations were           carried
on.    As his   strength    waned, these grew more intermittent, but even
to the latest    hour of consciousness       he remained        surrounded by         his
plants and animals, and showed his interest            in them."       A journey       to
London to attend        the funeral of his uncle,        Dr Matthews          Duncan,

a   kindred       spirit, and to whom he was tenderly attached,                                 danger
ously     exhausted him, and since that time his strength gradually
'liminished.            He died on the 24th November                            1870    at the age of
thirty-nine       years.
    Mr Matthews              had    a   singularly clear, well-balanced, and vigorous
intellect,      keen observation, and remarkable powers of application.
There     is,   indeed, no doubt that he would have achieved an eminent
position     in    science    if    his health had been                  favourable.       As   it   was,
he   became one of the               best authorities on the clupeoids, and no one
took     more interest in the group.                   Even when confined                 to bed, and
unable       to do more             than write briefly in pencil, he perseveringly
tried    to secure           anchovies, then appearing hero and there                           on our
coasts,      so     that       fresh      observations         on        this     form     might       be
carried out.
     Taken as      a    whole, the career of           Mr Matthews               is    an instance      of
exemplary devotion to duty — under great                            physical difficulties — in          a
held     he had deliberately chosen.                   Many men in his position would
have     felt the weight of physical illness sufficient to bear, and would
have passed         their valetudinarian hours in search of                        ease and repose.
Not so with             Mr Matthews.     Like Edouard Clapemle of Geneva, he
even adhered            to   his labours after repeated ha?rnoptyses — preferring
"rather to wear the sword out than let                           it   rust out."         The hand of
the gentle        young naturalist has vanished, but his accurate work will
remain as       a   proof of his resolute perseverence                    under difficulties, and
of   his loyalty to zoological science.

    The youngest                  son     of Major William              Yule of        the    Indian Army
(himself a devoted student of Oriental literature), Henry Yule was
born at Inveresk on the 1st May 1820.          The family had for
many            generations            previously          held     a   leading        place        among      the
well-to-do farmers                   of East Lothian, being settled                     in the parish           of
Dirleton, where they also owned some land ; and many of them lk-
buried in the old church of Gullane,  The subject of this memoir
had two brothers, who both distinguished themselves in India — Sir
George,             a    very     able    and       popular civilian,        and        Robert, who fell
fighting at the head of his regiment,                              the 9th   Lancers, before Delhi,
during           the      Mutiny.         The family is said to be of Danish origin,
the     name,             spelled       Jul,   or    Juul,         being still not uncommon                     at
Copenhagen.
      Henry Yule was at first intended for Cambridge, and probably
for the Law, for after leaving Edinburgh                                he was placed               successively
under            two           mathematical          tutors — Hamilton,                author         of    Conk

I     am        indebted for these reminiscences,                        says that           Yule "        showed
much more                liking for      Greek       plays and for German than for mathe
matics, though he had considerable                                  geometrical        ingenuity."           That
he had this seems,                     indeed, pretty clear             from the fact that on                 one
occasion            he solved a problem               which had puzzled the future                         accom

matter, addressed to                    Goodwin, being — " The               difference        between you

Engineers.             Whilst        at Chatham,             as        his contemporary                 General
Collinson writes :* "Although he took small part in the games and
other recreations              of our time, his knowledge, his native humour, and
his good           comradeship,        and especially his strong sense of right and
wrong, made him both admired                       and respected."

White of the Bengal Army                     ;   and on his return to India in 1852,

of     an    accident soon             after their marriage                  — was       unable         again    to
accompany            him.        Between        1843    and            1849     he was serving with
that group            of distinguished            engineer              officers   — among          whom        we

     These labours were interrupted in 1846 and 1848 by                                                the first
and second            Punjab        wars, in both of which he saw active service.
     The confidence                 already placed              in him by Lord Dalhousie                      was
shown by his appointment to an important post in connection with
the great scheme of Indian railways which that statesman                                               had just
introduced, and was pressing                            on with        characteristic      energy,          a post
entailing, from its novelty, much hard and anxious study                                          ;    and this
led on          to his         appointment               as     Under-Secretary           in    the        newly-
established            department of Public Works, to the head of which                                           he
succeeded             on the        retirement,         after    the    Mutiny, of his friend                  and
chief Sir W. Baker.                        In    the meanwhile, during the                     Burmese war,
he was          despatched            to    survey        the       frontiers of Arakan, when                     he
acquired the friendship of Sir Arthur Phayre,                                    a capable        and justly
popular          administrator,                 whose     name      will always be honourably
associated with               Burmese affairs.                  This acquaintance, no doubt, led
to     the      appointment of Captain Yule as secretary                                   to the return
mission of reconciliation despatched                                 to Burmah in 1855, after                   the
war, under Sir Arthur Phayre.                                   It    was     stipulated, however,                by
Lord Dalhousie that Yule should                                 be the chronicler of the expedi
tion,      a promise          amply fulfilled             in    a    Report to Government,                  which
was afterwards re-cast and published by Smith &                                      Elder in         1858, and
is interesting to us as his first independent work of importance.
     It    has       been     said     that his attention was first directed                               by his
Burmese          journey and studies to the affairs of those regions                                      beyond
India, on which he afterwards became so great an authority;                                                     but
the truth             is,   we find much of the knowdedge,                           and of the            literary
intuition, here already, and even thus early in his career we wonder                                               at
the variety of information                        displayed, and the luminous                         generalisa
tions put             forth,        both alike           destined      — and this         is    no        common
praise     — to       stand     the test of later and fuller                    investigations,            now so
much           more     easy to make.               The illustrations            are mostly from his
own pencil, in the use of which he was no mean proficient.

its many quaint         and pleasant       memories, as to a bright and joyous
holiday    ;  which,    indeed,   it  was.     But for one standing here on the
margin of these rivers, which a few weeks                      ago wero red      with the
blood of our murdered brothers and sisters, and straining the ear to
cateh the echo of our avenging                 artillery, it is difficult to turn the
mind to what seem dreams of past days of peace and security                           ;  and
memory itself grows dim in the attempt                      to repass the gulf which
the last few months            has interposed        between      the present     and     the
time to which this Narrative refers."
    He visited soon           after these       tragedies     the    historical   Well of
Cawnpore,       and afterwards designed the erection which encloses it.
    On his way homo from Burinah he was sent to report on the
defences      of    Singapore,     and      the    works      he   recommended          were
sanctioned by Government.
    Although       residence    in India during the latter years of his stay
became      in some       degree     distasteful      from various causes — among
others the prolonged absence from wife and child, and considera
tions of health — he enjoyed              the compensation          of feeling that his
character and services were appreciated                  in the highest      quarters,    for
the   confidence       and   regard, so    fully   and heartily bestowed          by Lord
Dalhousie,       were continued in no stinted measure by Lord Canning                        ;
the   intimacy becoming naturally greater, for such                       a  crisis  as   the
Mutiny briDgs out the deeper qualities of good men, and reveals
them to each         other.    His admiration for Lady Canning,                 and regret
for her loss — a victim          to the anxieties         of that terrible time — are
recorded     in   some touching lines to the memory of that charming and
gifted woman.           He retired from         the service     in  186*2,  with the less
hesitation      that Lord Canning, who was then returning to England,
had given       him the confident assurance that be should receive some
 suitable    employment.          And     no doubt        this would have        been     the
case had     Lord Canning lived.             But,   as may be remembered,           he died
 almost immediately after his return, and                      even     had   he left any
 political    heir, Colonel Yule would have been the last man to urge
 his own claims.          Full,  however,      of sympathy and interest, personal
 as  well    as   public,   in his     late    chief's    career,   he was     desirous     to
 write his life.         But   the family declined his offer, which                is to    be
 regretted,     not merely because           the various       short memoirs         he has
 since compiled       are models of what such             essays ought to be, but also

 because     the     deliberate     utterances       of such a man, treating,           as   he
 must have done, some of the more important Indian topics of the
 day, would have had much interest and value.*
     The harsh stroke of fortune, by which he was denied professional
 employment,          was a gain to        literature,     for the period of thirteen
 years    which       elapsed     before      he    found himself         again   in official
 harness    produced,        with other important work,               the book on which
 his literary reputation chiefly depends,                     viz.,  the   translation and
 editing    of      Marco     Polo.      It    seems     safe    to   prophecy     a lasting
 reputation for this work, since it is hardly conceivable                      that editing
 could be better        done, and its appearance in 1870                 placed   its author
 by common          consent,    here and abroad, in the very front rank of the
 geographers         of his time.        Yet its       appearance        was   not,   strictly
 speaking,       a surprise.         The    nature      and     extent of      the   writers
 learning was already            known by various            essays on allied subjects,
 and    notably by         a  work     written       for the     Hakluyt      Society four
 years    previously,        entitled Cathay and the                Way Thither.         This
 important        work,     long out of print           and     practically    inaccessible,
 contains    a   fund of curious information              on     mediaeval    Asia, and     on
 the relations from earliest times between China and the West, more
 especially     during the period of Chinese                exclusiveness      which inter
 vened    between        the   fall of    the    Mongols and           the  arrival   od   the
 scene,  two      centuries    later, of the Portuguese             and   Spaniards.      But

Accompanied         by two subalterns,         under a heavy fire, he carried a bag of
gunpowder       to the gate of the fortress and blew it in, enabling our troops
to enter.     A leading newspaper, writing his obituary, stated that Thomson
"was present at the capture of Ghuznee," on which Yule characteristically
comments — "The fact will hardly be controverted ; we believe it is also true
that Todleben was present at the defence of Sebastopol." These are all in
the Royal Engineers' Journal.            A notice of Sir Arthur Fhayre is in the
R.G.S. Proceedings for 1886. There is also a very curious notice of George
Straehan, an early Persian traveller, in the Asiatic Quarterly Review, v. 10.

among the merits and attractions of this famous book is the style of
the translation             itself.       It   is archaic,     and yet living, and instinct
with the very spirit of the old Venetian.                             The translator has lived

brethren five hundred years his juniors.                          How thorough-going                   the
intimacy, is sufficiently shown by the preface, written in fourteenth-
century French, to the second edition, and which some rnatter-of-fact
readers,        though      greatly puzzled, are said not to have discovered                            to

that it was in itself important, as adding to the wealth of the
world.        It is diilicult to think of him as ever asking " Cui
bono?"
     He has been accused of being deficient in a sense of literary
proportion.         The   chief   ground     for the       charge,   and perhaps its
excuse, may be found            in his extraordinary fulness of knowledge,
 always     at    hand   and    ready   to   come      forth.    He used       often     to
                                                          " uselessness,"

 Unite    enjoy the charge        from its humorous side.               But his    whole
 heart    was in his subject        as  he wrote,      and    his conviction of the
 importance of his subject infects the reader, whose judgment                      at the
 same time is gained          by the assurance which comes to him of the
 truthfulness       and  appositeness     of the     references,      the  comparative
  values    of which, besides,        have    meanwhile been all worked                out
 for him.
     It would      be beyond the scope of this paper               to institute a com
  parison between our present          knowledge of the physical             geography,
  and of the condition in mediai val times, of Central Asia, and what
  was available,      under either head, iu Colonel Yule's younger                  days.
  It  sounds     like  exaggeration     to compare        Central Asia     before Yule,
  with Central Africa before Livingstone             ;   but the comparison is        less
  far fetched than might bo supposed.              And      even now, notwithstand
  ing the extensive labours of recent explorers — often carrying Yule's
  Marco Polo in their hands, and always revolving                       in their   minds
  some problem he has suggested               or illustrated    — there    remain     vast
  tracts   virtually    unknown, and       some great        hydrographic      questions
  only partially solved.         And,  as  in respect of the geography,            so too
  in the mediaeval history and archaeology             ;  the awakening      of interest,
  and    the   direction of research, are largely due to the influence                    of
  these works.        The sources of knowledge existed, indeed, before,                but
  they were        remote   and    unfamiliar,    and above         all undigested     ; it
  needed     his intuitive    power of sifting and collating, separating                the
  wheat from the chaff, while throwing a glamour of interest over                       all,
  to make such a subject at once intelligible               and popular.       I may be
  allowed to confirm this estimate             by some words of Baron F.              von

 only    as a    scholarly writer and an expert                 in Asiatic geography,         but
 also   from     his position          on   the   Hakluyt        and   Asiatic    Societies,     is
 specially    conversant       with Colonel Yule's work                  He dwells on " his
 rare skill    in making intelligible to his readers the most perplexing
 and    confused        accounts      of geographical        explorations, the thorough
 way in which            he mastered        his authorities, and knew from a con
 scientious      study of their            works      how much reliance            was    to   be
 placed on them.             Take his Marco Polo and open it at any page,
 and    you     will find        as much        learning      in  a   single note     as   some

 himself    emphatically in the same sense, both from the literary and

enhanced        by a compulsory residence                  at    Palermo, where        he    had
taken up        his abode in 1864 on account of his wife's health.                           The
comparative         nearness to the great           Italian libraries       was, however,      an
assistance;        and in truth           his references         were    drawn from every
corner of the         world, and       he had occasionally          to wait for months        for
the   verification        of a single statement              by a correspondent,         in the
heart,   maybe, of China or Tartary.                    But such labour was repaid by
a  correspondence           often of great interest, and by the acquaintance,
not   seldom        ripening       into fast friendship, of many distinguished
men    of various countries,            and not the least of Italy, where such an

edition of her famous           traveller was received,         as was   natural,   with
warm appreciation.*
    Of   the remarkable intuition            with which he was wont to resolve a
geographical       puzzle,   a single instance        — as it   deals with a curious
piece of geographical        scandal   — may     be quoted.      In  the years follow
ing 1800 the countries lying between the then Russian frontier and
 our own were the object of very keen interest to geographers, the
political    rivalry    underlying        this    interest    being   not   less keen.
Accordingly,       much surprise was felt in this country at the discovery
 that   there existed    at the Russian War OUice a narrative of explora
tion in those        countries by      a   certain German baron, said           to have
 been in the employ of the            Indian      Government.        The authenticity
 of the    narrative was warmly maintained by Russian geographers,
 but it was proved        that no such person as the traveller in question
 had been in the service          of the Indian Government, and on other
 counts    the    narrative was      pronounced here, by Sir H. Rawlinson
 and Lord Straugfoid, to be           a  forgery.
    It  was, however,      a circumstantial story, and its geography              agreed
 with the map published from Jesuit sources by Klaproth.                          Along
 with this document there was another, purporting to be                       a transla
 tion (by Klaproth) of           a Chinese       traveller  ;  while a collection       of
 papers of similar tenure, which had been sold                    by him for     a large
 sum     to our Foreign        Office,    came to light       about   the  same     time.
 Colonel Yule, on close examination of the positions of                       places    in
  Klaproth's      map, observed      a   uniformity of error founded evidently
 on   some     principle,     and    finally     discovered     that   certain   of the
 separate    squares    on which, according            to the Chinese practice, the
 map     had   been    originally    drawn, had first been omitted, putting
 thereby    the longitude of places to the west of the lacuna, so caused,
 too far to the       east; then, the error           having been discovered,          the
 missing portion had been inserted, and again                 a certain  uniformity      of
 error appeared in the positions           ;  and this last time he discovered that
 this portion of the map, when being inserted, had been accidentally
 turned round in an angle of 90° (making east north, and                           north

Chinese            maps        the names         are    written     perpendicularly             instead    of
horizontally.                 And, in conclusion,          as the    positions thus falsified in
the map agreed                  with those given to the places in the narratives in
question,           the latter         were    evidently     fictitious, and but too clearly
from       the pen            of the able geographer               who was probably the only
person capable                of having concocted           them    !
      The errors,             honest     enough         as far as the         map       was     concerned,
affected our own atlases                   during many years.*
      The introduction                  by Colonel        Yule     to    Captain Gill's Rirer of
Golden Sand              f brings       a mass     of lucid research              to bear on the vast
rirer system which, originating                          on the plateaux of Eastern Tibet,
sends its streams                either eastward          through China, or south, in long
)»rallel      courses, to the Indian Ocean.                        The whole question,             of great
difficulty owing to the inaccessible                         and        little known character             of
the region, had                occupied his mind for many years                    ;   the distinguished
French         explorer         of    the Mekong, Francis Gamier, being one of his
many sympathetic                     correspondents.
     After         his    wife's        death,     in    1875,     Colonel         Yule       returned     to
England,            where        he was very warmly welcomed,                          and was at once
placed on the                 Indian Council.           Although not many years after this
lie   was attacked                   by the wasting disease              to which         he eventually
succumbed,               we find        but little       diminution,         up to the last, in his
recorded        work, while the amount of unrecorded                               work, friendly help
given, ofteu              under the heavy               pressure    of physical           prostration,      to
the     literary labours of others, was very great; his keen appreciation,
in    fact,    of such labour                 attracted     his sympathy irresistibly                to   the
workers         themselves.              And      his interest      in all    else that life had            to
offer   —art, in politics, in discovery, in social and philanthropic
              in
movements, in the welfare of his friends — continued to the last

of    Mr Fulwar Skipwitb, late of the Bengal C.S. — brought into his
life an episode                of hardly four years' domestic                 happiness,        unclouded,

her   just when his own health          was declining, and his need of such
compauionship the greater.
    Among other subjects of interest to him in these latter                 years,   the
Hakluyt Society       had naturally a prominent           place, its objects      corre
sponding closely       to the    line which he had made more especially
his own    ; and not a few      of  the merits of various works by others in
that series have been due, as their authors would willingly admit,
to the help      he so ungrudgingly       gave.      His own      last work in the
series,   The Diary of Sir William Hedges, to which he devoted
much of his latest energies — poured out like the profuse flowering
of a dying tree — overflowed into a             third   volume,    which contains,
inter alia,     a   mass   of curious documentary material towards a
 biography of Thomas Pitt, grandfather of the first Lord Chatham, and
 of " Pitt Diamond         celebrity — the story of that famous stone being

 given at length.       It was but very shortly before          his death that        he
 resigned    the  Presidency of this Society, and sent               for his    accom
 plished fellow-labourer, Mr Clements Markham, to express the                      hope
 that he would succeed him there.              He was, naturally, an honoured
 member and Gold Medallist of the Royal Geographical Society, and
 an   Honorary     Fellow of our own Scottish Geographical                     Society.
 He received     the   LL.D.    degree from the University            of Edinburgh
 at its tercentenary     commemoration.         He was also President, till his
 health   failed, of the Asiatic        Society, and was wont to urge its
 claims for support from all interested         in our Eastern Empire.
    He was always on the look out for fresh materials for                     a second
 edition or supplement to his Glossary of Anylo-Indian Collo-juial
  Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Term*,l which appeared in
 1880, the compilation of which, apart            from the sense of exhaustion
 which work produced,         had been to him,       as he says     in  the touching
 dedication to    his brother, " trium ferine lustrorum              oblectamentum
et  solatium."      Each of the terms is used          as  a peg whereon to        hang
 the quaint medley of illustrations           and references        collected    in his
 miscellaneous     reading,   and stored   till wanted in      the chambers of an
 unfailiug    memory.       The book was begun in connection with Dr
 Arthur Bumell, and        owes much to his great philological knowledge;
but he died soon after it was commenced,                 and   some seven-eighths
of the volume is Colonel Yule's.            The book is far less known,             and
its merits less appreciated,       than they deserve to be.

liis style of work, and the paper on
                                                   " Lhasa " is also valuable.*
    He was singularly happy in the composition of monumental and
other inscriptions;          and, in a very different line,          in his   poetical   etl'u-
sions, sometimes grave,            but others highly humorous, and occasionally
in good Scotch.           He had begun          shortly before       his death to collect
his fugitive      pieces,    with sketches and photographs illustrating them,
and    it   is to be     hoped some instalment of these may                   see the   light
before long.
    The humorous verses, and               the inscriptions        referred to, recall two
marked features          in his character;       a deep seriousness,       with occasional
despondency,         and for antidote a keen and delightful                 humour, never
far from the         surface      in his   conversation       or his writings.      And      he
appreciated       humour in others, so long              as  it was free from      cynicism
or   unkindliness ;         this revolted him, for he had                great   delicacy of
feeling,     and a warm and             tender   heart, with a ready sympathy fur
real   sorrow,     though small patience             for the unreal or conventional.
If   he was     vehement         in   assertion,   and scathing in denunciation of
all that to      him seemed mean, or             fal.se, or    unjust, this came mainly
from the        old     Scottish     sense of the seriousness          of life, and of the
importance,        in all things, of being on the side of truth and right.
For personally his simplicity               and humility were alike marked                 and
touching,       though      his presence had all the personal                dignity of one
who knew           he had       long and steadily followed             a  lofty ideal.       He
had a large        capacity for friendship, and in his rooms the walls, and
 even     the    doors,     were covered       with the portraits of his principal
 friends, as also         with     a very interesting and complete             collection he
 had   made of        portraits of the Governors-General and Commanders-
 in-Chief of India.
    It  was     only a few months before               his death that he resigned             his
 place    on the        Indian Council, which             the kindness and         considera
tion of his colleagues              had enabled      him to retain far longer than he
 could      otherwise        have     done.      Here his services          had long been
 valued, not       only for the extent of his knowledge, and his clearness
 of perception,         but from the spirit and tone in which he was wont to

handle    public    questions.      And,     indeed,  by many who knew but
little of him from the scientific side, he will be long remembered                as
an example     of chivalrous integrity, and for his consistent and often
fiery protests against all that was unworthy and base.
    As  a striking   instance    of the clearness of    a  strong mind amid    the
final prostration of the body,         I  may quote the    dying reply — instinct
with    more   than the old Roman's dignity, while resting on             a higher
faith —-which he dictated in Latin to the                 French Academic dw
Inscriptions     et Belles Lettres, which          had just   made him a Corre
sponding Member.

      Pkofessor Sir DOUGLAS MACLAGAN, President,
                                       in the Chair.
                        Chairman's Opening Address.
                                 (Read December       1, 1890.)
    My duty this evening            is to give the usual Introductory                  Address
at the opening of a new Session, this which commences                            this evening
being the Society's 108th.
    Before   doing      so,  however,     I   must try to disburden myself                    of a
weight which has hung heavy upon me for the last few                                 days, and
consists   in   the difficulty,        which     I  find to be insuperable,              how      to
select adequate       terms     in which      to express      my sense of the            honour
which you have conferred              upon me, in placing           me   in the position          of
your President.           In my wildest           dreams    it   never     occurred        to me
that such an event was possible,               till  a short while ago when certain
members      of   the      Council     hinted to me that such                 a step was in
contemplation      ;   and    I  can assure you that          it  was not without con
siderable    hesitation that         I   acceded      to the request          that    I   should
allow myself to be put in nomination.                       You will,       I  trust, believe
me, when     I  say that this hesitation            in no way       arose from any want
of appreciation on my part of the greatness                        of the honour            to be
conferred on me.            It   was exactly the contrary.                What      I felt,    and
do feel, is not for myself,           but for the Royal          Society.        I knew       that
my life has been little else than that of                a practitioner and          teacher of
medicine.      However constantly              I   have watched         with      interest      the
]>rogres8  of Science in its various departments,                    my studies        and any
little work which         I  have done       have been chiefly          with    the object of
keeping myself au courant du jour for the purpose of teaching;                                 and
as regards    her real work        I have    been to Science, in Horatian phrase,
cultor parens       ct    infrequens.       I   feared,    therefore,      that the Roval
Society might suffer in its prestige                  by its appearing          to the outer
world   as if it had    no man of scientific repute to           fill its Chair.        I know,
of course, that this is not the             case,    that there are men among                 you
who by their published works have made for themselves                                 a reputa
tion that would have truly justified their elevation to the President
ship.    It  did not escape the notice of                  the Council,         and it must
have occurred        to all of you, that the man                 who stood out            as the

 worthiest successor       to Sir William Thomson was our indefatigable
  General Secretary.
     But Professor Tait,       with that    appetite     for work which does not
 know the meaning of satiety,          thought that he could be of more               use
 to   the    Society in his      present   office    than in the more dignified
 position of your President, and thus he sacrificed                 that distinction,
 which might be a legitimate object of ambition to any man, for the
general good       of us all.     The Fellows of the Society will not fail
 to appreciate     this act of self-sacrifice      on his part   ;  and   will   not for
a   moment fancy that        I  have less sense of the honour           I now enjoy,
 because     Professor Tait had not      seen fit to accept of it.

ment    of the Session, by the removal by death of ten of its • Irdiimry,
and one      of its Honorary, Fellows        ;   and he mentioned in the case of
several    of them a few of the incidents in their respective              careers by
which they had made themselves                  honourably known.          Sinco tliat

died,   and     I wibh to be allowed now briefly to say                a few      words
regarding each of them,
    Dr James Staek, who joined the Royal Society in 1850, was born
in Edinburgh in 1811.             He was the son of Mr John Stark, Printer,
also a    Fellow, and     a zealous   cultivator of Natural        History.       James
Stark      studied    for the medical profession at             the University         of
Edinburgh, and took the degree of M.D. in 1833.                       His Thesis       on
that occasion       was on the way in which             the colours of substances
affected    the absorption by them of odours to which they were exposed.
His experiments led him to the conclusion that odours                      were     most
readily absorbed       by dark surfaces       ;  and he conjectured that perhaps
contagious emanations          followed   a   similar law, which led him to the
somewhat wide induction that the established                dress of the physician,
      "
the      customary suits of solemn black," were the worst adapted                     fur
his profession.
    Dr James Stark is         most to be remembered          as a pioneer      in Scot
land in the cultivation         of that important and fundamental branch
of Sanitary Science,          Vital Statistics.       In   1854,   shortly alter the
office    of the     Registrar-General      for    Scotland   was established,         he

 4           Proceedings     of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                     [sm
 was appointed to be Superintendent of Statistics ; and, in fact,                  he
 organised   that valuable      department     of the     public    service.      He
 wrote much upon the subject of Vital Statistics.
    In  1846   he gave an interesting report on the mortality of Edin
 burgh and      Leith;   and   in 1847 published        an     inquiry   into     the
 sanitary state of Edinburgh,         and   the  rate of its mortality since
  1780 ; and   in  1851  he published his      Vital Statistics of       Scotland.
 He was also a contributor to the        Transactions of      the Royal    Society.
 No doubt his writings are now very much superseded by the                    subse
 quent works of such authors as Farre, Simon, Newsholme, and                   many
 others, but  it  behooves   us not to forget one who led the way in our
 country, when Sanitary Science had not attained its present              develop
 ment and its strong interest for the public mind.
    Ecclesiastically he was    a warm and thorough adherent of the               late
 Rev. Dr Robert Lee, and was an elder in Old Greyfriars Church.
    From long-continued and depressing          bad  health     Dr Stark    retired
 from official duty in 1873.       He thereafter lived quite in retirement,
and died at Nairn on 2nd        July   1890.
    The Rev. James Grant, D.D., died at Edinburgh on 28th July
last, in the ninety-first year of his age.      Dr Grant     was long a notable
personality in Edinburgh.         He was a son of the manse, having             been
born in January 1800 at Portmoak in Kinross-shire, of which parish
his father was minister.       The elder Dr Grant was afterwards             one of
the clergy of     St Andrew's Church, Edinburgh, and was Moderator
of the   General Assembly in 1809.         James Grant received his earlier
education   in the school of his native parish.          He    was afterwards       a
pupil of the High School of Edinburgh,            subsequently went to            the
University,   and having passed through the         Arts curriculum        entered
the  Divinity Hall, and in      due time was licensed.          He  was, in those
days of patronage,     appointed in 1824 to the first charge of               South
Leith, he being then only twenty-four years of            age.    In this    charge
he remained     till 1843, when he was appointed to the parish of St
Mary's in Edinburgh, and there he remained           till  he resigned in 1871.
He   was perhaps hardly what could be called a popular preacher in
the usual acceptation     of that expression, but his services were         always
listened to with much       acceptance,   because his sermons,        like   every
thing which he wrote or spoke, were characterised              by great   elegance
of diction and clearness of utterance.          No nan in Edinburgh            could

excel, and few equal,          Dr Grant in the often troublesome task of
proposing    or replying        to  a toast,  and consequently     he was      often
called on to perform such duties.             A  notable instance of this lives
in the memory of the present writer.              It was on the occasion of         a
dinner to Professor Symo, when, in the unexpected absence of some
one  who had undertaken the duty,             Dr Grant    was abruptly    called on
to propose     the toast of the Royal Infirmary, which he did in such
appropriate and elegant terms that his was decidedly                 voted to be
the speech     of the evening.
    Besides being an earnest parish minister, and            a zealous promoter
of education and of       all  measures    for improving   the condition of the
poor,   Dr Grant took      a   prominent     part, and had great influence, in
the Councils     of the Church of Scotland.           Though    always ready to
co-operate    in matters of philanthropy with the brethren of other
denominations, his         strong ecclesiastical     conservatism    led    him to
become a powerful        opponent of those of whose Church politics               he
did not approve.        In   the stormy predisruption      times, which culmin
ated  in the   great secession      of 1843,    Dr Grant   was   generally    to be
found in the front of the battle.            He sympathised with the Presby
tery of Strathbogie, who set at defiance the         injunctions of the General
Assembly, and was along with others put under discipline                ;  but the
chief result of this was his receiving an address from the Town
Council of Leith, which was signed by many, it is said by thousands,
of members       of  the  Church of Scotland,         approving   of his action.
That he retained the esteem of the Church was evidenced in 1854
when he received, as his father had           in 1809, the highest ecclesiastical
distinction which could be conferred on him, in his elevation to the
Moderatorship of the General Assembly.
    Dr Grant received         the degree     of D.D.   from the Presbytery         of
Glasgow,    and in the year of his Moderatorship           Oxford bestowed on
him the   distinction of D.C.L.
    Dr Grant    became a      Fellow of the Royal Society in 1851.               lie
is to be reckoned as having belonged to the class of literary Fellows,
but he was for long a regular attender at the meetings when scien
tific subjects were under discussion ; and when from his advanced
age  it became unsuitable          for him to   go out  in the evening,    he even
 during   his   last year      made     his appearance at the Extraordinary
 Meetings   which took place in the afternoon.

    Dr Grant held numerous appointments of             a clerical nature.         He
was a member        of the Ecclesiastical Commission of Edinburgh,               and
was its Chairman        up to about six months before his death.                  He
was    in  1841     appointed   Chaplain    to the Highland Society,             and
retained that office to the last.        He    was an Honorary         Member       of
the Harveian       Society of Edinburgh,     and was its Chaplain         for fifty-
five years, having been       appointed in 1844.       In   1888, at the 106th
Festival, the Society revived the title of Ponlifex Maximus, which
had been in abeyance since the time of Dr Grant's predecessor the
Rev.    Dr Moodie, and conferred it on its venerable Chaplain,                  who
had but rarely missed a meeting during his long incumbency.                       Dr
Grant was      a  genial man, though with a dry manner,            and was    much
respected    and esteemed by all who knew him.
    By   the death of    Dr James Matthews Duncan, British               Medicine,
especially in the departments of Obstetrics and Gynaecology,                     lost
one of its foremost men, and a blank           has been left in the ranks of
the profession which       will not easily be filled up.
    Dr Matthews Duncan was born in Aberdeen in                 1826, and in that
city he received his early       as  well as his academic        education.       He
graduated     there as   M.A. in   1843, and in 1846 he took the          degree of
 M.D.      He subsequently studied Medicine in Edinburgh,                bestowing
 special   attention on the subject of Midwifery           ;  and    thereafter     he
 went to Paris in pursuit of further knowledge in his own                    special
 department.        He  was   for some     time   a private     assistant to Sir
 .lames   Young Simpson, but unhappily          a quarrel arose between         these
 two distinguished men, which led to their alienation.              Duncan     there
 after settled in practice in Edinburgh,          becoming a Fellow of             the
 Royal College of Physicians        in  1851, and two years         afterwards      he
 commenced       to deliver  lectures   on  Midwifery and        the   Diseases of
 Women and Children, which, although at first kept in the                  shade by
 the renown and name         of Simpson, soon began         to show enough of
 brilliancy to attract an earnest though not large class of students.
 His reputation among his professional brethren, and subsequently
 with   the public, led to his acquiring a large and important practice                ;
 and on the illness and subsequent death             of Simpson,        he unques
 tionably    stood   at the   head   of the    Obstetric  Physicians       of Edin
 burgh.     This naturally     led,   when Simpson       died,    to   the   general
 belief that he       would succeed him       in his chair    ;  but    tho fact of

his having quarrelled       with Simpson had         a heavy, and     in many
respects    unjust, effect on his prospects,    and he was not appointed.
His failure, however, had no discouraging effect upon him, and ho
went on bravely and        with ever-increasing    success   with his practice
and his    teaching.
    In  1877 he was offered and accepted the appointment of Teacher
of   Midwifery in, and Obstetric          Physician    to,  St Bartholomew's
Hospital, and he accordingly removed          to London, to the widespread,
we may      say universal, regret of his brethren not only in Edinburgh
but throughout Scotland.          The reputation which led to his call to
London       was founded, and that justly, on the number, practical
value,     and,   above all,   the scientific    character of his      writings.
Numerous        honours were bestowed upon him.          He  became a     Fellow
of the   Royal College of Physicians of London ; a Fellow of the Royal
Societies of London and Edinburgh ; LL.D. of Edinburgh and
Cambridge;        and an Honorary M.D. of the University of Dublin.
In London        he soon acquired    a  very large practice,     having gained
the confidence      and esteem of the profession and the public           in the
English, as he had done in the Scottish, metropolis.
    Duncan's writings were numerous and important, and all partook
of that scientific     character which was apparent in all that he did,
both as an author and practitioner.             Many of    them    were   purely
practical, and chiefly concern       those   who are engaged       in the same
line of practice.      Beyond this largo circle lie is best known by his
Treatises     on Fecundity,     Fertility, and Sterility,      which    have   an
interest    not only to the practitioner        but to the statistician and
political economist.
    What was the source       of Matthews Duncan's marked professional
success ?      It was the genuineness       of his   character,   personal   and
professional.      Assuredly    it  was   from    no   blandishments      in  his
bearing      or demeanour,     for  though    a   perfect gentleman       in  the
 truest   sense of    the word, he was, as the Countess of Rousillon
says    in   "All's    well that ends     well," "an     unseason'd    courtier."
 There was a certain dryness and abruptness             in his manner which
 at first repelled some people, but a short knowledge of him, whether
 as patient    or casual acquaintance, showed that under this somewhat
 dry shell there was a soft kernel of kindness and true courtesy
 which made him trusted, relied on, and beloved.            It  was all founded

on his genuine sterling worth, so that he          fully merited the    encomium
of the aforesaid     Countess :— " His skill        was almost as great as his
honesty,    and had it stretched         so   far,  would have made         Nature
immortal, and death should have play for lack of work."
    Duncan had a naturally robust constitution, but it was ohserved
by his friends for some months before                his death that his health
was seriously impaired, and a general            feeling was entertained that
his   unwearied       devotion    to   work    was   at the root of this.         He
abandoned teaching and professional duty, and went for                     a short
and thorough rest to Belgium, and subsequently to Baden-Baden,
where he had      a severe    attack of angina pectoris, from which how-
over he rallied, and had made             arrangements      for his return   home
when he died suddenly on 1st September last.                  He left behind    him
his amiable lady, and       a  family of five sons and four daughters.
    James Matthews        Duncan      will long    be remembered      by his pro
 fessional brethren, and those who benefited              by his skill,  as a true-
hearted friend and adviser, an unobtrusively              pious Christian, and        a
genuine sample of that honest man who is the noblest work of                   God.
    David Milne Home of Milne-Graden                  was born     in 1805.      His
 father was Admiral Sir David Milne, his brother being Admiral                       of
 the Fleet  Sir Alexander Milne.           He assumed the surname of Home
 on his marriage     in 1832 with Miss Home of Paxton, in Berwickshire.
 He devoted      himself to the study of Law, entered              the Faculty      of
 Advocates in 1826, and at the time of his death                   was the second
 oldest member        of that learned body.           In   1844    he  was Senior
 Advocate-Depute, but did not continue to practise at the bar after                 he
 succeeded to the family estates.          He betook himself to country          life,
 but did not confine himself to the management                  and enjoyment       of
 his property, but devoted           hjmself   to Science,     for which he      had
 manifested    a   strong inclination     from his boyhood.          He  became a
 Fellow of   the Royal Society of Edinburgh             in 1828, and was for          a
 long time   a Vice-President and active member of the Council.                    He
 was Vice-President      of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society,              the
 Meteorological Society of Scotland, and the Geological Society                      of
 Scotland, of which he was elected            President in 1874.        This   office
 he held at the period          of his death.      In   1870    the University       of

    His favourite departments of Science were Meteorology and more
 especially Geology, for although            his first published paper was an
 essay on    Comets, it is by his geological writings                that he is best
 known.      Our Transactions        bear abundant evidonce           of his activity
and   industry    as a geologist.       In tho 14th volume         is to be found a
series  of papers      " On the Mid-Lothian and East Lothian Coalfields,"
which    attracted much attention            at  the time    ;   and in that same
volume there are two other papers, one on the              " Depiction or Drying-
up  of the Eivers Teviot, Nith, and Clyde," the other on "Two Storms
which Swept over the British Islands," both of which events occurred
in November 1838.           In the 15th volume of our Transactions          appeared
an   account    of the     " Geology of Roxburghshire          ;
                                                                 "

volume a paper        " On the Parallel Roads of Lochaber," which is doubly
interesting    as being of a controversial         nature,   his antagonist being
so  redoubtable a scientific warrior as Charles Darwin, who, howover,
with the courtesy of a true knight, subsequently acknowledged him
self to have been        worsted in the encounter.
   To the 25th volume of the Transactions, published in 1809, Milne
Home contributed           a paper   "On    the Origin    of tho Boulder Clay."
This subject had always           a   special interest for him, and         a goodly
boulder    anywhere        excited   in him      an enthusiasm which          neither
advanced age nor failing health could check.                He     was appointed by
the  Society Convener of the Boulder Committee which was estab
lished in 1871      ;   and under his supervision the Committee published
ten valuable     Reports, which are contained in the Society's Proceed
ings.    These are only part of           Mr Milne Home's contributions             to
Science.      He   was the author of many other papers both               within  and
without     the domain of Geology, and of two books,                     one on    the
"
   Estuary of the Firth of            Forth and Adjoining Districts           viewed
Geologically," and tho other on "Ancient Water-lines."
    Mr Milne Home had within              the last two years a severe and pro
tracted illness, which carried him off on the 19th September 1890.
He leaves us an admirable example of what may be done for Science
by a country gentleman possessed of means and leisure, but animated
by the laudable ambition            to extend     the knowledge of his fellow-
men.
    The Hon.     Lord Lee (Robert Lee) was born in 1830, and was a
son of    the   Rev. John Lee, D.D., Principal of the University of

Edinburgh.      He devoted himself         to the study of Law, and became
a  Member of the Faculty of Advocates in 1853.                  He  had a   fair, but
not what is regarded        as a large,     practice at the Bar      ; but he was
noted for his earnest      devotion to his duties both           as  Barrister    and
subsequently as a Judge.            He    was made an Advocate-Depute               in
1867, and held that office        till he was appointed Sheriff of          Stirling
and Dumbarton         in  1875,    from which he was transferred to the
more   important Sheriffship of Perthshire.               He  was for many years
Procurator of the Church of Scotland, and performed the duties of
that legal office with much earnestness and general acceptance.                   He
was raised to the Bench        in  1880.      He formed his opinions slowly,
deliberately, and conscientiously, and was very tenacious of them
when    once   formed, his firmness           in this    respect   being by some
cynical people called obstinacy.          His leading characteristics were his
earnestness   of purpose,     and his unwearied patience.            He became a
Fellow of the Royal Society in          1872, but       did not take any      special
part in its proceedings.        In private life     he was much esteemed, and
had a considerable fund of genuine humour.                  Robert Lee was for a
long time in delicate health, suffering for many years from bronchial
asthma.      He    had   been enjoying       in Ireland     a holiday,    which he
had intended extending to St Andrews, but a sharp inflammatory
 attack came on, and proved fatal on 11th October 1890.                      He left
 a widow, daughter of the late         Dr Borthwick of Edinburgh,              and a
 family of three sons and three daughters.
    Mr David Grieve was          educated      at the  University of Edinburgh,
 and became      a   solicitor-at-law.      He subsequently         entered     H.M.
 Customs, and was collector at Banff, Great Grimsby, and Dover.
 He took much interest in .Natural             Science,   particularly in Geology
 and Anthropology.         He   made a large       collection of fossils.    He   was
 several times President of the Royal Physical Society, and was elected
 a Fellow of this Society in 1872.            He died in June of last      year.
    As Medical    Science    sustained   a great loss    in Matthews Duncan,       so
 did Classical Literature in the person of Professor             William      Young
 !Sellar.   There was a considerable parallelism between the two                 men
 in their earnest devotion to work, in their clearness of judgment,
 and,  above   all, in their contempt for everything that was not in
 accordance   with the highest ethical         standards.
    Professor Sellar was the son of the late          Mr Patrick Sellar,     and was

born at Morvich,        in Sutherlandshire, in       1825.    From his earliest
years   he was a classical scholar.         His earlier education      was got at
the   Edinburgh Academy under Archdeacon Williams.                        He went
to  Glasgow University at the early age of fourteen, carrying with
him from the Academy so much of classical lore as to lead him to
go at once    into the Senior University Classes, whence he came forth
with highest honours in Greek and Latin, and much distinction in
the  other classes.      He  was elected to a scholarship at Balliol College,
Oxford,   in   1843.     In  1847 he obtained first-class     honours in Literw
humartiores,     and in 1850 was made a Fellow of Oriel.               He had for
contemporaries     a  brilliant  assemblage    of men more or less connected
with Scotland, two of them,Shairp and Grant, subsequently becoming
Principals     of Scottish    Universities.     After acting      as Assistant     to
the  Professor of Humanity in Glasgow, and to the Professor of Greek
in St Andrews,       he was   in 1859   elected   to the Greek Chair in the
latter   University, and from this he was transferred to tho Latin
Chair in Edinburgh in 1863.             Honours     flowed in upon him.           He
received    the degree of     LL.D. both from St Andrews and Dublin,
and    was   admitted      to the   membership of the Athenfeum                Club,
without ballot, "as being of distinguished              eminence    in literature."
Though his first published writing was an article on Thucydides,
which appeared       in the Oxford Essays,      the works by which he is best
known,    and for which he is everywhere appreciated,                were in con
nection with     Latin literature. His volumes on the           " Roman Poets of
the Republic," and the
                              " Roman Poets of the Augustan Age," hold
a foremost place in modern classical literature, have passed through
several editions, and are valued by all scholars,               British and Con
tinental.     His teaching    as a professor,  though his minute scholarship
was profound, was characterised by great breadth              ;  and he imparted
to his   students a large share of that with which he was himself
imbued, the insight which the study of the              Roman poets gives into
the political, social, and moral characteristics of the Romans.
   He had been working           for some time at        a  new volume of tho
Roman      poets,    which    would    embrace     studies    of Horace,       Ovid,
 Propertius,   Tibullus, and Martial, and which           a few weeks more of
 work would have completed.           But unhappily this        was not to be, for
 an unexpected     attack of hepatic disease proved fatal to him at his
 country residence     in Kirkcudbrightshire       on   1 2th October.      It  is to

be hoped that a volume so far advanced may see the light, as                    it will
assuredly give to the world another brilliant picture of Roman life,
though wanting the finishing touches of the master.
    By   the death of Sellar classical literature         has sustained a severe
loss, the   University of Edinburgh           has a Chair vacant, which he had
ably filled for twenty-seven years, and his colleagues                 and all who
knew him have to mourn their bereavement                  of a genial friend       and
accomplished gentleman.
     Mr Alexander Yule Fkaser               was born near Perth.        He   was edu
 cated at the    University of Aberdeen, where          he distinguished      himself
 specially in the departments          of Mathematics and Physics,            though
he    did not  neglect  the other subjects of the        Arts  course.
     After graduating with         first-class   honours    in Mathematics         and
 Physics,    he was    appointed second mathematical master in George
 Watson's College, Edinburgh.             When George Heriot's Hospital was
 opened as     a  day-school, Mr Fraser was entrusted with the charge
 of the Mathematical       and Physical Departments            ;  and   it is not too
 much to say that not       a   little of    the success   of this school       is due
 to the    energy with    which he threw himself into the work of his
 department        lie spared no pains in providing for the due equipment
 of the Physical       Laboratory,      and in preparing courses of Practical
 Geometry and Experimental               Physics    suitable   for   boys.     Just    a
 little over a year ago,   Mr Fraser       was appointed Headmaster of Allan
 Glen's Institution,     Glasgow, one of the most important technical
 schools   in the country    ;   and it was hoped that he would now               have
 an opportunity      of displaying to the full his special qualifications            for
 a  post of this nature.       But     he had been at work         little  more than
 two months when he was attacked with pleurisy and threatened
 consumption, and felt compelled to tender his                   resignation.      The
 governors    of the school, however, were so much impressed with                   the
 value of his work that they declined to accept his resignation,                   and
 granted him instead nine months' leave of absence,                     in the    hope
  that  a change   of climate, and      a  complete rest for this period, would
  restore him to health.       In   search of health     Mr Fraser visited       South
  Africa, where he resided for several            months.     About    three months
  ago   he  returned to this country, and resumed                his duties at      the
  beginning    of the present Session.           He  soon   found, however,        that
 his health was again giving way, and he had to resign his position

 finally.     He had   made up his mind to return to South               Africa with
 the purpose of residing there permanently, when he caught a chill,
 which led to acute inflammation           ;  and to this he succumbed           on the
 9th of November last, at the early age of thirty-three.
    One of the objects        that absorbed        a   very largo amount of            Mr
 Fraser's attention     during the last eight years of .his life was                  the
 Edinburgh Mathematical Society.                This Society     may be said to owe
its existence     mainly to him.        The     idea    of starting such     a  Society
originated     with him  ;  and   as its Secretary during the first four or five
years    of its existence,    he had all the         trouble    connected    with     the
arrangements       necessary    to   put such an         institution   upon      a   firm
basis.       This Society    is   now in its 9th          Session,   has   about 150
members,       and publishes     a   volume of Proceedin/js           annually.       Mr
Fraser has       made   contributions        to   nearly    every    volume     of the
Proceedings.       A   subject that interested him from the time of his
student days was the history of the controversy on the foundations
of the Differential      Calculus.      Till within      three   weeks of his death
he had      hoped to be able to give an address               to the   Mathematical
Society on this subject at the meeting held on the               1 4th of November.
It  is  still hoped that it may        be possible to put the notes             he left
on   this subject into    a form that      will prove useful.         Mr Fraser      also
contributed     several articles to the edition of Chambers's          Ennjchqxcdia
which     is now being issued.           The mathematicians that interested
him most       were   De Morgan and Clifford.               Of Clifford's     book On
the Common        Sense  of  the Exact Sciences, he wrote a review which
appeared in the pages of the Academy.                  In poetry Mr Fraser         had a
great   fondness for the works of Matthew Arnold.
    Mr Fraser was remarkable, among other things, for the activity of
his intellect,     an intellect     that could never be idle           ; and    for the
energy    with which     he devoted       himself to any work he undertook.
His friends always found           a  talk with him to have            a  stimulating
effect,  and many will find in the future want of this stimulus                    a loss
which it     will not  be easy to make good
    I  had intended     to have said      a   few words to the Society, chiefly
by way      of contrast, regarding the various distinguished men who
have    occupied this Chair since its foundation in 1783, but I have
already too much tried your patience,              and     have exceeded      the time
which     I   had assigned to myself for the delivery of this address.

     I   need not say that when                       I   mention the name of Sir                    "Walter

him at any time or anywhere, but especially here, and on Scottish
ground.            I    merely desire to state to you an interesting circumstance
which is perhaps                   new to most of you, and which does not                             appear
in that interesting Journal which has been                             so ably edited and pub
lished by Mr David Douglas of this city.                                  It       is that the Council
has recently made a valuable addition                            to the     Society's collection of
manuscripts              by securing            a    holograph     letter of Sir "Walter's, in
which ho tenders his resignation of the Presidency of the Society.
It   appears           that in the latter part of the year 1830,                              Sir   Walter,
with the view of residing constantly at Abbotsford,                                      contemplated
renouncing all associations                     which would detain him in Edinburgh.
In   a letter to his friend,                Mr James Skene, dated Abbotsford,                            18th
September 1830, he says                     :—
     " It   is time to            think what        is to be done about the Royal                   Society,
as the time of my retirement draws nigh,                            <;ud       I    am determined            at
whatever loss not to drag out the last sands of my life in that

subjeci for future consideration, as                      I   have not breathed                 a   syllable
about resigning the                  Chair      to anyone,       but   it   must soon follow                as
matter of course."
     On the 18th of the following month he wrote the letter to which
I    have       referred as having                  now come into the               possession       of the

"John Robison, Esq.,      Secretary    to the
      " Royal  Society of Edinburgh."
   This letter was submitted to the Council at              a meeting   held on the
8th   of November     1 830.       The following is the minute regarding it : —
    "Read    a letter from     Sir Walter Scott intimating his intention of
residing    in the country, and proposing on that account that                     he
should cease to hold the office of President of the Society.
    "The Council having           considered     his letter were unanimously       of
opinion, that although they could not under the circumstances                   hope
to have    the benefit of Sir Walter Scott's frequent presence amongst
them,    yet that it was very desirable for the interests and reputation
of the Society that he            should still continue at their head.           The
meeting therefore      instructed the Secretary to write on their behalf
to   Sir Walter Scott, and           to request      that ho would again      permit
them to propose his name as on former occasions                 of election."
    In  consequence     of his resignation not being accepted, Sir Walter
continued     to be President       till his  death.
    The other President whom             I desire to name     is the distinguished
gentleman who has been my immediate predecessor.                    Of Sir William
Thomson,      who held the post of President             for the  full term of rive
years   (1873-1878),       and who has now, at his own request, been per
mitted to retire before the completion of a second                term of office,   it
is perhaps sufficient to say that he leaves               our Chair only in order
 that he may be enabled to assume                 the corresponding post in the
 Royal Society, London.
     His position is practically unique, for, while second to none in
 the  rajiks of pure Science, he is absolutely without             a  concurrent in

 The grandest works of the engineer are usually based on very simple
 scientific elements, and his skill is shown mainly in new and bold
 combinations     of familiar      properties.       Thomson     has    done   much
 splendid    work    in this direction       also — witness his galvanometers
and electrometers,       his siphon-recorder, and his harmonic analyser.
 But it will never     be forgotten that       it   was he who so applied         the
profound analysis of Fourier         as  to render rapid signalling         possible
through a     submarine cable — thus making             ocean telegraphy      a mer
cantile success — so that       we owe     to him one of the grandest safe
guards of our empire,        our practically      instantaneous communication
with our    most distant and isolated colonies.
    You   have already at your election meeting expressed and recorded
your thanks to Sir William Thomson for his conduct as our President.
You will,    I  am sure,    with unanimity and cordiality, express your
wishes for his comfort and success in the sphere of distinction and
duty to which he has been called.
    Three Prizes were awarded during the past Session.
    The Gunning      Victoria Jubilee Prize for 1887-90              was presented
to Professor    Tait for his work in connection with             the   " Challenger
Expedition,"     and his     other researches         in Physical    Science.    His
contributions     to   Physical Science are too numerous for me to
enumerate ; but      in  reference to his " Challenger

attention to the ingenuity with which he has determined the
physical properties of        sea  water,   such as compressibility,        thermal
expansivity, and its temperature          of maximum density for any given
pressure.     He has also included in his investigation the compres
sibilities of glass.
    The   Keith Prize for 1887-89           was    presented   to Professor    Letts
for his researches      into the " Organic Compounds of Phosphorus."
The     work   was difficult,     and the results are of great importance.
The special interest of the investigations depends on the remarkable
similarities,   and equally remarkable dissimilarities,            shown by the
corresponding      compounds of phosphorus, nitrogen, and sulphur.
These researches have been published in our Transactions.

 On the         Occurrence of Sulphur in Marine Muds and
        Nodules, and its bearing on their Mode of Forma
        tion.       By J. Y. Buchanan, Esq., F.R.S.
                                 (Head December    1, 1890.)
     In  the first section of the cruise of the " Challenger,"              that from
 Tenerife to        Sombrero, the existence          was   established of deep-sea
 muds,     perfectly     free from carbonate        of lime, consisting mainly of
 silicates    mixed withochreous          material, principally      hydra ted oxides
 of iron    and manganese,        and of local concentrations of those materials
 in the     form of nodules and of coatings or incrustations on dead
  calcareous     matter.     The qualitative composition of these concentra
  tions was      carefully determined, and it was particularly noted                that
  whether in the form of nodules or of incrustations they were                    aggre
  gations    of the general materials of the bottom, and not concretions
  or coatings      of  pure hydrous oxides.
      On    the    section between Bermuda             and   the Azores some        very
  suggestive      specimens were got from the bottom on 27th June 1873,
   when the     ship    dredged    in 1675 fathoms in lat. 38° 18' N.,long. 34°
   48'   W.     A    number of light-coloured         concretions were brought up
   which were         much perforated by worm-holes, the walls of which
   were   all stained blackish brown.           The substance       of the concretions
   consisted    of carbonate       of lime and silicates,       and  the  black lining
   of the    holes was peroxide of manganese.                The various specimens
   obtained     on this occasion showed the deposition of oxide of man
    ganese   in various stages, from those which              showed orrly specks       or
    stains   to those     containing    a  considerable percentage.*          The most
    remarkable fact, however, was the close association               of the oxide of
    manganese,       especially at its first appearance,           with   the  work     of

  annelids, and this produced           a  strong conviction that the occurrence
  of peroxide of manganese             at the bottom of          the   sea   depended in
  some way or other on the organic life existing there.
     After this comparatively little           manganese       was met with,      until,     on
 approaching the south coast of Australia,                a large   haul was obtained
 from     a depth of 2600 fathoms in lat. 42° 42' S., long. 134° 10' E.
 and     throughout the whole of the Pacific, when the trawl was put
 over     in water sufficiently       deep and sufficiently          far   from land, it
 rarely failed to collect abundance            of manganese nodules, of all shapes
 and sizes, and surrounding             all kinds of nuclei.           Concretions also
 were      obtained from time          to   time,  recalling those of          the   North
 Atlantic      above referred    to.    Thus, on the plateau of the Kermadec
 Islands,      large  lumps of a tufaceous            sandstone     were     brought up,
 which were much perforated by eerpular                      borings, and these were
 lined with peroxide of manganese.                At   the first station after leaving
 Japan,      and on the landward side of the deep gully which                            runs
 parallel with the islands,       a large   haul was obtained, chiefly of pumice,
 tuff, and      volcanic mud concretions.           These were much perforated
 by worms, and the holes were lined with black oxide of manganese.
 One concretion, a portion of which is on the table, was broken
open      in the plane of one of the worm-holes, and the worm                            was
found dead in it.*             On another portion          a   dead worm was found
adhering, and on removing it a black stain was                         found below          it
consisting        of  poroxide     of   manganese.          The connection          of    the
peroxide of manganese              with    the life    of these animals was very
marked in this          case,  and continued to occupy            my attention         from
time to time, though without               arriving at any satisfactory solution,
during      the cruise.       It must     not be forgotten that an invariable
feature of the nodules was that they gave off abundance                       of  alkaline
and empyreumatic-smelling               water on being heated,           which      served
further to connect them with the organic world.
    After     the return of      the   "Challenger"          I  did   a good      deal of
dredging in the summers of several                years (1877-1882)          in the     seas
on the west coast of Scotland, and on                the   21st   September        1878     I
brought up from the deepest parte of Loch Fyne (104 fathoms) a
quantity of sandy mud, with large quantities of dead pecten shells,
and along       with them     true manganese nodules,           with all the     outward
       *
          The body of this worm was tested and found free from manganese.

characteristics of those from the greatest depths of the                        open ocean     ;
and this       similarity was maintained on chemical examination.                          The
dredging        anchor must on this occasion                  have   been dropped      in the
very richest        part of the deposit        ;   for the mud, which had undergone
no    concentrating        process, was found, on being submitted to mechani
cal   analysis, to consist of rather over 30 per cent, of nodules.*                       This
was a      very remarkable discovery            ; for although peroxide of manganese
was not        wanting in the shallower dredgings of the
                                                                            " Challenger," it
existed       only   as   coatings and similar deposits and not                  as   nodules,
 which were believed               to be dependent for their formation                 on the
 conditions obtaining             in very deep water.                After this particular
 attention       was paid to the occurrence              of manganese in all dredgings,
 and    it was found to be abundant all round our coasts as a coating
 on shells,       and more especially         as    the binding       and colouring matter
 of worm tubes ;           but no nodules were anywhere found except in the
 deep      part of   Loch Fyne.          Some years afterwards            Mr Murray found
 them in great         abundance on the Skelmorlie                   Bank in the Firth of
  Clyde      in 10 fathoms.
       In  the same      summer of 1878           I   made a number of observations in
  the   channel otf the north-east part of the Island of Arran, where the
  water reaches        a depth of 90 fathoms.              A galvanised iron bucket         was
  used as      dredge,    with   a  weight attached           behind, and one before it          ;
  so that       its action was       rather to skim the surface than to dig into
  the    lower layers of the bottom.                 It brought up      a quantity of   a  very
   fine   red     mud,   in which       manganese         grains could be detected,         not
   apparently       differing from those found in oceanic                 red clays.    In  the
   process     of levigation, when the mud was stirred up with water and
   the    light flocculent portion           poured       off, the    heavier portion which
   had settled to       the bottom of the vessel had the appearance of having
   l*en cast into elongated            pellets.       "When these were stirred up again
    with water       they were partially             broken up into flocculent          matter,
    which was       poured off, leaving again pellets as before; and this could
    be  continued      until   the whole of the mud had been washed                    away as
    flocculi, produced        by the breaking up of these pellets.                 In  the case
     of  the    particular mud under description,                   hardly anything      in the
     shape     of sand or coarser         material remained           behind.     The ground-
     fauna, chiefly       ophiurids,     seemed to be abundant              ; and   the pellets

passing the sand or mud through their bodies.                                    In    some     of      these
animals the triturating                     apparatus takes formidable                proportions,          as
in sea-urchins             ;   and it is probable that the sand found at low water
owes its state of comminution largely to these animals and to worms,
such       as the         ordinary lob-worm used for bait.                       When examining

                                                                 I    had observed            the       pellet
formation, without, however, being able to refer it                                 to any probable
cause.             Now, however, it           became probable that the same causes are
at work            in    deep as in shallow             seas, and that the            matter forming
the       bottom of the sea is being continually                             passed     and repassed
through             the    bodies      of    the      numerous tribes          of     animals        which
demonstrably subsist on the mud and its contents.
     In    the following season, 1879,                  I made       an extended       cruise through
the greater part of the waters of the west coast of Scotland, visiting
most       of the deeper spots, and paying particular                               attention to the
occurrence              of coprolitic mouldings             of   the mud.             Thus,    on       16th
June       1879, dredging in the                    deep part of the         Sound of Raasay in
155       fathoms,*            "a little mud          came up.        It    was a fine gray clay,
whicli effervesced with acids and smelled of H2S.    On washing a
quantity of it there remained the coprolitic masses and very little
fine sand.               There appeared to be a good deal of carbonate in                           a   very
fine state of division.                 There were very few shell particles visible,
and the effervescence of what looked like flocculent clay was not incon
siderable."               At   the    time      I   explained this flocculent carbonate as
having been produced out of the silicates of the mud by the ground
animals forming sulphide of calcium, which was transformed                                              into
carbonate               by the carbonic acid of the water.                      On the following
day       another haul was got in the same locality and with similar
results            it   is noted that —

               ;
many legs of ophiurids,                      which      will account for the              coprolites."
When attention                  had   once been paid to              it,   the coprolitic moulding
of       the       mud, when of             a       suitable consistency, was found                  to be
practically universal round our shores,                    f

     Shore muds,            that      is,   the   terrigenous deposits                which are found
all along the shores of continents, and even at great depths — generally
present       the       characteristic appearance                   of   a      reddish surface           layer,
overlying        a      bluish substratum.                  This characteristic             is   observed       in
deposits even far out at sea, and, where                             it       is   not masked          by largo
amounts of calcareous matter,                     is   evidently duo to the oxidation of the
bluish ferrous salts, on their coming in contact with the                                             sea water,
which always contains dissolved                           oxygen.i
    A      very remarkable example of                           a   blue clay — for              it    was     too
tenacious         to be called        a     mud — was obtained in                   the Sound of             Jura,
and      it   was       particularly        noticeable for the amount of sulphides
which       it   contained, and instructive by their complete disappearance
on   drying.          It   is   worthy of more particular mention.
     On 6th       July      1879 the anchor dredge                    was put over in the Sound
of   Jura,    where a depth of 120 fathoms was marked on the chart.                                             It
did not hold, and the yacht drifted, dragging                                  it   over the ground in
a    northerly          direction      before         the     wind       and tide.           Suddenly           it
hooked the ground, and brought the vessel up                                        with    a    great strain
on the cable.              In heaving up          it      was with       diiliculty that          the anchor
was     broken out of the ground                      ;   and when            it   was brought to the
surface the bag was                 full of       a   fine,     unctuous, very tenacious blue
clay,      with      some       of the       reddish-brown               surface      mud covering it.
There were          a   few pieces of broken shell and                         rock, also smooth               and
rounded          pebbles,       which seemed to occur                         principally        in the part
separating the surface mud from the blue clay, but there                                              was very
little of this kind of matter.                    The whole bagful, weighing more than
universal all along the African coast, and developed in most remarkable mannera
on the coast  flat within   considerable radius of the mouth of the river Congo.

district    the most frequent           entries   in the deck-book as to the nature of the
bottom are        "cop. m.," meaning coprolitic mud. These so-called eoprolites
were almost       jet black and of the size of mice droppings, and they were covered
with the same substance      in flocculent form, or were free from it, according to
the scour  of the tide in the locality.    It was best developed in comparatively
shallow water, and more especially in depth of 50 fathoms, when the large ash
                                                      a
bucket, to the use of which as        dredge a  found   convenient to revert, came
                                                            I            it
up full of these eoprolites,   without any flocculent matter whatever.    All along
the coast the mud of the locality was moulded in        similar way, though
                                                                         a      was                       it
not so striking.   When the course of the cruise took us across the open ocean to
Ascension, and thenoe northwards, wc were able to trace the transition of the more
earthy     shore eoprolites into the more mineralised and glauconitic pelagic ones.

1  cwt., consisted       almost entirely     of homogeneous         blue clay of        a
tenacity similar to the clay dug for brickmaking, and quite different
from ordinary " blue muds."             The clay was rather foul-smelling,           and
gave off abundance of sulphuretted               hydrogen when          treated    with
hydrochloric acid.          It  was so tenacious     that it was impossible            to
break it up in water for the purpose             of levigation, which is always
very easily accomplished with ordinary muds.                    A  considerable     por
tion of it was dried and taken for analysis.           It was    found that,    as soon
as  dry, not     a trace  of sulphide was to bo found         ;  but the mass of     the
clay was permeated with fine particles of oxide of iron, each of which
represented       a previous particle of sulphide.       A    specimen    of this clay
is on the table.         The contrast between       the fresh moist clay, which
was     thoroughly      impregnated with sulphides,             and the dried clay,
without       a trace  of them, was very striking.*
    The fact then had been demonstrated that the mud is being                       con
tinually       passed   and repassed      through   the    bodies    of animals in
habiting the bottom of the           sea.   In doing    so  the mineral matter of
which it consists comes in contact with the organic secretions of                    the
animals,      mixed with     sea water,   and is ground up along with them in
 the milling organs of the animals.
    The Reducing Action of organic matter on sulphates has long                    been
known, and its importance as an agent               in geological metamorphosis
 was thoroughly recognised           by Eischof.t
     The effect of Trituration in promoting the chemical decomposition
of    silicates by water was demonstrated by Daubrt5e,J                     more par
ticularly in the case of Felspar.            I found the observations to           hold
good       also   for  Augite.     Clear   crystals of this mineral from             the
Tristan       da Cunha group, when pulverised            with water in        an  agate
 mortar, rendered the water alkaline to turmeric paper.
     It  is evident therefore     that at the bottom of the sea         a number of
conditions occur together, which are favourable to the production
 of chemical change.            The ground animals, in the search of               food,
 pass the mud through           their bodies, grinding       it up, and    bringing it

1S90-91.]         Mr       J. Y.        Buchanan on Sulphur in Marine Muds.                                              23
thoroughly into contact at the moment of comminution                                                           with     the
sea water         and the digestive secretions                            of the animal.                The action of
these       secretions             on        the sulphates in the                    sea    water is to produce
sulphides,                and the            actions      of        the     sulphides            on the            ochreous
matter           of        the     bottom          is    to     produce sulphides                       of     iron     and
manganese.                     Even      if    the      bottom          were      covered             with     felspathic
or     augitic sand,                   the    sulphides, acting                 on     these          silicates in      the
moment         of partial decomposition, would convert the ochreous
oxides      by degrees into sulphides. That the volcanic material, lava,
dust, scorue, pumice,                        which forms the bulk of the unaltered material
of the bottom                    of the ocean, is               so        dealt with by the animals, is
evident          from the specimen from the Pacific on the table, which is
not a singular specimen,                        but rather a typical one.
     Having           extracted what nutriment                             they can from the mud, the
animals          reject          it,   containing        a     certain proportion                     of sulphides of
iron and manganese.                           These snlphides,             it   is   well known, are exceed
ingly unstable in presence                           of water and oxygen, and                            if   they come
to lie      on the surface                    of the mud, where they are exposed                                     to the
action of the sea water, which                                always contains dissolved oxygen,
they must                 be   quickly transformed into                         oxides.          In     the    oxidation
of    ferrous         sulphide by this process                            there      is    always separation             of
free    sulphur, which, however,                         is    to   a     great      extent further oxidised;
but    it   is   probable that some would persist.                                         If    then the process
just described                   represents          at all what             takes         place        in nature,       we
should expect to find in the ochreous                          deposits (the hydrous oxides
of     iron and manganese)                        some relics of their connection with the
organic world.                    These are not wanting.                        All    the deep-sea muds and
manganese concretions,                          of every diversity                    of    form, gave without
exception,            when freshly collected and                             heated         in   a     tube over the
lamp,    a    large quantity of ammoniacal water.                                          It   was      important to
see    if   sulphur could be detected.                               And        here       it    is   well to bear in
mind that in the case of                      a   "blue mud," which                    may contain unaltered
sulphide, the sulphur found in the dried sample                                                 will    come at least
in    part from that sulphide, and                           will    be due to the oxidation                        by the
atmosphere                in the process of drying.                          In      the     case      of an oceanic

any sulphur which                       is   found may be properly ascribed to oxidation
on the bottom of the sea.

   Acting     on   these    considerations, in       the winter   of   1880-61,       a
number of muds and nodules were examined with a view to                             the
detection,    and if possible the estimation, of free sulphur.
                        Estimation      of Sulphur in Muds.
   A   certain quantity of the clay, dried at about 80°, was put into                  a
bottle with a known weight of chloroform.                  The stopper was         tied
down, and it was then put into                a  water-bath for about an hour         at
about the temperature           of boiling chloroform     (61°  C).    It  was then
allowed      to  cool,   filtered into     a   weighed fractionating     flask, and
washed twice with a           little  more   chloroform.     The chloroform        was
then distilled off, and the residue heated slightly and weighed.
   The residue        was treated     with hot nitric and hydrochloric          acids,
diluted, and filtered         if  necessary,    barium chloride solution      added,
allowed to stand,         filtered, and the precipitate of barium           sulphate-
 weighed.
    In  the first few samples          the barium sulphate was       not weighed,
but the quantity of sulphur judged by the amount of barium                          sul
phate precipitated.
   At first bisulphide of          carbon was used, but     it was departed from,
because, although perfectly pure, and leaving no trace of sulphur on
evaporation,      it was thought that it would be well to use         a solvent not
containing any sulphur.             A  portion of the blue clay from the Sound
of Jura, which when fresh contains much sulphide,                       was in the
dried state tested with both solvents, with the following                results,
i   Treatment      with Bisulphide        of  Carbon.  — A quantity of      the clay
 was pounded and dried at about 80°.                50-00 grammes    were put into
a  bottle with 236'0 grammes of bisulphide of carbon, and                    allowed
to stand all night.         A weighed portion of the carbon bisulphide             was
then    taken out and put             into   a   weighed flask, and the       carbon
bisulphide distilled off, and the residue weighed.               0-28 per cent of
sulphur was found in this way.
   The sulphur dissolved completely in a small quantity of bisul
 phide.      Next day another portion of carbon bisulphide               was taken
out and put into a weighed flask, distilled, and the residue               weighed.
This   gave 0-33 per cent, of sulphur.
   The bisulphide         was tested to see whether        it contained    any free
sulphur    ;  it turned out      to be very nearly pure.

     Treatment with             Chloroform.
                                                — Another          50-00   grammes         of clay
were treated with 183-6                 grammes     of chloroform.         The mixture          was
heated        for an hour on the water-bath at about the temperature of
boiling chloroform (61° C). A portion of the chloroform was                                    then
taken out, evaporated, and the residue weighed. This gave                                      0 39
per cent, of sulphur.
     There was very little oil present in the residue, which was nearly
pure sulphur.
     In   the first ten samples the BaS04 was not weighed,                      but the      residue
was always oxidised and                  the    presence     of sulphur proved by                  the
formation of sulphuric acid.                   When sulphur          was found          constantly
and       in appreciable        quantity,   I then    decided       to weigh      it,   the opera
tion being,          from an analytical point of view, an advantageous                          one,
as the      sulphate of barium weighed                weighs seven times more                   than
the sulphur to be estimated.                   By far the largest amount of sulphur
is   contained in the clay from the Sound of Jura, which, in its                               fresh
state, contained large quantities of sulphides, which were completely
oxidised on drying.                TheO'197         grammes of residue may be taken
to be pure           sulphur,     which makes about 0-4 per cent.                    By      far the
greater part,        if   not the whole, of this sulphur was formed by oxida
tion during drying.                Had    it   been possible to collect and examine
separately          the reddish-brown surface layer, we should, no doubt, have
found very much less sulphur, but                    it    would have been mainly                due
to oxidation by the oxygen of the bottom water.
     The " oil,"          which    is   extracted from        all the muds along with
the sulphur, and which varies                   a   good    deal    in quantity,        is   due      to
the animal            debris intimately        mixed with the mud and with                           the
materials of the nodules,                which are made up, for the most                     part>

from       a    depth of 2740 fathoms, where they appear to have                                been
exceptionally abundant.                  Those of the 16th September 1875                       came
from      a    locality where      they were equally abundant.                  The     water      was
a    little shallower, being 2350              fathoms,     in   lat. 13° 28' S., long. 149'
30'   W.         In both the      samples of these nodules examined,                    the weight
of the residue            is   considerable, but as there was              a   little oil in    both
cases     it   is   not possible to give the percentage of sulphur.

Ross-shire, was dredged from 150 fathoms,                             and consisted of very fine
soft grey mud, which on washing left a large residue of coprolitic
pellets.
      No.   5 is a        similar mud from Loch Duich, also in Ross-shire                                ;    it
harboured            many annelids.
      No. 6 is from the station in Loch Fyne, where, for the first time,
manganese             nodules were obtained in comparatively shallow water.
It is   a sandy           clay with many dead shells.
    No. 7 is the red clay from 90 fathoms in the                              Firth of Clyde,                ofF
the north-east             part of the Island of Arran, which has already been
referred to.              It   is a very fine red ochreous              mud, much resembling
the     oceanic       clays.          On washing, it is found                 to   be almost         com
pletely moulded into coprolitic                       pellets, and supports an abundant
ground fauna.                  Like    oceanic      clays,   on careful washing, grains of
peroxide        of manganese               can be isolated,       and       it contains over         1   per
cent,    of phosphoric acid.

    No.     9   is    a    coating of peroxide of manganese                        from an oceanic
concretion, but the locality has been omitted to be noted.
    No. 10 is mud from 115                         fathoms in the channel between                        the
Island of Searba                and the Garvelloch              Islands, about twenty miles
S.W. of Oban.                   Peroxide of manganese is very abundant here                                  as
a   coating on dead shells.
    No. 11 is from the upper basin of Loch                                  Fyne, in 60 fathoms.
The mud here contains a remarkably large amount of sulphur.                                              The
upper basin of a sea loch                    is,   as regards    many of its conditions, and
notably as regards the nature of the mud at its bottom, in                                       a   state
intermediate           between        that of the open          sea and      that of     a   fresh-water
lake.       The mineral               constituents are          usually in         a   lower   state         of
oxidation         than outside         ;    and this     is    accompanied             by, and    partly
due     to, the relatively             large       amount of vegetable             debris from           the
land.       All      these circumstances may retard the disappearance                            of the
sulphur.

Nos. 12 and             13   inasmuch             as the   Pacific sample now contains                           more
sulphur than the Atlantic one.
     No. 23 is the insoluble residue left after treating a nodule from

chloride.             The        difference        is    very        remarkable.            In    No.        2     the
sulphur was             not determined — that                  is,   the barium sulphate produced
by its oxidation was not weighed                           ;    but   it   was one of these samples
which showed that the amount present was so appreciable that                                                 it   was
worth while determining                       it   as    accurately as possible, so that                         it   is
certain         that   it   must have contained at least an average amount.                                           In
the    case      of the natural nodule (No.                           2)   the weight of chloroform
residue          per       100     grammes             substance          was    29      milligrammes;                in
the case of the extracted                         nodule No. 23            it   is   2   milligrammes,            and
the weight              of sulphate of barium                        is   put    down        as   1     decimilli-
gramme.               In    fact, the sulphur in the nodule had disappeared                                      under
the treatment.
     No. 24       is    from Loch Fync, in 87 fathoms, opposite Otter                                        House,
and    a    little further up               the loch than the station No.                        6,   but both        of
them        in the outer loch,                    as opposed         to    No.       11, which          is   in    the
upper and semi-enclosed                       basin.       The contrast between No.                          24 and
No.        11    is    remarkable.            In the upper basin the amount                                  of the
chloroform residue                     per    100       grms.    substance            was    74       milligrms,,
and        10    milligrms.            of    it   was     sulphur.          In the outer              loch       there
were only 17 milligrms. of residue and                                1    milligrm. sulphur.

    No. 25 is       a very remarkable        white clay from the          bottom      of
Loch Ness, and therefore          a  fresh-water formation.          It  occurs    in a
small area opposite Urquhart             Castle, and in various depths, often
covered     by a thin layer of peaty substance           ;  but in some places, in
depths of about 30 fathoms,           the sounding-tube brings up the white
clay alone.       It  was observed also in Loch Oich.              It  is chemically
quite distinct      from the marine clays,        being much more acid.             The
amount of matter extracted by chloroform                 is enormous,      being 374
niilligrms.    per 100 grms., most of which               is oil or wax, but con
taining      4 milligrms.      of oxidisable    sulphur.      It is not impossible
that in this case the sulphur             may   exist as an organic compound            ;
and     the   amount of oily matter in the clay is interesting in the
indication     which it gives of the possible mode of formation of our
oil-bearing    shales.
    No. 26 is from the anchorage             of Isle Oronsay in the Sound of
Sleat.
    No. 27 is from a depth of 87 fathoms off Garroch Head, in the
 Firth of Clyde.           Both   in   this case and in that of No.             2G   the
 amounts of residue and of sulphur are insignificant.
    Sulphur was thus detected            in all these samples       and   determined
 in the   greater number of them.            Putting   aside   shallow water coast
 muds,    the largest amounts of sulphur are found in the Celebes                    Sea
 (No. 16), in the Ltiatomaceous            ooze of the Antarctic        (No. 18), and
 in the Radiolarian         ooze of the Pacific (No. 20).         So far, therefore,
 as it goes, we have the evidence           of the sulphur in favour of former
 organic agency.         It  is worthy of remark that the property of giving
 off alkaline water on heating has in the course of years disappeared,
 and   in its place the nodules on being heated give off acid vapours,
 which,     it  is   true,   contain    some   ammonia,       but    along    with    an
 excess    of nitric acid, which is without            doubt due to the gradual
  oxidation    of the nitrogenous matter.           It  is possible    that the finely
  divided sulphur may diminish and finally disappear in the same way.
  But in 1881, there was still enough to be easily determined.                       Let
  us consider     the chemical reactions more closely.
     When a mud containing ferrous sulphide is treated                    with dilute
  hydrochloric acid, the sulphide dissolves with evolution of sulphur
  etted hydrogen, so long as there is           no substance      present   which has
  a  decomposing        action on the sulphuretted hydrogen.               If  there be

ferric salt either mixed with the mud or in the solution, then it is
reduced       to ferrous       salt,    with the destruction of          the   equivalent
amount of H2S and separation of sulphur.                         If the ferric salt be in
excess, no sulphuretted hydrogen makes its appearance at all The
reaction is very simple —
                               FeS + 2HC1 = FeCI,              + H2S
and                            H2S + Fe2Cl6
                                                   =
                                                      2FeCl2   + 2HCl  +S
 . \  by addition              FeS +     Fe2Clfi
                                                   =
                                                      3FeCl2 + S
 because the 2HC1 appears on both sides                      of the equation,    and is    in
 fact unnecessary.            A    trace of free acid is no doubt necessary, and
 it   is   turned over         and over        again    in  the   reaction of indefinite
 quantities of FeS on             Fe._,Cl6,  after the manner      of a catalytic  action.
      The same reaction            takes    place   if we use ferric sulphate in place
  of ferric chloride.
      It  is evident, therefore,          that  if  we have a sample of mud contain
  ing sulphide, and we mix it thoroughly with a solution of                           Fe2CLj
  or Fe2(S04)3,          we shall have in the ferric salt reduced a measure                  of
  the decomposable           sulphide present.           The ferrous salt can be readily
   determined by permanganate                 of potash or otherwise.       It will  be seen
   from the above           equation that one molecule              FeS  decomposes one
   molecule       Fe2Cl6    with the formation of three molecules                FeClj,      so
   that the FeS in the mud is one-third of the ferrous salt found.
       In   order     to make       some preliminary         experiments,    a mixture       of
   100 grnis.       alum and 30 grms. ferrous sulphate were dissolved                        in
   about    |  litre of water and precipitated with ammonia and sulphide
   of ammonium.            The precipitate was thoroughly washed by                 repeated
   decantations,        the flask being always filled up to the neck, and corked
   and allowed to settle.              When it      was completely washed      the surplus
    water was poured          off, and the      precipitate, suspended in about        h litre
    of water, was preserved               in a well-stoppered reagent         bottla      The
    precipitate consists of alumina                  and sulphide      of iron, and       may
    therefore      be   taken    as   an imitation       of  a  simple form of mud.            I
    made some experiments to see with                    what amount of agreement             in
    the results one could titrate a number of different samples of                          the
    same mud.

added          10 c.c. of the reddish-brown             but still acid, ferric sulphate
solution,        and the contents shaken.                   In    a    few seconds the black
colour of the sediment had disappeared                           entirely, being replaced by
a   yellowish-red precipitate, which disappeared                           for the most part on
the     addition of dilute sulphuric            acid.            Water        was then added                 to
bring up the volume to 250               c.c,   and the titration was effected                         with

cipitate        can   be measured      off about          as     accurately           as    a     dissolved
salt.
     It   is   evident, then, that   if   we have           a     mud containing FeS and
other ferrous compounds decomposable                             by IIC1, we can determine
first the       FeS by adding      Fe.,Cl0 and titrating               a   portion with perman
ganate;        then the other ferrous compounds, by adding HCland titrating
another portion           with permanganate,          due account                being kept of the
weights and volumes used.                 In order        to try the method                  in practice,
three      soundings were made       ; — on 30th September                       1881 in the Sound
of    Raasay, off Croulin Island, 120 fathoms                     ;    and on the 1st October
1881       in Loch Duich, in       49 and 51 fathoms.                      Tho first of these re
presents more or less the conditions in the open sea of coast waters                                         ;
the     last two represent        the conditions            in   a    semi-enclosed            loch basin.
The Sound of Raasay mud was                 a   light grey mud, with no offensive
qualities.         Both samples from Loch Duich were very foul smelling.
All       three samples were tightly stoppered                    up in their wet condition,
and examined on 20th and 21st October 1881 in my laboratory in
Edinburgh.            I   unfortunately had no suitable'fcrrie                         solution afloat
with me so as to treat them immediately.                              In   the three weeks that
both muds from Loch              Duich    were kept in bottles,                   the surface         layer
got completely          oxidised, and on opening the bottles the smell was
gone      ;    but, on breaking through the surface                         layer, the            unaltered
black mud was exposed              with all its original qualities, including its
peculiar odour.
      The following was the method used in the case of the Loch Duich

32          Proceedings      of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                             [sess.
mud from 49 fathoms.         Two portions of       the damp unaltered mud were
weighed out; one portion, 6'724 grms., was dried at 100°                        C, and the
other,  7-881 grms., was treated with deep red Fe„Cl6                        in  a 100 cc.
flask, which was then filled up to the mark with water.                      50 cc. of this
solution, containing     3-94 grms. damp mud, were                   acidified with sul
phuric acid and titrated with permanganate               I  —             grms. per litre    j,
using T9 cc.       To the remaining        50  cc. with sediment (the volume
of which     may    here    be    neglected)    were added 4 cc. of strong
hydrochloric acid (12'5 HC1 grms. per litre), filled up to the mark,
and allowed to settle.       50 cc of this solution, containing 1 -97 grms.
damp mud, were further           acidified with sulphuric             acid and titrated
with the same permanganate,            of which   1*7     cc     were used.       A litre of
the above permanganate          oxidises 5-6 grms. iron from the ferrous to
the ferric state.     In the first operation, 50           cc     solution used      l-9 cc
permanganate,     therefore the*whole      amount of mud, 7'881 grms., when
treated   with ferric chloride, would           require        3 8   cc.   = 0"0213      grm.
iron.
    After treatment with hydrochloric               acid      a   quantity      of solution
equivalent to 197 grms. wet mud required                    1*7   cc  permanganate,         so
 that 7-881 grms. mud would require            6 8  cc       when treated with both
 1IC1  and Fe2Cl6,      which represents        0-0381        grm.    iron.      Therefore,

 to be taken    as    forming      FeS, so that        in     7-881     grins,    wet    mud
 we have 0,0071        grm.   iron present      as    sulphide,        equal to 0-0112

 of  70-l  per cent.     Therefore the dry mud is 29'9 percent,                        of  the
 damp mud taken.         The    7 '881 grms.    damp mud therefore represent

 2-3564 grms. dry mud, and therefore                   we find that the mud taken as
dry contains 0-47 per cent                 FeS and       0-92    per cent.    FeO in some
other easily decomposable               combination.
    The other samples were treated in the same way, and in the Loch
Doich mud, from 51 fathoms, 0'94 per cent. FeS + 0 65 per cent FeO
were    found.       It  is remarkable that the amount of F2S should be so
small    in such     offensive     muds.
    In  the outside mud from 120 fathoms in the                          Sound of Raasay
only 0'05 per cent.          FeS and 0-l         per cent. FeO were found.
    In connection with                this    mud,    which        contained     some       shell
debris,    the method was found to be less applicable than to muds
free   from calcareous          matter.       The reason        is obvious    ;  because, on
adding a neutral ferric solution                 to a mud containing           carbonate       of
lime,     precipitation       of the      ferric   oxide by the          lime immediately
'.ommences.          This would not really interfere with                      the    reaction,
because the        FeS would reduce the precipitated                  Fe2< )3
                                                                              all the same,
and the ferrous        salt can still be determined by permanganate                       ;  but
in   truly calcareous          bottoms this action is troublesome,                    and     the
method       will require     special      study in this direction.           In the      semi-
enclosed     basins of the sea lochs, which, as has already been observed,
form a transition between               the open     sea    and fresh -water       lakes,    the
bottom resembles more nearly that of the                       fresh-water lakes, in the
absence      of mollusca,        and in the abundance               of organic matter of
vegetable     origin, than that of the open                sea   with its abundant and
varied ground fauna.              It   differs from those of fresh-water lakes in
being bathed by sea-water largely impregnated with sulphates.                              Con
sequently     it  is in the inner basins          of  sea    lochs that the conditions
for a constant production of sulphides are present,                        while the same
conditions       are   hostile      to   the presence         of calcareous       organisms.
Hence it is      in  these basins that the greatest               quantities of sulphides
are found,     and it is in their muds that the above method is most
applicable.
    The     sulphuretted       muds,       however,      are    so   alterable by       atmos
pheric influences that             it  is essential     that they       should lie treated
immediately         on collection.            For    this     purpose      weighed       wide-
mouthed       bottles     with good stoppers            should be provided.             When
a  specimen       of mud        is brought up from the bottom,                     a   sample
of   it   is   immediately         taken with         a   spatula and put           into one

of these       bottles containing       a known       quantity     of ferric chloride
solution, at least sufficient to completely cover the sample of mud.
Another sample,        as nearly similar to the first as possible,            is  taken
and stoppered       in another bottle for drying.             In this    way    a large
amount of valuable information              might be gained        ;  but it   will    be
evident from the nature of the            case  that the actual figures obtained
in any one particular case are affected               by   a  considerable possible
error.
    In  the month of      June    1881    I carried   out  a  number of laboratory
experiments bearing on this subject, using the sulphides of different
metals     of the iron group.          These bodies       were    all prepared in the
same way, namely, by precipitating the sulphates with                     sulphide of
ammonium, and washing by decantation in stoppered bottles, always
filled up quite full.        A quantity of hydrated ferric oxide               was also
prepared        by    precipitating     ferric    chloride     with    ammonia and
washing.         All of  these precipitates, when thoroughly washed, were
preserved       suspended    in   distilled    water    in well-stoppered       reagent
bottles.
    Ferrous Sulpiride and Ferric Oxide.             — When quite neutral           these
substances       do not react on one another, at least at once.              But if the
water has the slightest acid reaction               reduction of the sesquioxide
and production of sulphur take place rapidly.                   A mixture of      Fe^Oj
and    FeS in water and quite neutral was corked up and allowed                         to
 stand   for five days, when the sediment was found to be                     separated
 into two sharply-defined          layers  — the upper       red,   consisting of     the
 oxide,    and the      lower    black,    of    the   sulphide.      When      brought
 together,    therefore,   in presence of nothing but distilled water,             there
 is no appreciable resultant action.
     Manganous Sulphide can be preserved                  perfectly under distilled
 water    in well-stoppered bottles filled         to the neck.        A  considerable
 quantity was prepared        in the summer of 1881, and, when thoroughly
 washed,     it was put away in three separate bottles.               The   contents of
 only one bottle were used for experimental purposes, and the                     upper
 part of it got coloured immediately black with oxide of                   manganese,
 from the oxidation of the flakes of sulphide which adhered                       to the
 surface of the       upper part of the bottle, left dry when some of                 the
 water and precipitate had been poured out.                   This took    place at the
 time,   and was to be expected.              The two other bottles, which          were

have never been           opened    since, though they have         all the timo been
exposed to the light, and are exactly in the condition in which they
were when bottled nine and a               half  years ago.      There is no trace of
oxidation.
    Mawjanous Sulphide and Hydrous Ferric Oxide.                   — Both     substances
are   used,      suspended     in distilled    water.     If   the    ferric    oxide   be
cautiously added to the sulphide of manganese, and both suspended                       in
water, the red patches are seen to disappear,               and the general        colour
of the suspended           matter becomes       rather lighter in colour than the
MnS, and there is no formation of FeS.                      If  further additions of
Fe203 be made, red flakes deposit themselves.                    They do not appear
to be     unaltered Fe203,        but are exactly like the           " red cherty par
        "
ticles     of manganese bottoms.            On still further additions of Fe203,
the   colour changes         quickly, though not instantaneously, to black,
with, however,         a large   admixture of white particles, the two being
 easily seen to be perfectly distinct.            There is also     a  quantity of pre
 cipitated     sulphur     which    remains floating in the liquid long after
 the heavy       matter has subsided.
    Prosecuting this line of experiment,               I  made     three    mixtures in
 <uitable    flasks.
    No.    1   contained     MnS      and   Fe203,   the    MnS      being in excess.
 There was formation of red cherty particles, but nothing black.
    No. 2.      The   same substances,      but containing the Fe203 in excess             ;
 the  mixture quickly turned black.
    No. 3. The same as No. 2, only             it was made up        witli warm     water,
 ami it   turned black almost at once.
    These      experiments were         repeated,   and    with    the    same    results.
 The above flasks,         Noa   1, 2,  and   3, were    corked   up and allowed to
 stand   over night.         No.   1   contained numerous black particles,              as
 well as red cherty ones, and            an excess    of MnS      as  well   as  sulphur.
  Noe. 2   and    3 were    much    as they had    been    the night before, except
 that the    white particles had almost           entirely disappeared,        as also  all
  r«l particles.       The reactions are considerably accelerated             by heat.
     On examining the contents            of each of these flasks, no peroxide of
  manganese       was    found, but largo       quantities of sulphide           of iron.

kernels of some manganese                    nodules was very striking.             It    is not
improbable that the first action of the MnS on the Fe.,Os may be
accompanied  by the formation of mixed oxides of iron and man
ganese      ;    but there is much to be done in this direction in the strictly
quantitative           investigation     of the interaction of the insoluble, hut
not inert, compounds of this as well                    as   of other groups of metals.
     Ferric Sulphate and Manganous                       Sulphide.    — Experiments           were
now made, using the iron                 as a   ferric salt in solution, and for this
purpose         ferric sulphate was used.           It   was made as nearly neutral                  as
possible by addition               of ammonia.           The MnS was, as before,               sus
pended          in distilled water.
     On adding ferric sulphate to excess of MnS, the formation of FeS
is immediate.
     On adding          a largeof Fe2(S04)3 the FeS is decomposed,
                                  excess
there is formation of basic salt, and on dissolving it with H2S04 the
solution contains large quantities of ferrous sulphate.
     On experimenting with solution of ferrous sulphate it was found
that excess of MnS precipitates the iron completely as FeS, acting
exactly like an alkaline sulphide.
     The rationale, therefore, of the above                      reaction is very simple.

which       is   identical with (1), and by adding more MnS we                           get the
conditions of equation (2), and                 so on,    repeating the cycle.
     Hence,       if   we add      MnS       to excess of Fe2(S04)3, we should                 get
reduction of the ferric salt without formation of FeS.                              On   adding
excess          of    MnS, we get formation of FeS, and then on                          adding
excess          of Fe2(SO)4 we get back to the same state                  of things          as    at
first.
  The reaction of equation (1) can be obtained by very cautiously
adding small quantities of suspended MnS to   very large excess    a                                of

 Fe2   (S04)j.     Still there is always local formation of FeS which dis
 appears on     mixing, so that the reaction is really that of the whole
 cycle.      The action, therefore,      of MnS on soluble iron salts is in the
first   instance to reduce whatever is          in  the ferric state to the ferrous,
and then      at once to precipitate the ferrous salt as sulphide, a man-
ganous     salt taking the place of the ferrous salt in the solution.
    When added in great excess to solutions of nickel sulphate, man-
ganous     sulphide precipitates it       as  NiS.     When     added to solution of
sulphate of zinc, it either does not precipitate it at all or only very
slightly at ordinary temperatures.              Sulphide of zinc was not found
to  precipitate manganese sulphate solution.
    As the result, then, of the observations and experiments which
have     been recited     I was led to believe that the           principal   agent   in
the   comminution of the mineral matter found at the bottom of both
deep    and shallow       seas and     oceans   is the ground fauna of the sea,
which depends for its subsistence               on the     organic matter which it
can   extract from the mud.
    In order to fit them for collecting their nutriment in this way the
animals have         been fitted     with different       forms of masticating or
milling apparatus,          so as     to   thoroughly      deal    with   the    matter
which      they pass through their            bodies.    It   has been    shown that
most     silicates are decomposed          to a certain extent when ground or
pulverised      under water    ; so   that the mere mastication of the sand or
mud     in presence of pure water would have a decomposing action on
the   silicates which it contains.          This action     is much assisted,    in the
case    of marine animals, by the fact that the water which they pass
through their bodies along          with    the sand is charged       with sulphates.
These     are easily reduced      to sulphides by the action of the organic
matter    of the secretions      of the animals.         The resulting sulphide at
once suffers      double decomposition with any oxide of iron or man
ganese      which     is present     as  such   in the mud,       or may be being
set   at   liberty from silicates under           the  decomposing influence of
trituration     under water.       The sulphides of manganese            and   iron so
formed      are  in  course   of nature       extruded by the animals,          and   if
exposed      to the sea water on the surface             of the mud are quickly
oxidised,     the    manganese      taking     priority.      The   mud    below    the
surface     layer,  in localities   where     ground life is abundant, remains
blue, being     protected by the oxidation of what is above it.

      At the bottom of            the ocean the mineral matter is thus exposed
to a reducing process due to the life of the animals which                                             inhabit
it,   and to an oxidising process due to the oxygen                                    dissolved in             the
water.        Other things being equal, the redness or blueness of                                       a   mud
or clay depends            on the relative activity of these processes.                                   They
also exercise       a    controlling           or modifying         influence on one                 another.
For, although marine animals are much less sensitive to variation
in    the amount            of oxygen              in their       atmosphere           than        terrestrial
animals,      it   is   certain that there must be                a   limit to     the        deficiency          of
oxygen which              each        animal can support            ;     and when this limit                     is
approached,             its reducing activity               is    diminished,           or,   it     may        be,
extinguished.             The water in the course of circulation                            is     being con
tinually renewed, and, meeting with                        a   diminished amount of freshly
reduced matter,           it    is    able     to push the oxidation               of the mud                to   a
greater depth.             It   is    easily      conceivable that in many                    of the         deep
parts of the ocean the amount of ground life may be so limited that
the water          has     no difficulty              in oxidising        at once its ejecta; and
these conditions            would            be   favourable to the formation of                          a     red
clay      or chocolate          mud according to the preponderance of iron                                        or
manganese.

marine muds.               At     page 256,            after noticing that              it    is   due to       the

     It is now a year and          a  half since     I  communicated to this Society
 a   description      of a portable form of apparatus                for enabling us to
 count      the number        of particles of dust in the              atmosphere.         The
 working of that instrument in my hands has been most satisfactory,
 and though       it    has occasionally given trouble, yet               it   has not given
 more than might have been expected.                      Though     that apparatus         has
 worked quite pleasantly with nie, and enabled                        a  beginning to be
 made of      an investigation         into the amount,          and the effects, of dust
 in our atmosphere,          yet very few have         as  yet followed up this line of
 inquiry.       This     has probably been owing to there                 being something
 in the complicated nature of                  the apparatus        which       has  deterred
 others from      joining in      the work.        I  therefore determined to         see  if  a
 simpler,     and at the same time              a  reliable, form of the apparatus
 could not be devised.
      After the experience         gained    in making thousands             of observations
  with the portable apparatus,             I   have acquired an acquaintance               with
  its weak points, and a knowledge of what                    it would     be necessary for
  an   instrument        of this     kind to do under the different conditions
  in which     it would      be required to work, and            I may now sum up the
   indictment      against the         portable apparatus          under       the  following
   heads : —   It is too complicated         ;  it has too many weak points              ; it is
   too heavy ;     it   has an unnecessarily wide range                for meteorological
    work  ;  and   it   is  tuo expensive.          If   an instrument could be con

structed    free from the       first four charges,        it is probable       the fifth
would vanish.
    First,  as regards     weight, the experience         gained with the portable
apparatus     has shown that the size may be very much reduced if
the instrument is to be used only for testing air of country districts —
i.e.,  air  free    from    immediate local pollution.              Experience          has
shown that in country air the number of particles is rarely over a few
thousands per cubic centimetre.            It  is therefore not necessary to            use
the small measures          of the portable apparatus            under these condi
tions, as we can with the air-pump alone test air up to an impurity
of 25,000 per cubic centimetre.                It  is only for air of greater im
purity than this that the stopcock measures are required.                  These small
measures     may therefore       be omitted.        Again, when testing          country
air, the proportion of pure air to impure air required to make a test
does not vary greatly — from 4 to           1 to 19 to 1.        The receiver of the
instrument does not therefore require to be so large as when the air
to be tested       requires to be      mixed with some hundred                times its
volume of pure air.           This admits of      the receiver,     and therefore of
the whole apparatus,         being greatly reduced in size.          The capacity of
the receiver    in    the pocket instrument has therefore            been reduced to
one-fifth of that of the portable apparatus.                  This  at once effects a
great reduction in the weight, and the stopcock measures not being
required reduces the expense as well             as  the weight.
    Turning     now      to the weak and troublesome                parts,   these     are
principally : — (1) The air-pump          valves are liable to get out of order,
and    occasionally give rise to trouble.             (2) The india-rubber tube
for    closing    the    opening through        which the stirrer-rod passes
occasionally fails, and gives           trouble by leaking.           Further,      these
india-rubber tubes with closed ends require to be specially                    prepared
for the instrument, and            it is difficult     to    get  suitable    tube     for
the purpose.        And    (3) the silver counting stages are delicate                and
troublesome      to keep.      So far as my experience goes this is not                the
case, as after a little      practice  no trouble has been experienced,               and
the first silver stage put into my instrument is                 still in   use and in
good     condition.       My   experience,    however, is not that of             others,
and   it  seemed     in the highest degree desirable that some                 improve
ment be made           in this direction by the introduction of a              counting
stage that could be more easily kept in working order.

     Returning now to the first weak point, viz., the air-pump valves,
  reference to the    Plate given with this paper will show how this
  difficulty has been overcome.          The figures on the plate show the
 new pocket instrument        drawn full size.          In the   figures,   R is the
 receiver, and P the pump.          It will be observed that the receiver R
 communicates      with the pump P by means of the stopcock K, and
 it will be noticed that all difficulty       with the valves is got over by
 simply removing them altogether, and making the stopcock                       K   act
 the double part of air-pump valves,          and valve for admitting the air
 to be tested.     The passage through the plug of the stopcock                   K   is
 not straight, but is bored at right angles as shown.                It will  also be
 noticed that there are three ports in the body of the stopcock — one
 communicating with the pump P, one with the receiver R, and one
with the outer air.
    It will  be observed   that the lower part of the air-pump is similar
 in design to that of the portable         apparatus.      The continuation          of
 the   pump-barrel G forms a guide for the piston-rod of the pump,
and has a scale graduated       on   it to  enable    the observer to introduce
into the receiver different proportions of impure air for testing.                  At
tig. 4   is shown    a separate    drawing of the guide-tube, and on it is
shown the scale marked       with the figures                 j1^,  |.    This   scale
is so   divided   that when the guide-collar is drawn down to those
respective      marks   it enables      us  to   introduce    into     the   receiver
measured      quantities of impure air, such that when mixed with the
pure    air in the receiver and expanded there will be these propor
tions   of impure air in the receiver.         So that on making a test and
counting      the number of drops per cubic centimetre in the mixed
and expanded       airs in the receiver, the number so obtained must
be    multiplied  by the proportion of impure air used.                Suppose,     for
instance,    that we drew down the pump to the                 ._}g  mark on      the
scale,   and on testing the mixture of this amount of air with                     the
pure air in the receiver,     and observed,       in  say, ten tests, an average
of two drops per square      millimetre, then        as  there is one centimetre
of air above the counting         stage,   two drops per square millimetre
will be 200 per cubic centimetre in the air of the                    receiver,   but
this figure must in this case be multiplied            by 20 to get the number
uf  particles in the outer air, which in this        ease  would be 4000.

ring,    as   shown in drawing, at the lower part of the piston.                                              This
ring, so far              as    experience        yet goes, has              been      found          to be an
advantage,           and has           kept     the     piston        always       tight       with varying
degrees of dryness of the leather.
      The     second            weak    point     in     the      portable apparatus, to which
reference          has been made, is the india-rubber                            tube making the air
tight joint between the rod of the stirrer and the receiver.                                                 Here,
again,       as    will    be seen from the drawing of the pocket instrument,
the difficulty             has been got over by simply removing                                it,   and closing
the end of the tube with                          a    metal cap.            This     is   possible in the
pocket instrument, because we can move the stirrer without touching
it.     It    is   only necessary to invert the instrument, when the stirrer
drops to the other end, and on again bringing                                    the instrument to its
original           position, the stirrer               again drops to the bottom.                            These
movements                 are    made        two or three times               to      make           the    mixing
thorough.             Some         little attention         is   necessary       in the construction of
the     stirrer.          It will      not do to put             a    diaphragm into the receiver
and allow           it    to fall anyhow.              The effect of that would be to manu
facture       a      great       quantity       of nuclei, and copious showers would
invariably           follow its use.              These          showers are caused                    by nuclei
formed by the wet                       surface        of the stirrer         splashing on the                    wet
surface of the receiver.                       It will      be seen from the drawing                       that   the
stirrer       is   caused to move             truly     by means of          a   small rod fixed              in   it,
and      projecting downwards.                         The lower end of this rod enters                             a
tube which                projects through the bottom of the receiver, the lower
end      of        this     tube       being     closed.          Both    ends        of       the      guide-rod
are      pointed           to     reduce       this     splashing        surface       to       a      minimum.
 When the instrument                     is   inverted, the falling              stirrer keeps parallel
 to the top and bottom                     of the       receiver,      but touches neither, save                    at
 the points, and nuclei are rarely formed.                                   As in     the other instru
 ments, both sides of the stirrer and                             the bottom of the instrument
 are covered               with       blotting-paper,          cemented          on   with           india-rubber
 solution.           The blotting-paper                is   kept moist to saturate                   the air, and
 supply water for the rain drops, when the entering air                                          is   dry.
      On referring               to    the    drawing        it   will   be seen       that there             is   no

 filtering apparatus                     attached           to the pocket instrument.                                 With       the
 removal        of the air-pump valves its use would be inconvenient, and
 it    is not        a    necessary             part of the apparatus.                                   For viewing             the
 counting        stage the               magnifying lens                     M    is used.               A    common         single
leDS       of about           two-centimetre focus does very well for the purpose.
It      is    lighter         and less               expensive            than           a    compound one.                      The
lens         is mounted             in    a tube which                    slides into another tube,                              this
larger tube is attached                         to a disc of brass                    of the same diameter                         as
the top of           the receiver.               This disc               has a flange all round                      it of    such
a size that,             when cut so                 as to    give it         a    spring, it grasps the top of
the receiver              firmly, but in such                       a   way that it can be easily lifted
off.         This is necessary,                  as the             inside of the glass                        cover      of the
receiver         often gets dewed,                          and     the      easiest          way of removing                    the,
condensed            moisture is to                   lift off          the cover            carrying the lens, and
hold the finger on the glass                                 to heat            and      evaporate             the     moisture
from the inside surface.
      Before     proceeding to describe                           the improvements in the counting
stage,       it will be        as    well to describe                     the      manner of using the new
instrument.               The first thing to be done is to                                        see    that the inside of
the receiver             is wet.          If    it    is,   then examine                 the inside surface of the
glass        cover       of the receiver,                   and     see
                                                                             if
                                                                             it              is   free       from condensed
moisture, which would interfere with                                         a    clear view of the stage.                         If
it    is   not clear, take off the metal                                 cover       and hold             a    finger on the
centre of the glass plate                        till   it    begins to clear, and then replace the
cover.          Too much heating should be avoided,                                                 as    it   gives      rise    to
trouble with the counting                             stage.            Now examine                     the surface of the
counting         stage, and see
                                                 if
                                                 it           is    free        from specks.                    If   it   is     not
satisfactory,            take      it     out and clean                  it     with         a    piece of clean             cloth.
Care       is   advisable in doing this to                                see     that the cloth                 is   perfectly
clean,        as otherwise                the        stage    will look dirty                       and       streaky in the
humid         atmosphere                 in the receiver.                    If    the stage             is   simply dewed,
then touch the underside                              of     it   with        a     finger          to heat      it    slightly.
If    the finger          is    not quite clean,                    put      a    thickness of cloth or other
protection           over it.             If    these two glass surfaces                            are in good             order,
the    instrument             is   ready for making                      a   test.
                has been necessary                                        the counting                    stage out of the

and as there             is   no filter to enable                   us to         fill       the receiver            with     pure

air, we must now               purify it in another way.                         To do this the stop
cock    A     is closed, and            the stopcock          K    is turned so as to put the
pump into communication with the receiver, that                                        is,   in   the position
shown in fig.            1.   A     stroke of the pump                is   now made.               This    causes
condensation to take place on the dust particles when some of them
drop out of the air.                    The piston       is   again         put to its top position,
and     another           stroke        made,     when more                particles         settle,       or are
deposited          on the sides by the rush of air.                           After this expanding
and condensing process has been done                              a   few times          all the particles
of dust       will   have become nuclei, and                  be deposited               on the bottom of
the receiver.             The air will now be pure, no drops falling when expan
sion    is   made.        This     process of purifying the air                  in   the receiver         is   quite
as   quick     as    the filtering one.           Indeed, when the filtering process                                  is
used,    it   is   always quicker to end by showers                          of the last particles.
     The air in the receiver                 being now purified                  so    that no drops are
seen    falling when expansion                   is    made, the next thing to be done                                is
to introduce             into the receiver             the necessary             quantity of the air to
be tested.           However, before              doing this,         it    is   advisable to turn the
stopcock        K    a   quarter turn to the left, so                       as to      bring the receiver
into communication with the                       outer air.           The object of doing this
is   to bring the pressure inside the receiver to that                                   of the open air.
When making the                      repeated expansions               to     purify the air                in the
receiver,      some air may have                 leaked in past              the piston, and               it   is    to
iiet rid of this air that the stopcock                        is   opened and the receiver                        put
into communication                      with     the     outer        air     before         taking        in     the
measured            quantity.         If   this was not done the amount measured                                      in
would be too small by the amount of the leakage.                                                  There    will be
no leakage           if   everything        is    in good          working            order   ;    still   it    is   a
good precaution always before                         taking in the air to be tested to turn
the stopcock and allow any plus pressure to escape.
     The air in the receiver                 being at the same pressure                            as the       outer
air, the measured                quantity of the air to be tested                       is   then taken into
the receiver in the                following manner — The piston being

 of its stroke,          where     it   ought always to be at the end and beginning
 of every test, and                the stopcock         in   the position shown in the                          draw

 will   be suitable under the conditions.                          Say      it    is   drawn down to the

turned        one quarter turn to the left, so as to bring the inside of the

the measured                quantity of air rushes into the receiver.                                    The quantity
of air we have taken out of the                                 receiver        to make room for the                      air

K     is   turned to the position to admit the outer air to the receiver,                                                  it
will be seen from the drawing that the pump                                                is    then also in com
munication with the outer air by means of                                             a   small passage drilled
longitudinally                  through the plug of the stopcock.                                   By this arrange
ment        only one movement of the stopcock                                    is   necessary           for admitting
the air to the receiver,                     and opening the discharge valve of the pump,
and when               the       stopcock         is    again       turned to bring the receiver into

this    it    will         be    seen, that though we                         have    dispensed           with the air-
pump valves in this new arrangement, we                                               have       not increased            the
number             of      stopcocks             required,          nor the           number          of     movements

 the instrument                   is   then inverted so                  as to cause          the     stirrer to drop
 inside the receiver,                   and again brought to its vertical position when
 the       stirrer again drops.                   This        is   done two or three times to mix the
 impure air with the pure air in the receiver.                                               When this             is   done,
 the instrument                    is    held,     with         the top of the receiver                          horizontal,
 and        in         a   convenient             position           for       the    observer             viewing        the

 then made,                 and        the   number of rain drops counted in the usual
  way.            If   in this trial             more     than five drops                 fall     per     square       milli
  metre,          then too much impure air has been                                   tiiken in, and               a   smaller
  proportion               of impure air must                  be used to get             a   correct       test.       From
  the       number of drops observed                               it    is   easy to determine whether                    ^

 trial,        less    than       one      drop       per    square         millimetre           fell,   then     the
 quantity of impure air ought to be increased                                          to, say, £ impure          air.
 Sometimes,                however,       the air is so pure               that    \ is      too little, and     it is
 desirable to have no pure air in the receiver, and to fill it entirely
 with the air to be tested.                          When this            is the case, the stopcock                K
 is turned so               as to put the receiver into communication                                    with the
 outer air, and the air is drawn out                             of the receiver through the stop
cock A.               This      may be done            either by means                 of the mouth, or by
any simple piece of apparatus.                              The current must be kept flowing
through the receiver till all the pure air has been drawn out.                                               After
this the stopcock A is closed, the receiver put into communication
with the pump, the stirrer worked, expansion made, and the drops
counted in the usual way.                 When working in this way the number
obtained per                cubic centimetre in the air of the receiver has to be
multiplied by                1*4 to      allow for the reduction in number produced by
the     expansion.               When working in pure air it                                is often necessary,
instead of confining                      the     attention          to    one     square        millimetre,      to
observe          the number of drops that                        fall     on a square of four squares,
or on a square of nine squares, that                               is,   of nine square millimetres.
   Having described the manner of working                                         the       new apparatus, we
shall now proceed                   to    describe       what has been done to improve the
counting stage, and make                        it   more simple and easily kept in working
order.          Naturally           glass       seemed       the         most     suitable       substance       for
making those stages on account of the perfection of its surface, as
well      as   for the       ease    with which             it   can be kept clean.               I      had pre
viously tried glass, but with no good results                                          ;   but   though  I      had
hitherto failed, the many advantages                                to be derived from the use of
glass induced               me      to   make        a   fresh      attempt.               The difficulty    with
glass     is    that the drops when they fall on                          it    are nearly invisible.             It
does not matter whether we use glass mirrors or blackened glass                                                  —
in all cases          it   is   difficult to     see     the drops.             On examining into the
cause      of this difference                   between          glass     and silver surfaces,             water
spray was allowed to                     fall on     these surfaces,            and the drops were then
examined by means of                        a    magnifying              lens     as       they rested    on the
different surfaces.                 It was      seen that on the silver, the drops scarcely
touched the surface,                     but      formed little flattened balls, and their
brilliancy            is   due    to the        light reflected           from the internal              concave
surface        furthest from the light                 ;    whereas        the drops on glass adhere

to     and spread              themselves      over      it,     more        or less, but there               is    no
internal          reflection, and only            a     slight external one on the convex
side    next the light.
     The problem then came to be — Could                               it    not be possible to prevent
the    drops adhering to and spreading themselves                                        on the glass         ?     In
some         trials
                  I     got encouragement                to suppose                this might be possible
by    coating the surface              of the glass with some substance                                that would
repel the water.                The manner of testing this was to coat                             a   clean plate
of   glass       with   the substance          under trial, allow              a    shower of spray to fall
on     it,   and examine the drops with                          a   lens.         In this manner many
substances were tried, but the best results were got with paraffin-wax
and      refined beeswax.                 These substances                     were       put on the           glass,
and then rubbed off                   till their      presence            could scarcely be detected,
(rlass so          treated was found               to    act      exactly like silver                ;   the spray
rested on the surface in                  little round balls, and                        showed      the internal
reflection         well.
     These substances                were then tried in the                        dust-counter, on small
silvered          glass        counting      stages, and             it    was      found that they did
perfectly under certain conditions, but                                   it   was difficult             always      to
secure these            conditions        with     the      very small pieces of glass.                            The
treatment             was tried       in practice for  time, but a  was found            it                    to be
troublesome,              as   it   did not always produce the desired result.                                     The
plan was therefore abandoned as                             it    was not thought good                      enough,
nor sufficiently simple, and                     certain in its action, to be put into the
hands of most observers.
      Experiments were therefore begun in another direction, and trials
made of the effect of illuminating                               the      stajie    from bene;ith.             If   we
place        a   mirror underneath the glass stage so                               as    to reflect        the light
of      the      sky through           the     stage,       no    satisfactory            result       is   obtained
owing to the general                   glare     of light.             However,       I       have       fortunately
succeeded              in lighting        the     stage          from        beneath          in     such    a      way
that not              only are the drops visible, but                              they are         seen     with        a
distinctness far superior to anything yet obtained, even with silver
in its best condition                  and best lighting.                      Xot only            so, but    a    very
 low degree of illumination                      is     sufficient to show the drops clearly.
 One great             advantage       of this        is,   that observations can be made in
 early morning and late evening, when the light                                          is   far too feeble for
 working with silver.

    This method of illumination              is shown        in   the   drawing     of the
instrument     (see figs.  1   and 3).        The counting stage is made of
glass, and is illuminated from beneath, the light being reflected
upwards by what we might call               a   spot-mirror, which is simply an
ordinary mirror with a black circular space in the centre.                            This
enables the drops to be illuminated               by means of         a slightly oblique
light, while an image of the black spot covers the field of the lens.
The result is the drops arc seen shining brilliantly on                   a  nearly black
field, and arc counted with great           ease.
    After satisfying myself of        the value of this method of             working, a
difficulty presented    itself.     I  had an ordinary micrometer made                 of a
size suitable for the counting stage.             This micrometer           was made     by
a  professional maker of these instruments               ;  but on fitting it into the
dust counter, the method of illumination was found to be so powerful
and trying,     that it brought out all manner of imperfections                        and
blemishes on the micrometer which were not seen with                           a magnify
ing   glass  and    ordinary      illumination.           The     cross    lines   on   the
micrometer looked rough, with              a   crystalline glistening appearance,
and there were so many specks             on its surface         that working with        it
was very difficult, as few squares were free from spots, which were
apt to   be counted    as drops.        The makers of the micrometer were
therefore   written to about these imperfections               ;  their reply was that
"  they had done their best, carefully selecting the glass,                 &c, and that
they thought it would be difficult              to get a better instrument."             If
better could not be got,      I felt that the value of the new arrangement
would be greatly decreased.            I  therefore      determined to attempt the
manufacture of micrometers myself, to                see    what could be done.          A
piece   of patent plate-glass was procured, this was cut into suitable
sizes and very carefully examined              with    a   strong lens, while it was
illuminated    by means of      a   spot-mirror.        After finding       a fairly good
piece  in the  glass, any specks which were on its surface                    were tested
with a pointed piece of soft wood, and               if they     were not found to be
removable,    the part was rejected        and the search continued.               In this
way a few pieces were obtained large enough for the purpose, and
perfectly free from specks.           These perfect pieces were marked off
on the glass, cut out, and          fine cross     lines at one millimetre           apart
were   engraved    on their surfaces ;          after    which      they were      turned
into little circular discs of the required diameter.

      Two methods of engraving these lines have been tried, and both
of them give much better lines for the purpose                                     than is obtained by
the usual        method of engraving micrometers.                                   One method is to
cover     the glass         with beeswax,               and draw             the    lines      with       a    fine
needle      point, and then etch                       with    hydrofluoric            acid.     The          lines
obtained         by the use of ordinary hydrofluoric                                 acid are not very
suitable, as          they require to be of some breadth before                                      they are
visible with          the spotmirror                illumination,        and they then show                         as
bright glistening lines.                    The mixture known                 as    "white acid," how
ever, gives a fine          line with just that degree of white visibility which
makes       them appear               clear        without     glancing            and distracting              the
attention.         In      this manner the micrometer which is at present                                           in
use   was prepared, and                it    has been found             in   every way satisfactory.
The      vapour of hydrofluoric acid also gives good results.                                    In etching
these     lines, trial must be made with the acid and                                       a piece       of the
same glass        to find the correct time the micrometer requires to be kept
in the      acid to etch              to    the required depth,               the trial        pieces         being
tested    under the spot-minor                     illumination.             The difficulty          of draw
ing these        lines with       a    diamond          is,   that when they are made strong
enough      to be easily seen, they have always bright spots on them.
     It   will   be observed               from the drawing that these micrometers                                  or
counting         stages are made of thick                     glass.     The object of this                    is   to
prevent any speck, or anything adhering to the under side                                                  of the
glass,    interfering        with the clearness of the field.                          The thickness of
the glass        puts them          so much out of focus that they do little harm.
There      is    then, therefore,            no real barrier to the use of these micro
meters, only the glass must be selected when under the illumination
of   a   spot-mirror.         It      may be remarked here that the spot-mirror may
be    found useful for other purposes.                         It gives       us   a   powerful means of
detecting        flaws in lenses,                &c.     The surface           of a new lens when
examined          by means of          it    looks so full of imperfections that                      it      seems
scarcely possible            it    can give         a   perfect     image,         while the imperfec
tions must give rise to the dispersion of                           a   good deal of li<,'ht.
      The other method of engraving the lines on the glass, which has
been tried and found to give good results,                              is    to cover the glass with
very fine emery powder, wetted                            with turpentine, and                   scratch        the
lines      with    a       needle          point   ;   or better,       to tip the needle                 with       a
little diamond              bort.          The      fineness      of these          lines      can    be      made

blunting under the operation.                        In ruling        these lines,       it    is,    of course,
necessary       to keep the pressure                 on the needle constant, and to                              make
the     same number of strokes across                       the glass for each line, in                           order
that the lines may be equally thick.
     The pocket instrument                    has been          occasionally in use during                            the
whole of this summer,                       first with     a    silver stage and then with                             a
glass     one, and          bas       been    working       quite satisfactorily,                  and giving
results agreeing             with those of the larger instrument.                              The instru
ment appears                to be now
                                                                                                                       in by
                                               so    simple,     it   can be easily worked
any one.         So far       as can         be seen at present,              the weakest                  point
the instrument now, and the only one                             likely   to cause trouble,                      is   the
piston packing.               If    the piston       is   not tight, correct work cannot                               he
done.      Fortunately,               the    conditions        of testing make            it       impossible,
with      ordinary care, to make                     a    test with       a    badly-fitting                piston      ;
because     it       would be impossible with                    it    to thoroughly                purify            the
air in the receiver.                  When air leaks in               past the piston, nuclei                         are
admitted, and these                    prevent the showers in the receiver                                      ceasing
completely.            If   the piston leaks          a   little, at each stroke of the pump,
though no air has been admitted by the stopcock,                                     a   few drops will
be seen        falling,       and      call    the     attention        of the       observer to                      the
imperfection.
     To   reduce the trouble from this cause as much as possible,                                          I      have
introduced the spring ring already referred to, under the                                                       leather
cup packing, and so far this has worked well                              ;     the piston has given
no trouble since its introduction.                         One objection to the cup                             leather
packing        is,   that   if   it   gets out of order the repair of                it       might not                be
within     the powers              of the observer.             To obviate this           objection,                  the
arrangement shown in fig.                       5    has been designed,              tried, and found
satisfactory.           It    consists simply             of the substitution                 of           plunger-
                                                                                                   is, a
pump for        a     piston one.            The advantage         of the plunger                          that any
one can easily pack the                     stuffing-box, and some kind of material                                   for
doing     it   can always be obtained.                     In   appearance,        the plunger-pump
is    not so compact              as the      piston one, on account of the diameter                                    of
the stuffing-box              requiring         the guide-tube            to    be    made                 of     much
greater diameter.                 Yet this      is   little disadvantage          so far as compact
ness for packing              is    concerned,        as the      pump-barrel can be slipped
inside the guide-tube, when unscrewed for packing in its                                             case.

1890-91.]    Mr    J.   Aitken on a Simple Pocket Dust- Counter.                             51
   It  may be asked       — Does this simple instrument displace                     the more
complicated       earlier    forms     of   the    apparatus?           Have       the  earlier
forms been unnecessarily complicated               ?     The answer to this is — That
the   pocket instrument          is designed for special              work, and only for
that work ; while         the earlier forms are still necessary, and can do
work    in conditions in which            the pocket instrument would be use
less.    The   large instrument fitted up in the Ben                   ^>'evis   Observatory,
with its arrangement of circulating                  pipes,     aspirator, and artificial
illumination, is still the best form for a first-class observatory, where
observations      have to be made in all .weathers,                   and during night as
well as day.        The Portable instrument                is   still  necessary      when we
wish to test locally pohited air, such                as   that near human inhabita
tions,    that is for sanitary work            ;   while       the use       of the Pocket
instrument       is confined to meteorological work                      in the open         air,
 and  its advantages       are simplicity     and lightness.
    It may    be remarked here that the Pocket instrument may be used
 to give a  rough indication of the impurity of polluted air. The manner
 of using   it for this    purpose    is as follows     : — First, turn       the stopcock     K
 a quarter turn       to the   left, and draw down the piston.                      This takes
 the  impure air into the cylinder.                The whole of this air is then
 discharged by pushing the piston to the top of its .stroke.                           By  these
 movements       nearly, but not quite, all the impure air                  is   expelled from
 the   cylinder.       The small       passage between            the stopcock and the
 piston is still       full of impure air.            Immediately          on     pushing    the
 piston    to the      top of its stroke, the             stopcock is returned to its
 original    position    ; the    piston is then drawn                 down, and at         once
 returned     to its top position.          By   these      movements          we have    taken
 some    of the pure air out of the receiver and mixed it with the small
 amount of impure air            in  the pump passage, and the                   return stroke
 has sent the mixture           into the receiver, where after being stirred,                    a
 shower is produced, and the drops counted.
     This    cannot       give    a  very    accurate         result,    as     some    of   the
  particles must be lost when the air is drawn in from the receiver                            to
  mix with the impure air in the pump passage.                          This    loss, however,
  does not seem to be great, owing probably to the higher temperature
  of the pump-barrel, from contact               with      the    hands,     preventing con
  densation.      Owing to the possibility of              some air being left between
  the top of      the piston and the cylinder,                  it would        be difficult   to

      It   is    well known              that pseudomorphic changes                                   take place with
many minerals.                     These changes                    may be either                    by alteration                        or
displacement.                 In the         case     of carbonate                 of lime they are generally
of the former order.
      Among other work                       conducted at the Marine                                Station, Granton,
during the past year,                    a   number of experiments were instituted with
the view of showing                       how far carbonate of lime was influenced                                                        in
this direction by metallic and other salts.
      Corals,       preferably            the        more          porous           and     soft       varieties,                   were
selected         for this purpose, and                       these were               exposed          to the action                      of
solutions of the following                          salts   :     — Chloride of             manganese,                  sulphate
of iron, chloride of zinc, chloride of chromium, nitrate of nickel,
nitrate of cobalt, nitrate                          of    copper,             nitrate     of lead,               chloride                 of
mercury, chloride of tin, nitrate of silver, phosphate                                                 of ammonia.
  In many             cases the action was very slow, especially                                            in    the case                of

 the salts     of nickel and cobalt.            On   the other      hand, with salts of
 copper and         manganese,      the action was        sufficiently rapid so       as  to
 make a     material difference,        within    a few weeks, in the composition
 of the coral exposed        to their action.
    In most cases there is           a direct interchange between            the lime (of
 the carbonate       of lime) and the oxide of the metal which takes its
 place.     Thus we have        : —
    1.  With     a copper salt, in seven months,           :>G'4  per cent, of carbonate
          of copper taking the place of an equivalent amount of car
          bonate      of lime.
    2.  With chloride of          manganese,      in twelve months, 58'4 per cent.
          of carbonate       of manganese.
    3.  With     salts of iron practically the whole coral is altered              — first,
          into     carbonate,      and   ultimately,     on     exposure     to  air, into
          sesquioxide of iron.
    4.  With salts of        zinc,    26 8 per cent, of carbonate            of zinc had
          formed      in six  months.
    5.  With phosphate of ammonia                the transference      was between the
          carbonic acid of the coral and the ammonia of the salt.                      The
          lime having combined with the phosphoric acid to an extent
          equal to 60 per cent, of phosphate               of lime.
    Without       doubt,     phosphate of lime           deposits,     especially    those
found on old coral islands, have                had   their origin in this manner,
the    phosphoric acid being derived from the excreta of wild fowl,
deposited       upon     dead     coral or carbonate        of lime, the amount of
pseudomorphic          change      being in accordance           with   the   quantity of
guano    deposited.         Of    course,    transference      between      carbonate    of
lime and     alkaline     phosphates can only take place in the presence of
water,   so    that we have no such pseudomorphs where                       the climate
is rainless ;     there    the     guano    remains     as   deposited, whilst       these
deposits    in rainy zones always assume the form of insoluble                       phos
phate   of lime.
    Carbonate of lime, with silver and mercury                   salts, seems to throw
down oxides,        not carbonates.        But    the compounds with nickel and
cobalt we have,        as yet, been unable to determine.
    With    a  true pseudomorph, the structural                form of the carbonate
of lime,      be   it in the      shape    of coral, shells,       or calcite, remains

unchanged       ;  when, however, an oxide is produced, as in the case
with tin and mercury           salts,   it   forms merely a superficial coating.
     From the results of numerous experiments, which it is unneces
sary     to record      here,    we   have      good    grounds      for   assuming     that
carbonate      of lime, either in a massive             or comminuted condition,           or
in solution, carries out the most important function of withdrawing
metallic and other bodies from sea-water, which may be said to hold
(often in minute amount) almost every elementary substance in
solution, and fixing these in a concentrated condition.
     The geological      significance attaching to this property of carbonate
of lime is apparent,          as,  without       question, many metallic ores owe
 their origin to this source.
 Manganese Deposits in Marine Muds.                                 By   Robert Irvine,
                        F.C.S.,    and     John Gibson, Ph.D.
                                  (Read January       9, 1891.)
      Two theories have           been      put forward in order to explain the
 formation        of   manganese         deposits in        marine       muds,   and    more
 particularly       with   regard     to manganese          nodules    :  one by Murray,
  in   a paper    read   before this Society         in  1876, the other by Buchanan
  in    1888.     Murray     assumes        the gradual oxidation          of carbonate    of
  manganese         resulting     ultimately        in the      formation     of   hydrated
  peroxide of manganese.              Buchanan first propounded his theory in
  1880,     and    subsequently, in a paper               read    before   this  Society in
  December 1890, argues as follows                : —
       " The                                                       of the mineral
               principal    agent in the comminution                                  matter
   found at the bottom of both deep                    and   shallow seas and oceans        is
   the ground fauna of the sea, which                   depends     for its subsistence    on
   the organic matter which it can extract from the mud.
       " In order    to fit them     for collecting their nutriment in this              way,
   the animals have been fitted with different forms of masticating                        or
   nulling    apparatus,    so as to thoroughly deal              with the matter      which
   they pass through          their      bodies.      It   has   been    shown    that   most
   silicates are decomposed            to a certain extent when ground or pul
   verised    under water      ;  so that the mere           mastication of the sand        or
   mud in presence of pure water would have                      a decomposing action      on

1390-91.]          Mr Irvine and Dr Gibson on Manganese Deposits. 55
the silicates which              it contains.          This action            is much assisted, in the
case      of marine animals, by the fact that the water which they pass
through their bodies along with the sand is charged with sulphates.
These are easily reduced                       to sulphides by the action of the organic
matter of the secretions                    of the animals.               The resulting sulphide at
once        suffers        double       decomposition              with       any     oxido of iron         or
manganese              whicb is        present       as such in the mud, or may be being
set    at    liberty from silicates under                      the    decomposing influence of
trituration under water.                     The sulphides of manganese                      and iron so
formed          are,    in    course    of nature,        extruded by the animals, and if
exposed          to the sea-water                on the surface           of the      mud are quickly
oxidised,          the manganese                 taking      priority.          The    mud below the
surface layer, where ground life is abundant, remains blue,                                            being
protected by the oxidation of what is above it.
      "At       the bottom of the ocean the mineral matter is thus exposed to
a   reducing process due to the life of the animals which inhabit                                           it,
and to an oxidising                    process       due to the oxygen dissolved in the
water.           Other things being equal, the redness or blueness of                                  a   mud
or clay depends on the                      relative activity of these processes.                      They
also      require       a    controlling         or modifying         influence on one another.
For, although marine animals are much                                 less sensitive to variations
in the          amount         of   oxygen in their                atmosphere           than   terrestrial
animals,         it   is   certain that there must be                a     limit    to the deficiency of
oxygen          which        each   animal can            support    ;     and      when this limit         is
approached,                its reducing           activity    is    diminished,         or   it   may be
extinguished.                The    water in the course                    of    circulation      is   being
continually             renewed,        and,      meeting with            a     diminished     amount of
freshly-reduced matter,                 it     is   able to push the oxidation of the mud
to    a   greater       depth.         It   is   easily conceivable that in many of the
deep parts            of the ocean the amount of ground life may be so limited
that the water has no difficulty                       in oxidising at             once its ejecta;        and
these       conditions          would       be favourable            to    the      formation of       a   red
clay or chocolate mud, according to the                                   preponderance        of iron or
manganese."
      In    a   word, that the animals passing                       sand       or mud through their
 bodies with            sea-water       tend to reduce             the     sulphates present           in the
    sea-water, and the alkaline sulphides so formed cause the formation

of sulphides of iron and manganese, which, on subsequent                      exposure
to sea-water containing oxygen, are                quickly oxidised — the   maDganes*
taking priority.
    It is obvious that any conclusion as to the relative correctness of
these     two theories cannot be arrived at solely by chemical                        con
siderations, but must depend                  largely upon such questions          as the
relative abundance            and distribution        of animal life upon       the sea-
Huor   ;   and, further, upon the physical structure of the deposits.
    In this      paper      we   propose     to confine    ourselves    chiefly to     the
chemical aspect of the               subject, and more        particularly   to   certain
reactions       of manganese,         which we believe to have           a  very direct
bearing upon it.
      A. — Behaviour            op  Hydrated        Protoxide of Manganese.
    If   freshly-precipitated hydrated protoxide of manganese                  be added
to sea-water,       it  is pretty freely dissolved, and         if the sea-water be in
 large    excess, the manganese              remains in solutions for a very con
 siderable     time.      If,  however,    more hydrated protoxide of manganese
 be added than is sufficient to form carbonate                 of manganese with the
 carbonic acid         in the sea-water,          the excess    of manganese       is pre
 cipitated, after a comparatively                short period, as hydrated oxide of
 manganese         (more      or less    completely      peroxidised),    provided      the
 water is sufficiently         aerated.
               B. — Behaviour           of Carbonate of Manganese.
     Carbonate of manganese,                when freshly     precipitated    and amor
  phous,     dissolves in        sea-water      in  notable   quantity,    but    is very
  sparingly soluble in the crystalline form.                Further, when carbonate
  of manganese is dissolved in sea-water, it remains in solution.                     Such
  solutions do not give rise to any rapid production of peroxide of
  manganese.          This    is in   accordance      with what has      been    hitherto
  ascertained      concerning the behaviour of carbonate                 of manganese,
  which, as has been shown by Bischoff and others, is very slowly
  oxidised       under      ordinary      circumstances.       A.    Gorgeu     (Comptes
  Rendus,       cviii.    100G-1009)         states   "that   native   manganese        car
  bonate     or diallogite is very stable,             and remains unaltered           after
  contact    with amited water for three years.               Precipitated   manganese

 carbonate,     which    has   become      crystalline, remains in contact with
 aerated   water, at an ordinary temperature,            without any peroxide.            If
 the   precipitated carbonate          remains in contact with rerated water
 for ten years      about one-third is decomposed,              and the product has
 the   composition MnO,MnO.,.               Two    specimens,       containing respec
tively eighty and seventy per cent,               of manganese         carbonate,     were
exposed      to air   in the dry     state   for eight years.        In    the first case
thirty-three      per   cent.,  and in the second            fourteen per cent.,          of
manganese       carbonate    remained — the      rest  being converted into
                                                                                      " the
oxide    MnO,Mn02."           Other observers have found that under certain
conditions,     and notably in presence of carbonate                of lime, peroxida
tion takes place, although very slowly.                 This   is in accordance       with
our own        experience.      Some eighteen         months ago, in connection
with     Irvine    and Anderson's       investigation on the action of metallic
salts   on carbonate       of lime,*      some   pieces of coral and chalk were
placed in a weak solution             of chloride of manganese              in sea-water.
Interchange        has   taken place,       and    fully fifty      per    cent,   of   the
calcium has been replaced by the                manganese.         The outer portion
of the coral is     blackened, owing to the peroxidation of the carbonate,
and    the bottle in which         the   coral was placed        has become       covered
with     a  film of peroxide of manganese.                There is also        a  distinct
precipitation of peroxide in the liquid.
               C. — Behaviour        of Sulphide of Manganese.
    Precipitated sulphide of manganese               in  a  moist condition is well
known to be very unstable in presence of oxygen or air, and rapidly
becomes       brown     owing    to   peroxidation.       It  also    behaves     like   an
alkaline     sulphide towards certain metallic salts, and even gives up
its sulphur to ferric hydrate, as was found                  by Buchanan          (see  his
paper read before this Society, December 1890).                        In   the presence,
however, of carbonic acid sulphide of manganese                         is   quickly and
completely decomposed          — sulphuretted hydrogen being given                 otf and
carbonate      of  manganese     formed.      This decomposition of sulphide of
manganese        takes    place   even      when the      carbonic acid        is   loosely
 combined,      as   in solution of bicarbonate of lime or                    manganese.

water,   sulphide       of manganese       is not    peroxidised,    carbonate     of
manganese       and sulphate of lime being formed.               This is  shown by
the following       experiment : — Equivalent        proportions of sulphide       of
manganese       and precipitated      carbonate    of lime were added to         sea-
water,   and a current of air was passed              through the mixture for
twelve hours.         The    mixture    did not     become     brown,    and when
examined       it  was    found    that   the whole     of the    manganese      had
been    converted into carbonate,           and the lime into        sulphate.     A
similar quantity of sulphide of manganese              to that used in the above
experiment was          mixed with distilled       water and      exposed    to the
action of   a   current of air for a like period.         It  became   brown,    and
instead of giving off sulphuretted            hydrogen on addition of hydro
chloric acid, chlorine was evolved, so that the decomposition of the
sulphide by oxidation was in this case evidently complete.
    We find, further, that when sulphide of              manganese    is added to
sea-water,    in quantity not more than sufficient to form carbonate of
manganese       with all the carbonic acid present in the sea-water, the
Bulphide is completely decomposed,            sulphuretted hydrogen liberated,
and the manganese          dissolved.
    These facts appeared to us to be incompatible with the theory                  of
the   formation      of manganese       deposits propounded         by Buchanan,
which    hitheito     had appeared       to us to offer a very plausible and
probable explanation          of many of the points connected with             these
curious formations.
    In this     change     of view    we   were   confirmed by the following
experiment      : —
    A mixture of ferrous and manganous                carbonates    was    added to
sea-water    along with       a  quantity of decomposing mussel flesh,           and
the whole mass allowed            to decompose,    air being excluded.         After
four or five days        the    contents of the vessel         became   black,   and
sulphuretted hydrogen was freely evolved.                Air   was then blown for
twelve hours through            a portion    of the mixture, which         was then
filtered and carefully washed.             The residue left in the filter        was
then examined          for   manganese,     which    was    found to be entirely
absent.    Another portion of the decomposing mixture was examined
for sulphide of iron.          The whole of the iron which had been           added
 as carbonate     was found in the form of sulphide.

  From the behaviour of manganese                          as   above    described,       we have
come to the conclusion that the formation of sulphide of manganese
cannot be a result of the animal life, or the decomposition of animal
matter     at the sea-bottom,              as supposed      by Buchauan            ;   inasmuch     as
sea-water containing excess of carbonic acid must be always present.
Buchanan            does    not give any            evidence    whatever          to show        that
sulphide of manganese                 is formed, but appears                 to   rely upon the
supposed        analogy in the behaviour of iron and manganese.                             Under
conditions          such    as   those     referred to by him, sulphide of iron is
necessarily         formed.       Unlike      sulphide      of manganese,              sulphide     of
iron is readily formed in the presence of sea-water, whether mixed
with     carbonate         of lime or not, and solutions of carbonic acid or
bicarbonates do not decompose it or prevent its formation.
  Thus         in all      cases where,      through the life processes of animals,
sulphide of iron is formed                 as a   result of the reduction of sulphates,
the excess          of carbonic acid necessarily formed at the same time
must prevent the formation of sulphide of manganese.
  This holds equally in the                  case   of the decomposition of the dead
bodies of animals at the sea-bottom.
On a Difference between the     Diurnal Barometric Curves
           at Greenwich and at Kew. By Alexander Buchan,
           LLD.
                                      (Read June 16, 1890.)
   In the "Challenger"                   Report on atmospherical                  circulation,     the
diurnal barometric curves at Gries and Klagenfurt in the Tyrol, and
at Cordova          in the Argentine Republic,              are specially examined.
   The most noticeable feature of these daily barometric oscillations
is their very large amounts, those at Gries, for example,                                though in
lat 46° 30' N., being quite tropical in amount                           ;   and the singular
circumstance          is that    in no     season does the morning minimum                  fall   so
low as the daily mean.                   Gries, Klagenfurt,       and Cordova are each
situated       in   a deep       valley.     In     such   situations,       during night, the
whole     surface       of the region is cooled by radiation below the air
above    it,   and the air in immediate contact with the ground becoming

also    cooled,       a system of descending air-currents                       sets in over       the
whole face of the country bounding the deep valley.                                 The direction
and velocity of these                     descending currents        are        modified    by     the
irregularities of the ground, and, like currents of water, they con
verge in the bottom of the valleys, which they                           fill   to a considerable
height with the cold air they bring                           down from the sides of the
mountains.            This cold and relatively dense air rises above the
barometers          which happen to be down in the valley, with the result
that a higher mean pressure is maintained during                                  the night.        In
summer,        when the daily range of temperature                   reaches the maximum,
the pressure          during        the coldpst       time of the        night     is maintained
0   040 inch higher at Gries than it is in open situations in that part
of Europe.           On the other hand, during the day these deep valleys
become highly              heated     by the sun, and a strong ascending current
of air is thereby formed, under which                         pressure    falls unusually low.
Thus,      while      at    Vienna the afternoon minimum                        falls   0-026    inch
below the daily mean, at (Jries the amount of the fall is 0-05S inch,
and at Cordova 0-061 inch.
    The general result              is,   that in these deep valleys atmospheric pres
sure    stands much higher during                       the   night and falls much lon              er
during the day than             is        elsewhere    the case.     The amounts increase
in proportion to the daily range of temperature                     ;    or, strictly speaking,
to the amounts the             temperature            falls below the daily mean during
the    night, and rises above                it   during the day.         The object of this
paper     is   to show that the same rule holds                  in comparatively shallow
valleys such         as    that of the Thames.
    Mr Francis        C. Bayard has calculated, for the five years 1876-80,
the diurnal         range     of barometric pressure               for nine stations in the
British    Islands, including               the two Observatories at Greenwich and
Kew.       The paper          has         recently been       published     by the         Meteoro
logical    Council,         in which          the Tables give the diurnal                range      to
the ten-thousandths             of an inch.            The diurnal       range for these two
places, which are only seven miles apart, being for the same five years,
are therefore strictly              comparable,        and the fourth            decimal renders
possible   a    more exact comparison of the results.

Barographic          Record in the Vicinity of a Tornado. By
         John Anderson. Communicated by Dr Bcchan. (With
          a Plate.)
                              (Bead June 2, 1890.)
    The fluctuation shown by the barographic record occurred imme
diately after    6 p.m., at   the time of the passage of the tornado of
Thursday,       March    27,     1890,    near  Owensboro,       Davies   County,
Kentucky.        The distance of the barograph from the nearest              point
of the tornado can        be   approximated by the evidences           of damage
the tornado left, and did not exceed a mile and a quarter or a                mile
and    a half.    At this  distance     to the south-east    of Owensboro there
is a ridge 150 or 200 feet high, and a large brick house on top was
unroofed and partially         demolished.       This is the first evidence of
destruction in the vicinity of Owensboro, but previous to this the
noise of the approaching          tornado was plainly audible to persons on
the streets of the town.         Until reaching     the ridge above mentioned,
the   tornado appears      to have passed       in the air,    accompanied    by a
roaring sound, without         doing any damage in its passage.            From a
 point about twelve miles to the south-west a tornado passed over
 the latter city two hours later.          The rate of progress of the cyclonic
 area of low pressure,     as   shown by the signal service map, was forty
 miles an hour.       On the same day a parallel tornado passed about
 thirty miles     to  the south of Owensboro, near               south Carrolton.
 There was none to the northwards.
     The sudden dip in the barometric curve at             6 p.m.  of March 27th
 is shown on the accompanying Plate.                 Though the centre of the
  tornado was from     a  mile and     a  quarter to  a mile and a half distant,
 yet the barometer       fell suddenly about the tenth of an inch, and
 immediately thereafter         rose   as  suddenly    to   a  point nearly two-
 hundredths      of an inch higher than the point from which it fell.
  This observation, which          is new to science,      gives the explanation
  of the wrecking of buildings          by tornados    as  by an explosive force
  within   the buildings.      The sudden lowering of the pressure outside,
  which must greatly exceed the tenth of an inch near the centre                  of
  the tornado, is amply sufficient          to account    for the fearful energy
  developed    in these tempests.

                    Note on Potassium Persulphate.
                         By Hugh Marshall, D.Sc.
                             (Read  February 16, 1891.)
   Persulphuric       anhydride    and the corresponding acid have               been
known for some time.           Berthelot obtained the former by subjecting
a mixture of sulphurous anhydride and oxygen to the ejiluve elertrique
(as in the   preparation of ozone), and            a   mixture of the latter with
sulphuric    acid, by adding the anhydride              to water.     He    also pre
pared  a  similar mixture       by the electrolysis of sulphuric          acid solu
tion in a cell where the         electrodes   were separated      by  a porous pot.
Both   substances       he   found to be very easily decomposed,                spon
taneously evolving oxygen.             Up till    now, however, the correspond
ing salts      have not been         prepared.        In fact, Mendeleef, while
commenting        on Berthelot's     results,  expresses     the opinion that per
sulphuric    anhydride is not a true acid-forming oxide, but             a  peroxide
similar to those of the metals barium, lead,              &c, and that Berthelot's
persulphuric      acid is analogous     to peroxide of hydrogen.           Recently,
however,      I   have   obtained     the    potassium      salt, and   have     since
succeeded     in preparing it in quantity.
   While     oxidising    a  solution of cobaltous sulphate in presence of
potassium      sulphate and sulphuric          acid,    by electrolysing     it  in  a
divided    cell,   as in Berthelot's experiment,         I  obtained  a quantity of
white feathery crystals.          These were filtered off, washed with cold
water,  and dried on porous plate over sulphuric                  acid.    The sub
stance   was     found to possess powerful oxidising properties.                When
heated   it fused and        soon   decomposed,        evolving   acid fumes       and
leaving a white residue        which proved to be potassium           sulphate.      A
solution of the substance        gave    only   a  faint precipitate with barium
chloride    solution,    but on boiling        a   dense   precipitate   of   barium
sulphate     separated     gradually     while     chlorine   was   simultaneously
evolved.      These properties seemed to point to the salt being                a per
sulphate, and analysis confirmed this opinion.
   A known quantity            was    ignited    and the resulting      sulphate of
potassium weighed.          The residue amounted to G4'2 per cent, of the
original.       For potassium persulphate theory requires               64 -4.    The

 oxidising   power was estimated              by titration    with ferrous sulphate
 and potassium permanganate.                 The extra oxygen thus found was
 5 92 per cent, (equal to 35-5 of SO,,).                Theory requires 5'93 (35-6
of S04).
   I  have   since    prepared       a considerable       quantity       of the salt by
clectrolysing     a   solution        of potassium hydrogen               sulphate   in   a
divided cell.        After     some     hours the persulphate crystallises             out
from the liquid surrounding the anode.
   Potassium      persulphate dissolves fairly readily in water at the
ordinary    temperature,         easily in hot water.             If   the solution     be
boiled, especially      if it     is   acid,   decomposition with evolution              of
oxygen occurs.         By solution in          warm water,      and cooling, the salt
can be recrystallised         in prisms resembling those of potassium per
manganate,     with which the persulphate is evidently isomorphous.
   Dr James Walker          has    kindly determined       the electric      conductivity
of the solution, and his results             show that the formula is KS04, the
solution behaving         in    a   manner comparable           to one of potassium
perchlorate   (which is also isomorphous with the permanganate).
   The solution of the pure salt is neutral to litmus, and appears to
be stable at ordinary           temperatures.        It  gives no precipitate with
solution of barium salt.            With silver nitrate it        gives no immediate
precipitate, but what appears             to be silver peroxide separates out on
standing.     When mixed with potassium                  iodide solution, iodine is
liberated only gradually, but more quickly on heating.                           The solu
tion is not decomposed           by peroxide of hydrogen.              It  is attacked by
ferrous sulphate in the cold, ferric and potassium sulphates being
produced.      If   some     of the solid substance            be added        to a small
quantity of strong ferrous sulphate solution,                   as   the    salt dissolves
the green colour changes to brown, and the                  liquid    becomes warm.
   When the solid is gently warmed with strong nitric or sulphuric
acid, oxygen     highly    charged      with ozone is evolved.               Hydrochloric
acid gives chlorine.
   The properties of the salt have                  been   as    yet but superficial ly
examined,    and no attempt has been made to prepare                         other persul-
phates.    I  am, however,           engaged in     a  fuller    investigation     of the
subject, and also in examining the behaviour of salts of other acids
when electrolysed in        a   divided cell.

On the         Soaring of Birds : being a Communication from

      by the late Mr William Froude to Sir William Thomson,
      published in      these   "Proceedings,"      March      19, 1888.
                                (Read January    5, 1891.)
   The object of the present          communication is to give the purport of
the remainder      of the letter referred to in the title,         as  well as that of
other letters     bearing on the same subject written by the late                    Mr
Froude shortly afterwards, which were not at hand at tho time the
extract referred     to was printed.
   Iu the extract already printed, Mr Froude expressed                       the   view
that the continued " soaring

                                        (or    sailing                        also been
called)    of birds      only    took place     where     there   was   an  ascending
current of air of sufficient speed.              And    he noticed as an apparent
exception,      which    he had observed         one day on the passage to the
Cape on board       H.M.S. " Boadicea," that in            a very light    wind some
albatrosses were seen soaring (manifestly without wing stroke)
"
  almost ad libitum," where there could not possibly be any ascend
ing current due        to deflection of wind         by the ship,       lie suggested
as a   possible    explanation, and one which to all appearance fairly
accorded     with the birds' visible      movements,        that they were availing
themselves       of the ascending stratum             of air which         must have
extended       above   the advancing slope           of each wave of the well-
marked ground-swell which was running.                    From the dimensions of
this, the maximum upward speed of such air current was estimated
at about 3 feet      per second.
   Thus far the extract already printed.               In    the original letter there
followed     a mathematical investigation to determine whether this up
 ward air current of 3 feet per second             could suffice for the supposed
effect     This  I now paraphrase       and somewhat abbreviate         as follows   : —
   Suppose a bird soaring with constant speed and direction in still,
or  uniformly moving, air          ; and let
      a = the angle (taken downwards from horizontal, in a fore and

              the air.     Hence,

     The nett force acting upon the bird, owing to its motion                                     through
the air, should be treated              as consisting              of two elements,               viz.    (1)
the normal force on the wings due to their obliquity                                   <r   to the line
of motion, (2) the resistance due to the air friction                                  on the wing
surfaces and body.  Taking, then,
       A     = total wing surface (one           side);       sq. ft.
       rA =     total surface area      as   reckoned for computing resistance;                          do.
       V     = speed through the air         ;    ft. per.       sec.
     These two elements of force may be expressed thus —
        Normal force (lbs.) = PAV2o-              ,
        Eesistance (do.) = FrAV2             ,

     The strict condition of equilibrium                     for constant speed              and direc

equal to the weight of the bird.                      Seeing that the values for a and

 out loss of level.       For in maintaining his level by              active     flight, the
 bird must be supplying at least the work theoretically equivalent to
 lifting his own weight at the rate at which ho would quiescently

animals, when taxing their strength in given degree, is said,                         I  be

    Hence conclusion        (i)  above    is in accordance         with the fact that
the larger flying birds are comparatively few,                   and that the largest
birds do not fly at all.
    The value of this supposed           approximate constant, viz., the speed
at which animals in general are capable of continuously                      lifting their
own weight for a long time at a stretch, if estimated from the reputed
"                  "
   horse-power (or equally from the reputed man-power), would be
about 30 ft. per minute, or '5 ft. per second.                       If, then, the same
relative power-capacity may be assigned to birds                  as we have     estimated
for the average animal, we might have concluded at the outset, and
without the aid of the mathematical reasoning which has been given,
that the upward air current of            3 ft. per second ascribed to the passage
of the waves, would suffice several times over to enable                     any birds to
soar that are able to fly in        still  air.
    On  the other hand, equation (8) above,                if interpreted by any      such,
numerical     values     as   would    be used       in   any ordinary         mechanical
problem of the kind, gives           a value for Vj(aj + o-j) much greater than
3 ft. per second,      and we are thus confronted by a serious paradox.
    Mr Froude took for his             albatrosses       W=    20 lbs.,   A=    22 square
feet (figures   presumably obtained from the officers of the ship).*                    For
P, F,  and r, he took (to minimise the paradox) as the most favourable
values which        he  thought might be conceivably justified,                   ^=2\j'
F = — -—        ,  r=l"5.       These values for P and           F          ^

gravity of air    ;  F  not increased on the score of the greater viscosity
of air, but     P doubled       on the     score   of advantage        that might con-

 r is taken as       T5, instead of over          2-0 as     it prima facie should be,
on the       score of eddies         conceivably annulling in part the friction
on      the    upper      surfaces    of   the wings.           These    values put        into
equation       (8) give no less than 4-7 feet per second                 as  the value for
V1(a1 +      o-j).    Thus, apparently —
     (1) The formula as interpreted by these constants requires no                          less
than 4 '7 ft. per second rate of descent.
     (2) The suggested explanation of the soaring admits                       of   no more
than 3 ft. per second.
     (3) The fact that birds can sustain flight in still air admits                   of very
much less still, unless we can suppose that                  in birds  the relative power
capacity      is many times greater than            it  is in horses and men.
     It  is not my purpose             here to attempt to clear up this paradox.
Mr Froude          appears    to have considered the formula unimpeachable in
structure,      at least as a fair approximation            (and so  I think it evidently
is), but the constants           probably in error.           At any   rate, he seems to
have treated the argument from the power capacity                           of animals        as
sufficient     prima facie       evidence   that the updraught of the advancing
wave slopes would suffice for soaring                 ;  because in subsequent letters
he describes further observations made with the object of identifying
the occasions of soaring in a calm              with position of       the bird over the
advancing        wave slopes.        But first  he had an opportunity of observ
ing soaring in          a  strong wind, under circumstances which appeared
to defy the idea that advantage               was being taken of local ascending
currents.        This must       be described in his own words,             in  a  letter to
myself dated 14th February                1879  : —
     "But    since    I have    been here we have had a lot of           S.E.   gales   ;  and
though the sea surface has been like that at Torquay pierhead                             in   a
S.S.W. gale, and thus without                any big waves, we have seen             a lot of
vkale birds, as they are called, playing the skim trick in the most
marvellous         and fascinating way.
     "The     albatrosses     did occasionally flap, but these birds went high
and went low, went              fast  and went slow, with the wind or against
   *
      As  a justification    for this, Mr Froude suggests the circumstance            that in
the cup anemometer          the circumferential speed of the cups is accounted to be
 i the speed of the wind ; hence the relative speed of the wind facing the con
cave surfaces is only one-half that facing the convex surfaces, yet the wind
 presumably      exerts the same force on both.

wards       if they           pleased, not flapping a wing                  once for hours,         I may-
swear   !— all in             such     a   way as to be dumbfoundering,                    unless       it be
possible to suppose an ascending current apparently uniformly dis
tributed over             a   level ocean, and reaching to at least 50 or 60 feet
above       it,   and     with     a   rate      of ascent sufficient to explain the birds'
behaviour.              This supposition   j/rima facie   is                  an inadmissible            one,
for the air,           if    was all ascending, would
                              it                                             leave   a    vacuum         over
the water.
     " At first       I   thought that the retarding action of the water friction
(which was plainly enormous, for      was tearing the water surface
                                                               it
to tatters) miglit explain the action by the circumstance that the
retardation would crumple up the lower air strata                                         endways, and
by thickening                 them, would            in    effect produce an ascending             motion
in   them.
     " But in          spite of the more vigorous frictional                     action close to the
water       surface, the ascent                  of the particles due to the crumpling                     up
would be nil at the surface                      ;   yet the birds seemed to find the ascent
as   active there as anywhere.                             Still
                                                               I    think   there    is   something         in
this view.
     " Two        days        later, however, when the gale was                     a   good    bit more
furious,    I     had     a     better proof of what was happening, though the
'

                                 gale the sea surface seems to
like   dust       ?     Well, in this            case, the air was for           a   long time so full
of sea spray up to                  a      level of 50 or 60 feet, that              it   looked   as   if   a
heavy April shower                     was passing,            though there was a clear blue sky
overhead,             and sunshine.
     " Now, whatever could carry                          spray to that height would answer the
birds' purpose.                 To-day the birds are again about, but the wind                               is
only    a    double reef cutter breeze,                        if   so much  ;   and to-day, though
they do       a       good deal of skimming, they have also to do                           a   great deal
of flapping at intervals."
     As an explanation                      of    the ascent        of the particles of spray,             Mr
Froude goes on to suggest that the frictional eddies in the air must
receive their most effective                       renewal of energy from the friction                      on
their under sides nearest the water surface, and that consequently their

speed must be greater on the ascending aide than on the descending
side.   The particles of spray passing across and through the vortices
must    be subjected alternately to the upward and downward forces
due to the ascending and descending speeds.                           True, the ascending
streams, being thinner          in proportion          as their speed is greater,           will
presumably act on the particles for                  a  proportionately smaller share
of the total time        ;  but the resistance           being    as speed       squared,   the
aggregate     upward momentum imparted to the particles will never
theless exceed the aggregate downward momentum.
    This  suggestion       is interesting, as a plausible explanation                   of the
phenomenon        of the rising spray          ;   at the same time           I  hardly think
the suggested operation can favour the soaring of birds except                             by  a
second order quantity.             For, in proportion             as the     bird's speed is
high (as   I  think it must        be), relatively to the           speed of the eddies,
the effect of the local contrarities of the eddy speeds becomes to the
bird one simply of small differences               in angle of impact on the wings              ;
and, since the pressure on an obliquely moving plane                            varies  simply
as the angle     (for small angles), the consequent differences in upward
pressure would be proportional to the times for which those pres
sures act, so that the aggregate upward momentum and mean upward
force would be the same as in             still   air.
    I imagine    that the soaring witnessed                by Mr Froude on the occa
sion which he describes,          is to   be ascribed to           an    operation which,
so far as   I  know, was first suggested               by Lord Rayleigh             in a com
munication      to Nature      of 5th April 1883, viz.,              a   utilisation    by the
birds of the difference        of wind-speed at different levels.                     But this
explanation     evidently did not occur to             Mr Froude        a,t the time, and      I
need make     no further reference to it here.
    Mr   Froude's     next     letter     bearing on          the subject          was   dated
Saldanha Bay, 24th February 1879, and in it he says : —
    "             The voyage up from Simons Bay was delightful                              for
                                                                                          ;
it was a glassy calm        ; and    as  there was also a tolerably pronounced
swell, especially the latter part of the way,                   I  was able       (and Tower
helped me)       to watch       the    albatross's       flight    in   a   calm, with the
 following results     : — When flying high they had                   to flap their wings
 continuously,     except when descending.                When near the surface they
 '
   skimmed'     occasionally, and, as far         as we     could distinguish, they did
 this only when traversing a region                over an ascending wave slope.

72               Proceedings          of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                   [sess.
Very often this was               conspicuous.       Now and then          I noticed one    or
more of the birds skimming for a half-moment at a time in a position
which must have been so, viz., when they were hidden, or all but
hidden, from us by             a    wave   crest, the     back or the descending side
of which was towards the ship.                    As the      waves were      long and not
high,    it  was only       by keeping exactly in this position                 that a bin!
could remain invisible, or visible only partially and for a second or
two at     a time,     as  the wave varied in form             a little, or as he rose and
fell  a  little.
    " It   also frequently happened that two, three, or four of the birds
were flying        in   close company,        generally in single file.          When    they
were     thus flying close to the water,                 they occasionally 'skimmed,'
and     then after a few seconds                 began     again to flap.       And it    was
noticeable that they all made the change                        simultaneously,
implying that they had simultaneously arrived at                         a suitable region."
    At   the end of a letter on other subjects,                 dated 10th March 1S79,
he   says —
               "  I  have made quite sure            that the skimming birds follow
the ascending wave-slopes                as I had surmised."
    These remarks            of Mr Froude        seem to make         it clear that the up-
 draught of the advancing slopes                  of   a   ground swell in       a calm may
 sometimes       be a cause of soaring.             It   certainly seems to be the only
 cause which can account for soaring                     in  a calm     or very light wind     ;
 on the other hand,              it  is a cause which can operate only when there
 is a large       swell, and when the wind is either very light or not in
 the direction of the swell.
     Perhaps the most interesting feature of the letters consists in                       the
 analysis of the theoretical conditions of flight, and the paradox which
 thence results.           For this paradox        has an important          bearing on the
 computation of air resistances in general, and any information which
 may     serve      to    throw       light upon      it    has a correspondingly        wide
 significance.

We see further that the first row of this compound determinant con
sists of the fifteen determinants dealt with above, and that therefore
only three of the fifteen are independent.   Similarly follows that theit
vanishing   of the first three of the second row entails the vanishing                    of
all the rest of tho row, and that the vanishing of the first three     the           in

to each       other exactly             as    the elements of                a    row are ; consequently the
vanishing of these nine elements                                   entails the vanishing of all the
other elements              of the first three columns.                                    Finally, viewing              these

remaining           rows,    we see that all the                        225       minors will vanish                    if   the
nine minors common to the first three                                    rows and first three columns

This result was                  enunciated         without proof by Sylvester in the
Philosophical             Magazine             for September 1850.  It appears from the
foregoing to be an easy deduction from Cayley's theorem                                                            published
seven years before.
    Cayley's next theorem                      is   bound up with                     a    certain notation intro

                                        (Read January           19,      1891.)
  The first step is to find an expression for the distances A, p, of
the centre              of the oval from the guides.                           These, distances                               are to be
found separately,               beginning with             A.
  For this purpose it is indifferent whether wo consider the oval                                                                                as
moving            in contact       with the guides,                     or whether we consider the
guides as variable                tangents        moving round the circumference of the
oval.        On the latter supposition, the extremity of A is evidently the
locus of the foot of the                    perpendicular on the tangent of the oval,
whose equation is given in the title.
  Let f,           7]   be the coordinates of this locus referred                                        to the principal
axes    of        the generating curve as reference                           lines.           Then, by                       a       known
relation, the equation of the required locus is
                                 {? + r?)^i={a£)*^                       +(br,)^i                    .        .           .           (A).
The distance,              A, is the radius-vector corresponding to $ and jj                                                           :

of a and p, quantities containing                  x1 and y2.      Hence for the ellipse

immediately derived from these are of the 5th and 6th degrees, and
 the final equation is of the 10th degree.                      Dr Muir        has shown,       in
 a paper    just    read, that the final equation is divisible by a quadratic
 factor,    and    is thus of         the same      degree as its      limiting form, the
 glissette    of the parabola.
     Since the glissette of any curve may be found from the equation
 of the pedal (supposing the latter can be found), the glissette may
 be considered          as   belonging to a system         of derivative curves which
 includes the pedal, the inverse, the reciprocal-polar, and (as shown
 by the writer in a previous paper) the caustic for parallel rays (Proc.

The Influence of High Winds on the Barometer at the
   Ben Nevis Observatory. By Alexander Buchan, LL.D.
                            (Read March 2, 1891.)
    The question of the effect of wind on the readings of the baro
meter   was first examined by         Sir Henry James in         a paper    read to
the   Society on March        15,   1852.*      The observations were made
during the succession of gales from the south-west which occurred
in January and February          of that year, at his house in Granton,
with an aneroid barometer,          laid horizontally     in succession      on the
table of his room     in the cottage, on the seat of the open summer-
house, and on the surface of the ground close to the summer-house,
all at the same level.        The anemometer          employed was of a very
simple construction, being on the same principle               as the   instrument
used for weighing letters,     the weight or pressure         being indicated by
the compression    of  a  spiral spring in      a tube.     A  table of results is
added,   giving the depression         of the barometer       in decimals of an
inch for the velocity of the wind from 14 to 40 miles per hour.                   At
 14  miles the barometric depression           was O010      inch, and increased
gradually to a depression      of 0'045 inch at 40 miles per hour.               Un
fortunately, the number of observations            on which the depression        for
each wind-velocity     has been deduced          are not given, and the obser
vations in the cottage and those at the open summer-house                  are com
bined into one result.        It  may be safely assumed           that the result-;
arrived at indicate too large barometric depressions              for the different
wind-velocities    as   barometers       are   usually   observed,     namely,     in
 houses.   The depression      on the lee side of any obstruction             in the
wind such     as a  summer-house         is greater than it is in the room
of a dwelling-house.         Further,     a   barometer     laid on the ground
 during strong winds will, if        the wind     brush briskly over the key
hole of the instrument, indicate a less pressure            than that of the air.
Since,   however, in such a position, the wind will only at a few
points have access to the connecting opening between                   the aneroid
and   the free atmosphere,       it   may be assumed        that the instrument

will,  in  the great    majority    of   cases,   show a higher reading than
that of the free atmosphere.           For    these    reasons,    these barometric
depressions    are too large.       Since 1852        meteorologists      have   taken
no action on the results of Sir Henry James's inquiry in discussions
on barometric      readings    and wind-velocities          ;  and    practically    no
advance    has   been made       in this branch of meteorology.               Various
arrangements have been proposed,            but none of them can be regarded
as satisfactory, to arrive at the knowledge of the actual pressure of
the free atmosphere during          high winds.         The difficulty consists       in
finding a perfectly unscreened            position      for   the   barometer,      and
securing at the same time that the wind, brushing past the small
openings    connecting the mercury of the cistern with the air outside,
will not partially lower      the pressure on the mercury in the cistern,
and   so  render the instrument           no longer indicative           of the true
pressure    of the    free  atmosphere.         The    same     remark applies        to
aneroids.
   In carrying    out, during     the past five months, the           instructions of
the directors of the      Ben Nevis Observatory to discuss the observa
tions   made   at the    High and Low Level Observatories, it quickly
became apparent that the influence of high winds on the barometer
was the first inquiry calling for serious            attention.      The depression
of the barometer        during high winds was plainly so serious                  as to
render the examination of many questions all but a hopeless                       task,
until some approximation was made to the values                      of these depres
sions for different wind velocities.
   Now, since the horizontal distance of the High and                      Low Level
Observatories    is only about four miles,         it follows that      the two may
virtually be treated as one as regards           the geographical distribution
of pressure.     But    the  Observatory at the top of tlio mountain is
peculiarly exposed to high winds, which are occasionally so violent
that the observers must be roped together on going outside to make
the observations    ;  and it not unfrequently occurs that very strong
winds    prevail, while over the surrounding low country calms and
light winds only        prevail.     On the other hand,             the   Low Level
Observatory at      Fort-William       is in a sheltered         position, and high
winds are of comparatively rare           occurrence.        Thus, then, these two
 Observatories    present the      conditions      which      are  essential   to this
 inquiry, viz^ one      of the barometers         is in    a   building   exposed     to

90            Proceedings      of Royal    Society   of Edinburgh.                [ssss.
winds of all velocities up to at least 150 miles an hour, whereas the
other is in    a  building where either calms or light winds only at the
time prevail — so that this barometer may be regarded as recording
the pressure of the free atmosphere.              It   was therefore      resolved to
institute   a  comparison between the sea-level            pressures of these       two
barometers,       employing only those cases when winds                  at the Fort-
William Observatory           were  light
    The scale used on Ben Nevis for the observations of the force of
the   wind     is a modification       of Beaufort's scale, 0 to 12.              Much
attention     has been given to ascertain, the wind's rate              in miles     per
hour, corresponding to each of the figures of Beaufort's scale.                     For
this   purpose,      a   modification    of Robinson's      anemometer        was de
signed by Professor Chrystal for the Observatory                  ; and during       the
times the instrument is not frozen up in            a  thick covering of       ice, the
comparisons have been made.                These have been discussed by Mr
Omond       in   a paper    read to the Society.       The comparison is given
at the top of Table        L
    The reductions of the barometric readings on the top of                         Ben
 Nevis to sea-level have been made by Table                VIII.    prepared    for  the
purpose,     as given in the volume of the            Transactions recently pub
lished,* and the readings at Fort-William in the usual way.                         The
differences    of the two reduced readings were then entered in columns
 headed 0, 1, 2, 3,       Ac,  and according to the        wind force at the Ben
 Nevis Observatory at the time.             Table  I.  gives the mean differences
 for each wind force for each wind; and the figures                    in  the second
 half of  the Table show the number of observations from which each
 mean difference        has been    calculated.   The comparison for the six
 months was made from the hourly observations at both Observatories,
 from August 1890 to January 1891.               But    since this period gave too
 few observations for the highsr            wind velocities for good averages,
 the observations from January 1885 to             July    1890 were utilised for
 the five hours of the day at which corresponding observations were
 made    at   Fort-William.       Only    the wind forces from 5 to 11             have
 been   thus utilised,       and the results have         been   incorporated      with
 those for the six months,         and entered at the foot of Table         L     In all
 4596 of the Ben Nevis observations have been reduced to sea-level
 for these comparisons.

     Thus in calm weather, the two reduced barometers                       are practically
the same, but         with every      increase of wind           the   depression of the
barometer      steadily augments.            It  is not   till a  velocity of more than
 20 miles an hour is attained that the depression                         amounts to one
hundredth of an inch.             At  63 miles an hour,         it is O-O'iO inch       ;   at 96
miles, 0104 inch; and at 120 miles, 0-150 inch.                       The amount of the
 depression     of the barometer          is thus practically proportional                to the
 velocity of the wind, from zero to                a velocity of 120 miles per hour.
     This  depression     of the barometer           is no doubt occasioned              by the
wind     drawing      out the air from the room                where     the barometer is
hung,    as   it  rushes   past    the    observatory, thus producing               a     partial
vacuum and consequently               a   lower pressure.          If  a  window or door
 is opened on the side of the room                exposed to the wind, the readings
of the barometer          are    thereby raised        ;  whereas     on the lee side of
 buildings,      in  rooms      connected         therewith,     and     in    rooms         with
 chimneys,       the barometric          readings are lowered.               Now,       as    the
 barometer      of the Ben Nevis Observatory is hung in a room, with
 the usual chimney, door, and windows, these results                      may be regarded
 as   applicable to the readings of barometers                 generally, since they are
 in almost every case suspended                in situations similar         to that      of  the
  Ben Nevis barometer.

  pressure over those parts of the country where the prevailing winds
  are stronger than elsewhere.               It   may now be regarded             as probable

real   lowering      of atmospheric pressure          in these districts,    but are
only an increased        depression of the barometer         brought about by the
stronger winds which prevail in those parts of the country.
    In forecasting weather it will          be necessary     to keep this effect of
high winds on the barometer              constantly in mind, with the view of
arriving at a better approximation             to the real geographical     distribu
tion of pressure at the time the forecasts are being framed.
    In working out         the    question of the barometric gradient from
actual observations, particularly the relations of the higher gradients
to the wind velocities, the results hitherto arrived at cannot be said
to be satisfactory.        The reason is that, while the wind velocities were
 known with tolerable accuracy,            the pressure     of the free atmosphere
 could not be dealt with, because the observations did not record it                   ;
 what the observatories recorded             was only     the barometric readings,
 not reduced      proportionally to the force of the wind at each observa
 tory.     For   such   discussions to be satisfactory, the amount of the
 depression     of the barometer, owing to the force of the wind prevailing
 at the time, should be approximated to and allowed for.
     Table   II.,  showing the mean diurnal variation of the differences
 between the two reduced             barometers    for the six months lias been
 prepared     in this way      :   The differences      for eacli hour of the day
 were corrected       by adding, in each       case,  the corrections indicated      in
 Table    I., according     to the wind force at the time, from which              the
 monthly means were calculated.               The six months' means show that
 from    7   p.m.   to 9   a.m., the reduced         High Level Barometer        reads
 the higher, and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. that it reads the lower.
     In  these reductions the mean temperature              of the stratum of atmo
 sphere from the bottom to the top of the mountain has been assumed
 to be the same as the mean at the two observatoriea                   If  it be sup
  posed that the diurnal variations for the six months in Table                II.  are
  simply an expression of the degree to which the mean temperature
  of the    two observatories       falls short of, or exceeds, the mean of the
  whole    intervening     stratum, it follows that during the warmer hours
  of the day the        temperature of the whole intervening              stratum is
  about 0°"8 lower, and during the colder hours of the night 0"-8 higher
  than the mean of the two observatories.
     The variations of differences         are of course much larger and          more
  uniform in their distribution           during the hours of the day.         It will

                               (Read   April  6, 1891.)
                                    (Abdract.)
    In our previous communications                to   the   Society    (see   Trans.
xxxvi.    211) we described the behaviour of the ethyl potassium
salts of normal dibasic acids on electrolysis.                   These we found
always    to yield   the diethyl      esters    of normal     acids    of the same
series.    We   have    now extended          our investigation to acids         with
side chains, and in this paper           give    an account    of the electrolysis
of    ethvlpotassiutn     methylinalonate          and     ethylpotassium       etbyl-
malonate.

This dimethvl.suecinic acid contains two similarly                  situated asym
metric    carbon    atoms,    and is     thus, like tartaric acid,        capable    of
existence    in four    isomeric forms — two optically            active,   and   two
optically inactive, one of these             latter (corresponding to racemic
acid)    being a   compouud or mixture in equal               proportions     of the
 two opposite    optically active      acids.     As   the optically active forms
are   produced    in equal    proportions by any purely chemical process
from inactive      materials,   we were justified         in expecting to obtain
by electrolysis      a  mixture      of   the     esters   of  the    two    inactive
 symmetrical    dimethylsuccinic acids.
     The synthesis was conducted            in precisely the same manner             as
 in our previous experiments.           150 grams of ethylpotassium mcthy]-
 malonate    yielded about      60 grams       of an ethereal     product, which,
 on distillation,   gave   a  fraction of 30 grams, boiling between              194*
 C. and 206° C.       This portion      was saponified      with boiling alcoholic
  potash, and the potassium          salt thus formed converted into               the

freed from       a  small quantity        of an oily substance         by drying      ori
porous tile, and then            subjected to systematic fractional            crystal
lisation from water.            We     succeeded     in separating and purifyin?;
two acids    — one,    the less soluble, having the melting-point            193°    C,
the other melting at 120°-121° C.                  The acids on analysis proved
to have     the same composition, both corresponding to the formula

   The acid melting at 193° would thus seem to be identical with
the para-s-dimethylsuccinic            acid of BischofF (melting-point          194r);
and that melting at 120°-121° with his anti-js-dimethylsuccinic                    acid
(melting-point       120°).      For further confirmation         we measured       the
electrolytic conductivity          of solutions of      the acids,   and found      the
following dissociation-constants          : —
          Para-acid,    K = -0208 (K = -0205,          Bethmann).

   In    a similar      manner we        performed      the   electrolysis  of ethyl
potassium      ethylmalonate, and from 150 grams of the salt obtained
63 grams of an ethereal          liquid.     The portion of this boiling        above
200°,    was saponified, the          potassium salt acidified, and the          crude
acid    extracted    with ether and         purified   as  in the preceding       case.
Besides     water    as   a means      of fractional crystallisation,      we found
benzene a useful solvent for effecting the separation of the isomeric

Proposed Extension of the Powers of Quaternion Differ
    entiation. By Alexander M'Aulay, Ormond College,
          Melbourne.               Communicated by Professor Tait.
                                           (Read December   15,   1890.)
     It   will,    I    think,        be acknowledged        that Quaternions,             while    pro
viding       for       the       physicist     a   machinery       much     more        natural anJ
graceful          than the Cartesian, for all conceptions strictly geometrical,
do    not at present afford equal facilities                         for the consideration              of
questions involving                    differentiation.      It    is true that there is              one
well-known symbol of differentiation of great utility, which                                    enables
Quaternions to deal in a suitable manner with many such questions ;
but there are left whole classes of differentiations in which the
symbol is of no avail.
     This    has led me to the consideration of other symbols of differen
tiation, and to              a   slight generalisation of the powers of the symbol
already       mentioned.               I    had thought it necessary only to define                   the
extensions here referred to, and proceed                           to apply them.           But Pro
fessor Tait, whilekindly procuring me this opportunity of bringing
forward my views, has given me fair warning that the repugnance
of physicists to some of my notation may prove an insuperable
obstacle          to their paying any attention                   to investigations conducted
in that notation.                  This      personal   reference    will explain why, in             the
present short paper, an apology for, and explanation of, the methods
are entered            into, much more detailed than could otherwise                            be con
sidered advisable or even justifiable.
     In what follows, after an explanation of                        the proposed changes               of,
and additions to, quaternion differential notation,                             a   brief account       in
the abstract             is      given of the reasons           for and against         what    can     be
called innovation                 ;   and the rest of the           paper   is   devoted to        some
examples           of the application              to the theories    of elasticity aud         electro
statics.     I         may here remark that, in             a   short paper like the            present,
it   is   impossible to do full justice to the views enunciated,                                because
for this purpose                  it   would be necessary to go over                a   large    part    of
the       ground covered                by mathematical physics             ;   but   if   the slight
variations from previous custom                         indicated below do not meet                 with

that studied discountenance from                     all authorities in             the matter, which
I    have      been assured they must,              I could           give in   a   future paper some
few applications          of the methods which would probably prove in
teresting        to physicists, and which cannot be treated readily,                              if   at all,
by methods other than those in question.
     As is well known, Hamilton's                       symbol V may be defined by the
equation
                                              ,d        .   d     ,   d
                                              dx         dy           dz
where              k, x, y, z have           the usual meanings.                    Hamilton       himself
did not examine the                 utility of V.             This explains,         most likely, why
he    did not state more exactly how to consider to what symbols the
differentiations implied should refer.                           In    the simplest applications of
V these differentiations will refer to that symbol, and only to                                               it,
which immediately follows the operator.    Very little practice in the
application of        V   to physical questions serves to show that,                              if   we are
to be         bound by this rule, at least seven-eighths                             of   the     potential
utility of V must be sacrificed.                     Professor Tait lias recognised                        this
in the 3rd edition of his Quaternions, where he freely separates the
V    from the symbol or symbols                    it    affects      ;    and, according to       a     well-
known custom, indicates the connection between                                      the operator           and
the symbols          affected       by attaching the same suffix to both.                              This I
had already done               in   a   paper      to be referred             to immediately.              We
seem         then to be led by           a    natural process to the following                          state
ment      :  —
     The operator       V      and its operand           on-    operand/, may have any relative
positions in a term whicli are convenient, the connection                                 between        them
being indicated in the usual way                     by       suffixes.
     For the propriety of this view,                 I          now wish to contend,              although
at       the time of writing            the 3rd         ed.     of Quaternions Professor Tait
was not prepared to endorse                   it   in full.           Notwithstanding             that   it   is
immaterial how great, in                 a   term, be the separation                 of   a   V   from the
symbol affected,          so   long     as   the   V     is     on the left of the symbol, he*
emphatically —observe                   his italics — lays down the law, that the                             V
must not be removed to the right of the symbol, even the immediate
     *
    With regard to the use of v Professor Tait (Quaternions, 3rd ed., 149)                             §
says — "The precautions necessary in such matters are twofold — (a) The
         :
operator must never be plated after the operand; (b) its commutative                                   or non-
commutative character must be carefully kept in vieic."

right.         Is it not akin               to inconsistency                   to say         in     effect   — " It       is
justifiable         to     violate, for convenience,                          the custom             of 'writing        an
operator to the immediate left of the symbol affected, and to indi
cate the connection                    by some other method, but the justification
only covers           a    limited violation of the custom.                               It    matters not that
the new            method of indication will equally well serve whatever                                                be
the       relative positions in                  a term        of the operator and the                          symbol
affected      — we will strictly                     adhere     to        one       part of          the restriction
hitherto           imposed         upon this relativity                    of position, though freeins
ourselves          from the other."
     It   may be — has been — urged that to place a                                   V       to the right nf the
symbol affected is                    as   criminally          ridiculous            as    to       write     X-^-      for
                                                                                                                dx

~         ¦   It   may be equally well urged that the removal                                       of V     to the left
dx
from its           primitive          position is on            a par           with writing                    XY      for

     It   must be conceded                  that both of these violations of custom                                     are
objectionable, and cannot be                              justified,           unless         some         convenience
accrues greater                than the counterbalancing inconvenience of having
to show by some method,                          other than that of juxtaposition,                             the con
nection between                  the operator and the symbol affected.                                        Whether
such convenience                 does exist must               be left         undecided            till   we come to
the       applications.              What        I    want     to         point out here               is,    that    it   is
extremely           inconvenient, and there                    is   absolutely no ground whatever
for not utilising this new method of indication                                           in all     cases where           it

Now, what             possible          objection          can        there     be     to   writing this last

On the left of this equation                       the     V   , as   indicated by the suffixes, refers
to the symbol immediately                          preceding           it       On the right it refers to
both the symbol immediately preceding and also to that immediately
following.           Certainly the expression on the right can                                    be    written

above may be treated.                        He shows how                   we may prove properties of
the vector, and even suggests                          a   method          of writing down the vector.
Adopting that             suggestion,               we     should           have,      instead         of equation

  One advantage                  of this notation                   is,   that the Vj's,              V   2's,    &c,         as
well   as   the   o-j's,      o-2's,   &c,     can be treated as mere vectors."
  It   is   this last statement which points to the most powerful argu
ment    for not restricting the position of the V's in                                               a   term in any
way.        Let them have all the freedom of vectors, and they                                                  will   obey
all the laws thereof.                   As   soon as we allow this freedom,                               but not till
then, can we draw upon the large storehouse                                          of already accumulated
knowledge of vectors,                  f
  It   will     be observed            that in the above definitions there                                 is    no abso
lute need for introducing the symbol A.                                         It   is,   however, as in many
cases of duplicate notation, extremely convenient.                                                   Its differentia
tions refer to all the symbols in the term in which                                             it   occurs.           Thus,
for instance,       the above equation (1) can be written

which still more clearly shows the connection between                                                       the stress
V2)( )@ and the resulting force per unit volume V2)                                                   A   (5.

integration can be thrown into                           a    rather more general form.                  J        If    <f>   be

This twofold             meaning for       a    leads to no confusion, and is convenient,
as   all the formulae which are true of one a are true of the other
also.       To     a    may be attached a system of suffixes for the same objects
and with the same meanings,                          as   in   the case of             V.
     It   is convenient, though not absolutely necessary, to introduce one
other symbol.                 Suppose      Q(a,/J) is           a     function of two vectors, linear
in   each.         Then we have
                              Q(Vi,p,)      =
                                                Q(mHQ0'J)                     +   Q(*.*),
so that          V j and      pj may be interchanged.                         This particular               use of     V
is so frequent that                 it is advisable             to use a symbol which                        will    call
attention to the symmetry.                       I    therefore define                 £   by the equation
                                        Q(V1,p1) = Q(£v,f1)-
Similarly,         if    Q(a,jS,y,S)    be a function of four vectors,                             a,/3,y,S, linear
in each, we may put
                                Q(    v i.Pp    ^2^2) =Q(£i>fi>£»£s)>
and so to any number of pairs of                               £'s.      Of       course      if   there     be only
one pair the suffix may be dropped entirely.
     I    now state       a   number of theorems in pure mathematics which will
be useful, for brevity leaving them unproved.
     If    <f>   be any linear vector function of                         a    vector, and          <f>'   be its con

     If    Q(a,/J)       be any quaternion function                           of two vectors,               o and      /?,
which       is    linear in each,

I         now proceed            to   a     few examples                    of the        use,    in    the subject of
Elasticity,          of the symbols introduced.
     Assuming uniformity of temperature                                         throughout, let us investigate
the general           equations connected                            with the         state of an elastic body.
The two usual assumptions                                  will not         be made (1) that the strain                        is
small, and (2) that there  no molecular couple.     Let <fs be the
                                                      is
volume of an element in some standard state — say the initial state.
We    assume that the pot. en. of any finite volume of the body                                                    is   of the
form /ffwd<;, where w depends only on the state as to strain of the
body          at    the point.   (Notice that      not here assumed, as    it   is                                            I
believe        is   invariably done, that w depends only on the coordinates
of pure            strain at the point.                         It   may,       e.g., so far as we                 know        at
present,           involve       also the space-derivatives                               of     those       coordinates.
We        do, however,          assume that                 it   is   not   a    function of the state of the
body at        a     point that            is    at    a    finite distance from the point under
consideration.)
  Our first object will be to get, not the equations of motion, but
the equations connecting stress and strain.                                               As will       be seen, these
two problems are not necessarily identical.                                           The plan adopted                   is    to
assume the body to be strained in the most general                                                     manner.           Then
impose the most general small additional                                             strain, and use the prin
ciple that for any finite portion of the body

ordinary stress, producing no couple per unit volume, and the second
is    a couple-stress.               The    latter is quite independent                                       of       the pot.            en.

      We    may anticipate here by saying that this part of the stress                                                                      is

This gives           us a very simple            way of dealing with              the   external
couple when the strains are small.                        For in that      case we may put

so     that the mathematical problem is the same                       as    if  there were no

 force        § + £VV5JJ.          If   any     part of the given             data consist of
 surface tractions, we must add                   that the given surface            traction per
 unit surface           J, must be replaced            by   §, - JVUv5Jt,         where    Uv    is
 the       unit normal at the point.
       Returning        to the    consideration of equation (16), we                 see  that if
 the portion considered             be limited to the element           </s,  we obtain

        Before     proceeding further, we must consider the strain a little
  more        closely.     Let x      ^e   Professor       Tait's   (Quaternions,        3rd ed.,

  The physical            meaning of x may be thus explained.                      Let to be the
  vector coordinate before strain of any point P, very near to another
  point        0, relatively to the       latter; then        x«> is the coordinate of the

Thus the only infinitesimal                            appearing in              Sip is        ty.        It       follows that

This                              of an elastic body (solid or fluid)
           is the equation of equilibrium
subjected to an external force and couple per unit volume of the
unstrained           body 8 and 9JJ                     respectively.                     For the              corresponding
equation           of motion we                  have       to     equate the left member                                of this
equation to Dp', where D is the density of the body at the point
in    the standard state.
      In the        case      considered by                    Thomson                  and         Tait (Nat. Phil.,
App.        C), both 3 and 9R                    are zero, and our equation takes the very
simple form

      In connection with equations (41) and (42), it should                                                        be observed

where         t   has the same meaning as                        in equation (38).
      The next few applications will be of an extremely simple nature,
and        will   be confined to work already well known                                                  in its       Cartesian
form.
      We now assume,                as     is usual,        that the strains are small, and that
there is no external couple,                           and therefore no stress couple.                                         We
deduce our equations as particular                                  cases of the above,                             though, of
course,       if the   present           were         our sole object, we could adopt a much
simpler           process.         We       may       put      q=l,           <}>   =   <j>   =   73,          =       + x>    and

                                    V^a?P^

                                                       W=                                                                     (45).

According          to him, the properties of the medium                   depend on six
independent constants            for each point, called the coefficients            of spec,

And,     further,        if    <f>   be       self-conjugate,                both these forces               will       be
explained by         a   stress       <£,    as can be seen               by the above work on stress.
For proof      we have by equation                           (3) above

where of course               the element ds                  is   taken twice, namely, once for the
region on each side.                  But

where the element ds                 is     now only taken once.                          Equating coefficients
of the arbitrary vector                     877   we get the required equations.
    To avoid difficulty at surfaces of discontinuity,                                         8   when applied to
a   function of the position of                        a    point must be thus defined.                      Suppose
that by means of the displacement                               877, any     point      is   moved from      P    to   P.
Then     Q   being the value of any function at                               P    before the displacement,
Q   +   8Q   will    be the value at                    P'    after     the displacement                 8Q   is   thus
in all cases        a    small quantity                     of the same order as                  877.      With    this

In Professor    J. J. Thomson's consideration of this subject (Applica

only assumes K to be a mere scalar both before and after strain, but
he   also does   not consider the most general           case of strain which
involves   6 instead   of 3  independent coefficients.        If  this last restric

to what seemed a novel property of iron wire under the combined
influence of circular and longitudinal              magnetisations.      Similar     ex
periments were subsequently tried with nickel, and similar                     results
obtained.      It  appeared, however, that in some respects nickel behaved
oppositely to iron.         The first series of observations brought out the
fact that a current along the nickel              wire seemed to assist the          ac
quiring,     under a longitudinal            magnetising     force,   of  a polarity
oppositely directed to the direction of the current.
    Unfortunately        the necessity     of stopping work during           the hot
summer      months postponed         the discovery that much        if not all of   the
supposed     curious effect in iron and nickel was due to the existence
of   a twist in the wire.        It should    be mentioned that the wires were
set up with great care, being first annealed,            then brazed     to terminal
pieces, then annealed a second time under horizontal tension sufficient
to keep them straight in a direction             perpendicular to the magnetic
meridian.       To   one of the terminals two copper            wires, laid parallel
to and on each side of the nickel or iron wire, were                  soldered  ; and
the set of three wires was placed              in position in suitably      arranged
grooves cut along the plane surface of a semi-cylinder of wood.                    The
 other half of the cylinder was then superposed                  so as to keep the
 wires firmly in position          ;  and   the whole arrangement was lifted
 from     the place    where the final annealing had been accomplished
 and inserted into its position         in the heart of the magnetising coil.
 Exactly when the wire got twisted it is impossible to say.                  It must
 have been a small twist ; but that it did acquire a permanent twist
 is sufficiently proved by later experiments            in the months of     October
 and November 1890.
     In  these   later experiments a slightly different arrangement                was
 adopted.      The     wire   to   be treated,     after careful     annealing,    was

slipped through a glass tube a little longer than the internal metal
wall of       the tube on which       the well-insulated      magnetising coil was
coiled.        This metal wall was      used as the return channel for the cur
rent, so that all possibility of an appreciable direct electro-magnetic
effect of the circuit upon the magnetometer was quite excluded.
The end of the iron or nickle wire             nearer to the magnetometer           was
gripped vice-wise by          a cleft metal plug of conical shape, which, when
pushed into the end of the magnetising coil, established good pressure
contacts between           the  end   of the wire and the         metal   wall.     The
other end of the wire projected backwards out of the magnetis
ing      coil    sufficiently to enable     it to    be   clamped     to   a   twisting
gear.      From this       end, and from the neighbouring          end of the      tube
 wall, wires well insulated and well twisted together were led to the
 commutator connected with the battery.
     It   was only after a series         of experiments, in which           the  effect
 mentioned in my earlier note was observed to take place sometimes
 in one way and sometimes in the other, that              I  came to the conclusion
 that there must be an original permanent twist in the wire.                     Thick
 wires showed comparatively              small effects,    steel  wire showed        the
 effect   oidy when it was drawn thin, and so on. Nickel wires be
 haved in an especially confusing manner, even after the greatest
 care was taken to insert them untwisted               into the magnetising coil.
  The twisting gear mentioned above was added                  to the apparatus so
  as  to make a direct experiment upon the effect of             a small voluntarily
 applied twist.          That large twists might reasonably          be   expected     to
  produce      peculiar disturbances in the magnetic distribution             under the
  combined influence of longitudinal            and circular magnetisations will
  be   at once admitted when it is remembered             to what an extent twist
  ing atfects the result of either taken alone.                I was   not prepared,
  however, for the pronounced influence exerted by even a small twL<t
  previously existing in the wire upon subsequently applied longi
  tudinal and circular magnetisations.
      To prevent the possibility of such twists being inadvertently
  applied, the wire was, in the later experiments, annealed with a
   weight hanging free at the one end.            This left   the wire permanently
   magnetised      under the influence of the earth's vertical field           ; but in
   the stronger cyclic field to which         it became subjected       the wire soon
   lost  all   trace   of this original polarity.       After being annealed         the

ends carefully clamped after the manner already indicated.                                            In    the

     Here, the only apparent effect of passing                         a    current along the          wire
is   to decrease the range of intensity due to                         a    given cyclic variation
of field.       The susceptibility                is   markedly diminished, and the                    more
so as the current            is   taken stronger.             There    is   not the least       evidence
of an accumulated polarity changing sign with the current,                                        as       de

back to its first stage of positive twist, there is            a  bint at a     change        in
the law of the acquired polarity.               It  is obvious, however, that              this
is simply the result of torsional after-effect.              The wire,      in    fact,     has
become      elastically   untwisted,        although    it  has    not become          so as
regards    the relative positious of its end-sections.                  On    continuing
the untwisting      past    the original       zero, we find that       it is  some time
before a pronounced effect is produced.                 Even for     the   twist     — S7'"5
the difference in the average               polarities for the two directions                  of

force,   the current along a wire is reversed                 at different       stages        of
untwisting.
   There is one particular,             however, in which          the results of           the
present     experiments differ from what might                   be expected          if    the
accumulation of polarity was simply due to the magnetic                            effect of
the current along the twisted wire.
   First, it should     be noted that the twist          in a wire subjected             only
to the magnetising influence of a longitudinal                field varied cyclically
has    no determinate effect             in causing     a change       in the       average
polarity.      "Whatever     be the polarity       produced by a current            passing
along the twisted         wire, we might naturally             expect     a cyclic field
superposed      thereon    to    give rise to        a  symmetrical        variation          of
magnetic intensity        about this acquired polarity as a mean.                       Con
sequently the difference           of the average polarities for positive                 and
negative     currents should be equal to the range of polarity when                         the
current is reversed        in the twisted wire.            As  a fact, however,          it    is
much greater.        For   instance,      in the  case given above for twist            + 25'
the  range     of polarity produced by reversing              the    current, the        field
being zero, was only            25 ; whereas       the  difference of polarities             as
given in the table is 42.               Similarly, for twist        + 37'-5,    the range
was    49,   as  compared       with the difference        82 '5; for the         (second)
twist 12'-5 the range was zero;              and for twist    - 37'-5     the range       was
6, as compared      with the      difference     15-5.
   The same peculiarity is shown to a more pronounced extent                                 in
nickel wire, of which         I  give here only one experiment.               In   spite of
the greatest care in setting up the nickel wire, a change                     of   average

polarity             was        in this         case obtained at the first putting on of the
current.                 The necessary               fingering of the wire when clamping its
ends        seemed              to give         a   slight twist, sufficient, however, to produce
the        effect spoken of.                        "We may suppose             the existence            of the effect

average polarities associated                                 with positive and negative currents is

 satisfied, however, that                           (in nickel wire             at any rate) there              does not
 exist      a    measurable              difference of polarities duo to the current only.
 The great difficulty                     is    to be sure that no twist                       exists in the wire           ;
 for       it        quite evident that                       very small twist                sufficient to produce
                                                                                      is is

a     very large average polarity, when the wire                                           subjected to         a   steady
 circularly magnetising force in conjunction                                             with   a    cyclically vary
 ing longitudinal                      field.        If   the effect      is   due only to the twist in the
 wire, we have here an                          extremely sensitive process for demonstrating
 the       existence of            a    twist, especially in nickel wire.
       The whole subject calls for more detailed discussion                                              ;   and I         am
 impelled to communicate these earlier results chiefly with the desire
  of   correcting any false impressions that my preliminary note of last

accurate ; but we see now that the more                    curious of them are          com
 paratively easily explained             as  being due to an initial twist in              the
 wire of    a few minutes per unit length.               This   is true not only of the
 average polarity acquired, but also of the asymmetrical form of the
 curve    with   reference      to the line of zero field.         For,    as may be seen
by   a  study of      E wing's     curves   {e.g.,  Phil. Traits.,      plate  lx. fig.    17,
 188")), such an asymmetry exists                 in  a cyclic curve taken about             a
mean value of field other than zero.                    Now    here     we have     a finite
mean value of longitudinal              intensity supported by the current along
the wire.        If, in    the curves shown in the preliminary note, we shift
the upper narrow graph to the right and                   the lower one to the left
so  that their mean points have               abscissae    equal     to the longitudinal
fields    corresponding to their ordinates regarded                    as intensities, we
shall   see at once a        sufficient reason for their asymmetrical form.
    All that     can be safely said regarding the effect of a current along
an iron or nickel            wire, upon the susceptibility             of the same       to a
longitudinal        field, is that the susceptibility        is markedly diminished,
and    that the residua!          magnetism* falls off more quickly than                  the
total reduced         magnetism.        In other     words, a current along a wire
diminishes        the     hysteresis (to use Ewing's word) relatively to a
cyclically varying longitudinal field.                The former conclusion agrees
with     the   result obtained by           Schultze (Wied.        Ann., xxiv.,       1 885)
in his experiments             on   the   reciprocal action       of   mutually    perpen
dicular magnetisms.              He experimented with            iron and steel      tubes,
and    the circular magnetisation was induced by currents altogether
outside the iron.            He does not seem to have discussed the properties
of cyclic magnetic graphs, or even the ratio of the residual                         to the
total induced longitudinal              magnetism,      with or without the circular
magnetism.           It  is therefore     impossible at present           to say whether
the diminished          hysteresis     here   noted    is due to the magnetic         effect
of the current in the wire,              or, as   is perhaps     more probable,      to the
direct vibratory action of the current upon the molecules,                         thereby
accelerating      the breaking up of unstable molecular groupings.

they were heated in the water-bath until they ceased to lose                       weight.
It  was    necessary,    therefore,     to determine their weights, and they
have    accordingly been tabulated, and will give roughly an                        idea of
the difference      between     a  wet mud and        a  dry one.

    Near the African             coast    the amount of CO., varies hetween                       8   and
 10   per cent.          It   increases      with distance from the land, being no
doubt less masked by land debris.                          The maximum 20-97                    of C02
(47'17       CaC'O.j)     is found        on the      Balearic Bank.            The depth here
was     only "82       fathoms,       and the land drainage            is insignificant.

also added, and the flask fitted                 with    a cork pierced by a tube with
an india-rubber valve.             It  was       then heated       on the water-bath              for
half-an-hour, filled        up with boiling               distilled    water, corked,           and
allowed to cool.          50 c.c. were taken for analysis, and                   titrated       first
with potassium         permanganate            of K^fn04        grammes       per litre     ;   and

this way is in the ferrous state                  ;  while from column m the total
amount of iron, expressed                as Fe2Os, extracted           in this way is only
from 40 to 50 per cent,                 of the amount extracted by prolonged

    With    reference      to the observations      in  the lochs of the   Cljde     sea-
area, they were made during a series of trips at different seasons of
the year, and the           results of each trip are placed         in chronological
sequence as far as the geographical arrangements                 adopted permit.
    The arrangement          adopted for presenting these data is that of             the
natural districts into which the physical conformation divides                        the
region under investigation.               The districts are — (1) the Eztuary,
extending       from     I.owling     to    Greenock ; (2) the Gareloch ; (3)
Dunoon Basin,           which runs       as  a trough of      about 40 fathoms          in
depth from the Dog Rock                 at the mouth        of Loch Goil, through
lower Loch Long, past Dunoon, and terminates a little to the north
of the Cumbraes          ;   (4) Loch Long, above the junction with Lxh
Goil j (5) Loch Goil; (6) Holy Loch ; (7) Kyles of Bute, including
under this name the: shallow water between Ascog and Toward, as
well   as the Kyles proper, and Loch Ridun; (8) Loch Sfrivan; (9)
Arran Basin, which includes the Firth of Clyde, from the south
end of Arran          to the Cumbraes,         Inchmarnoch       Water,   Kilbrennan
 Sound    as far    south    as  Davaar Island, and lower Loch Fyne up                  to
within    one mile of Otter Ferry ; (10) Loch Fyne, above Otter;                    (11)
 the Plateau, extending           from Davaar Island          and the Mull of Can-
 tyre across the south end of Arran and Ailsa Craig to the Ayrshire
 coast; and (12) the Channel beyond this plateau.
    The observations are arranged under each of the twelve natural
 districts,   as  far  as possible     in regular    succession   for each trip,   from
 one end of the district to the other.                As  a ride, observations were
 made always         in  the same position during each trip, and it has been
 considered     sufficient to designate these positions briefly in the          record
 of temperature.           The following       statement    will  serve  to fix them
 with precision : —

N.B. — All the       bearings given above, and the direction of wind in
             all the observations, are magnetic.
    The observations in the lochs to the north of the Clyde sea-area
are for the most part limited to the spring and summer months, but
are   very    interesting    for  the    purposes   of comparison,     as well   as
valuable in themselves.
    Many of the observations recorded             in the following Tables were
taken with the special object of detecting the effect of winds on              the
distribution      of temperature     in the    waters   of the   lochs.   It  was

1S90—  91.]   Dr John Murray          on the Temperature          of Lochs.          143
found that when the wind           was off-shore,    or down from the heads of
the lochs, cold water was           Drought    to the surface in summer              ;   in
winter, on the other hand, warm water                was brought to the surface
from the deeper portions of the lochs.              It will     be seen that when
the sea-lochs have      a depth of 80 or 100 fathoms, the warmest water
is found at the bottom in the months of December and January,
 and the coldest water in June and           July.

 in  progress,   and will shortly be presented           to this Society by             Dr
 H. R. Mill.
    The    observations were for the most part taken by myself and
 Captain Alexander Turbyne of the             " Medusa," occasionally           assisted
  by gentlemen      who have taken part in the work of the Scottish
  Marine    Station.    The   results were copied          from     tho    observation
 books and prepared for press by Dr            Mill and Mr James Chumley.

On Silica and the Siliceous Remains of Organisms in
         Modern Seas.              By John Murray,                LL.D., Ph.D., &c,
         and Robert Irvine, F.C.S,
                                 (Read March 16, 1891.)
      In  a former paper to this Society, we pointed out the important
 role played by carbonic acid in modern                 seas,  with special reference
 to the vast     deposits   of carbonate      of lime now taking place in coral
 reefs and those other calcareous deposits known                    as  Globigerina and
 Pteropod      Oozes.     It   was    pointed out that carbonic acid was the
 chief     agent   in the disintegration of         felspars    and other silicates of
 the earth's surface, that it was concerned                  in all the changes       that
  result in the secretion of carbonate               of lime by marine organisms
  from any of the lime salts in sea-water, that                  a vast  amount of car
  bonic acid was being locked up in the calcareous                     deposits now in
  process of formation on the sea-bed, and that                  there was an accumu
  lation of these       calcareous     deposits chiefly towards the equatorial
  regions of the      ocean    basins.      In the    present     paper we propose      to
  deal   with  the great    antagonistic power to carbonic acid, viz., silica,
  and    with the siliceous organic        remains    in  the ocean.
      Silica, or silicic acid, is an oxide of silicon, indeed the only oxide
  of that element        known to exist, and resembles in many of its pro
  perties    the oxide of carbon           (carbonic      acid); it    is probably     the
  widely distributed         body in      the surface      and    subsurface   layers of
  the earth's crust.        When the earth's surface was at            a  high tempera
  ture, probably all the silica was in combination with lime, magnesia,
  iron, alumina, and alkalies — forming the great scries of silicates.
  At   a  high temperature       silica has    a great    affinity for bases, but at     a
  low temperature it is in most cases replaced by carbonic acid from
  its compounds.         It  thus happens        that from early geological         times
  carbonic    acid has been extracted from the atmosphere,                   and  locked
   up  in the solid crust of the earth.           If  this process goes on without
   limitation life will ultimately become             impossible on the earth's sur
   face.   From volcanoes and         fissures carbonic acid is given off, owing,
   apparently,    to the silica again      taking the place of the carbonic acid
  in the heated rocks below.             In all   the   ordinary disintegrating pro-

  cesses   at work at the earth's         surface,   the carbonic acid replaces             the
 silica from its bases, the silica being thus set free to form quartz,                        or
 a  hydrated variety of silica like opal, for example.
      Although      there    are enormous      numbers of organisms in the               ocean
 that secrete silica to form their frustules, shells, or skeletons,                         the
 remains      of these siliceous organisms do not play nearly so large                         a
 part in the formation of the deposits of modern                     seas as   the   remain-*
 of carbonate         of lime organisms dealt with in our former                       paper.
 For our       present     purpose    the siliceous       organisms      of modem          seas
 may     be divided       into the Sponges,         which     live   on the     bottom,       or
 belong to the Benthos,* and the Diatoms and Eadiolarians,                              which
 have      a   pelagic     habitat, or belong to the              Plankton.*         The      si
 liceous     sponges     belonging to the Tetractinellida,              Monaxonida,        and
 Hexactinellida,         are   universally     distributed      over the      floor of      the
 ocean, the Hexactinellida           being limited to the deep         sea, i.e., to depths
greater      than 100 fathoms.           Although universally distributed                 over
the ocean's floor, the spicules of sponges rarely make up over                         1  or   2
 per cent, of a deep-sea deposit, except               in those limited        areas where
there are extensive patches of these sponges growing on the bottom,
 when the spicules in some samples of                  a  deposit may rise       as  high     as
 20    per    cent.     At Kerguelen, in         120     fathoms,     over one hundred
specimens        of RosspUo, antarciica were obtained in one haul of                        the
trawl    ;   at Zebu,      Philippines,     a large      number of EupUettlla and
other sponges were obtained in 100 fathoms                       ;  off the    Ki   Islands,
in 129 fathoms,           there were     eighteen    species     of Hexactinellida         and
a large       number of individuals          ;   in   the    Atlantic, near the          Cape
Verdes, there was procured in 1525                     fathoms     a large    specimen        of
Poliopogon         amadou (2 x 1J feet) attached to the branches of an
Alcyonarian coral (PI eurocor allium johnsoni) ; off the Kermadecs,
in 630 fathoms, there was another Poliopogon (Poliopoijon                             t/"ja-<),
measuring         2 x  3J   feet,  and this was        but   a  fragment of what           was
apparently         an   enormous       sponge.      In    the    Faroe    Channel        large
numbers       of specimens of Pheronema (Holtenia) were dredged from a
depth of 530 fathoms, while trawlings near the same spot did

       Benthos (0ty$os, bottom of the sea) is a term introduced by Haeckel for
all those organisms living on or creeping over the bottom of the sea, in contra
distinction to Plankton, which, as extended by him, includes all those organ
isms swimming about in the sea or carried along in ocean currents [Planktov
Studieii, Jena, 1890).

not yield any        specimens.        Many       other examples       might be given
to show that the sponges are clustered in patches over the Led of the
ocean,   with intervening more or less barren spaces.                   On the whole,
siliceous sponges are most abundant in moderate                         depths on the
Blue Muds      along continental       shores and       in pelagic deposits, and are
more numerous on Diatom and Radiolarian                       Oozes    than on (Jlobi-
gerina and Pteropod Oozes. The spicules of sponges frequently show
signs of undergoing solution, in the widening of the axial canals,
and    the  disappearance       or thinning       of the more delicate processes.
The spicules contain from            6   to   7   per cent,     of water,    or in some
cases as much as 13 per cent.,* associated with organic matter,!                      and
belong to the variety of silica known              as opal.
    When     we turn to the Diatoms              and    Radiolarians,     we find that
they are universally        distributed        throughout      the   surface   and   sub
surface    waters,    indeed, the      tow-net       experiments       carried out on
board the " Challenger

                                appear to prove that some species of Radio
larians live throughout all the intermediate depths of the ocean.
    Diatoms    are abundant       in all      estuaries   and    wherever there is       a
low salinity from the admixture of river water, but they are found,
although     more    sparingly, in the very saltest             waters    of the ocean.
 In the    waters   of the great Southern            Ocean     and Antarctic      regions
 they occur in enormous quantities on the surface, filling the tow-nets
 with a slimy, yellow-brown mass.                This slimy     mass of siliceous alga?
 consisted chiefly of lihizonnhmia,              Clm forei'of,    and   Tlialassiothrix,

  tropical and subtropical regions                the "Challenger"            Expedition          also
  collected     great   numbers of Diatoms at the surface, especially where
  there    was    brackish water,           or, at least,      water of      a    relatively low
  salinity.      In the true         oceanic      waters     of the tropical regions               the
  number of species of Diatoms is probably                        as   numerous        as  in  polar
 waters, but the individuals               are  not nearly so abundant.              In  a  Diatom
  ooze   from lat. 54° S., 48 species of Diatoms were observed                               in    the
 deposit,     while in      a  tropical Radiolarian           ooze,   lat. 6"   X.,     51 species
 were recognised        ;   of these 14 species are common to the two stations.
 In   the former case the Diatom                  remains make up over 50 per                   cent,
 of the whole deposit,             in   the latter not more           than   2    or  3  per    cent.
 Some      large   species      of tropical Etmodiscus (Coseinodiscu*)                    have an
 extremely thin shell of silica, and indeed, all the Diatom frustules
 of species that live in truly pelagic waters of the tropical and sub
 tropical regions         are exceedingly thin             and delicate        compared         with
 those    in colder       and    coast     waters.       When Diatoms cannot                be ob
 served directly in the tow-net gatherings, they can almost always                                  be
found in the stomachs of Salpce, DolioJum, and other marine animals.
 The specimens          of Diatoms          met with      in  the open      sea    all belong       to
 pelagic species, but         it is not uncommon to meet               with    attached       forms
fixed to the backs of Copepods and other Crustacea,                              as well as on
pelagic Molluscs.            These siliceous pelagic Algse or Diatoms, together
with other Alg;e, some of which secrete carbonate                            of lime — Cocco-
spheres      and    Ehabdospheres — appear                to   live only      iii  those      upper
layers of oceanic         waters     that are affected by sunlight, and they                      are
the original source of the food of the vast majority of animals living
at the surface        and on the bottom of the                  sea,  for on falling to          the
bottom the Diatoms still retain                    a portion of their organic matter,
and thus supply with nourishment those animals, like Echinoderms
and    Annelids,      which live at the bottom by eating the mud or                             ooze
there in process of accumulation.
    The Radiolarians, unlike the Diatoms, are rarely met with in                                 any
numbers in estuaries or near the mouths of rivers, their true habitat
being in the open ocean               ;   they belong to oceanic           as distinguished

although numerous, they                   are not apparently so abundant as                             in   the
less          salt waters    of the Pacific, Indian, Southern, or Polar Oceans.
The tow-net experiments of                    the   "Challenger" Expedition showed                           that
those Radiolarians                which secrete the          heaviest shells and skeletons,
as       well    as the    whole legion of Phseodaria,                  were captured in greatest
numbers when                the nets were dragged            a   considerable distance beneath
the surface, so that it is probable that many species live in the inter
mediate           waters     of the     ocean       where the temperature                   is as low as
50" or 40° F.               Some species of Diatoms and Radiolarians                                  are often
met with in such great numbers that they form vast floating banks,
fields, or zones, between which are lanes of water comparatively free
from these organisms.                    We    have     referred        to the banks            of Diatoms
in the Arctic and Antarctic                         Oceans       and in the       Arafura             Sea.    In
1880, in the Faroe Channel, the tow-nets were                                     tilled with Radio
larians,          belonging       to    the     genera:          Acauthumi I ra,            Xijilmeantha,

Sjiongodincus, and ThalaxxosplHrra — for weeks                                   together         ;   but two
years later,         in   the   same month, only a few of these organisms were
captured, the surface                  waters being then chiefly occupied by vast
numbers of Doliolum.
         If   we now turn to the remains of Diatoms and lladiolarians                                    found
in the marine deposits at the bottom of the ocean, we find that they
are almost universally                  distributed.         Radiolarian          remains were ob
served          in considerable abundance in                       more        than two-thirds,              and
Diatoms in like abundance in more than one-half, of the samples of

nearly every specimen                  of pelagic and terrigenous deposits.                            In    the
deep-sea deposits            of   the Atlantic,       Radiolarians, Diatoms, and Sponge
spicules, make up, on an average, about                            \\   per cent.,         in   the    Pacific

about    1G per cent.,              of the deposits.           In    some special     regions,   how
ever, they play a much more important part in the formation of dee{>-
sea    deposits.          There would appear                  to be a wide band or zone               of
Diatom Ooze surrounding                       the South        Pole, between the latitude             of
40° S. and the                Antarctic      Circle, covering about 10,880,000 square
miles of the sea-bottom, in which the percentage of siliceous organisms
is,   on the average, about 50 per cent, of the whole deposit.
      Again, in the central parts of the Pacific and Indian Oceans there
are large         areas       of Kadiolarian        Ooze      in   the greatest depths,      covering
in all about 2,290,000 square miles of the earth's                                surface,   in which
the remains of siliceous organisms                         are estimated         to make up     nearly
60 per cent, of the whole deposit.                       In   some Globigerina and           Pteropmi
Oozes, as well as              in   some Eed         Clays and Blue Muds, there are in
certain regions very few,                   if   any, traces of these pelagic          Diatoms and
Padiolaria.             It    is   somewhat difficult              to account     for their absence,
for they are captured in the surface waters of these areas, although
not in such great abundance                        as   in the surface      waters     over regions
where they make up                   a   large part of the deposit at the sea-bottom.
In     some instances               they appear to have been removed in solution,
as    will       be pointed out later on;                in others their          presence      may be
masked            by    the    relatively        much more rapid accumulation of cal
careous remains,               of triturated pumice, or of land debris.
      In our previous              paper,    when discussing the secretion of carbonate
of lime by marine organisms,                      we found    it    impossible to accept the view
that the lime was absorbed                       and secreted directly          as carbonate,    owing
to the small amount of carbonate                         of lime in solution in sea-water             —
one part in 8000 — and                      the enormous quantity of water that would
consequently require to pass into the life circulation                                 to permit      its
secretion          were       this the only source.                 We were able to show, we
think successfully, that organisms may obtain their carbonate of lime
from any of the lime salts in sea-water, by means of the changes
produced by their effete or waste products on the constitution of the
lime salts in solution, the whole of the lime present                                  being in this
way available for the formation                           of carbonate          of lime shells.        A
similar difficulty with reference                       to the source of the silica             is   pre
sented in the case of the silica-secreting organisms,                              for to obtain the

pass an enormous quantity of                              sea-water          through their bodies.                             No
interpretation like that adopted for the carbonate of lime organisms
is possible here, for silica is present in solution in sea-water only in
one condition, and our own and the analyses of different authorities
give only the               merest traces of soluble silica in sea-water.

      The determinations made -by us at the Scottish Marine Station
with carefully-filtered waters from different parts of the ocean led to
similar results.           The amount of soluble .silica was              so   minute that   it
was difficult        to believe       it    to be the exclusive source              from which
Diatoms and Radiolarians                   procured the silica for their frustules and
skeletons,      the results showing only one part of soluble silica present
in from 200,000 to 500,000 parts of sea-water.
      In all    attempts        to determine the silicic acid, we filtered the sea-
water through several                folds of ashless      filter-paper, or we added to
it,   in the cold,        a     solution of pure albumen, thereafter                 raising the
liquid to      a   temperature       of 212° F.,       so that the coagulated           albumen
which collected            as   a   scum     on the top of the         boiling fluid carried
with      it   any mechanically            suspended    matter present             in the water.
Even the ash from the apparently ashless filter may give rise to                                    a
profound error in the result, and in these determinations, in order
to secure          absolute accuracy,           platinum    vessels       should      be    used.   *
The accurate            determination         of silicic acid in sea-water            is   compli
cated       by another difficulty.               This   arises     from    the      presence     of
fluorides,      which in the ordinary methods for determining silicic acid
would tend to form volatile fluoride of silicon, thus vitiating                                 the
results of the analyses.               The results      referred      to above, showing the
quantity of silicic acid in sea-water to amount to not more than one
part in 200,000            to   500,000, were obtained           by   evaporating     a    weighed
quantity of carefully-filtered sea-water to dryness with hydrochloric
acid.        The dried salts were drenched with hydrochloric                           acid and
again       heated      to dryness,        the insoluble   residue      left being taken as
silicic acid.        It   is   evident that in the presence of fluorides,             if   in suffi
cient amount, the whole of the silicic acid would be driven off, and
pass away during the evaporation and subsequent                        drying and ignition,      t
      *
          The balance     used by us was not very delicate         ;   the results can only be
relied on to the third place of decimals.
 t    Exp. (A). To determine this point we added silicic acid in soluble form to
                                                                               a                    a
litre of artificial sea-water (which water waa practically free from silicic acid),

     Even       when    any loss of silicic acid which may occur from                 this
source of error is taken into account, the amount of soluble silica
in sea-water is too small to be quite certain that it is sufficient to
supply all        that is required by silica-secreting organisms.
      Moreover, if       we accept the      fact that the sea receives the greater
part of its silicic acid from the waters carried down to it by rivers
in the form of soluble silicates, we should expect that such silicates
would be decomposed by the salts of magnesium so abundantly pre
 sent in sea-water, with the formation of silicate of magnesia.                      This
 substance        we know,      in  the  condition of steatite      or talc, is   so   in
 soluble, that no appreciable           amount is removed by solution in water,
 eveu in        presence of free carbonic acid.*         We have found, however,
 tile   amount     so added being 0"0342 grin., adding also 0 096 grin,    of fluoride id
 solium.        The whole was then evaporated to dryness with hydrochloric acid,
 and the residue dried and drenched with hydrochloric acid, and again dried.
  The silicic acid determined in the insoluble residue- showed that M)'4 per rent,
  of the whole silicic acid added had liecu thus recovered, only ll>-6 percent,
  lteinglost by the action of the fluoride. A similar expel inieut (V>) was conducted
  with the same amount of silicic acid ns in Experiment (A), hut O'lHjO gnu., or
  ten times the amount       of fluoride of sodium, was added to the same amount of
  artificial  sea-water.    This quantity gave a precipitate of fluoride of calcium
  with the lime salts of the sea-water, so that such an amount of fluorine could
  not I* present in natural sea-water.        The amount of .silicic acid recovered in
  this instance was 67 '5 per cent., the loss of silicic arid being ;i2*5 per cent.
  A third experiment (C) was made, in wdiich a large excess of fluoride of sodium
  was again added, and the evaporation and drenching with hydrochloric acid
  repeated six or seven times in succession.        It was then found that only 4 per
  cent, of the silicic acid added remained in the insoluble residue.       These results
  would seem to show that even if sea-water contained as much silicic acid as
   one part in 50,000, and also as much fluoride as it could hold in solution, at
   least two-thirds of the silicic acid present in sea-water would he found by the
   methods ordinarily in use for silicic acid determination.         Nothing like that
   quantity (1 in 50,000 parts) was ever found in our experiments.            The third
   experiment (C) shows that the silicic acid may be carried away ill a volatile
   condition, combined with fluorine, after repeated evaporations          with hydro
   chloric acid and ignitings, so that the amount of silicic acid we have found in
   carefully-filtered sea-water must be correct within the limits of at least '20 per
   cent (see Experiment A), thus making it according to these determinations
   less than one part in 250,000.

         Bischoff, Chemical and 1'liysical Gfulogy, vol. i. p. '.). Mr Alexander
   Johnstone,      F.G.S., has proved experimentally that pure water, even
   when saturated with carbonic acid, has no solvent action on pure tale
   or steatite, but that sea-water has a slight but distinct effect in this direc
   tion equal to 1 part in 200,000.          His results are also interesting as show
   ing that silicate of magnesium once formed cannot lie conveyed to any extent
   in a soluble condition by river water to the sea (Proc. Hoy. Hoc. Ediiu, vol.

    These precipitates consisted                          principally          of silicate of magnesia,
silicic acid, and traces of silicate of lime                          ;   so    that we are justified in
concluding that if alkaline silicates in proportion equal to                                          1   part of
silicic acid in 100,000 parts of water were present, the whole would
be removed in combination with magnesia and thrown out of solution.
For     the sake       of argument,               let us suppose that silicic acid did occur
to this extent         in   sea-water, thus representing 0*01 grm. per litre, even
this amount, taking                 it,   we shall say, as       a   saturated solution of the most
insoluble silicate known,                    is   very much less than the amount of silicic
acid        found by the analysts whose results represent                                  the maximum
amount of that body found in sea-water    (see Table         235).                           I.,       p.
These experiments were repeated with pure water, to which chloride
of magnesium              was added              together with pure silicate of soda.                           The
results showed               that amorphous or freshly-precipitated                                  silicate            of
magnesia was              less soluble in fresh than in sea water, thus leading
us to assume that             it     could not be carried to the                  sea as such         by river.-,
as also       that river water, rich in other magnesium                                  salts, can hardly
be supposed           to carry soluble silicates to the sea.
    A similar         series        of experiments were conducted with lime Kilts,
but the amorphous silicate of lime so formed was found, in com
parison with the silicate of magnesium, to be so soluble that                                                  it   did
not cause         any precipitate above                      1     part in 50,000            of water                    in
twenty-four hours.
    To vary these experiments,                        a    weak solution of silicate of soda
was exactly neutralised by means                            of hydrochloric acid            ;    an amount
representing          1     grm. of soluble or colloid silicic acid was added                                            to

 1   litre of sea-water, the one-half of which was kept at               a  temperature
of 40J and       the other at 80° Fahr.         Here apparently more silicic acid
 was retained in solution by the sea-water             than in the former experi
 ment with the alkaline silicate, and on determining                   the    amount of
silicic acid in       the filtered sea-water     after seventy-two hours, it was
 found that sea-water could hold up for that period CH34G grm. per
 litre,   the precipitate consisting principally        of silicic acid and silicate
 of    magnesia.       We think, however, that         as a   rule silicic acid must
 reach the ocean        in the form of silicates.*
      At this point it may         bo well    to refer to the      character     of river
 water in its relation to the amount of silicic             acid carried to the        sea.
 From the analyses of forty-eight river waters given by Bischoff,t we
find the average quantity of silicic acid present to amount to about 1
part in 100,000.           But   here the same source of error seems to have
crept in,     as is   the case witli the silicic acid determinations               in  sea-
water, a certain number of analysts showing                    a  maximum amount
equal to 4'8 parts in 100,000,           whilst others     show minimum            results
equivalent to 0'01 part in 100,000.               That this    source of error is due
to the presence of insoluble clay, is pretty well proved by the results
of certain of       the analyses.      For   instance,  in those of the waters of
the Maas, the amount of silica at Hocht is                  2 parts   in 100,000;        at
Pierrebleue,       l'Ot;    and at Arensdonck, 0-28         ;  clearly showing that
the water had deposited insoluble siliceous matter                     or clay in its
course to the        sea.   However     this may be, it is certainly curious to
note,    taking the minimum results of             these   forty-eight      analyses     as
representing the true amount of soluble silicic acid in river water,
that we find it equivalent to             1  part of that body          in   2-r>0,000   to
    *
        A solution of silicate of soda was neutralised with carbonic acid, ami an
amount of" this solution equal to 1 grm. of soluble or colloid silicic acid added
to 1 litre of sea-water.      A comparatively small precipitate resulted, and was
fonnd to consist of silicic acid and silicate of magnesia, with traces of lime.
The clear liquid nitrate from this precipitate remained lor a very long period
perfectly clear, and only deposited a slight additional precipitate after stand
ing more than fourteen days.        The silicic acid was determined in the filtrate,
and it was found that the amount of the precipitate corresponded with the
carbonate of magnesia or lime which occurred in the water.                Tims if soluble
silicic acid in any circumstances     be added to sea-water, we should expect only
that portion thrown out that would thus combine witli tin- alkaline constituents
of the sea-water, the amount of alkaline constituents being always enormously
in excess over that in which silicic acid could exist either in surface or bottom
water.                                   t Lot: cit., vol. i. pp. 76, 77.

       Kyle, in his analyses of the water supplied to the city of Buenos Ayres,
states that   "the river Hate is in reality the estuary of the rivers Parana ana
Uruguay.       It is characterised by its muddy appearance, and always contains
in suspension a considerable amount of coloured clay."                 In the analyses which
follow of the waters of the rivers Plate and Parana, this clay is represented as
alumina and silica. From this it is evident that the waters were not tiltered
before analysis.      On the other hand, looking at the analyses of the water of
the river Uruguay, the analyst characterises it
                                                          " .'is a very remarkable one, and
probably one of the purest river waters in the world, containing rather hss
than four parts of solid matter per 100,000.              Alumina is entirely absent, the
noteworthy      fact being that   about   46  per cent, of the total solid matter consists
of soluble silica not suspended as in the other two rivers.               A small proportion
exists probably as alkaline silicates, but the greater part is undoubtedly pre-seut
as hydrated silicic acid."       In these circumstances may be found an explanation
of the petrifying properties attributed to the water of the Uruguay {Chemical
News, vol. xxxviii. p. 28).
    The abnormal quantity of free silicic acid present in these waters may be
accounted for, either by the decomposition of felspar rocks by carbonic acid, or
by the action of azo-humic acids referred to by Julien ("On the Geological
Action of Humus Acids," Proc. American Ass., vol. xxviii. p. 325) on silica
itself.    But, granted all that has been advanced as to the carriage of silicic
acid as such in a soluble condition to the sen by rivers, as we have shown, when
such water mixes with the sea there can be no possible accumulation of soluble
silica over that of one part in from 50,000 to 100,000 parts of water.
Julien, we think wrongly, urges that the humus acids may have the same
action in sea-water that they have upon silica on land in the presence of fresh
water ; that a vast proportion of humus acids reaches the sea is undoubtedly the
case, but immediately on mixing with salt-water the humus acid is thrown
down either in combination with lime, magnesia, or alumina.

     To  ascertain the amount of clayey matter in suspension in the open
sea    far from land, we procured large samples from the surface of the
Atlantic,       the Indian Ocean, Red Sea, the Mediterranean, the German
Ocean,      the Baltic Sea, and the         Firth of Forth.*          These waters were
preserved in stoneware             jars thoroughly cleaned          and      filled witli the
utmost care, so that no siliceous matter might be accidentally intro
duced.         About    14  litres of sea-water were passed through                     a  double
ashless      filter, and, after carefully washing the solid matter left on
the filter to get rid of salts, the whole was burned, and the residue
treated     in   a  platinum vessel with pure boiling            sulphuric acid, — the
silicic acid, iron, and alumina were treated                in the usual way.                  The

quantity of silicate of alumina or clay present in sea-water, even                          at
very great distances           from land, and          in  the   saltest   and     warmest
waters.       The above waters were taken from the surface                    ;  but, by     a
carefully-collected series of waters from different depths,                       it   might
be shown         that the deeper and colder waters                 contained      a greater
proportion       of this line clayey matter than the surface                    ones, and
it is at once apparent that waters                 taken near shore          will   contain
more than those from far out at sea.
    Bearing in mind the above facts, it is interesting to recall what                     was
stated above as to distribution of siliceous organisms in the ocean, they
being more abundant in shore waters or in waters of a low salinity
and in cold waters — as, for instance, Diatoms in brackish waters and
in those of the cold Southern and Polar Oceans, and Radiolaria in
polar waters       and    in the West Pacific and Eastern Tndian Oceans,
where     there    is a relatively      low salinity,     as  well   as   in  deep inter
mediate waters where there is a low temperature.                      This would        seem
to indicate that       in  the ocean siliceous organisms are more abundant
where there is most clayey matter in suspension                    in the sea-water.
    With     the   view of gaining some information               as to   the conditions
under which silica might be secreted by organisms,                       we instituted       a
number of experiments with Diatoms and other silica-secreting plants.
A culture solution, representing the mineral food of plants according
to Sachs' formula, was prepared,             consisting of —

(NhHcuIci)       was placed      (in August       1890)   with    a  small quantity of
silicic acid in the form of jolly.              In   the course of seventeen             days
they grew most vigorously, the Diatoms increasing in great numbers
-   possessing      the characteristic yellow-green colour of chlorophyll,
giving off oxygen abundantly in sunlight, and moving about with
the peculiar motion of these organisms.                 From this patch of Diatoms
we obtained the material for the following                 experiments.
    (P>)  A small quantity of living Diatoms                  from   (A)   was carefully
washed so as to remove            all traces of silicic acid or soluble silicates,

and transferred               to    a fresh      portion     of culture solution pure and
simple.         For    a   time the plants continued to live, but their increase
was trifling, and after twenty-seven days they presented the appear
ance of dead organisms,                  being deprived of their green colour, ceasing
to    give off oxygen in sunlight, and were without motion.
      (C) Another           patch of (A) carefully washed was placed in cul
ture solution,             into which a quantity of very finely-levigated clay
from the        fields was introduced.                  (This   clay by careful washing was
entirely       freed       from any soluble matter.)                   After    a   short time the
whole clayey matter                 became       entirely altered in appearance, forming
a    sticky matted-like             substance,      from which in sunlight oxygen was
freely       given     off,        and which       under        the    microscope        showed an
enormous         growth            of Diatoms, having             the characteristic yellow-
green        colour of the            healthy      algae.       This experiment               has   been
continued        for a number of months, and the results obtained, so
far     as    the development               of   Diatoms        is    concerned,        has    been    so
extraordinary           that we have             examined with           the    utmost care any
possible       source       from which           they might derive silica (apparently
necessary       to their life functions), other than from the clay which
was added.*
    The experiment (B) seemed to prove conclusively enough that
siliceous plants cannot obtain silica in sufficient quantity from the
glass    vessels       used for that experiment.                      We were also suspicious
that atmospheric dust might have                            provided     a   certain     amount of
siliceous nourishment, but the fact that the Diatoms in experiment(B)
had been unable to live seemed to us to prove that neither from the
glass vessels nor from atmospheric                      dust could they obtain, under                 the

for the propagation of Diatoms is instructive. He spreads the mud (containing
Diatoms) on a plate or shallow dish, and exposes it to the full light of the sun.
Stimulated by its rays, the plants begin to multiply rapidly, and on removal
those left in the mud may lie stimulated into active, production by repeating
the same process.    By degrees the vitality of the little plant exhausts itself,
and it is necessary to revive their vegetative powers.      This may be accom
plished by creating an artificial spring and winter. You have only to allow
the water to evaporate, and the mud to become nearly, but not quite, dry, when,
on fresh water being poured over                  it,
                                         vegetation commences anew.        In this
way gatherings originally poor may be made to yield an abundant supply of
Diatomacea.

careful conditions of our exj>eriments, sufficient silica for vigorous
growth.       On placing a small portion of the matted sludgy matter
under the microscope,         it  was interesting to notice that        all round the
outside,    and even       piercing into the very centre             of the mineral
matter    composing       the mud,       there   were    living Diatoms in          great
abundance, whilst in the clearer field of the microscope                      free from
clay, only a very few were detected               floating about.      These     experi
ments    seem to point to the conclusion that these                 organisms     are in
the process      of growth able to obtain their silica from (otherwise)
insoluble compounds of silicate of alumina.
    (D) A     patch of (A) was        introduced (August 1890) into culture
solution     containing      silicate of lime.          The result here was an
abundant growth of Diatoms.
    (E) A patch of (A)           was introduced       (August 1890) into culture
solution containing pure amorphous silica.                  A very few       seemed to
have lived, but the major portion had died by December 15, 1890.
    (F) A     patch   of (A) was introduced (August 1890) into culture
solution containing Diatom Ooze, and when examined shortly after
 wards there      seemed to be no growth, but subsequently (December
 15) a considerable mass of              living   Diatoms     was   observed.        This
 may    be due     to   the   soluble silica present         in Diatom      Ooze, but
of course such a source of silicic acid for surface                  Diatoms is        out
 of the question.        However, Sponges may obtain their silicic acid in
 part in this manner.
    Take now the rase of land plants growing in                   a  virgin    soil, con
 sisting of decomposing           rocks, sand, clay, and salts of lime, potash,
 and so on, or in      a barren     soil, from which, by repeated cropping, all
 the soluble food salts        have been extracted,        but to which manure            is
 added to replace       the salts    represented     in the culture solution          used
 in our experiments.         In either      case we have    bulky   crops grown, and
 on examining        the ash left on burning the grain or straw we find
 large quantities of silicic acid which has been absorbed,                 as is shown
 by the    following Table :—

    Here    we find silicic acid always present,             and in many cases bulk
ing   very largely of the whole amount of the ash left on incinerating
the plants.
    On looking         at the analyses        of such soils,     we find a very large
proportion of their constituents               to consist of silicic acid, but in the
insoluble form of          sand, or in chemical combination with alumina as
insoluble      clay.
    In  the drainage water from good arable hind, the amount of silica
found amounts only              to  1  part    in 100,000.       There must therefore
be processes at work by which                a  plant can rentier soluble and make
available      the silicic acid of the soil, from which its roots obtain this
in common with other mineral                food.    It  has frequently been pointed
out *    that when polished slabs of marble, dolomite, or apatite were
buried in        pure    sand,    in which seeds were           planted, wherever the
 roots of    the plants reached the slabs             corrosion of the surface        took
 place, which        is explained by stating that the fine rootlets secrete
acids having        a  solvent and disintegrating action on the lime-bearing
 rocks.    The rootlets have in all probability            a  similar effect on siliceous
 rocks.     In    the ease of what we consider eminently siliceous plants,
the silicic      acid absorbed      from the soil and secreted on the outer cell-
 walls of    the stems and in the joints must,            it  appears to us, have been
 so obtained.          The clay, or even the sand grains, has been no doubt
 rendered soluble by plant action, for we have seen that no ordinary
 soil contains soluble silicic acid in the least degree equal to what is
 required for        the healthy       life of such plants        as  produce siliceous
 coatings.        So far    as we   know, some plants usually containing silicic
 acid can       be grown to vigorous             and complete      development under
 conditions in which they             are entirely deprived of silicic        acid  ;  and
 granting that silicic acid does not appear to be necessary for their
 nutrition, yet we find it present in most plants, just in the same way as
 carbonate of lime, although not necessary for the nutrition of animals
 ami plants, yet is always present in Foraininifera, Algie, &c.,f                   where
 we find it always associated as part of the body structure.
    At    one time agriculturists            supposed    that by adding soluble sili
 cates to the soil, the stems of cereals would be so strengthened                      that

the laying of crops by stormy weather would be prevented.                           The
result proved that no more silicic acid was secreted by plants under
these    conditions than when no such addition was made.                     Here we
have apparently proof that the source              of silicic acid in plants         lies
beyond any question of soluble silica present in the soil.                  As  to the
secretion     of silicic acid by marine plants and animals, we think it
is unnecessary      to formulate any elaborate       chemical theory to account
for its absorption and secretion.           There can be but little doubt that
marine plants and animals have the power of decomposing the in
soluble silicate of alumina, or clay, which we have seen occurs in
all sea-waters we have examined.               The experiments we have             been
able to perform with Diatoms            in the carefully-washed       field clay    and
pure water, appear to indicate what takes place on such an enormous
scale in nature, and to point to suspended            clay   as a true source from
which siliceous organisms         derive their silica.
    In the case of the secretion of silicic acid by Sponges, we may have
another condition of things, also capable of explanation in              a somewhat
similar way.       These Sponges grow in         a muddy soil, and are provided
with    spicules,   fixing them firmly in the deposit where decomposing
organic     matter    is abundant, under the influence of which               alkaline
sulphides are continually being formed (by the deoxidation of the
alkaline     sulphates     of sea-water).        These sulphides may, acting
locally, decompose the clay or silicate of alumina, setting free soluble
silicic acid to be absorbed and stored up by the Sponges.                    It  is not
impossible that Diatoms, floating           as  they do near the surface of           the
water,    may also receive       silica in this manner,        the organic      matter
present    in  the floating clay indirectly causing solution of silicic acid.
The presence of alumina in            a  quantity of Diatoms obtained in the
Antarctic     Ocean     seems to point not only to the original presence
of clay in the water,         but its subsequent         decomposition by         these
alga?.
    There is also distinct solution of silicic acid when muds consisting
of the remains of calcareous and siliceous organisms                 are acted upon
by sea-water, as shown by the following experiments.                    A portion       of
mixed Diatom and Globigerina               Oozes was placed       in  a litre of     sea-
water and some mussel flesh added, so               as to  obtain the conditions
attending decomposing organic              matter on an ocean floor consisting
of these mixed muds.           After    a week's   exposure,   during which time

   the organic matter had become                 putrid,    the   water    was    carefully
  filtered from the sediment,          and the silicic acid determined in the
  iiltrate.     The amount found was equal to 0 025 grm. per litre, or,
  according to the amount of water,            1  part of silica had been dissolved
  from the Diatom Ooze in 41,000 parts of sea-water.                       This action of
  silicic acid in decomposing carbonate of lime was further proved by
  exposing 2 grins, of the two oozes to boiling water for half au hour,
  the amount of silicic acid present             in a soluble condition after that
  period amounting to          0 014,  or 1 in 80,000 of water.            To check this
  result, and at the same time to determine                whether the decomposing
  action of silicic        acid   upon carbonate        of lime was        continuous,     a
  portion of the mixed oozes was heated with successive                      quantities of
  sea-water,     when it was found that this action was constant.                    Thus,
  in   a mixture of 89-42 per cent, of calcareous                organisms      and 10'5S
  per cent, of siliceous organisms,          the amount of silica was reduced,
  by 25 successive litres of sea-water, from 10'58 to 3'47 per cent.,                     so
  that 67 per cent, of the silica present was removed.*
       On looking at the Tables showing the amount of suspended                        clay
  in sea-water      (see pp. 241 and 242), and eomjKU-iiig the amount with
  the    soluble silica or silicates in sea-water, it is to be observed                that
  the maximum           amount of silica found is            much larger than that
  present    as suspended        clay.   In the actual determinations of this
  body in the seven waters              (shown       in Table       III.,  p.   243),   the
  amount of clay found in these waters                   ranges    from 264 to 8000
  tons per cubic mile of water,         thus roughly representing            from 132 to
  4000 tons        of silica per     cubic mile    ;  whilst   soluble silica, by the
 analysts' results we have quoted, appears                at  a  much higher figure.

        In this   connection Julien states ("On the Geological          Action of Humus

 exists that a substance corresponding to humus, simply in its yield of acid

 constitution of the layer of ooze upon the bottom of the ocean.            Its exact com
 position has never yet been determined ; but it may be suspected that it
 resembles that of glairine, especially in its high content of silica.            As it has
 resulted from the continuous decomposition          of the cellulose membranes of the
diatomacefe, &c, and of the gelatinous sarcode of the radiolaria, spougia', and

In either       case, without    doubt    the amount found is sufficient            to
account      for the growth and accumulation of siliceous organisms                 in
modern        seas ;  hut  a moment's       consideration will show that, by
adopting the view that siliceous              organisms obtain    their siliceous
matter      also   from insoluble     matter floating in the water, we            can
understand to some extent their distribution in the ocean, and how
they may obtain what to them is a vast local supply (close at hand)
without being required to deal with an enormous quantity of liquid
containing but minute traces of silica.*               To exemplify what           we
mean,      take,   for example,     an animal requiring, say,     1   lb.  of solid
food per day, this is quickly assimilated with                the   assistance      of
a  small quantity of water        ;  but  if wo suppose   this same amount of
solid food dissolved in from 250,000 to 300,000 times its weight of
water,     we are unable to conceive the possibility       of the animal     assim
ilating enough         of the solid nutriment contained in this            mass     of
liquid     to sustain life.

                                        (Read January 19, 1891.)
     The method of Roy for determining the specific                                       gravity of the
blood is a very excellent one, and is capable of yielding sufficiently
accurate        results.         Over         thirty     bottles           containing          mixtures         of
glycerine        and water of different                     specific         gravity,      ranging           from
1-030 to l'OTO, are used for the estimation, and a drop of blood to
be tested is placed in a sample                     of one of these fluids.                     If    the drop
sinks it is heavier,             if it    floats    it   has a lower specific                  gravity, and
then another drop of the same blood is tested                                 until by         a few      experi
ments the exact specific gravity is determined.
     It   might be imagined that this method is more difficult to carry
out than        it really        is,   and that        it   requires many attempts                        on the
part of the experimenter, and the loss of much blood, before                                                   the
specific gravity          is   finally settled.           This      is     no doubt true in the case
of   a    patient examined for the first time, but afterwards, knowing
beforehand what the specific gravity                         is     likely    to be,      it   is   easy,    with
one or two trials, to find out                     if    any change           in    the specific gravity
has occurred.
     The chief objection to the method                               is,    however, the cumbrous
nature of the apparatus                  required, which would render                      it       useless for
the requirements of private practice,                        although undoubtedly of much
value     in   the Hospital and Laboratory.
     The method       I        venture to introduce has this advantage                                   that the
apparatus       used      is   quite portable,           requiring no more room than the
space occupied by               a   small pocket            case.          The method           is   accurate,
requires       only   a   single drop of blood, and, moreover,                             it       is   perhaps
more quickly done than that of Roy.

allowed to flow into the tube as well.                                 The drop of blood does not mix
with the solution, having a different surface tension from                                              it,   and floats
on its surface as              a      tiny         red globule.            The graduated pipette                is   now
filled with solution (B) and this allowed to run slowly into the is
mixing tube, shaking after each addition.  As (B) flows in, the
specific gravity of the mixture                                is   lowered, and after each addition
and       shake       the red globule                    returns more and more slowly to the
surface.            At last    it     neither tends to rise nor sink, and the mixture
now has              the    specific           gravity         of the blood              itself.        The specific
gravity of the mixture can readily                                         be calculated, or found                 from
the table attached                    to the apparatus made                         by Mr Fraser, Lothian

the fluid divided by its volume                                will give the           specific gravity          of the
mixture.

     As the mixtures of bonzyl chloride and toluol expand with heat
they will vary in their specific                                    gravity,      so that      a   correction for
temperature            must be made                     if   exactitude      is   required.          The solutions
(A) and (B) are prepared at the                              temperature       of 15°-6 Centigrade or 60'

made          is   also 60°      F.    no correction                will   be needed.          If,    however,       the
temperature            is   higher than 60° F. the specific                              gravity of the fluids
will          be lower, and            this fall of specific                 gravity will          be    at the rate

     My first attempt         to estimate       the specific gravity of blood was by
quite another method.                 While watching           a    globule of blood slowly
descend in a cylindrical               vessel rilled         with oil, it         occurred    to me
that by using drops             of the same size, their specific                    gravity could
easily     be determined,            for the      higher      their     specific       gravity      the
quicker      would they fall.            By     the rate of fall,            I    found that the
specific gravity could          be    determined with the greatest accuracy,                        but
inasmuch        as the        viscosity of the oil, and               therefore        the rate of
fall    varies with      the temperature,          this must either remain constant
or a correction made for it.                  As tho viscosity           varies      considerably
with     even small changes           of temperature           I    abandoned          the method,
as one    incapable of clinical application, though it                      is,
                                                                            I      find, highly to
be     recommended for laboratory purposes, where the temperature
factor can be kept strictly under control.  Having spent some time
on this method         I      did not like to relinquish               the subject,          and    the
plan already described               in this paper         was worked out.             It   occurred
to me that      if"
                I      could obtain two fluids, both of which had                       a   different
surface      tension     from blood, one of which procured                         a   higher, tho
other    a   lower specific      gravity than blood itself,             I         could mix them
until  I   hit off      the   exact    specific       gravity of any particular drop                I
might wish            to examine.        This     is      of course    the principle          of the
method  already detailed in this paper, but   was for               I                   some time
unable to carry   out in practice, more especially as
                         it                                                            such      fluids
must be very mobile in order readily to mix with                                  each other, and
mobile fluids of high specilic gravity are not very numerous.                                       I
first tried mixtures of chloroform and paraffin, one mixture having
the sp. gr. 1-070, and the other sp. gr.                      TO'20.        This plan did not
succeed at all, for the mixture affects the density of the blood itself,
a    globule of blood, say of slightly                    lighter specific        gravity than        a
given mixture           of chloroform and paraffin,                   on its first immersion
floating on the surface, but after                    a   few seconds acquiring density
and sinking in the fluid.             I   then        tried mixtures of chloroform and
toluol (chloroform, sp. gr. T498                  ;   toluol, sp. gr. O'STOG), and this
time with        success,      the specific       gravity          of the        blood remaining
constant in the mixture.                 This     method           succeeds       admirably, but
the    mixtures are apt to lose specific                    gravity on keeping,              for the
chloroform      is     very volatile, boiling at 61° C.                 I         then sought for
another mobile fluid having               a     higher specific         gravity and          a     high

CeH5CH2CL,      having a specific  gravity of TlOO, and  a boiling-point
178° C.     The only objection to this is its irritating vapour.       It  is
well not  to allow any of the fumes to get into the eyes, or   somewhat
painful smarting will result.

   I     published in the             Brit.        Med.       Jour., December           12,    1885,     a
method invented by me for the easy and yet accurate                                         estimation
of uric acid.          The method consists                    in precipitating         the uric acid
as a     silver salt, estimating the silver, and calculating the uric acid
from the silver (168 uric acid to 108 silver). As no process was then
invented which had itself been tested, except as Salkowski's, by the
side of others acknowledged to bo inexact,                              I   did all my work with
weighed quantities of uric acid, and tested my process — the only
straightforward        way of working                — by adding known quantities of
uric acid to one of two samples of                        a   urine, and finding            as a   result
of my estimations of the uric acid in the two samples                                       practically

adversely criticised by Salkowski, who still maintains that uric acid
and silver do not combine in a definite ratio.        This observer
published in 1872 twelve analyses,                            which show, according to his
belief, that there            is no constancy in the proportion between                                the
silver     and uric      acid,        and     in    1889           ho   again     allirms     the same

analyses     made by his colleague                  Professor John and himself.                    I   was
for some time unwilling to take up the controversy where Professor
Salkowski      had     left    it,   for, certain of the care with which                       my own
work      had been done,         I      was quite willing to let the                        matter be
settled by other and less prejudiced                               persons,       especially as such

proves, therefore,              is that by his method about 14 mgrms.                                less uric
acid are found than by                  the silver calculation.                    The mistake he fell
into in interpreting his results will                     be obvious on referring to column
5 of his table.   He here calculates                       the ratin between             the silver and
uric acid found by his                  method      and does not find it constant.                          The
reason         is very obvious, for in the weaker urines the loss of 14
mgrms. will          be comparatively a heavy loss, making the ratio of the
uric acid        to the silver low, while             in   the stronger urines the loss                     will
be less felt.          A      glance at the table          will   show this, for the silver in
the upper part of the table is say 4'1 to                              3,   while in the lower part
it sinks        to say 3'4 to 3.             The loss of          a    pound is much to                a poor
man, but will not inconvenience                       a   rich one, because it bears                  a    small
ratio to       the sum that he possesses.
    In    John and Salkowski's                  recent paper the same error is repeated
without discovery, the                  table      of estimation they give showing still
more forcibly             a   "constant      difference"          as    a    result of their estima

 evidence    in favour of the silver process, for a constant difference        such
 as he obtains would not be possible were the compound (we will call
 it urate of silver) of unfixed and varying        composition, and      therefore
 his own results prove the proposition he intended to destroy.
    The constant difference of 14 mgrnis. is due, at any rate in               part,
to the imperfections of his own method,            which he had never        taken
the    trouble    to   test,   merely comparing      his results     with     those
obtained by the unexact method of Heintz.                  This   difference    has
been reduced      to  within the limits of manipulative error       by Hermann
and Czapek, when comparing the silver method with                    the method
introduced by Ludwig.
    Mr   Gossage     has also criticised my method on the same grounds
as  Salkowski, but      I am afraid that his results must suffer a totally
different     explanation.      He gives five     estimations,    in   which     be
obtains the uric acid by the silver method and                  by Salkowski's
method.       His results     may therefore strictly be compared        with    the
exactly similar ones of Salkowski and Jolin.            His  average difference
is 32 mgrms., which         is more than the extreme       difference    obtained
by the other chemists          (28 mgrms.).     If  we accept    the results of
Salkowski      and   Jolin   as   trustworthy we are     forced to look       u[ion
Mr   Gossage's analyses      as  untrustworthy,   and indeed his least       mani

On a Method of Observing and Counting the Number of
        Water Particles in a Fog. By John Aitken, Esq.
                                  (Read May 4, 1891.)
    The    phenomena       known      as haze, fog,        mist,   and  rain are      in   a
general way but the successive development                  of the same process, and
the line which divides          the one from the other is              very    indefinite.
Dust in      the atmosphere        produces      a haze,    and    the thickness of a
haze of this kind depends principally on the amount of dust present
when the relative humidity of             the atmosphere         is very low.      But    as
the humidity increases the effect of the vapour increases also                      ;   the
dust particles      attract the water vapour which becomes deposited                     on
them, thus increasing their size and their hazing effect, till at last
when     the air is nearly saturated          it  becomes      very thick, and forms
what    we call a fog      ;  when in this condition, the thickness of the
atmosphere        depends      principally       on    the    degree    of    saturation.
 Between the haze and the fog, however, there is no recognised                          dis
tinction in kind, it        is principally     one of degree.         After the air       is
saturated      and   the conditions       are such      as to tend     to cause super-
saturation, then       a change     takes place      in the condensation.         A few
of the dust particles         have    water deposited on them,              and   after    a
time    they grow and become              little drops      of water,    in which       the
original dust nucleus          bears a very small proportion                to the    total
 weight.      At this    stage it is   still  called a fog, but after more water
 is deposited      on   the small drops they grow and become what is
 known     as mist,   and when the mist drops combine and fall they are
called rain-drops.
     The instrument       to be described        will, it is hoped, in addition to
 enabling us to count the water drops, also give us a means of finding
 by observation the boundary line between                a dry fog and    a  wet one, the
 latter being    the name often given to the first stages in the formation
 of   a mist, when the condensation is taking place at the level of the
 observer.      At   present   two forms of apparatus are being developed
 for observing      these water particles.            The first and simplest is an
  instrument     for observing whether there are any water particles in

260             Proceedings              of Royal Society of Edinburgh.                                      [sess.
the fog or not, that               is,   for determining whether                   it   is   a   wet or     a   dry
fog.      This instrument                can also be used for counting the number                                of
drops which              fall on    a    given area in          a   given time.                  It   might      be
thought        it   would be quite unnecessary                      to       use    an instrument               for
telling    us whether there                are any water drops in the fog                                 or not  ;
because    if   there are any drops                 in   it, they will be falling, and will wet

be necessary for the purpose.                         Such, however,               is   not the        case.    I
have found in many fogs when                          all   exposed surfaces             were quite dry,
that there were great quantities of water drops in the air and falling
on     all exposed         surfaces.        These drops, however, are so extremely
small they are invisible under ordinary                                 conditions, and being                    so
small they rapidly evaporate,                    as      all exposed          surfaces        are generally
more or less heated by radiation during the day.
     The plan   I        have adopted for observing these drops                              is   the same       as
that used for observing the artificially made drops in the                                            "   Pocket
Dust-Counter,"            described in       a      previous communication.*                          The new
instrument consists of               a    glass micrometer divided into squares of                               a
known size,         a    spot-mirror for illuminating                    the stage, and               a     strong
lens or    a   microscope          for observing the drops on the stages.                                      The
space between            the micrometer and the lens                     is   open, so that the air
passes freely over the stage, and the drops that fall                                        on its surface
are easily seen.             These drops are very small                  ;    as   yet  I    have not had
an opportunity            of measuring them.                   They of course vary greatly in
size, and many of them even when spread on the glass are not more
than   0   05 mm.            In observing           these drops the attention requires to
be confined         to   a   limited area of the stage, as many of the drops
rapidly      evaporate,        some       almost as soon                as    they touch the                glass,
whilst the larger ones remain                   a   few seconds.             A     square of          1   mm.    is
rather small an area, but one of                         ^     or   ^   cm. does very well when
working with          a   magnifying lens.
     The following are samples of the results obtained when working
with this instrument.                    On the 19th February                       1891,        at 10       a.m.,
the fog was so thick                 that objects beyond 100 yards were quite
invisible.          The surfaces          of bodies         exposed          in the      open         air    were
dry.      On this occasion                the number of drops falling per minute
varied greatly from time to time.                              The highest number observed

 19,350 per square inch per min.                  This high number never lasted
 for long, and in      the intervals the number fell as low as 300 per sq.
 cm., or to one-tenth        ;  the temperature         at the time was      29°.   Two
 days later, that is on the 21st of February, the air was again very
 foggy, about the same thickness                as  it  was on the 19th at 10 a.m.,
 and all exposed        surfaces      were   dry;      the number counted was        13
per   sq. mm.      per min., that is 1300           per sq. cm. or 8385 per sq. in.
per min.         This number remained fairly constant                 on this occasion,
and slowly diminished            as  the fog cleared away.           The temperature
 at the time was 31°.           Od both of these occasions            the temperature
 had not risen more than J° above the night minimum.                       The number
 of dust particles in the air was also counted on these occasions, and
 on both days the number was very high, varying from 45,000 to
 80,000 per c.c.
    The number of water particles in               a fog, as   given by these observa
 tions, seems to be very large, and it             is difficult to imagine how they
 evaporate     so  quickly that      exposed surfaces are not wetted           by them.
 It  must, however,      be remembered          that they are very small, so small
 that they are not felt falling on the hands or face of the observer.
 Indeed, it is probable        they never touch the skin.              These fog drops
 are very similar      in   size to the     little drops artificially produced in
 the "Dust-counter," and it is           found that, if the stage of the "Dust-
           "                              the drops never reach
 counter       is slightly heated,                                         its surface,
 but  are evaporated      in the slightly heated layer of air over it.
    If we knew the size of these drops we might be able to calculate
 the velocity of their fall, and from that obtain the number per given
volume     of air.     As it would         be more        satisfactory to obtain this
 number from direct observation, the second form of the instrument
has been designed.           It   is constructed on the same principle as the
other one, but an arrangement                  is   made    by means of which the
number       of particles that fall from a known height are counted.
My first attempts in this direction                were not satisfactory, owing to
using a magnifying lens for observing.                    This limited   the height of
air out of which the drops fell to little more than                   1 cm.    Another
instrument       has since     been constructed          in which this difficulty     is
overcome.        In place of a short focussed lens, a low power microscope
is used.      This   enables us to get easily 5 cm. of air over the stage.

In order      to    find the number of drops            in this height of air       the
following plan has been adopted.                Underneath     and concentric with
the    microscope      is mounted a tube 5 cm. long and 4 cm. diameter.
This tube       is provided     with    a   bottom and a cover      ; these are both
fixed to an axis parallel with               the  axis of the tube,       so that by
turning     a  handle both top and bottom can be slid sideways,                    and
the tube closed or opened at top and bottom simultaneously, when
desired.      In    the cover is a small opening corresponding to the lens
of the microscope,           and   in the centre       of the bottom is fixed          a
micrometer       illuminated by      a spot-mirror.      When the top and bottom
are turned aside          the tube is open       at both ends,     and the air      can
circulate freely through          it.    On quickly turning       the handle     both
top and bottom aro closed, and the micrometer by the same move
ment     is brought under the          microscope,    and all the drops that fall
out of the     5 cm.     of air over it are counted on a known          area.
    This instrument          was  only     completed    just when     the  fogs were
about over for        a season,   and no satisfactory readings         have been as
yet obtained.          It was, however,      thought advisable to give this        pre
liminary note at present,         as   the   season for fogs has gone for a time,
 and it will give an opportunity for any one wishing to make                    obser
 vations in this way being prepared for the coming season.
     It may be mentioned that the instrument first described,                 may be
 found useful for observing the larger particles of dust in the                 atmo
 sphere.     If  it is exposed anywhere with the stage horizontal, the            dust
 that settles on the glass can be distinctly seen with the lens.                If   the
 spot-mirror is applied to a microscope             it gives  an illumination      very
 suitable for examining            the    smaller  particles of dust.       The very
 small particles, which are quite invisible under the ordinary'               form of
 illumination,       shine out brilliantly when illuminated             by the    spot-
 mirror.      The spot-mirror has also been found useful in the micro
 scopic examination of delicate            objects other than dust particles.

     Dear Professor Tait, — I write                to put on paper           an account     of
the    observation     I  mentioned to you to-night, in                  case  you should
think it worth communicating             to the Royal Society of Edinburgh.
     In  the course of last summer         I  was      led, in connection with same
questions about lighthouses, to pass                a beam       of sunlight, condensed
by a lens, through the flame of a candle.                     I  noticed that where the
cone of rays cut the luminous              envelope         there were      two patches of
light brighter than        the general     flame, which were              evidently duo to
sunlight scattered by matter in the envelope which was in                          a state of
suspension.         The patches corresponded              in area to the intersection
 of the double cone by the envelope,                and their thickness was,           I  may
 say, insensibly       small.    Within      the     envelope,       as   well  as   outside,
 there was none of this scattering.                  The patches were mado more
 conspicuous by viewing the whole through                    a  cell with an amnion iacal
 solution    of a salt of copper,        or through a blue              glass coloured       by
 cobalt.     In    the former     case   the    light,     from the flame         was    more
 weakened than the scattered light, which was richer in rays of high
 refrangibility     ; in the latter   case the patches were             distinguished by      a
 difference of colour, the patches being blue, while the flame (with a
 suitable thickness of blue glass) was purplish.                         The light of the
 patches exhibited the polarisation of light scattered by fine particles
 — that is      to say, when viewed in a direction                  perpendicular to the
 incident light it was polarised in            a plane       passing    through the beam
 and the line of sight.
      When the       beam was passed        through the blue base of the llame
 there was no scattered           light.    A     luminous gas flame showed                 the
 patches indicating        scattered    light like the flame of               a candle,    but
 less copiously.         They were not seen in a Bunsen flame or in the
  flame of alcohol, but were well seen               in  the luminous flame of ether.

 "When   a glass    jar   was inverted over burning            ether, the blue     part,
which    does     not show scattered          light,   extended higher till,        just
before the flame went out, the luminous part disappeared                   altogether.
 A Bunsen      flame,    fed with chloride of sodium, did not               show     the
phenomenon,        though the flame was fairly luminous.
   The phenomenon shows               very prettily       the separation of     carbon
(associated,    it may     be, with    some hydrogen)         in the   flame, and      at
the same time the extreme             thinness of the layer which this           forms.
It  shows, too, the mode of separation             of the carbon, namely,        that it
is due to the action of heat on the volatile hydrocarbon or vapour of
ether, as the case      may be.      At the      base, where there is a plentiful
supply of oxygen, the molecules are burned at once.                   Higher up      the
heated   products of combustion have                time to decompose        the com
bustible vapour before         it  gets oxygen enough to burn it.               In   the
ether  just going     out, for want of fresh          air, the previous decomposi
tion does not take place, probably because the heat arising from the
combustion is divided between            a large   quantity of inert gas (nitrogen
and products of combustion) and the combustible vapour, so that the
portion which goes to the latter is not sufficient to decompose it
prior to combustion.
   In the Bunsen        flame fed    with chloride of sodium, the          absence     of
scattered   light tallies with the testimony of the prism,                    that   the
sodium is in the state of vapour, though                I  would not insist on this
proof,  as  it is possible that the          test of scattering sunb'ght         is not
sufficiently delicate      to show the presence of so small a quantity of
matter in a solid or       liquid  state. — Yours, sincerely,
                                                                    G. G. Stokes.
   P.S. — I fancy     the thinness of the stratum of glowing                carbon is
due to its being attacked         on both sides — on the outside by oxygen,
on the inside by carbonic acid,               which with the glowing            carbon
would form carbonic oxide.

The values in the second        column are taken directly from the paper

as the critical temperature.         Those     in  column    A  were     calculated
for temperature   194° C. from the pressures           given in the same table
for 195° C. and 200° C. (occasionally 210° or 220°               C).      Those in

greater and less than the critical volume, respectively. A glance at

the critical point should be sought slightly                                         above       194° C.          For,

As will       be seen by the numbers                           in column C above,            which are
calculated from them,                    these      formulae       represent     the   experimental
results very closely           :   — but   I    am not quite satisfied            with the first of
them, because the value (3), which it assigns                                to a, seems to be too
large in comparison with                   v.       But, on the other hand,             if    we much
reduce this value         of        a,   the closeness of representation of dp'dt is
much impaired.            Again, the value                     (- 1*5)    which is assigned           for a
in the second of these formula' is inconsistent                              with the fact that at
0°    C and   1   atm. the volume of one gramme                           is 1-4 c.c. nearly.          But
a    very small change              of a will entirely remove                   this objection, and
will not perceptibly impair                      the          agreement     of the formula            with
experiment.
     The general     formula is applicable to temperatures                             considerably
under that of the critical point, for volumes greater than                               4.      In    fact
Drs Ramsay and Young seem to assert that at any constant volume
j) is a linear function of I.                   But      I think     even their own experiments
show that, for      r<    4,       there is diminution of the value of dp                    </t as   soon
as the temperature             falls below the critical value : — i.e.,                as soon as we
begin      to deal with            liquid alone.              And certainly such       is the result
which theory would lead us to expect.

Additional Observations on the Development and Ldfe-
       Histories of the Marine Food-Fishes, and the Dis
       tribution of their Ova. By Prof. W. C. M'Intosh.
                                     Abstract.
                              (Read   July   20, 1891.)
    Since the previous communication               to the Society by the author
and    Professor Prince, not     a  few dubious points have been cleared
up, and, by the courtesy of the Fishery Board for Scotland, further
investigations on the general        subject carried out at the St Andrews
Marine Laboratory.        Under     the former head may be mentioned the
large unknown      pelagic egg, with      a spacious    privitelline  space, termed
Ovum of Pleuronectid        R      This     has been proved by         Mr E. W. L.
Holt    to be the egg of the     Long Rough Dab,            so that the ambiguity
 which has existed since the Trawling Expeditions                 of 1884 is now at
an end.     The larval and early post-larval stages of the species have
already been      described and figured.             A   more    detailed series     of
observations have also been made on the development of the Lemon
1 lab   or Lemon     " Sole,"   as  it is     somewhat       ambiguously     termed,
showing     how readily ova can be transmitted long distances,                    and
the larval    and post-larval stages reared subsequently.                 Formerly,
only    the   ovarian   egg   of   Muller's       Topknot     was    described and
figured   ; now the fertilized      and free-floating egg and its develop
ment have been studied.          Like    the egg of the Turbot and        Brill this
has an oil-globule.      The larva is tinted of        a deep   gamboge-yellow on
head, trunk, and upper part of yolk-sac, while the oil-globule is con
spicuous at the posterior and lower part of the yolk by an environ
ment of the same bright hue.
    Amongst forms hitherto unknown is an ovum somewhat less than
that of the Gurnard,        with    a   large    privitelline   space and     an   oil-
globule.     Its development      has only been partially followed, and             its
relationships    are unknown.        The ova of the three-bearded           rockling
have been     procured in great numbers along with other two species
of the same group, and the changes during development described.
The most interesting additions, however, are those connected with
the   larger and the lesser Sand-eels,          the reproduction of which was

involved in considerable confusion.                    Both forms have now been
shown       to have      small demersal        eggs which       possess a single large
coloured oil-globule when ripe, and, moreover, have the zona radiata
covered by a special            papillose layer which causes them to adhere
to plates of glass and other foreign bodies.                      In   the larger     Sand-
eel the oil-globule is greenish               yellow, in the lesser it is reddish
or     brownish      yellow.       In the earlier       stages    of the    eggs    in the
 ovary, the particles of greenish              yellow oil are scattered throughout
 the granular        yolk,     but they gradually         coalesce    until   the  mature
 ovarian egg has only           a  single large globule.        Towards the period of
 hatching,      these globules undergo a curious change                   of tint in the
 embryos, just before           yellowish     pigment appears in the trunk, and
 the special papillose coating of the egg disappears,                   leaving the zona
 bare.     As in    the herring, no vitelline circulation            is established,    and
 the yolk is considerably diminished                before extrusion.        The investi
 gation of the developing eggs has also cleared                   up the relationships
 of certain larvae, such as         I) and G,* which are shown to be the early
 stages    of the      forms under consideration.               They     occur in great
 numbers at certain seasons,            as in March.       It  was apparent      that they
 did    not spring from           pelagic    eggs, since     these would       have    been
 captured      by the various nets before the advent of the young forms.
 It  is now evident that two spawning periods or                    a  much prolonged
 one are characteristic of the Sand-eel,             the larvre of which        are found
 from March to        July,    or perhaps     even later.
     By the frequent use of various kinds of tow-nets on board the
 '            '
   Garland       and    at   St Andrews,       at all   seasons,    an endeavour        has
been     made     to ascertain      the distribution     of the pelagic eggs of the
 food-fishes round our shores.             They have been found at all depths,
 surface,    midwater, and bottom, and sometimes                    in great    numbers,
especially      where cod, haddock, whiting, and other forms congregate.
Their    abundance,       as  formerly indicated, is generally in keeping with
that of the adults in the neighbourhood, though many are swept
 into adjacent areas where few or no adults occur.                     Moreover, while
 there is a general        resemblance      in the collections of the pelagic ova
of   the British coasts, certain areas have features of their own.                   Thus,
the floating eggs of the pilchard and mackerel are characteristic of

the cod, haddock, whiting,        and long rough dab are conspicuous           ;

such pelagic eggs as those of the variegated sole, witch,          mullet-like

is also more or less characterised      by the occurrence of certain forms.
Thus in January, off the east coast of Scotland, the eggs of         rockling
and   plaice appear, followed by those of the haddock, bib, and           long
rough dab.       In March and April       the    eggs of the cod,  ling, dab,
sprat, gurnard, lemon-dab,      brill, and other forms     are common.      As

                                          (Read    June     15,   1891.)
    We   have        ventured to bring our examination                               of this specimen
under    the notice of the Society, not so much for its pathological
interest,    as    for the light which it throws upon the normal mode of
growth of the skeleton.                      There has been            a   tendency of late to regard
endochondral          ossification           as   quite secondary             in importance to that
of membranous ossification, but we believe that the case illustrates
ia a very striking manner the important part played by ossilication
in cartilage in        the growth of the greater part of the skeleton.
    The specimen is             a female          foetus, which wo received                   last February
from Dr Gonin of Pontypool.                           It   was born at the           full     time, and the
labour was natural, except                    that, the      liquor amnii was in great excess,
and that the forceps were used to assist the progress of the head.
    The father is          a   healthy man, aged twenty-six years.                                The mother,
who is   a   year or two younger, suffers from occasional fits, regarded
by her doctor as epileptic.                       They have two healthy children, aged
four and two.              About         three     months before              this, their third child,
was born,         the mother was violently                        assaulted       by another woman.
There is no history of any relative of the parents having suffered
from any malformation of the skeleton.
    The fcetus weighed 8 lbs.                     2 oz.      Its   general external appearances
are shown in Plate                 I.,   which      is     the reproduction              of   a   photograph
taken by ourselves.                 The most striking                   feature     is   the shortness           of
the upper          and         lower      extremities,            which       are    not      only         greatly
diminished         in length, but are very thick,                             and marked by deep
transverse        sulci.       The head and trunk, on the other hand, are of
nearly      normal         size.     A       closer        examination          of the        head         shows,
however,      a     few peculiarities.                Thus         its upper part             is      somewhat
enlarged, and the fontanel les are abnormally open.                                       There       is   a   deep
sulcus at the root of the nose, which                             is   exaggerated        by the forward
bulging of the forehead                  ;   the nose       itself      is   short and thick.                  This
appearance         has been         described         as     resembling that of                   a   bull-dog.

    The fcetus was injected as soon          as it  came into our possession      with
 Miiller's  lluid, and then kept in this fluid, which was frequently
 changed.
    After   the specimen        was hardened    it   was carefully dissected.        On
 reflecting the     skin   a   layer of normal fat was exposed, which was
 rather thicker than usual.           The muscles, blood-vessels,          and nerves
 did not      present    any unusual       variatious.        The     muscles of     the
 extremities had thick short bellies, due to the shortness               of the bones.
 All the   viscera were      found to present        a  normal appearance       to the
 naked eye.
    The thymus and thyroid were removed, and submitted for exami
 nation to Dr G.      L. Gulland, who very kindly favoured us with the
 following report : —
     " Thymus. — In weight and dimensions decidedly above the normal,
 but the organ is subject to considerable variations in size.                   Micro
 scopically     there   was     nothing    worth      recording,     except that     the
 lobules were rather larger than usual, and that the concentric cor
 puscles   were better formed than is usual in a nine months' foetus.

Microscopically the following changes were observed.                             The acini
were irregular in size and shape. The blood-vessels                            remarkably
distended with blood, and              here and there so tortuous, as apparently
to project into the lumen of             the acini.         The epithelial cells were of
large      size, roughly cubical in shape,      with a largo nucleus and relatively
large amount of protoplasm.               In   some parts the cells were adherent
to the walls of the acini, but for                the most       part were lying loose
in    their interior, almost filling them with desquamated                      cells, from
some of which, more granular than tho rest, the nucleus had dis
appeared.           There was no marked leucocyte infiltration.
      " The     changes above described        may be included in the term acute
desquamative catarrh."
      As   the fcetus had been        dead about eight days when we received
it,   the brain and spinal cord were not sufficiently well preserved for
microscopic examination, but we succeeded                       in demonstrating some
interesting changes          in the general     configuration         of the brain.          As
these, however, were secondary to certain deformities in the cranium,
we     will defer their description until after that of               tho   skull   bones.
      The essential and characteristic lesion in this specimen                  is    found in
connection with the skeleton             ;   and before proceeding to describe in
 detail the alterations in the individual bones,                it   appears advisable to
 state first, in general     t   erms, that the alterations present are confined to
 certain groups of bones, wliile others arc quite normal. The latter are —
      (1) Those which        are formed entirely            in membrane,      e.g.,   the flat
             bones of the vault of the skull.
      (2) Those which, although formed in cartilage, remain entirely
           or mainly cartilaginous till an advanced period of foetal life,
             so   that their general     growth       is   quite independent of endo
             chondral ossification.      As examples of these may be mentioned
             the sternum, costal        cartilages,        patella, and the tarsal and
             carpal bones.
      The departures from the normal affect those parts of the skeleton
 which, formed in cartilage,            largely depeud         for their growth during
 foetal    life upon endochondral ossification,              the cause of the departure
 being      a     premature arrest     or absence of this process.              Tho bones
 belonging to this group are the long bones of tho extremities, the ribs,
 the posterior part of the base of the            skull and      the innominate bones.

     Skull. — As           the growth and ossification of the skull                                   is a very
complex         process         it affords numerous illustrations                                 of the above
generalisations.               Thus      the various           membrane                 bones       are       normal,
the parts cartilaginous                  at    birth    are of their usual size                         and form,
while        those    bones        which are ossified from cartilage at                               an early
period of foetal life are considerably modified.                                             Further, we find
at    the     base       of the skull a marked                        synostosis of certain                        bony
centres.        After       the     entire head with                  the        brain in situ had been
well hardened in Midler's                      fluid,    a    sagittal mesial section was made
with a large knife.                 Similar preparations                   were made of the                   head of
a    normal nine months' foetus for purposes                                 of comparison.                   In     the
sections       thus obtained, the principal                     alterations in the base                        of the
skull       are well seen.                 and 2.)

     The part of the base which extends from the foramen magnum
to    the anterior             edge     of     the      pre-sphenoid               is    abnormally             short,

fcetus.        This shortened portion of                       the         base     is represented               by     a
single osseous nucleus,                   the     os     tribasilare             of Virchow, so called
because        it    corresponds          to    the three             nuclei — basi-occipital,                   post-
sphenoid,           and        pre-sphenoid,           which          Virchow found                     united        in
the    skull of      a    cretin.
     This single           osseous       nucleus         consists           of     cancellous            bone,       its
margins are regular,                    excepting        the      anterior              which      is    markedly
irregular, presenting               a   number of tapering processes which project
forwards into the cartilage.                          This nucleus is usually regarded                                as
being formed by                   the fusion           of three originally                     distinct        nuclei
by      a    process       of     synostosis      ;     the      appearance                  of    the        anterior
margin,        as    above      described,       suggests         the probability                  that, at any-
rate,       the pre-sphenoid element                    has been             formed by an extension
from an osseous centre lying posterior to                                  it,   and not from           a   separate
centre.
     The mesial portion of the base of the skull in front                                                      of the
sphenoid being normally cartilaginous at birth,                                         is   in this specimen
of    normal length.                Thus       the distance from the anterior                                 edge    of
the os tribasilare              to the level of the             fronto-nasal suture was                        3   cm.,
and in the normal fcetus the distance was the same from the anterior
edge of the pre-sphenoid                      nucleus to the fronto-nasal                          suture.         The

    cm.,      which        we      found to              be      the average             of four        normal skulls.
    This diminution                 is,   of course,              the direct result of the premature
    ossification and arrested                     development of the four elements                                    of the
    occipital bono which surround the foramen,                                              and    by the growth of
    which the foramen increases in size.
         Sphenoid. — As already mentioned, the pre- and post-sphenoidal
    nuclei,     together          with the basi-occipital, are represented                                  by     a     single
    osseous      mass, the os tribasilare.                             The pituitary              fossa     is   distinctly
    smaller than usual, its antero-posterior diameter being                                                      -G   cm. as
    compared          with TO cm.                 The orbitc-sphenoids, or lesser wings, are
    smaller.          The aUe-sphenoids                       (greater       wings), on the other hand, are
    fully     as large       as     normal       ;       this suggests              that they are not formed
     entirely in cartilage                as    commonly described, but partly in membrane,
     and the radiating appearance                               of their outer edge supports this view.
         Ethmoid.         — The         mes-ethmoid,               which           is   normally cartilaginous at
     birth,     is,   as     we         have     already mentioned, of                            normal         size.      Its
     lateral masses,              although               well ossified, are distinctly                    smaller than

       Temporal          bone.    — The membranous portions                       (squamo-zygomatic
 and tympanic)                are normal, but                the petro-mastoid, developed in
 cartilage,      is distinctly smaller than normal, and its cranial surface is
 irregular in form, the prominence of the superior semicircular canal
 and the floccular fossa being indistinct                                 The auditory          ossicles are
 well ossified, and are practically normal in size.
      All     the foramina piercing the cartilaginous portion of the base of
 the    skull    are distinctly diminished                     in size.     The bones forming                the
 vault of the            skull — frontals, parietals, and upper part of                               supra-
 occipital       are     normally osBified,                 but the calvaria presents                certain
 peculiarities.             Thus all the fontanelles, mesial and lateral, are                                en
larged,       and    the two halves of the frontal and the two parietals are
further apart than normal.                           The reason of the enlargement                    of     the
fontanelles is found in the fact that the base of the skull is so short
that an abnormal separation                          of the bones of the vault was necessary
to     give    space        for    the      growing brain.              For the    same         reason      the
vertical        plates       of        the frontal          are   bulged     forwards.           There        is,
therefore,      a    general           enlargement          of the vault of the skull compen
satory in character.                    All     the facial bones          developed    in membrane
are    practically normal.
      The lower jaw               is   the only one presenting any peculiarity.                            The
ossification of this bone                       is    complex,     it     being formed partly                 in
cartilage and partly in membrane.                                 On    the whole     it   is    distinctly
smaller than normal                    ;   thus      it    measured     3"3 cm. along the lower
body of the body from the angle to the symphysis,                                          as    compared
with     4-5 in      a      normal specimen.                 The vertical depth of the body
was very slightly diminished.
     The portion of the body in front of the mental foramen was of normal
length, but its anterior extremity corresponding to the central incisor
was partly cartilaginous and imperfectly united                               with the          rest of the
bone.         This     is   the only portion of the lower jaw which                             is   formed
by the ossification of Meckel's cartilage,                          the greater part of the body
of the jaw       being ossified            in   membrane          external to Meckel's cartilage.
The small size of the lower jaw was evidently due to the fact that
its posterior portion              is   ossified      in   cartilage.
     Before proceeding to the examination of the other parts of the

skeleton,     a brief reference             may be made to the condition of the
Braix.       This   organ was hardened              in situ, and the entire head was
then divided by        a   sagittal mesial          section.      Fig.    2   of Plate         II.   is   a
drawing of     the right      half of part of this         section,       while fig.       1   on the
same      plate shows the same structures in a normal nine months'
fcetus.     A comparison         of these two figures           will demonstrate the fact
that the normal relations of the brain                           have     been    considerably
altered, these alterations being secondary                     to those    in   the skull.
   The lower     part of the medulla is notably diminished in size                              ;    this
is probably     duo     to the smallness of the                  foramen magnum.                     The
medulla and pons normally extend from the foramen                               magnum          to the
upper edge of the dorsum               sella1,   but in this case fully one-half of the
pons lies above the level of the dorsum selhe.                       The long axis of the
medulla and pons, which is usually directed from below upwards
and somewhat forwards, is here incliued upwards and backwards.
   These changes were obviously due to the decrease in the length
of the base of the skull in front of the foramen                     magnum.           The optic
thalami are also displaced              backwards and upwards, and lie between
the splenium of the corpus callosum above and the corpora quadri-
gemina below.         Normally these two structures are only about                              -3 cm.
apart, while in our case they are separated                      a distance      of    1*3 cm. as
measured      from the splenium to the upper extremity of the nates.
The posterior part of the corpus callosum is pushed upwards so that
its antero-posterior arch is less marked than usual.                            The most strik
ing changes,        however,     we found in connection                  with the form and
position of the cerebellum,             which is flattened from above downwards
and backwards, so that its long axis is directed from the foramen
magnum upwards and backwards.                        Associated with this, there is an
alteration in the attachment of the tentorium and in the situation of
the lateral sinus, while             the     falx cerebelli       is greatly increased                in
length.     The torcular Herophili               is 6'3 cm. distant from the posterior
edge   of   the foramen      magnum,          whereas   it is generally about 25                     cm.
The lateral sinus and attachment of the tentorium cerebelli correspond
to the lambdoidal          suture,     so that the cerebellar            fossa reaches to the
upper limit of tho supra-occipital.                   No distension           of the third            or
fourth ventricles, the aqueduct of Sylvius or the foramen of Monro,
is seen in the mesial section           ;   and after the removal of one-half of tho
brain and cutting into           it,   the lateral ventricle was also found of the

normal size.      In   the description   of several    specimens     of a similar
nature to ours, hydrocephalus has been assumed               to exist from       the
appearance     of the vault of the dried skull in which the fontanelles
were increased     in size.   As already pointed     out, we believe     this   con
dition of the vault is due to the marked diminution               in  the  dimen
sions of the base of the skull, causing the brain to be displaced
upwards, and iu this way leading to the expansion of the vault.
   The pituitary       body   was   examined    microscopically       and   found
normal.
   Vertebral Column. — The spine            does not differ     in length from
that of    a  normal ftetus (24 cm.); it presents an abnormal curve
forwards in its thoracic segment and an unusual degree of lordosis
in the lumbo-sacral region ; both were found to depend on altera
tions in the thorax and pelvis respectively, as will be described.
   A   mesial sagittal section of the spine showed (1) that the ossify
ing nucleus in the centre         of each body was only one-half of the
normal size, and (2) that the antero-posterior diameter of each body
was '3 cm. less thau the average, while the vertical diameter as
already mentioned is quite normal.           This   is explained by the fact
that   the   vertebral    bodies grow in the antero-posterior diameter
during fcetal life by progressive ossification, while increase in their
vortical diameter is dependent upon cartilaginous              growth.      There
was no deficiency       in the number of the     osseous nuclei       throughout
the spine.      The amount of central        soft substance        in the   inter
vertebral discs was excessive.
   The    fourth    to   the   seventh   dorsal  vertebrae      inclusive    were
examined microscopically        ; the appearances    which they present will
bo discussed    with those found in the other bones.
   Thorax. — The thorax, after removal of the soft             parts, was found
remarkably      small and flattened,      and on either side presented             a
furrow or depression      along the line of junction of the ribs with their
cartilages.
   The diminution in the capacity of the thorax is indicated by                 the
following comparative       measurements   —
   Greatest   antero-posterior diameter, 3-6 cm. in the specimen, 5-3 in
         the normal fuutus.
   Greatest transverse      diameter,  4'4  cm. in    the specimen,      8 in   the

  This remarkable contraction of                               the    chest       was found                  to depend
entirely upon the arrested                     development of the ribs                            ; the        latter are
less than            half    the normal length at birth, while the costal cartilages
are    of   the      full    average size.
  The           longest,      or 7th rib, measured                 along the convexity                       3 2 cm.    in

      The ribs          are sharply          curved,           and join their                    cartilages at an
angle.           Externally this angular junction is responsible for                                                   the
furrow mentioned                    above, while       on the internal                 or pleural aspect                    it
forms       a    prominent projection, like that of                        a rosary.
      Further,         as a   result of their shortness,                  the ribs are more horizontal
than normal, and the costal extremity of each is slightly cupped.
      The 7th rib and its cartilage were examined microscopically                                                  ; the
appearances        will be afterwards referred to.

  The sternum is of full size and is well formed                                                    ;     it    consists
entirely of normal hyaline cartilage, without                                      any trace of osseous
nuclei.
      The       Pelvis, like             the thorax, is remarkably contracted in all its

is less than half of the same diameter at birth.

      The pelvis             is,   therefore, generally contracted and flat.                                    Further,
the diminution                 in the sizo of the pelvis                   is   shown by the fact that
the    tip of         the coccyx projects 3'1 cm. below the level of the lower
border of the pubic symphysis, and                                   2    cm. below the                 level of the
ischial tuberosity.
      The above alterations are entirely due to the early arrest of the
osseous growth of the constituent elements                                      of the ossa innominate,

     These measurements                do not    fully      represent        the degree of defective
endochondral ossification, because                          the cartilaginous                      ends      of    the
bones    are of normal                size, and the             shortening           is   confined to the
diaphyses.         This        is    readily explained by the fact that the carti
laginous       ends          during     fcetal   life       increase         in    size        by growth              of
cartilage,     while, in the case of the shafts, the increase                                      is   the result
of progressive        ossification.
     The diaphysis             is    seen, from the following                     measurements,                  to be
only about one-third of the normal length                           :  —

     In    circumference the shafts are quite normal.           With    scarcely   an
exception the shafts present very pronounced curvatures, which are
in each case an exaggeration of the normal curve of the bone. The
humerus is abruptly curved forwards in its lower half, the radius
and ulna are uniformly curved, with the concavity on tho llexor
aspect.         The femur is bent almost to       a right angle at the junction
of the shaft with the lower end, the angle being open posteriorly.
The tibia is uniformly convex forwards, and the tibula backwards.
 Tho metacarpals and metatarsals have practically no shaft ; they
 possess      a minute central osseous nucleus, which is almost surrounded
 by the cartilaginous        ends.
     The curvatures       we have     described   do not appear      to result,  like
 those met with in rickets, from softness of the bones.                  The shafts
 arc firm and rigid.         We would suggest that they depend upon arrest
 of the cartilaginous ossification         and   consequent    arrest of growth in
 the axial portion of the shaft, while the peripheral membranous
 ossification continues.
     Lastly, the       secondary    centres   of ossification or      epiphyses at
 the      ends    of long bones,     which    are   normally    picsent    at birth,
 e.g.,    in lower    end   of femur and upper end of tibia, are entirely
 al >sent.
      The joints of     the   extremities have suffered in function in conse
 quence of the alterations in the bones.               They are disproportionate
 in    size,   and  their movements      are seriously restricted by the large
 size of the cartilaginous ends of the bones over which the ligaments
 are tightly stretched.         Generally speaking,      all the joints are fixed
 ill  the flexed position.
      The condition of tho short bones of the extremities is similar to
 that of the short bones of the trunk.            Those which are cartilaginous
 at   birth   are of normal size, e.g., carpus.      Those which have      a central
 osseous nucleus at birth, e.g., astragalus,         os calcis, but which do not
 depend for their growth on ossification proceeding from the nucleus,
 are also of normal size.          The central nucleus,     however,   is distinctly
 smaller.
      The difference between the long and short bones is well illustrated
 by    a  longitudinal section of the foot passing through the great toe,
 the tarsus       being found of normal size, while the metatarsals              and
 phalanges       are extremely short.

were        then cut with the large microtome, and mounted in approxi
mate series.
      Before entering into details, we may state at once that we found
no evidence             whatsoever of any disease known                       to affect     the   foetal
skeleton, e.g., syphilis, rickets.               The essential lesion showed itself                      as
an     absence,         arrest,   or perversion of the normal process                          of endo
chondral ossification of the                   most   definite and universal character
in every element of the skeleton in which                               the     process        normally
takes place during intrauterine life.                         All   the peculiarities which we
have       described in the specimen               are referable to the perversion of
ossification, and to this alone.
      In    the examination          of the long bones we found that complete
sections were of great assistance,                especially on comparing these with
similar preparations of the normal nine months' foetus.
      The large cartilaginous ends consisted of normal hyaline cartilage,
actively growing, covered by perichondrium, and traversed                                   by nume
rous       largo blood-vessels        (see Plate        III.).       The short curved shafts
consisted       almost exclusively             of periosteal bone              ;   the periosteum
itself being actively engaged                  in ossification in the usual way                    ;    the
surface       layer beneath the membrane                  is less compact           than is usually
the case.              From    the   surface    layer     a    regular system of trabecule
stretches       right across the entire thickness of the shaft, to meet                                   a
similar series on the opposite side.                           Peripherally        these trabecular
are    closely approximated, and are for the most part parallel to                                     each
other.        In       the centre    the spaces between              the trabecule          are larger
and more open, and are filled with marrow                              ; there      is,   however,       an
entire absence of anything in the shape of                              a   medullary canal              or
endosteum.               The process        of excavation or hollowing                     out of       the

present.         The entire thickness is occupied hy the periosteal                        hone,
as described.             This condition           of    affairs    naturally    presents      an
important          obstacle     to   the     development         and ramification        of the
medullary         blood-vessels      ;   their extension or projection towards the
ossifying junction at the ends of the diaphysis would                            be specially
 interfered with.             Probably this interference with the                 vessels     has
 played      an important          part in the causation of the arrest in endo
 chondral ossification,           to be immediately described.
      The marrow itself is rich in small vessels, chiefly capillaries, while
  it  is deficient in      those of larger size.            Further, very few giant cells
  are to be seen, and scarcely any Howships' foveolie.                         The periosteal
  bone is almost continuously invested by osteoblasts.                           At the     ends
  of the shaft       the periosteal diaphysis            is peripherally extended so            as
   to form a cup, which embraces                   the cartilaginous        extremity and        a
   small wedge-shaped             mass     of endochondral bone.               The apex and
   sides of this endochondral                wedge occupy the concavity of the cup,
   while its base corresponds            to the  junction     between    it and  the terminal
   cartilage    (see  Plate    III.).
      Although       the endochondral and periosteal                bone are thus in imme
   diate contact,      they are readily differentiated from each other by their
   structure and connections.                  The ossifying junction between                 the
   endochondral bone and the terminal cartilage is in the form of an
   irregularly curved line, concave towards the diaphysis.                          The endo
   chondral bone consists of a very irregular honeycomb, made up of
   branching masses, each of which contains                      a core  of cartilage in the
   centre  ;  the bone       is non-lamellated, and stains very intensely with
   carmine or cosine.             It    appears    to have      been   formed by      a   direct
   conversion or metaplasia of the cartilage into bone, after the manner
   described by Kassowitz,*               as  occurring in the course of normal ossi
  fication     in cartilage,       and     similar    to   the    process    observed     under
   pathological conditions             in cartilage of       new formation.         liy direct
   conversion of cartilage into bone, we further mean to convey that
  there is an entire absence of proliferative changes, or of any activity
   whatsoever in the cartilage itself, previous to its ossification                     ;  there
   are no parallel rows of cells, no progressive                   formation of medullary
   spaces by the projection of medullary blood-vessels                        into the carti-

lage.    There is an absence of vessels at the ossifying junction.                 The
typical organ-pipe     arrangement      of structures at the ossifying junction
is either not recognisable         at all, or only here      and there, and that
faintly.     In  several  of the bones we further noticed that the                 zone
of cartilage immediately adjoining the ossifying junction was sharply
denned or cut off from the main mass of cartilage above                       it  by    a
curved line or layer,        in which       the   cartilage matrix      is partially
fibrillated, and the cells flattened        and crowded together,        resembling
the tissue arrangement       seen   in perichondrium.
    The appearances described sufficiently account for the remarkable
external appearances of the long bones.
    Previous observers who have examined specimens similar to that
under consideration, describe         as  characteristic, the occurrence         of   an
intrusion from the periosteum between the diaphysis and epiphysis,
which interferes      with    the    development of bone           from the      latter
(Eberth, Urtel, Bode).         We believe this appearance to be fallacious :
it is merely the result of the disproportion in size between the shaft
and the terminal cartilage,       together with the abrupt curvature of the
shaft close to their junction.          The apparent      intrusion     is only seen
at the concavity of the curve,         in  sections close to the surface of the
bone.      In making our serial       sections   of the entire bone in its long
axis from the surface inwards, we observed               that no such intrusion
was visible when the level was            reached at which      complete     sections
were obtained.
    The other bones were examined            on similar lines   ;  the seventh rib,
for example, with its cartilage, presented            appearances      which might
 be exactly compared       to those seen      in one-half of     a  long bone     ; the
 short diaphysis of the rib consisted entirely of periosteal bone,                 cup-
 shaped at the costal end so as to embrace              the cartilage,   —a    similar
 arrest  of endochondral ossification being           observed     at the ossifying
junction.
    In   the bodies of the vertebra?, the os calcis and astragalus,               there
 was a complote     arrest of the ossifying process at the junction of               the
 small central     nucleus with        the surrounding       cartilage;     the bone
 already formed being for            the   most    part metaplastic, while           the
 marrow was       deficient in large vessels and           in giant cells.        It   is
 obvious that the arrest of ossification in these bones is not to                     be
 ascribed    to a continuous and       excessive formation of periosteal           bone

without its simultaneous removal or absorption in the interior,
which we described as the prominent feature in the ¦Jong bones.
Nor      can we ascribe        the    arrest to deficient vascularisation of the
general cartilaginous         mass in which the arrested nucleus is embedded,
for    the number and size of the vascular canals                   in   the cartilage is
quite equal to the normal. We are absolutely unable to account for
 the arrested growth in the osseous nuclei in the vertebral bodies, in
the os calcis and astragalus, etc., and also for the complete absence
 of ossifying centres in these bones in which these are normally
 present     at birth {e.g., sternum).
     Eberth and Mullcr           are of opinion that the arrested             development
 of endochondral         bone is the result of an interference arising from an
 enormous overgrowth of               the periosteal     bone, while Klebs holds the
 view that         the   origin    lies in    an   imperfect     development of the
  medullary      vessels supplied to cartilage.         Wo cannot    accept the former,
  because it will not hold for the                arrest   observed     in parts of the
  skeleton,    e.g., os calcis, where     there is no periosteal      growth whatever,
  far less   excessive    growth      ; while   as regards    the latter, our examina
  tion of     the bones     does not show any imperfection                 in the    vessels
  supplied     to cartilage    in  bones devoid of an external periosteal              crust
  (os calcis). The arteries and nerves of the extremities                     presented   no
  alteration in their microscopical structure.
      Most of the published descriptions of similar                 specimens       indicate
  that the authors       are of opinion that       it  is a real disease of the foetus,
  instead of regarding          the condition, as we do, as a simple arrest of a
   normal    process.      Hence many observers describe             it  as a fcetal   form
   of sporadic cretinism, others as a form of               foetal rickets.       From the
   latter it is readily differentiated.
      Its  resemblances      to rickets are only apparent,         thus :—

      3.   The contracted and flat pelvis is not due to softness of                                       the
            bones,        but simply and solely to arrested                          growth of            the
            innominate bones.
      4.   The        largo        size    of the ends           of the long bones              is     only
            apparent           ;    their measurements               are the same as the ends of
            normal bones.
      5.   The curvatures of the long bones are not the result of                                         any
             softening, but due to arrest                            of the central cartilaginous
             growth and progressive periosteal growth from the                                         peri
             phery inwards.                   The curves,            moreover,     are all exaggera
             tions of the normal curves.
      6.   The histological changes                       at the ossifying junctions               of the
             long bones are strikingly different                              from    those     seen       in
             rickets.
      7.   The membrane bones which participate in rachitic                                   processes
             are      quite normal.
      8. There is not such a thing as a microscopical record of                                      a pro
             gressing          fatal rickets,            hence its occurrence        only rests       upon
             conjecture.
  The question whether it                     is,   or   is   not,   a   fetal form of   cretinism          is
less easily disposed                of, chiefly because we really know so very little
about cretinism.                   In     the published          description of what          is     called
sporadic cretinism, the most striking                                lesion appears     to be      a      pre
mature arrest of endochondral ossification occurring during infancy
or childhood, like that we have here described as having                                             taken
place during the early months                       of intra-uterine life.           Further,    certain
abnormalities of the thyroid have been met with in the former;                                            and
in our specimen               there are distinctly abnormal changes                      in the       same
organ, consisting in proliferation and desquamation of the alveolar
epithelium, together with an extraordinary fulness and distension
of the blood-vessels.
   With     reference              to the causation of the lesion, we do not regard
the assault        received          by the mother during the sixth month                            of   her
pregnancy        as    of any etiological importance, in virtue of the                          evident
fact that the arrest of development occurred at                              a   much earlier    period.

 On the Blood of the Invertebrate.                     By  Dr A. B. Griffiths,
                            F.R.S.E., F.C.S., to.
                             (Read 1st   June   1891.)
    I.  The Gaffs   of the Blood. — As very little      is known concerning     the
composition and nature of the gases in the blood of the Invertebrate,
the following notes may be of some value.
    The author has ascertained         the approximate composition of the
gases in the blood of certain Invertebrate animals.                The apparatus
used    for this purpose was that of Gautier slightly modified (fig. 1);
and the method allows the collection of the blood in vaeito (from
the time of leaving the vein, Ac.) without any alteration in its
composition.       The glass receiver      ACD (left-hand figure), in       which
the vacuum is made, has a canula           E  fastened    to its lower end.    The
canula    is drawn out into a fine capillary            point, which is pushed
into the artery, vein, or under the hypodennis, as the case may                  be.
After introducing       the canula into the blood system,            the tap B     is
opened      and the    blood   rises   into    the   receiver.     The   gases are
evolved almost immediately,            and by means          of the pump they
are collected     over mercury in the tube ab, where their composition
is ascertained.
     After  the introduction    of the blood into the receiver the tap B           is
 turned off; the receiver        is  then attached        to the pump.      Before
 opening the tap A, the receiver is placed in            a  bath of water heated
to about 40' C.       The heat assists     in the liberation of the gases from
 the blood.     Coagulation is prevented by previously introducing                   8
small quantity of sodium chloride into the receiver (i.e., before the
 introduction of the blood).*
    The pump and pneumatic trough do not require description,                      as
they are of the usu il kind.        The volume of the mixed gases collected
in ab having        bsen   ascertained,     the    percentage     of  each  gas     is
estimated     by the ordinary methods         of gas analysis.       The carbonic
   *
      The liberation of carbonic anhydride is accelerated by previously intro
ducing into the receiver a small quantity of a hot solution of tartaric acid.

    The nitrogen is simply dissolved in the blood, but the                     oxygen
and carbonic anhydride         are partly dissolved, and partly in a state
of loose chemical combination with certain constituents of the                  blood.
The oxygen with the hsemocyanin               ;   and possibly the greater          part
of the carbonic anhydride is united             to certain salts contained in the
blood.

    The blood was obtained from very large individuals, by opening
the carapace and passing the capillary point of the canula directly
into the heart.

This    6ubstance       (as is well known)      forms an oxygenised            combina
tion which         is very unstable,      and which       is carried    by the blood
across the tissues          of the animal, and is there dissociated, yielding
its oxygen to the elements of those tissues which require it.
    Professor Ray Lankester discovered             that in some of the Annelula
the hemoglobin            is replaced    by  a green-colouring        matter — chloro-
cruorin    ;  but in the majority of these animals haemoglobin               is present,
which the author has proved to be similar in composition to that
present      in the higher animals.           Concerning this point, the author
obtained the blood of 500 earthworms (Lumbricus                      terrestrial)   which
was treated         with benzene.        The mixture (in solution) was allowed
to stand for twenty-four' hours at 0° C, when it separated into two
distinct layers.         The one containing the colouring matter was now
separated      from the other       ; and   about one-sixth its volume of pure
absolute      alcohol was added.           After filtration the alcoholic extract
was exposed          to   - 12° C, when red      crystals were obtained.            These
crystals yielded the following results on analysis              : —

    The above analyses prove that the colouring matter of the blood
of Lumbricus           is comparable      chemically     to  that of a Vertebrate
animal — like        the dog.      The spectrum        of this colouring matter is
identical with that of Vertebrate haemoglobin.
    Although hemoglobin            is present in the blood of certain Inverte
brates, the chief constituent in the blood of the majority                      of   these
animals is hsemocyanin — a compound analogous to haemoglobin,                          but
containing copper instead of iron.*

Edinburgh,      been obliged to return to the Thames,            in order to allow
the builders to finish their work, in which they are unfortunately
in arrear.
   But it would     have   been very painful for me to give up this visit
which promised me so much               satisfaction, and      I  have   come even
without      my ship to      speak    to  you about her and           to   claim in
advance your sympathy with its future work.
    It is to do honour to Oceanography,           — of that    science whose field
has only   just  begun to open itself to      investigation, — that your     society,
one    of the highest in      the   scientific world, has assembled to-day.
 And what is Oceanography            1   This is      a  question which, at the
 present time,     may   reasonably be asked            by anyone      of ordinary
 education, but it is one which will soon appear              as strange as   would
be    "What is Geography?"              Yet Oceanography constitutes this
 most    important department        of Physiography, because it includes
 the study of the immense         realm of the waters,        with all   the secrets
which it can disclose        to us of the past of our planet and of the
conditions of its formation, while at the same time it can enlighten
us on many points of its future.           In    fact this science includes in its
programme       the questions   of the formation of the solid layers which,
slowly deposited      at the bottom of the ocean during thousands                  of
centuries,    are preparing under our eyes future continents; unless our
earth be now too old to react as of old, when the material                  accumu
lated   in the depths of its seas raised        itself into subaerial mountains
with all its fossil inhabitants, the faithful guardians of the secret of
the great problem of the origin of life.

     To establish the laws of Oceanography                       it   is necessary     to know
the temperature,              the motion, the chemical constitution, the density,
and the zoology of the waters of the ocean at all depths.                                       It    is
necessary to borrow a              little   from all the natural sciences.            It   is thus
that Peter the Great appears to have first broken ground                                   in        the
science, by having soundings made                        in   the Baltic,    the White           Sea,
and the Sea of Azof.                     Soon afterwards it was your countryman,
James Cook, who,                 amongst      the first, engaged in oceanographical
research in one of his great voyages on board the                         " Resolution."
     As    is    usual in the early stages               of all sciences, the means                   at
disposal were of the most primitive                       kind, and until your magnifi
cent      "Challenger" expedition,                 the    observations collected           in the
course      of numerous voyages,                 indicate      much good       will, without
offering any of the precision or continuity of accurate observation,
which are expected of the scientific observations of our time.
     But    the minds of the men who                     made    these early observations
gradually acquired a certain sagacity due to the contemplation                                        of
nature in the open, which it is difficult to acquire within the four
walls of a laboratory, and without which great                              discoveries      often
remain barren.
     It   is thus that the great            Darwin returned from his long                  voyage
in the "Beagle            "
                              absorbed    in the conceptions from which sprang                   the
theories        which threw        a   light on the scientific world           as unexpected
as   would the rising of the sun in a new part of the horizon.
     Nowadays the scientific men who forsake                          their laboratories for
the open air are many, but the organisation of a scientific oceanic
expedition is not easy.                   Sometimes       the captain of the ship is not
enough of a man                 of science to understand what science demands
and to devote himself                    with the      necessary zeal to      it,   he executes
coldly          the    orders    which      he   has     received;     sometimes      it    is   the
scientific men on board who are not sufficiently acquainted with
the sea and life on board ship to be able to utilise their time to the
best advantage of their scientific work.                      Owing to these causes, also,
difficulties           often arise       between       the    captain    and the scientific
observers.             Further, the keeping up of millions of men, the manu
facture of hundred ton guns, and the launching of ironclads and
torpedo          vessels,     do not leave much room              in the     budgets       of most
nations for intellectual work or for the labour of men who would

willingly     devote      themselves    to the best interests of their fellow-
men.
    It  was consequent        on such reflections       that, some seven           or eight
years ago,     I undertook       the mission which         lay before me, because           I
was at once a sailor and devoted                to science.         The only means at
my disposal,       a sailing schooner       of two hundred           tons, was unfortu
nately     much too restricted for the realisation of the enterprises
which     I  dreamt of.       But what      can we not achieve when we are on
the path of good and our whole heart is in it                  1
     The "Hirondelle"          was supplied    in  1886 with several hemp ropes
of different      sizes for sounding        and dredging and with a deep-sea
trawl similar        to that of     the   "Blake," and with             a large   iron pot
and various sounding leads.                With this material, worked by                 the
arms of the crew,          I made    soundings, temperature            observations,    and
dredgings in the Gulf of Gascony, down to                    a   depth of five hundred
metres.       But     the labour of these operations was considerable,                  and
the crew were sometimes              kept at the capstan for four hours at                  a
time.      And     as   the weather     of that year was very bad there were
 series of twenty-five days during which                 it  was impossible to leave
 off one's oil skins, for the trawl could be worked even in                         a heavy
 sea.    In   the intervals of work the 900 metres of dredge rope of the
 trawl,    hardened by the water,             and coiled all round the deck of
 the little schooner, rose like an oval wall above the heads of the
 men, who,       always in the best          of spirits, never murmured at the
 work, and even showed much intelligent curiosity in the results.
     In  the following       years my working        gear was much improved by
 the use of steel wire for sounding and dredging purposes,                      as also   by
 the use of      a  special winch, still, unfortunately, worked only by the
 muscular exertions of my crow, and                   I  was able to rectify           many
 deficiencies     in my methods of work            ;   aided also        by that will of
 success, which is the firmest             support of workers,           I   succeeded     in
  carrying my researches to a depth of 3000 metres round the Azores
  and off Newfoundland.             But then,     perfected       in their training and
  stimulated by a certain           pride, my crew worked             as  long   as  twenty
  hours at    a  stretch in dredging in 2800 metres.                A pot similar     to one
  which     I  had lost in moderate           depths in 1886, when used with
  handier material, gave me magnificent results in depths of                       as  much
  as  2000 metres,         but this was      always accompanied             by very hard

work and continual calls on the imagination to surmount unfore
seen difficulties as they arose.
    During     these expeditions,      which extended over three years,                 I
made experimente        on the direction and velocity of the great surface
currents of the Northern Atlantic, by means of               1 700 specially loaded
floats, which      were   thrown overboard       in   three    distinct regions be
tween Europe and America.
    The results     of these expeditions are being gradually published,
and they show that the work done in the " Hirondelle
                                                                       "
                                                                          will leave a
definite mark in the history of the science.
    Zoology gains several hundreds of new species and genera spread
over    all its branches,     as  well  as  fresh    knowledge about the geo
graphical and bathymetrical           distribution     of certain animals        ;   and
this is due principally        to the fact that      I  have     applied systemati
cally all the means of research at my disposal to one and the same
region.
    Oceanography       will very shortly      be enriched by a chart            of    the
surface    currents which       I am preparing with the data furnished by
the 224 floats which have been picked up out of the 1700 thrown
over    during    my experiments.        We have here a photograph on                    a
reduced scale of this work which           I am just     finishing.
    On this subject      I shall confine myself to-day to pointing out that,
 possessing     exact   and authentic      information       on the      positions      of
 departure    and arrival of    a great  number of these floats, which have
 come at first directly, and sometimes          in numbers       at a time, towards
 certain points of the coasts of Europe,          I have     been able during         the
 six years which have passed          to follow    their successive       appearances
 from the north of Sweden to the Canary Islands, then their return
 towards America, and even from some already, the repetition of this
 cycle.    And thanks       to these data which all afford mutual             support,
 I  have been able to construct my chart under conditions                   of exacti
 tude which make of it an experimental document worthy of complete
 confidence    as regards    the general direction and the mean            velocity of
 the currents     of the North Atlantic.         But   if  I  remind you of these
 things to-day, it is to direct your attention to the fact that many of
 the privileged of fortune might easily contribute to the civilisation
 of humanity by elevating its intellectual power,               if they would bring
themselves      into touch with the great efforts of science.                 The vast

domain of the sea is full of mysteries which the work of man will
 surely      penetrate,   and    the collection of        observations which enable
savants to advance          along this path would be               a   noble aim in the
 life of   many people who weary themselves                 in the abundance         of their
 goods, and wear themselves out in their uselessness.
     To-day      I am  able  to realise     the plans which         I  have     dreamed of
 so often, when, each year, during               months of struggle with the             sea,
 I could      perceive treasures for science without the power of securing
 them.         And    I  should      have    rejoiced to       bring    before     you,   the
 initiators of the great efforts made in this line, the god-parents                         of
 the Challenger, to bring before you my ship, the                     " Princessc Alice,"
 the work of my waking thoughts and of my devotion to science.
 The Messrs         Green of Blackwall,        who have built her, may be proud
 of their        work, and their skill has powerfully                  aided mo in the
 realisation of my ideas.
                                           "
     The yacht "Princesso Alice has a displacement of 650 tons, and
  I  have only fitted her with auxiliary steam power in order to
 reserve      as  much space      as  possible for the arrangements               necessary
 for engaging in serious            scientific work, combined with the wants
 of social family life.          Nevertheless,       the engine-room        is sufficiently
 large to accommodate            various apparatus,        which are thus under the
 management of one engineer               ;   they are — a dynamo,            an ammonia
 freezing-machine, ami          a  water-still.
     The dynamo supplies           100 lamps of         16-candle     power for interior
 lighting,      three 100-candle      power lamps for lighting            tho dock when
 work     is being carried       on during      the night, and         a search     light of
 10,000 candles for illuminating              the sea when work          is being carried
on in boats, and for picking up buoys.
     The      freezing-machine has           several     uses.      By    means      of   the
liquefaction        of ammonia gas, it produces             a  very low temperature,
which       is directly communicated to a liquid which                    does not freeze
at    this temperature,       a   brine which is then conveyed in tubes to
the     refrigerating     chamber.        This     receptacle      can   contain several
moulds of different forms and sizes to receive                  the objects      which, for
anatomical, histological, or zoological purposes, it may be wished to
freeze,    in order to protect them from the damage inseparable from
the chemical processes at present in use.                  Once frozen, these objects
will   be placed in a cold chamber,            kept at    a temperature        near that of

congelation by the refrigerating liquid which circulates in a coil of
pipes close to the roof of the chamber.
     The refrigerating chamber is placed in the central laboratory               ;  the
cold chamber       is immediately below in the hold, where               it occupies
a    space   of   about five     cubic metres.         A   branch   pipe takes the
refrigerating liquid to the laboratory tables, to be used in delicate
biological experiments.           On the other hand, the cold chamber is
large enough to accommodate            a part of the ship's provisions.
     The water-still is  a
                           " Yaryan "       apparatus, very simple and powerful
for its size, which furnishes         2 \   tons of fresh water per twenty-four
hours for use in the boilers and the laboratories.
     Several steam-engines        are to be found at different points           in the
ship   ; a  winch for working the dredge ropes and lighter lines for
temperature      and other observations is fixed to the deck in front of
the foremast,      and can   lift  6 tons to a height of       1 metre in a second.
A sounding-machine, which              I    have    constructed on new ideas is
fixed in front of the mizzen-mast              ; it  acts   automatically, and      can
indicate any depth to be found in the               sea.
     A  large reel with two drums works              in the hold.     It   carries   on
one side     6000 metres of cable         in   one length, to which a reserve         of
4000 metres of stronger cable            is ready to be joined for very great
depths.      On the other side there are 5000 metres of cable, divided
 into lengths of 500 metres.
     The first will be used for dredging, the second for sending down
 pots, and generally for operations which                require the apparatus     used
 to remain at the bottom of the sea for a time, while                   the cable is
 buoyed.      Fiually,   there is another small double reel, which is very
 light, and carries pieces of cable varying from 100 to 500 metres in
 length, which are used for small operations,                for which   it would     be
  useless or inconvenient to use longer pieces.
      To summarise, the actual equipment of the ship allows of sounding
  everywhere,     dredging in 8000 metres, and laying out pots or other
  apparatus     on the bottom at depths          up to 6000 metres without the
  least difficulty.
      The stoke-hold is arranged           in  a  way suitable to the equipment
  of the ship.      It contains two boilers, a small and a large one.               The
  first is used to drive the auxiliary machines (winch, dynamo, &c),
  and when applied to the main engines                    can  drive the ship three

1890-91.]    Prince of Monaco on Ship               for Study of the          Sea.      301
knots    per hour    ;  the second, along with         the   first, gives    a speed       of
nine knots.      Thus the ship can bo economically steamed slowly while
work is being carried          on, and     she can     also   be worked         under sail
when the wind permits.
    The products of the scientific work are distributed                 amongst        three
laboratories,    as  follows : —
    The materials      as collected    are received    in  a laboratory situated on
deck abaft the mainmast,              and   communicating by a            lift with the
central laboratory immediately below, and the lift descends                       as  far  as
the cold chamber          in  the hold.      After   a first picking over, for the
 elimination of useless matter, the zoological             material is sent to the
 central laboratory, and the oeeanographieal             material to    a   third labora
 tory in the after part of the ship, which is devoted to chemistry and
 physics.    These laboratories are lighted by large               scuttle    lights, and
 the arrangement       of the tables allows of four or five persons working
 at each of them         without    interfering     with   one another.           Like   the
 rest of the ship, they are heated by steam on               a special     system.        As
 to the general     service of the ship,      it  is arranged      according       to  what
 modern progress has recognised            as most useful and most practical.
    I  do not think that one ought to carry too far an analysis or
 other delicate observations during the voyage.                  The movement and
 the noise, however subdued they may be, are a cause of constant
 disturbance    ; on the     other hand, one would have to have exceptional
 power over one's mind, to bo able to arrest it in the exciting moments
 of a general investigation, whilst other experiments,                of an engrossing

  seem to me to be an easy matter, and                 I  think that it ought to be
  one's chief object,     during the work at       sea, to make      the best arrange
  ments for collecting a great number of facts at the most                      favourable
  moments,   and     for noting all the details which strike the eye and
  the mind.      It  is thus that a painter makes              a  study from nature,

                                  (Read  July    6, 1891.)
      The    manner in which the electric resistance            of cobalt varies with
 liigh    temperatures      does not seem to have            been studied with        any
 great care.         The peculiar behaviour of iron and nickel                 as regards
 their    change      of resistance   with temperature         is now well known.*
 "With     a  view to discover    if cobalt     presented     any similar peculiarity,
 I set    Mr Omori,      one of the    physical students        in the Imperial Uni
 versity, Japan, to investigate the question.                  The chief results       are
 embodied in the present short paper.
      The piece of cobalt used was            cut.   from    a sheet   of rolled cobalt
  which had been given me by Professor Tait.                   Dr E. Divers, F.R.S.,
 very kindly determined its composition by analysis of                           a  small
  quantity      (about 20 grains) supplied to him.                 The result of the
  analysis is as follows : —

 metal undetermined.            The carbon might bo as much              as 1 per cent.
 Dr Divers        regarded the cobalt as of remarkable purity for a furnace
 product.
     The experiments        now to be described were carried out in January
 and February of 1890.             The method was essentially the same                  as
 that used in my earlier investigations on nickel.                  Four stout     copper
 rods,    60 cm.      long, 0'7 Bquare cm. cross-section,            were    fixed in    a
 vertical position some little distance apart.               Their lower extremities
 were joined         in pairs by two        coiled    wires,   one   of which was a

specimen       of platinum           wire and the other the cobalt                     strip that
was    the     special       object of investigation.                  The upper extremities
of the rods were joined                   by stout copper strips to a commutator
connected          to a Wheatstone Bridge resistance-box of                       ordinary con
struction.
  In    one series of experiments the lower ends of the rods with,                                their
connecting wires were dipped in a vessel of oil which                                       could       be
heated up to a temperature                   of 240° C.         A      thermometer,         centrally
placed so      that its bulb lay at the mean level of the platinum and
cobalt coils, was used for measuring                      the temperature.            The    oil       was
heated       very gradually and was kept briskly stirred until                                a few
seconds before a reading was to be taken.                              One of the wires was
meanwhile thrown into the Wheatstone                            Bridge, and the resistance
adjusted slightly in advance.                       The temperature          was then        allowed
to rise very slowly           until    reversal of the commutator               in    the   galvano
meter branch gave no deflection.                       When      the equilibrium            was    thus
attained the thermometer                    reading was noted.             In this experiment
chief attention was given to the cobalt                          ;   a few measurements                 of
resistance were made with                   the    platinum, sufficient to give the most
important temperature                coefficient.
      The resistance curves for the cobalt and the platinum are shown
 in the diagram, Nos.            1   and     2.     All   corrections      have been carefully
 applied and the resistances are in legal ohms.

     Since the second differences            have   appreciably different values, it
is impossible to        represent    the law of change by means of a parabolic
function.        But   the remarkable constancy            of the ratios of successive
pairs of resistances          suggests     an   exponential function          of the tem
perature     as the expression         for the resistance.
     Thus   we may put,
                                            r = at"
 from which we find,          if  t  is the temperature         in  degrees centigrade,
                              k = -002605           a =-09511
     According to this formula, which strictly applies only to tempera
 tures above        100°,   the resistance      at 7°'5     should be -09698, almost
 exactly    1  per cent, too high.
      In  the paper already referred to,              I   found that the same form
 of expression        held very approximately for the               case   of one of the
 nickel     wires,    the    only     essential   difference      being     in   the  value
 of k, which for nickel was -003.                  The resistance        of cobalt there
 fore does not change              so quickly      with     temperature      as   does   the
  resistance    of nickel.
      In the    second     series of experiments,         the lower ends of the rods,
  with their connecting           wires, were inserted into a porcelain vessel.
  Asbestos was wrapped round the wires                  ;  and the whole was heated
  in a charcoal       furnace.       The observations of resistance were made
  as   the system      was cooling,       the cobalt and platinum being thrown
  alternately into the Wheatstone                Bridge.       The instants at which
  the balancings were effected were carefully noted,                      so   that it was
  an easy matter        to interpolate between          two successive measurements
  for the one wire that resistance              which corresponded           to the inter
  mediate     measurement         for the other wire.           In this   way, for every
  measured cobalt resistance,            the corresponding resistance of platinum
  was    calculated by        a  simple interpolation.            After all     corrections
  were applied, every           resistance     was   divided      by the     resistance    of
  the same wire at           7°   C.      By this    treatment      the   results    of the
   four different      experiments were reduced               to   identically the same
   condition,    so  that direct comparison was possible.
       Each single experiment contained from 20 to 30 distinct pairs
   of measurements.           These     numbers    were then classified        into groups,

 and by a rigorous process of interpolation,                    the cobalt resistances
 corresponding to assumed             values     of the platinum resistances               were
 calculated.        These    are the    numbers given           in Table        IL,      which
 epitomises       the results    of the four distinct experiments.                  The     first
 column       contains the       platinum      resistances,      taken as       convenient
 multiples of the resistance at          7°   C,   measured      after the experiment
 These     virtually    serve as a temperature           scale.      The other columns
 give in order the corresponding resistances                   of the cobalt, likewise
 all expressed       in  terms    of the cobalt resistance           at 7°   C,   measured

    If   we assume that the changes             in the platinum         resistance follow
the same law as in the earlier experiment with                         the   oil, the rise
of temperature,         which     will just double the            resistance,      is about
680°     C.   ;   and   the    interval   from      1   to   1*2    may be taken              as
corresponding to         a rise   of temperature        of 136° C.          According         to
the experiment in oil, this rise of temperature                  would have increased
the resistance        of the cobalt in the ratio 1'425 to unity.                         It   is
apparent        then, that     under    the influence of           the first excessive
heating, the cobalt has been considerably altered in its properties,
so   that the average         temperature        coefficient for resistance             up to
150° C.       has   been   increased    by a quarter.           The only other pos
sible explanation of this discrepancy is that the corrections                            to  be
applied      for the resistances        of the connections or contacts                    may
have     been     underestimated in the second               series    of experiments,
or overestimated in the first.            There could, however, be no doubt
as to the resistances         of the connections, which were the same in

all   experiments,        and were       measured       with    great   care.     If  again
the resistances of         the contacts       had    changed     to   any great extent,
this   ¦would    declare    itself in the measured resistances at              7° C. made
before      and   after the      first severe       heating.      In Table      IIL    these
measured       resistances,     corrected      for connections,       are given.       They
were all      made at 7°       C,     except    the first pair (taken immediately
before     the first heating), for which the temperature                was 70-5 C.

     The fall in resistance after the first heating is probably due to
  some    change     in the   contact     resistances    — decrease evidently.           But
  even   if this    were large      enough      to   sensibly affect the second sig
  nificant figure in the calculated value of the temperature                    coefficient,
  its effect would        be   to    diminish      this coefficient.        Consequently,
  we must accept the conclusion that the first excessive                       heating has
  profoundly influenced the qualities of cobalt                    as regards its change
  of resistance with temperature.
     Table    III.    shows   us also that whereas            the platinum resistance
  at 7° C. has not been            changed      at all by the second         heating,    and
  only slightly       by the third, the cobalt resistance              goes on steadily
  increasing.      After   the experiments were            completed,      the cobalt was
  indeed found to be much altered                   by oxidation.         It  had   become
  exceedingly brittle, and broke into small pieces when it was being
  detached    from the copper rods.             This   steady deterioration in condi
  tion of the cobalt explains the inferiority in point of regularity of
  the third     and    especially the fourth experiment, as compared with
  the first and second.
     It  is matter of surprise that, in spite of the great alteration in
  structure taking place in the cobalt strip, the general                    behaviour of

the cobalt, as shown in the first three experiments, is essentially
the same.              This    is well shown by tabulating                             the rates        of change
themselves.                These quantities were calculated from the observa

results      as   contained in Tables                     I.,   II.,     and   IV.         The individual ob
servations        upon which these results are based are entered graphi
cally in the diagram.                     Curves      1   and        2   have already been mentioned.
They show the march of resistance with temperature                                                 as   measured
on    a   mercurial centigrade                  thermometer.                   In   curve    3,   the platinum
resistances are the abscissse, and the ordinates                                     are the corresponding
cobalt resistances.                 The points belonging to the various experiments
are distinguished by special mark.
     In   one particular, cobalt resembles iron and nickel in its behaviour.
There       is   a   rapid increase             in   the steepness              of the curve at higher
temperatures.               In   iron and nickel, however,                          this rapid increase           is
followed          at   still higher          temperatures                 by   a    distinct decrease,           the
curves bending so as to present                        a    concavity towards the temperature
axis.       Neither Table                IV. nor       the curves              give any hint of such              a
tendency          in   cobalt.           It will      be seen that              Experiments         I.    and    IL
are       in fair      agreement           throughout           ;    and    that all four experiments
point to          the existence            of   a    critical temperature                   at which       the   re-

sistance begins to increase     rapidly with rise of temperature.      This
critical temperature     is about the stage 1'5, which     corresponds  ap
proximately to 350° C.        The phenomenon may be broadly stated
in  these  terms.    Between temperatures       400° C. and 700° C. the
resistance of a cobalt strip       increases   on the average    at  a rate
nearly twice    as great    as the average   rate of increa.se between   0°
and 300° C.

   The Thermoelectric Positions of Cobalt and Bismuth
            By Professor Cargill G. Knott, D.Sc, F.R.S.E.
                                 (Read    July  6, 1891.)
    So   far  as   I  know,     the only       satisfactory determination      of  the
position of the cobalt line on the thermoelectric diagram was made
by Professor Tait's students in the Physical Laboratory of Edinburgh
University     some fifteen       years ago.       The position of the cobalt line,
so  found, was given along with the positions of certain alloys in                     a
paper     by Professor     J.  Gordon MacGregor and myself,             published in
the    Transactions     of   the    Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol. xxviii.
(187S).      The particular specimen of cobalt used in these early
experiments       was a short rod obtained by electrolytic decomposition.
The noteworthy facts regarding its thermoelectric line were that                      it
lay below nickel on the diagram,               and that its inclination to the lead
line was much         greater    than the inclinations       of the iron and nickel
lines.
    As   a laboratory exercise,        I  gave to  Mr  Sawada,   one of our students
of physics,      the tusk of studying the thermoelectric properties of the
cobalt described       in the preceding paper on electric resistance.              The
plan adopted was to form             a   multiple arc of palladium and bismuth,
and, by proper adjustment                of the resistances    in these branches, to
 obtain an intermediate line which should cut through the cobalt lino
 at temperatures      within    easy reach.
     Such an intermediate line passes through the neutral point of                  the
 component metals.          It   divides the region between their lines so that
 any transversal is cut into portions which are directly as the resist
 ances in the       branches     of the multiple arc.          Thus, by varying the
 ratio of the resistances          in these branches,       we may sweep      through
 the region between         the two corresponding diagram           lines, interpolat
 ing, so to speak, any intermediate line suitable for our purpose.
 The extreme accuracy with which we can measure electric resistance
 enables us to fix the position of this intermediate line as accurately
 as the    positions of the component lines are known.
     In   the present     case,   the low position        of cobalt on the diagram
 very much circumscribed the choice                 of metals for the multiple arc.

Bismuth      had to he one of them, as            it  alone was known to lie below
cobalt.     The other       metal      fixed upon was palladium,              a  substance
convenient      in every way.            Its diagram line       is straight up to high
temperatures      ;  and    its    character    does not perceptibly          change even
after    severe heating.-!.       Unfortunately,        however,    the use of bismuth
limited    the investigation to moderate             temperatures       only.
     The bismuth      was broken up into small pieces, which were packed
 tightly into    the bore of a siphon-shaped glass tube.                  Gentle heating
in a Bunsen      flame sufficed to melt the metal, which ran together and
 solidified   on cooling into a fairly uniform rod.                  The junction wires
 were fused into the ends of the bismuth rod.
     As finally     sot   up,     the apparatus        consisted     of  a   triple  cobalt
 palladium     bismuth junction dipping in oil.                 This formed the        "hot
junction."      Resistance       boxes      were  included in the palladium and
 bismuth branches.          Because of the magnitude of the thermoelectric
 forces between       these three       metals and copper, great precaution was
 necessary   in keeping the various cold junctions at the same tem
 perature.     The palladium branch always contained                    100 ohms resist
 ance ; and the bismuth branch never contained less than 200.                           For
 each   of the seven selected ratios of resistance,                 a careful series of
 thermoelectric observations was made.                     A delicate     high-resi.stanee
 galvanometer was used           ;   and the temperatures         were measured        by a
 mercurial     thermometer.            The     electromotive      forces    between     the
                                                                    "
 cobalt and each        intermediate " equivalent           metal       were in this way
 measured directly.         From these the thermoelectric powers at chosen
 temperatures     could be calculated.          But one of these equivalent metals
 was   palladium      itself, obtained by making               the    resistance    of the
  bismuth branch infinite.            Thus, by    a  simple process of subtraction,
 we obtained the thermoelectric powers                    between     palladium and all
 the others.     These quantities, calculated for 0' and                    100'    C,  are
 given in the following         table.      The symbols Bi, Co, Pd stand for the
 metals bismuth,        cobalt,     and    palladium     respectively.       The various
 equivalent    metals     are represented        by the symbol Pd Bi„, where the
 number n represents        the ratio of the resistances           in the bismuth and
 palladium branches.          Thus I'd Bia means that, since the palladium
 branch always contained 100 ohms, the bismuth branch contained
 in this case 200 ohms.           The electromotive forces, from which these
 values were calculated,        were measured         in microvolts.

      According       to   the numbers deduced            by Fleeming           Jenkin from
 ^Matthiesen's        experiments, bismuth            lies four       times    further     from
 lead than does cobalt. Here we have it seven                            times.     Professor
 Tait's electrolytically-deposited cobalt lies four                     and    a  half    times
  further from       lead    than does palladium.             Here we have it          a   little
  over two times.           According       to Becquerel's numbers, given at the
  end of the English translation of Mascart and Joubert's Electricity
   and Magnetism, the ratio at 50" C. of the thermoelectric powers of
   palladium       and   bismuth relatively to lead is as              7 to 40.      Here wu
   have it    1  to 16.
      These discrepancies           are not surprising.        We know* how variable
   are the thermoelectric properties of stable                  alloys intended to have
   the same composition, and how a very slight change in composition
   may bo accompanied                by  a   very large      change      in thermoelectric
   quality.      The     present      experiments must           therefore     be judged        of
   altogether on their own merits.                Now,    a   simple comparison          shows
   that Professor Tait's electrolytically             deposited cobalt will fit in to
   the region between             lead  and   bismuth very much             as   Matthiesen's
   cobalt fits in to his own series.             Thus the cobalt investigated here
   seems to differ from the other specimens                    in much the same way.
   The new cobalt,          indeed,     has its diagram line at ordinary                atmos
   pheric     temperatures         above   the   lino   of Tait's       nickel,    for which
   A =—218.            This unexpected result was at               once tested.       A  rough
   experiment was made with a nickel cobalt                        couple,    and   a  neutral
   point was obtained at             a  moderately low temperature.               The cobalt
   line,    therefore,    begins      above   the   nickel     line, but because         of its
   greater downward           inclination     gets below       it  at temperatures       above
    100°   c.

     As regards the inclination         of the cobalt line, the present resuli
agrees as well        with the earlier result as could reasonably                 be ex
pected     with two quite different            specimens     of the metal.         Thus,
 expressed      in the same      units,    the    thermoelectric    power    of    Tait's
electrolytically-deposited cobalt is
                                  p= -26-3-OllCf,
while for the present specimen
                                  p=   - 13-2-0-139?.
With      the exception       of the sharp upward bend in nickel,                     this
gives    the    greatest   inclination      yet obtained      for a thermoelectric
line.
    The downward         trend and comparatively large inclination                of   the
bismuth line are also worthy of note.                   Because   of the position of
the line, as a whole,       lying far below          the lines of all other metals,
this large inclination        does not greatly influence the electromotive
forces, so that with bismuth couples               the electromotive force is very
approximately         proportional      to   the    temperature.      This fact,        of
course, prevents us from making                a   very accurate determination of
the coefficient B, which in the present                experiment has a large pro
bable    error.    The mean value is         a  little larger than that indicated
by Battclli's      direct   measurements          of the   Thomson     effect   in bis
muth.*
    Righi    has    shown   f   that the      electric resistance     of bismuth        is
altered    in   a strong magnetic field.            To find if any thermoelectric
change accompanied          magnetisation of bismuth,         a  bismuth palladium
couple    was set up between         the poles      of  a  powerful electromagnet.
No effect whatever was observed,             although the arrangement         (slightly
modified) was sensitive enough to show with great ease the thermo
magnetic effect discovered by v. Ettingshausen and Xernst.J

On        the Effect of Longitudinal Magnetisation on the
          Interior Volume of Iron and Nickel Tubes.    By
          Professor Cargill G. Knott, D.Sc, F.K.S.E.
                                          (Read   July    20, 1891.)
       The     following         results     in magnetic           strains     are,       so far as         I    am
 a. •ware,     new.     They supplement in an interesting way Joule's old
 result of      no change of volume in an iron rod when                                 it   is magnetised.
  "What      is given here is only preliminary, and suggests many lines of
  research which           I   hope to he able to follow out later.
       The broad fact established                 is,   that the internal capacity of certain
  iron       and nickel          tubes     alters       appreciably          when         the       tubes        are
  magnetised longitudinally.                      The      tubes      were      34   '8      cm.    long, and
  ¦were      all about       3   cm. external            diameter.          One iron tube had an
  internal diameter of               1   cm., and another of           2     cm.      These     I    shall call
  A,     and    A2 respectively.             A3 represents            the    third iron tube, whose
  wall    was about        1           The nickel tube (]!) had its wall 03
                                mm. thick.
  mm. thick.           "When experimented with, each tube was tightly corked
  at both ends, and               through the one cork                a     line capillary glass                tube
   projected.         The tube was filled with alcohol coloured with cochineal.
  The changes of volume were measured                                  by the movement                    of the
  end of the liquid              column in the capillary tube.                          This was viewed
  through      a   microscope.           A   movement          in the tube through                  a    distance
  equal to one division of the microscope micrometer                                      meant      a    change
  of volume of         7   2   x 10~* cub. cm.
       As an example, take the                case      of Aj, the small bored iron tube, in
  a    field of       250.       The       sudden outward movement                           of the liquid
   meniscus        showed        a              (change per unit volume) of
                                     total compression
   21 x 10~7       in the region inside the tube.   But we know that in this
   field ordinary wrought iron lengthens                     ;   and in virtue of this lengthen
   ing the internal volume will be increased.                                 It   is   clear, then, that
   the transverse contraction of the walls of the tube has overbalanced
   the longitudinal            extension.         If    A./n represent       the elongations              parallel
   to and perpendicular to the axis of the tube along the inner surface
   of the bore, the dilatation will                 be  \  +   2/x.    Now, in field            2   oO   Bid well

   Unfortunately       I   possessed        no nickel tubes shaped         like the iron
ones, so had to content myself                 in the meantime with       a thin walled
tube formed by rolling up              a sheet of     ordinary commercial nickel to
the convenient size.          The results for this tube were of great interest.
Up   to a field of 50,           the compression          of the inside space varied
uniformly with the field, the dilatation being given by the formula
                               \+2/*= -l-8xlO-»H,

the same field the       following expression for A: —

      Thus, for the iron tubes, the transverse                  contraction always exceeds
  the longitudinal extension,             so   that there is on the whole          a  diminution
  of  the internal space.           There is evidence of the contraction attaining
  a maximum, which, in the case of the thinner walled                             tubes (A., and
  A3), occurs in       a   field not far removed from the field which produces
 the maximum extension.
      For    the nickel tube, the transverse                 expavaion      differs so slightly
  from     the longitudinal       contraction, that the change of volume of the
  internal space, though of the same order of quantity                      as the correspond
  ing   change     in the iron tubes, is a very small fraction indeed of the
  change that would result from the longitudinal                           contraction acting
  alone.       In low    fields, the longitudinal            contraction overbalances          the
 transverse expansion,              causing       a   compression.         This     compression
 reaches a maximum about field                    CO, and      then    falls off first slowly,
 then      more     rapidly.       About        140    it   becomes      zero,    and    changes
 sign in higher fields.               In field      2G0 a very distinct            dilatation    is
 produced about equal              to the       maximum         compression        obtained in
 field 60.        The rapid changes of temperature                     of the liquid in the
 heart      of the magnetising coil, when the high currents were used,
 made accurate measurements                   of the changes         of volume impossible          ;
 but there was no doubt              as to the      fact   of the change of sign in the
 compression        when the field was taken high enough.
     It  should be mentioned that, in an experiment with a glass tube
 substituted for the iron or nickel tube, no effect was produced                             ; so
 that the alcohol itself was uninfluenced by the magnetising force.
 An experiment         was also tried with a current of seven amperes passed
 along the iron tubes, so            as   to cause a circular magnetisation of the
 outer circumference.             No    change of volume was observed,                 however,
 probably because of the comparative                   smallness      of the fields involved.

twists produced in the magnetic                            metals    when they are under the
combined influence of circular and longitudinal magnetisations.
  It    is established that a cobalt rod of rectangular section                                          twists
left-hamledly when                a    current is passed along it in the direction                             of
magnetisation.                  That     is,    cobalt behaves        like nickel.              Iron, on the
other       hand,       twists         righthandedly,             until very             high     fields     are
employed.              These      results seem to have              a   close     connection with the
magnetic          changes         of length in these metals                 ;     for iron expands in
moderate fields, while nickel and cobalt contract,                                  the former always,
and the latter           till high         fields are reached.
   In   the case of nickel an evident maximum                                    twist    is    obtained for
intermediate values                    of field.         The occurrence             of this maximum
finds   a   ready explanation in terms of the theory suggested.
   In all       cases       the amount of twist produced                    by reversing one of the
magnetising forces                 depends            on which      one     is   reversed.         Generally
the twist         is   greater         when the longitudinal                 field   is       reversed     than
when the current along the wire                            is   reversed.         For low fields in          the
case    of iron and nickel                 it   is,   however,    the current reversal             that pro
duces       the     greatest           twist.         These      various phenomena                give very
instructive illustrations of the magnetic after-effect or hysteresis.
   In Part        I.    an expression was given for the twist                            in     terms    of the
elongations in              a   thin walled tube            of given radius, under the com
bined influence of given circular and longitudinal                                        magnetisations.
From the observed maximum twists in iron and nickel wires now
given,      a     comparison            is     made      between     the     elongatiou coefficients
which enter into the formula for the tubes of equal diameter.                                                The
comparison             is   in remarkable             accordance     with        the direct comparison
of elongations as furnished by                          Mr Bidwell's        measurements.

twisting       a     magnetised            wire, more          especially      a    wire       magnetised
circularly by           a   current passing            along    it.     The peculiar mauner               in
which       the magnetic          change sometimes              lags behind the stress, some
times       shoots        ahead      of    it,   is   fully investigated.                This magnetic
" lagging"         or   "priming"          is    found to depend             upon the strength of
the current, upon              the    amount of twist, and upon the amount                             and
degree of tapping to which the wire                        is   subjected.
     The longitudinal polarity acquired by                       a    current-bearing wire when
it   is   twisted    is     relatively     very high as compared                   with the probable
intensity      induced at the circumference of the wire.                                      Further, the
longitudinal intensity                so    acquired       is   reversed,       more or less com
pletely,      when the current               is   reversed.           These facts are not easily
explained       in terms of the usual                   theory of magnetic                   aeolotropy, or
in    terms    of any simple hypothesis of rotatable molecules.                                       They
rather hint at the existence of complex                          molecular groupings, which
assume new           configurations under the influence                        of   a   changing stress
or   a    changing magnetic force.
     Certain       experiments on the effect of slightly                            twisting      a   wire,
which by superposed magnetisms                         has been reduced to an apparently
demagnetised            condition, show how easy                it    is   to destroy        the apparent
magnetic balance.                 There     is   a    strong    suggestion         that   a    magnetised
wire may, under certain circumstances,                           consist of alternating layers
of opposite        polarities.Any mechanical                     stress which acts differently
on these      different layers will almost, as                   a     matter of course, power
fully     affect the average              resultant action which               is   measured on the
magnetometer.
     From the experiments recorded in the paper, and from the experi
ments of other investigators into the complex                              relations      of magnetism
and twist, the general               conclusion may be drawn that the first effect
of   a    shearing stress upon the molecular groupings                                  is   not only to
increase      the average          intensity          in the direction of the magnetising
force, but also to bring into prominence                          a     relatively high intensity
in   directions at right angles thereto.

                      Communication,        By    W. Dittmar.
                               (Read February 3, 1890.)
   On the strength of Dumas' famous                RecJierche   sur la Composition
de  VEau,*     and adopting the great master's own interpretation              of his
results,   all chemists, until lately, agreed in assigning to the atomic
weight of oxygen the value              0=16 (H=l);             and     it is on the
strength chiefly of the same experiments that many of us now hold
that  0=     15 -96 is a closer   approximation to the truth          !
   In    these    circumstances     it surely is worth while to look into
Dumas' work with the help of critical experiments, and try to see
whether he was not right in thinking that — all his great efforts
notwithstanding — the difference             lies within the        influence of his
method-erroTa ; the more so, as          all  these errors (as far as one can see
without experimenting) tend to raise the experimentally ascertained
value of the ratio        H :0   above its true value.
    I accordingly, some time ago, caused my private assistant,                     Mr
Henderson, to join me in this inquiry,                and, thanks to his youthful
energy and indefatigability,         we have already made considerable pro
gress in our work, and hope           before     long to lay a complete account
 of it before the Society.         Meanwhile,      I content    myself with stating
 that we have succeeded in so modifying Dumas' modus operan/li as
 to give   a  higher degree of constancy to the weighings, and to reduce
 the trouble and loss of time          involved to far less than it was with
 the original form of the method.
    The principal object of the present               notice, however, is to direct
 attention to an oversight which Dumas made himself guilty of, and
 which, as far      as  I  am aware, has never been noticed before.             What
 I allude to is that Dumas, while weighing his oxygen (virtually) in
 vacuo, weighs his water in air, and forgets to reduce this latter weight
 to the vacuum.
    That the correction tells very considerably upon the calculated
 weight of the hydrogen          a very  little   reflection  is sufficient to show    ;

I  prefer to give at once the results of my recalculation of Dumas'
                                                                        " probable value"
experiments, and apply the correction to the most
as calculated by         me.
    In his tabular         statement    of results Dumas gives,              in the    case of
each of his nineteen           experiments, two values              for what he calls the
"equivalent of hydrogen" (the term with him meaning the weight
 of hydrogen which combines with 10,000 parts of oxygen into
 ¦water)
         — viz., firstly, the value            as  calculated from the uncorrected
 weights of water and oxygen                ;  and, secondly, the
                                                                          " equivalent
                                                                                          *  as

 corrected   for   the           the sulphuric          acid    (used
 of the hydrogen from zinc). For reasons, which will                               be stated
 in the memoir,        I   have left these corrected values on one                 side, and
 recalculated and reduced only the " equivalents hruts."
     Taking S     as a symbul for the             weight of oxygen consumed in                a
 given experiment, and           W for the uncorrected weight of                  water pro
 duced,    I formed       the equations

                                                  =

                                         - =         83
 and solved the nineteen equations in respect to k — firstly, in the way
 which reduces         the algebraic       sum      of all the errors       8  to  nil  ; and,
 secondly, so as to reduce           the sum        of the squares of the errors           8 to
 its minimum.             The first method gave £=1*125 43;                      the second
 gave £-=1*125        47.
     The two     values,      as wo see,      are practically        identical.    Adopting
 the second, it may bo read            as  stating that 1000 grammes of oxygen
 take up hydrogen to form                 a   quantity      of water whose          apparent
 weight in air is 1125*47 grammes.                    But, assuming the air to have
 the density corresponding to            15° and 760 mm.           (which probably is not
 far removed        from the air-density which actually prevailed during
 Dumas' work),           the air displaced by the              water amounts to           1*38
 grammes     ;  hence      we have,     in reference        to any given quantum of
 water, the following relative values for the weights of

      As already pointed out by Lotliar Meyer and Seubert, Pumas' table of
 results includes quite a number of misprints.               These, however, are all easily
 discovered,   and   set  right without   much     fear  of error.

tlioso chemists   who hitherto {after having become convinced that

weights to   H  = 1, will give up this absurd practice,   and, like other
people, adopt    0 = 16   as  their standard.  The sixteenth part of the
atomic    weight of oxygen,     surely, is as good a unit   as one could
desire to have.

        Investigation of the Action of Nicol's Polarising

                             (Read February 20, 1837.)
    The first anuouncement of the construction                        of this   important
instrument appeared almost paradoxical                  : a  piece of calcareous       spar
was to he cut in two, the surfaces            of the section polished, and then
reunited by help of Canada Balsam                   :  and     it  seemed    strange   that
from such an operation there should have resulted any change in
the optical properties of the mass.               Even now that the instrument
 has been in use for some time, the true                  nature      of its performance
is often misunderstood       ;  while no investigation has been made public,
 the object of which is to enquire into the laws of the action, and into
 the circumstances      which determine the peculiar forms of the parts.
    This investigation     necessarily     involves operations belonging to the
 higher branches      of algebra      and    geometry       ;    but this is not to be
 wondered at, when physical science has reached                         such  a degree    of
 development as to exhibit many of the laws of its phenomena.
    Before proceeding with the strict investigation,                      it may   be con
 venient to take a general          review of the modifications which light
 undergoes    in its transit through the instrument                ;  as by that proceed
 ing we shall be better         prepared    for seizing the full import of the
 analytic results.     Let, then, ABCD             represent        the prime section of

  ray will be refracted        in two    pencils,        FH      that submitted to the
  ordinary,    Yh that    to    the   extraordinary,          law.      Were the rhomb
  entire these rays would again           suffer      refraction at the surface BC,
  and would emerge in directions           HI, hi parallel           to the incident ray     :

the same thing would                      happen were             the surfaces    BD in            optical
contact,       that    is,   were    they united by           a    substance     having       its index
of refraction greater than or equal to the greater of the two indices
for calcareous spar.                But the index for Canada Balsam                      is   less than
that for carbonate              of lime, and on this account the rays                         may not
proceed uninfluenced.
   If,   indeed,       the ray      FG fall very obliquely on the surface of the
varnish     it   may be totally reflected,                no portion of     it   passing         into the
second wedge           DBC.          So   it   may also happen     but  with the       ray    Fg   ;
as the two rays fall with different obliquities on the varnish, their
limits of total reflection are different, and between these, the extra
ordinary light alone will find                  a      passage.
   The ray       E,F                                           would
                         falls at such an angle that the ordinary pencil
barely suffer total reflection, while the extraordinary pencil would
not.  Any ray incident between the directions AF and EjF would
transmit both its pencils through the whole instrument.      The ray
F.2F, on the other hand,                 is   so placed      that both of its pencils suffer
total reflection       ;     and,   hence, all rays          within the        angle     EjFE2         will
transmit to the eye only that portion which                              has experienced               the
extraordinary refraction, while no ray incident in the angle                                      E2FD
will    send any       light through.
   Such     is   the true action of the polarising eye-piece                       :   it     does     not
depend,     as has       been       thought, on the separation of the images, for
in truth there         is    never more than one image formed, and the                           virtual
place     of that image             is   not affected        by the film of balsam.                  The
perfection of its action depends on the magnitude of the angle                                   EjFEj,
which magnitude regulates                     the extent of the field of view                ;   and on
the     transmitted light             passing          without     being at all deflected             in
its path.        For    the attainment of the latter object, the surfaces                            AD,
BC      must be so placed            that      a   ray of extraordinary light, passing in
the interior          parallel to the sides AB, may not suffer refraction in
escaping       at either surface.              By this     arrangement         the light proceeds
from the object to the eye, so that the first and last portions of its
path are not only parallel to each other, but actually in one straight
line.     If   this adjustment be not effected, there                     is   created   a    parallax
similar to that occasioned                     by the      transmission of light obliquely
through     a    thick plato of glass              :   that parallax affecting the apparent
positions of near, but not those of distant, objects.

     The   removal     of this     parallax   is   not altogether a matter of
necessity, it      is one rather of convenience,          for by turning on the
«;iids of the containing box circles parallel to each other,                      but on
different axes, the inconvenience of the parallax would bo entirely
removed     — the adjustment, however, of                 these    axes     would      be
troublesome.
     The teudeucy of Iceland Spar           to   split in   planes parallel to the
faces of the primitive form renders almost unavoidable the employ
ment of rhombs whose lengths are parallel to the aretes                          of that
form, economy in the amount of material being nearly                    as   important
as a maximum extent of iield.
     Regarding, then, the positions of the lines             AB   as  determined by
 the cleavage, and those of        AD by     the condition     of rectilineal trans
 mission, there remains only to be determined the inclination of the
 plate DB of balsam.              This inclination       may   be    determined by
 attending to one or other of two conditions.                   Either    we may       so
 place this plate as to give the greatest angular field              of view      ; or we
 may so fix it that the verges of that field are equally inclined to
 the direction       AB  :  practically the latter consideration is the more
 important.       It will,   then, be proper, before attempting the enquiry
 into the best possible form of the instrument, having regard neither
  to the economy of the material nor to the introduction of parallax,
  first to determine the form which it ought to have when influenced
  by these restrictions.
      The first thing to be determined is the angle ADC, which the
  diagonal   AD of     the end of the rhomb makes with             the arete of the
  primitive   form.      Adopting     the results of the       elaborate      investiga
  tions of M. Malus, let (fig. 2) the whole crystal be imagined to
  occupy the point O. Suppose that KOL is the direction of the
  axis of crystallisation, and ON that of the arete of the primitive
  form, and also of that portion of the ray which is interior to the
  crystal.   Describe from O,        as a centre,   a sphere   with the radius OM
   = unit,  to represent      the progress     of a luminous      pulse    in    air, and
  the interior ellipsoide with       its semi-axes     -G04  and -G73 to represent
  the luminous pulse in the interior of calcareous spar.
      In order    to place    the refracting surface       OP in     such   a   position
  that the pencil of extraordinary light may not be bent, we must
  apply tangent planes         at the points      M   and   N, and    continue these

     This error of                        three degrees committed by M. Malus seems to have
run throughout his work, and thus throws considerable uncertainty

       Now,   the    inclination             of the arete to the face of the primitive
 rhomb      is   109°   . .   08', so that, in forming an eye-piece, the ends must
 be inclined 4°         .
                        .     09' less than the natural face is.
       This result      is    opposed         to the instructions                given by        Mr Nicol in
 his first description of               the instrument            :     he directs       that the obliquity
 be increased,          whereas             we have found that                 it     must be diminished
 4"; and,        indeed,      on inspection of those                     eye-pieces which have been
 made      agreeably          to his instructions,              it     will    be found that the ray of
 light     proceeding         in the interior of the crystal parallel to the arete
 suffers    refraction at each surface, and that the ray which does not
 suffer refraction passes in                     a   direction intermediate between the lino
 of the arete and the diagonal                       joining      the two obtuse corners.
       Having now determined this                           element           of the      artificial         rhomb,
 there remains for me the solution of another question.                                                 It   is   this   :
 To place the plate of balsam                             so that the extent of field may                            be
 placed equally on each side                         of the lino of sight.                    For this,      a     new
 element      enters        into the investigation                ;     the refractive power of tho
 balsam.
       Let OR       represent           the      direction        of     the     plate of        cement,           and
 measure off        OR        to represent           tho velocity of light in that medium                                ;
 the    limiting directions             of the two pencils                will    be thus obtained.
       First, for the ordinary ray                   ;    describe      a     sphere     round     O     with the
 radius a, and from              II     apply to that sphere                     the tangent plane                 Rs,
  meeting the surface                  OP in         the line   ;t      then     from that line apply                a
 plane touching tho sphere pertaining to the air                                        in the point          u, Ou
  is   the direction          of that external ray, of which the ordinary pencil

     just suffers total reflection at the surface of the balsam; this is                                                                              oim-
     of the boundaries of the field of view.
          Again, from the same point R apply the plane                                                                  EST touching                  the
     spheroide            in S, and cutting the surface                                     OP in T                 ;    the tangent plane
     TU will             give the direction of                        OU      the        limiting extraordinary ray.
          The question is to place OR, so that the angle UOw may                                                                                         be
     bisected by the line OM.
          For       the analytic solution of this problem we have only to                                                                 go into

     the corresponding formula for ordinary light.
          Denote the angle                         LOP by                   the required angle                             LOR by              v, and
     the velocity                of light in Canada Balsam by y                                                     :    then are the co

  This   value of      POR,       96°    . .   11', differs by six degrees from             the deter
mination of Mr Nicol          ;    but        as the surface      according to that gentleman
is inclined     by seven      degrees to the position assigned                           by theory, it
follows that the value of                v,    or the position of the plate of              balsam in
reference to the axis of the crystal, is nearly the same                                 in his instru
ment, as by the above determination.
  If,   indeed,      an eye-piece, constructed according to the                          directions       of
the inventor, be placed                  so     that the light from any object pass in
the interior parallel to the length of the rhomb, that object                                  will      be
found considerably nearer the limit of the ordinary than that of
the extraordinary light.
  The above angles are sufficient to guide the operator in the con
struction of the eye-piece.                    But it    is to be remarked that the              advan
tages sought in this construction                        do not balance              the disadvantage
of a diminished field         ;   and that Mr Nicol's dimensions are preferable.
   Having now completed the investigation of the best form for a
rhomb whose           faces are obtained by cleavage,                           I    shall proceed to
investigate the absolutely best form independent of that considera
tion.
   In   strictness,    this investigation ought to be founded on the above
values of POU,           POw.            It     ought     to     include the solution            of     the
equation
                                  POU          +   POm=2(Ai-A).
The root       of that equation determined, the value of                                  POIT   - POw
should be thence deduced.                       Then the maximum value of that field
ought to be sought,               and          \ being the       primary variables.
   Or    if   the condition              of non-refraction              of the line of sight be
included,     /j.   becomes       a   function       of    X,    and hence the differentiation
becomes monome.               This investigation however                       is,   on account of its
complexity, almost impracticable                     :    for   it
                                                                 I      shall substitute another.
   Instead of seeking the maximum separation                                  of the limiting rays
exterior to the rhomb,            I      shall seek for that position of the plate of
balsam    which gives the greatest internal divergence,                                which depends

to the two interior rays OS, Os                           ;       and that we must seek for the best
possible       position beyond that limit.
     The maximum value of ROs                                 - ROS       must, since ROs-                          is       constant,
accompany the minimum                                  value of ROS, which minimum                                                 value,
since both angles must always lie on the same side of                                                                OR,       is      zero.
We might,            therefore,           be led to suppose that the best value of                                                     LOR
is     (v)   = 57°   . .   55'.          But in reality, any value of LOR between

circumstance,              that no pencil of extraordinary light                                           is   intercepted by
the balsam.                Hence in considering the values of                                              v    between                these
limits, we have only to examine                                   the condition                  of total reflection of
the     ordinary           ray    ;    this examination                  is    a        matter               of comparative
facility.
      Having         thus found              a    wide range of angles accompanied                                                 by no
interruption               of     the      extraordinary                ray,       we        might              enquire whnt
particular angle would give the most extensive field of view; but

in    reality, all positions of               the   plane      OR give the         same     value,
22°    . . 33', to the angle           ROs, so that the position of OR between
these limits         is indeterminable by this condition.
     Another        and     remarkable       condition     may, however,          be proposed       :
 viz.,   so to place          the external surface, that no ray of ordinary light
 entering      the eye-piece         may pass through it           ;   while at the same time
 not    a   single extraordinary           ray is intercepted.             The construction of
 an eye-piece          to satisfy these conditions              would seem to give every
 requisite      desirable        in such an instrument.
     Let AB       represent        the position of the plate of

  passing in the            interior    between      AB     and       Di! would      sutler   total
  reflection    ;   no     ray beyond DB would                be     intercepted.     We wish,
  then, that no ordinary              ray entering the substance               may    make with
  the line    AB      an angle       greater   than 22°     . .  33'   : in other words,     a ray
  of light    BD     passing in the interior          ought to sutler total reflection           at
  the outer surface.               The angle      ADB,     then,       ought to have for its
  cosiue the ratio a          ;   whence

      Assuming         AC       as the   limit of      the     rhomb,       and   making       that
   coincide   with     the direction of the arete of the primary form, the whole
   instrument      is defined.         With this     eye-piece, as a matter            of course,
   there are no       separating bands perceived.
      In all of        these      enquiries the object has been to exclude the
   ordinary    and      transmit the extraordinary pencil.                    But  the converse
   question may also be proposed.
      At   a glance      it  is seen that no combination                 similar to that which
    we have been        considering can supply the requisite conditions.                        We

extraordinary ray interior to the glass would suffer                           total reflection

needless here to go over them.
   The importance of the eye-piece                     as an   instrument for experimental
research,     entitles        it   to   a   strict and minute analysis,          that we may
call into action the full development of its powers, and thus make
sure of losing none of the benefits which                      it   promises   to confer.

                      Note on Dr Sang's Paper.                     By Prof. Tait.
                                      (Read November 23, 1891.)
          At the       very urgent request of the late Dr Sang, who regarded the
   above           paper as one of his chief contributions to science,                  I brought
   Taefore          the  Council of the Society the question of its publication.
    From          the Minute-Book        of  the Ordinary Meetings,          I  find that it was
    read on the 20th February 1837, though it is not mentioned in the
    published Proceedings of that date. On 21st July 1891 the Council
     finally resolved that the paper should be printed in the Proceedings
     " if otherwise found desirable." The reasons in favour                           of printing
     it seem to outweigh those which may, readily enough,                               be   raised
      against such a         course.
            The subject      is one   with which,       except    of course in its elements,
      I      have     long    ceased    to    be   familiar.      But, from       the   imperfect
      examination          which    I   have      found     leisure to make,        I have come
      to the following conclusions.
             The paper contains       a  very important suggestion which (one would
       have thought)           should     have     been forthwith        published,      whatever
       judgment might be passed on the rest of the work                        : — viz.,  the pro
       posal to construct the polariser of two glass prisms,                     separated     by a
        thin layer, only,        of Iceland spar.          In view of     the scarcity     of this
        precious substance,        such a suggestion         was obviously of great value.
             I am    not sufficiently acquainted with the early history of the Nicol
        prism to bo able to pronounce on the question                     of Dr Sang's claim
         to priority in the explanation of its action :            —  but he told me that he
         believed himself to have been the first to demonstrate                 that the separa
         tion effected was due to the total reflection                  of the ordinary ray.
         And it is quite certain that, long subsequent                 to 1837, various very
         singular attempts at explanation               have been given in print.              The
          inventor, himself,      seems     to have      thought     that the effect of his
          instrument was merely to "increase the divergency" of the two rays.
              The numerical error which             Dr Sang      has pointed out in Mains'
           work seems to have been a slip of the pen only, as the minutes and
           seconds of the angle     in question are correctly given.            He supplies no
           reference to the passage,      but   I  find  it in  the list of calculated      angles
           at p. 12")   of the Th&orie     de la Double Refraction.              It cannot    be a
           mere  misprint, because the supplement is given along with the angle,

and       is affected       by the corresponding                         error.            But   I    do     not think
that Dr Sang's further remark is justified, as Malus not                                                     only give?
the correct       expression              for the cosine of the angle in question, bnt
seems to have           employed                in his subsequent                 calculations the  inclina
tion of the axis to              a    face, not to an                  edge,      of the crystal : — and h<?
gives the accurate numerical value of this quantity, as deduced                                                          from
Wollaston's measure of the angle between two faces.
     There is an altogether unnecessarily tedious piece of analysis                                                             in

and it is so even although he shortens it by the introduction                                                        of       the
terribly       significant clause                "after       repeated            simplifications."                  I    will
give below what              I   consider to be a natural and obvious mode of
dealing with the question (one which, besides, leads to some elegant
          —           I
results) : but have reproduced Dr Sang's manuscript as if ica* read,
for the circumstances                     of the present                publication              seem       to require
literal accuracy.            Dr Knott             has     kindly verified for                me the agreement
of my final equation              with that of Dr Sang.
     In   p. 331, above,         it   is clear that, since S is a point on the spheroid,
we may put

Hence the general relation between                              K      and     S,     i.e., between         <j>   and    v,   is

Also, since the angle BOS                        is   to be   a      maximum,

Differentiating the first equation, and eliminating                                         d\f>/dv   between the

 On the Extension of Brouncker's Method to the Com
           parison of several Magnitudes.                             By Edward Sang,
            T.L.D.
                                  '(Head December        15,   1800.)
      1  n the paper on this subject, printed in the twenty-sixth                       volume
 of the Society's Transaction,*,                the general         principles   only of this
 extension         were    explained    ;   since   then       the   subject has lain aside.
 An accident            has   drawn     attention to the use uf this method                   for
 determining           cube-roots,   and particularly in regard to the duplication
 of the cube.             The consideration of              this    matter has    led to     the
 observation of certain relations which deserve to be recorded.
       Here      we have to compare         three quantities which are in continued
  geometrical progression.                From    the greatest         of these we deduct
  multiples of the others to obtain                 a   fourth magnitude or remainder
  less than the least of the preceding                    ;  leaving oil now the greatest,
  we treat the remaining three                  quantities in the same way, and                so
   proceed until the remainder               become       insignificant or, in the case of
   commensurables,          become zero.
        In    the former explanation          the three quantities were arranged               in
   the    order     of decreasing      magnitude, and            the second     was taken as
   often as possible         from the first before            the subtraction of the third
   was attempted, and the three i[uantities in hand remained arranged in
   the order of decreasing           magnitude.
        For the sake of illustration             we may take          the case of the cube-
   root of 2, in which ease wo have the three quantities                              jj'2  and
    1, to be     compared.       Expressing tliern numerically, we have
                                        1.087401      1  =  A,

                                        1.0000000        =  c.
        •The   second of these deducted         onrr,   from the first leaves     a remainder
    less than      the third,    therefore we write A              = 1.B +  0.C +  D, leaving
    1) =   .3274801.        Treating       B,  C,    D       in   the   same   way    we   find

comparing C, D, E, we find that D may be taken thrice                     from    C,
and   we get    C =  3.D + 0.E + F, leaving        F= 175597; and thus           the
work proceeds,     as  shown in the accompanying scheme : —

                                21 =  S.
    In  the work so carried on, there          is no appearance      of recurrence
 among the quotients, such as is seen when two quantities are compared
 for the purpose       of finding    tho    square-root.       But here   we   have
 followed the piirely arbitrary rule of making               as  many subtractions
 as possible of the second from the first of the three quantities.              We
 might have written,
                                C  = 2.D+     l.E + F
 or                             C=1.D     +  2.E +   F,
 or even                        C  = 0.D + 3.E +     F  .
     In  such  case we     should have a change           in  the sequence   of the
  quotients, but any of these, if continued to exhaust the absolute
  numbers    proposed,     would    necessarily    result in reproducing      those
  very numbers.

    We have to enquire how often D may be contained in C.                                                                    Now          the
    quotients among them are not affected by any other alteration in value,
 provided they be all changed in the same ratio; therefore, exactly                                                                        as
 in     the       analogous             well-known                  operation                for square-roots,                 we seek
 some multiplier                    which may render D rational.                                             This multiplier i*
    evidently 4/4 + 4/2                  + 1,      and the new proportionate values of C,                                             D, E
    become        C=        4/4 + 4/2 + 1, D'
                                                                  =     4/2,   E'      = 1.          Here we observe that
    D' is contained in                         + 4/2 twice, while                        E'        is contained           in      1   once,
    wherefore           we write C' =               2.D'+ l.E' + F' giving F'=                                  */4- $2;                  an l

 again, we              see       that the E', F', G' are transcripts of the previous

I   hose of D and                 E in       the ratio of               $2 -1:1; while those of H and                                       I
are again less in the same ratio,                                      so thai the series D, F, H

   Here the new column is headed          by the triple of the sum     of tl.e
numbers in the previous column      :   and the rest of the    column is got
by adding the doubles of the adjoining figures.
   Thus it seems that the comparison of several            quantities in  con
tinued proportion leads      us to this     general conclusion that,      if    r
be the nth root of a number or of a rational fraction, and             if the
powers of

approximately    proportional   inversely     to  the  values  of the surds
themselves  : the approximation       being closer    as  the index   of   tlie
power is augmented.
