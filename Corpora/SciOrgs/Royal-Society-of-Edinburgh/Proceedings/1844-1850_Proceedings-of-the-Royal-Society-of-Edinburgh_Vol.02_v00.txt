    Sir T. M. BRISBANE,              Bart., President, in the Chair.
    The following Communications            were read     : —
1.  Account of the late Earthquake at Demerara.                   By W. H.
      Camphell, Esq. Communicated by M. Ponton, Esq.
2.  On the Existence of an Electrical Apparatus in the Flapper
      Skate and other Rays. By James Stark, M.D., Fellow
      of the Royal College of Physicians, Edinburgh.
     The author, after noticing the fishes in which          an electrical ap
 paratus had been      discovered, stated that,     with    the exception    of
 Geoffroy    St Hilaire,  no writer had endeavoured     to shew that Skates
possessed electrical organs.        The organ to which that writer al
luded, the author regarded as nothing else than muciparous ducts,
identical with the very same organs in the Torpedo, and quite
distinct from the electrical      organs.    The circumstance was then
mentioned which directed       the  author's attention to the tail of the
skate, and led   him to  suppose that an electrical organ might exist in it.
    On removing the skin from the tail of a Flapper Skate, an organ
was discovered occupying the place of the lateral muscles, extend
ing from near the base to the very tip of the tail, and possessing
all the anatomical characters of the electrical apparatus of fishes.        It
was about 14 inches in length, and about      half  an inch in diameter for
nearly one-half of its length ; was composed of columns or four-sided
membranous tubes, about the twelfth of an inch in diameter, divided
   VOL.   TI.                                                   A

                                          2
   by  cross   membranous septa into compartments          varying from the
  twentieth to the thirtieth of an inch in diameter.         These compart
  ments were filled with a transparent gelatinous matter.        The columns
  were so arranged as to form layers, which, on a transverse sec
  tion, were seen to have     a concentric    arrangement, but on a longi
  tudinal section, were seen to form hollow cones placed one within
  the other.     This arrangement allowed about three-fourths of the
  wide extremity     of every cone-shaped layer to come in contact with
  the skin.
      The microscope    shewed the walls of the columns and        their  cross
 septa to be composed       of  dense   fibrous and filamentous     tissue, on
 which the blood-vessels      and nerves were minutely ramified.           The
 gelatinous matter which filled the compartments was seen to be com
 posed of very minute cells, the walls of which were composed of a
 fine transparent membrane, over which the nerves were seen to
 ramify in the most      beautiful  manner.      The interior of   these   very
 minute transparent cells was filled with a transparent jelly.
      A  rough chemical examination shewed the organ to be composed
 principally of gelatine, and in small part of albumen. No fibrin was
 observed in it.
      The organ   was supplied   with nerves from three   sources,  viz., from
 the lateral branch of the eighth pair, and from the anterior and pos
 terior caudo-spinal nerves.
     This organ did not exist in equal development in every species
 of Ray.      In most of them it was merely rudimentary, not being
thicker than a crow-quill or common pen, and consisted of only four
 or five columns, similarly divided into cells by cross membranous
septa.
      The author formed the conclusion that this      was an electrical ap
paratus from the following         purely anatomical   considerations, as he
had not an opportunity       of ascertaining the occurrence of electrical
discharges    from  the  organ by an examination of living specimens.
     1. The structure of the organ was the same as that of the
electrical apparatus of the Torpedo and Electrical Eel — consisting of
membranous tubes or columns arranged in layers, each column being
divided into distinct compartments filled with a gelatinous fluid.
     2. All the layers of tubes communicated with the skin, and that
skin was abundantly supplied with mucus.
     3. The organ was supplied not only with spinal neryes, but with
the descending branch of the eighth pair, which, along with a branch
of the fifth pair, is the electrical nerve of the allied genus Torpedo        ;

                                           3
  whereas,     in other fishes, this nerve is solely distributed        to the in
 significant muscles which move the fin of the tail.
      4.   The microscopic structure is the same        as that of the electrical
 organs    of the Torpedo and Electrical Eel.
    5.    The chemical constitution       is the same as that    of the electrical
 organs of the Torpedo,         consisting   of  gelatine  and albumen,     but no
 fibrin.
    The paper         was  concluded with      a  few  remarks on the probable
 uses to    the Rays of an electrical organ ; and by directing the atten
 tion of naturalists to the probable existence of electrical organs
 in many soft-bodied fresh and salt water animals, as           Polypi, Asterias,
  &c.

          Sir  GEO. MACKENZIE,                Bart., in the Chair.
    The following Communications             were read    : —
1 .  On a Possible Explanation of the Adaptation of the Eye to
       Distinct Vision at Different Distances.                   By Profes
       sor Forbes.
    The idea   suggested   in this paper, occurred to the author three
years ago, from reflecting that the destruction of spherical aber
ration in the eye might be effected by a modification of the curva
ture of the lens, as well as by the variable density which it is
known to possess,     and which has usually been accounted for as in
tended for that purpose.
    The author     considering the probability to be almost infinite
against the sphericity of the surfaces (a necessary evil in our instru
ments, but inexplicable in a natural organ), a conviction which he
afterwards found to be reduced to certainty           by  experiments which
have actually been made on the figure of the lens— he conceived
that the variable density of this part of the eye must have some other
cause.    He considered it likely that it might contribute        to the focal
adjustment of the eye in the following way : — The lens            is composed
of  coats more  firm and tenacious,     as well as more refractive, towards
the centre, and less so at the sides.         These coats    are  also nearly
spherical in the centre, forming    a nucleus     of considerable resistance.
Hence the author      supposes,  that   if the  lens be compressed in any
manner by a uniform hydrostatic pressure, it will yield most readily
in a plane at right angles to the axis of vision, and hence the lens
will   become more spheroidal, and, consequently, more refractive ;
that  is, adapted for the vision of objects at small distances.             The
hydrostatic pressure    in question   is  believed  to be conveyed     from  the
humours of the eye, between which the lens is delicately suspended,
and to originate     in the   compressing action of the muscles which
 move the eye-ball acting simultaneously on the tough sclerotic coat.
    The author thus sums up the evidence which he thinks gives pro
 bability to this explanation : —
    1. The form of the surfaces of the lens might have been such as
to correct aberration without any variation of density whatever.
But, on the contrary, it has a form which exaggerates the ordinary
 spherical aberration.      A form which, therefore, appears to bo

                                                  7
 adaptod to the        rapid variation of density in the lens, which must,
 therefore,             be presumed to have some distinct mechanical
                                                                 utility.
      2.      The effort to view near objects is accompanied in most, if not
 all persons,            by a sensible muscular effort.
     3.       This theory        is free from     the various        conclusive       objections
 urged        by Dr Young against all explanations which                    do not    turn upon
 a change           of figure of    the lens ; and    it   is also free from the difficul
 ties to the admission of            Dr Young's theory, — the muscularity of the
 lens itself.
     4.       When the lens        is reproduced, after the operation for cataract,
 the power of adjustment is greatly diminished                        or wholly lost, since
 the variable elasticity     will be wanting.
     5.       The diminution of the adjusting power of the                      eye in old age is
explained by the increased rigidity of the lens, and consequent in-
 compressibility.
     6.       The crystalline lens polarizes light in             a manner        similar   to that
 exerted by glass and other                  uncrystallized substances in a state of
 constraint, that is, possessing               unequal elasticity in different direc
 tions.
                   2.    Notice of an Ancient Beach near Stirling.
                               By Charles Maclaren, Esq.
     This          beach presents the appearance           of    a terrace, extending along
the north       of the Carse of Stirling, from the foot of Abbey
                        side
Craig westward to Lecropt Church, and beyond it.       Its length is
about two miles ; its breadth, at Lecropt Church, is about 200 feet,
at Airthrey Mineral Well 900 feet, and at Airthrey Castle near
half      a   mile.        Its upper surface    is nearly a dead level in both direc
tions, except where breaches                 have been made          in   it,    by streams or
other agents.   The elevation of this surface above the Carse in
about 85 feet, and above the Forth at Stirling probably 110 feet.
Rock          is                               of Causeyhead, in the
                   seen under the terrace at the village
bed of the River Allan, at the Bridge, and at the bottom of the
acclivity under Lecropt Church.    Everywhere else the terrace seems
to consist of stratified sand and gravel, constituting  mass similar        a
in form            and materials      to our present beaches.              Its preservation
may be attributed               to the high rock of   Abbey Craig, which protected
it   from the action of the ancient tides when the sea stood at                             a   con
siderably higher level than    does at present.
                                          it      A remnant of                                    a
similar beach   seen on the south side of the Carse, about
                           is                               mile                        a
southwest from Stirling.                It   consists of    a.   hill of alluvial matter,         a

furlong south from Whitchouse Farm, and about 70 or 80 feet in
height.   A small portion of a lower terrace about 30 or 35 feet
above the Carse, is found at the southwest foot                   of the rock of Stir
ling Castle      ;                                     height is seen
                     and a portion of a terrace of the same
in connection with the higher terrace, extending for a short distance
eastward of Lord Abercromby's south gate.

 4.  On      the Cause     which     has produced         the Present Form
         and   Condition of the Earth's Surface.               By Sir George
        Mackenzie, Bart.
    The author first described, generally, the appearance of the loose
 materials covering the surface; and referred to some districts in the
 north    of Scotland, especially the central    one on the borders of   Perth
 and   Inverness shires, as demonstrating the effects of vast currents of
 water having passed over the surface.         He also referred to the valleys
of the    river Conan and its tributaries, in Ross-shire, as presenting an
epitome of all the phenomena which may be supposed to result from
a vast    flood gradually subsiding, and taking the direction of the val
leys.      He then shortly alluded to the theories proposed to account
for the present condition of the surface, which appear to resolve them
selves into the effects    of  a remote cause.
    It   being generally   admitted that the crust of the earth now         ap
pears broken, some portions having          been elevated,     and some having
sunk ; and that this breaking up of the strata, causing them to take
various positions, the broken portions being inclined at different
angles,     some being vertical ; and that    this dislocation of the strata
is observed     everywhere;     it is obvious that a tremendous force must
have been exerted to produce these           effects.     The elevation of the
former ocean      bottom, and the sinking of much of the former land,
would occasion      an agitation of the waters such as would have caused
the waves to overtop      the mountains ; and as the waves subsided cur
rents would have       been directed with great       violence through  all the
valleys, sufficient to produce all the phenomena we observe, except
those which may be fairly attributed to a subsequent gradual rising
of the land, and to partial convulsions.
    Sir George       concluded by     observing that,      probably, Man had
not     appeared on the earth previous              to the great convulsion
by which the order of the strata had been so greatly disturbed ;
for, besides no human fossil remains having yet been found, man,
without such disturbance of the rocks, could not have enjoyed what
external nature offers to his senses, nor have discovered the minerals
and    organic remains which have contributed so much to his wealth
and comfort, as well as to the noblest exercise of his mental faculties.

1. Some Account         of the Magnetic Observatory at Makerstoun,
      and of the Observations made there.                   By J. A. Broun,
      Esq. Communicated by Sir T. M. Brisbane, Bart.
   The observatory is situated        on    a rising ground forming the left
bank of the Tweed, and is at a        distance of about fifty yards from the
Astronomical      Observatory.     It  is  built of wood  ;  copper nails were
used, and all iron carefully excluded from the building.
   The plan of the observatory is rectangular, 40 feet long by 20
broad : it is divided into one large room to the north, 40 feet by 12,

                                           11
 and two   ante-rooms       to the south, with the lobby and entrance doors
 between.
    The magnetometers and telescopes in the observatory are placed on
 stone pillars of about 20 inches diameter, having good foundations,
 and  being completely disconnected with the floor, so that no tremor
can be communicated to the instruments by walking past them.
    The instruments in the observatory are of two classes, Magnet-
ical and Meteorological.
    Belonging      to   the former     class,   there are,    1.  The Declination
Magnetometer,          used   for determining       the  variations   and absolute
values  of the angle formed by the astronomical and magnetic meri
dians.     2. The Bifilar Magnetometer, by means of which the varia
tions of the horizontal         component of the earth's magnetic force are
obtained.       3.  The Balance Magnetometer, which gives the varia
tions  of the vertical component. 4. The Inclinometer, used for ob
taining the magnetic dip, or the angle formed by the direction of the
earth's total intensity, and a horizontal plane, namely, in the mag
netic meridian.          5. An extra Declinometer in a small wooden build
ing, at   a   distance from the observatory,          is used for obtaining the
absolute    value of the horizontal        component of the earth's magnetic
force, according to the method of Gauss.
    The   second class of instruments         is the Meteorological.
    These are, — 1, The Barometer, a standard by Newman,                  similar to
that belonging        to the    Royal Society.       The  tube is 0-552 inches    in
diameter.
    2. Thermometers.           The dry and wet bulb thermometers, by Messrs
Adie and Son, are placed on a revolving wooden frame opposite one
of the north windows.              They are always read from within the
observatory, the frame being moved by means of cords and pullies.
Maximum and minimum register thermometers, by Adie and Son, are
placed on the north side of the observatory.                Self-registering black
bulb thermometers, for solar and terrestrial              radiation, are placed in
an enclosed      space at a distance from the observatory.
    3. Anemoscope and Anemometer.
    4. The Rain-Gauge.
    In 1841 and 1842, daily observations              were made at the      Gottin-
gen hours of 8 and 11 a.m., and 2 and 5 p.m.                  ;  in 1843    at 6, 8,
10, a.m.    ;  Noon   ;   2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, p.m.       Another observation    was
made at 11 a.m., after           October    1843; in 1844, at every hour of
the   twenty-four;       and this system is being continued in 1845.
    The instruments         observed  at these hours were, the declination, the

                                         12
  horizontal    force, and vertical force, magnetometers,-M;he barome
  ter, its height and temperature. —the dry and wet bulb external
  thermometers, and the thermometers of the two force magnetometers.
  To these were added observations of the weather.
      The magnetic inclination, or dip,       has been observed since the com
  mencement,      with a few exceptions, twice a-week.
      Since  July   1841,   the monthly periods, named Terms, have been
  regularly kept.      The terms are periods of twenty-four        hours, which
  occur once a-month,       on days previously       agreed upon, and during
  which simultaneous observations of the magnetometers are made in
  all the magnetic observatories.        At present, the three magnetome
  ters are observed every five minutes of the 24 hours, meteorological
  observations being made hourly.           In  this way, each term produces
  388 observations of each magnetometer, comparable with the obser
 vations made at the same instant in the other observatories.
     Finally,    observations for the absolute       declination   and absolute
 horizontal    intensity   of the earth's    magnetism have been made as
 regularly as possible at different periods of the year.
     The second class of observations is irregular, and comprise all
 those observations     of phenomena which are irregular in their             pe
 riods.    The    most important of this class are the extra magnetic         ob
 servations.      Whenever the magnets are found to have assumed posi
 tions differing unusually from those at the previous observations, they
 are watched, and      if found    to be moving, extra observations are im
 mediately commenced.           When the disturbance is moderate, the three
 instruments     are observed every five minutes, as on term days          ; if it
 be considerable, an instrument is observed every minute.
     Much    attention has been paid to the magnetic disturbances in
 1844.      Upwards    of 60,000 extra-readings         of the magnetometers
having been made         in that year, giving about 25,000 mean posi
tions.
     The aurora borealis     is as carefully observed as due attention to the
magnetic disturbance with which it has here been found invariably
accompanied, will allow.         Attention is paid to the measurement and
description of halos, parhelia, and paraselenee.
    The reductions are at present in a considerable state            of forward
ness ; and it is expected that the volume for 1843            will  be  ready to
place in the printer's hands as soon as thai for           1841 and 1842 is
issued.

  2.  Description of a Sliding Scale for Facilitating the Use of
      the Moist-bulb Hygrometer.                By James Dalmahoy, Esq.
     The instrument     described in the paper is made of German silver,
  and is about a foot    in length, and   T3ff of an inch in breadth      ; along
  the middle of it   there is a groove for a slider.       On the right edge
  of the groove is engraved a scale of inches, and on the left the de
 grees of temperature from 0° to 85° Fahrenheit, each being placed
 exactly opposite that point of the- scale of inches which measures the
 corresponding tension of vapour.          On the left edge of the slider is
 engraved    a scale  of equal parts,   each       of an inch ; on the right
 edge,   and having the same zero, is a vernier, applicable to the scale
 of inches.     The lines on these scales are ten times larger than those
 which the symbols in the dew-point formula represent, but their nu
 merical designations are not changed.
     The instrument is      to be used as follows   : — Find   on the slider the
 number which expresses the difference            between the indications       of
 the dry and moist bulb thermometers, and           bring it opposite the num
 ber on the     left scale,   denoting the temperature of the moist-bulb;
 then zero on the slider will indicate, on the left scale, the tempera
 ture   of the dew-point ; and on the right scale,          the corresponding
 force of vapour.
     The paper concludes       by  shewing    that the ordinary     hygrometric
 formula, which suggested the idea of the sliding scale, indicates also
 a geometrical construction for finding the temperature and tension
 of vapour at the dew-point, which, however, would not be practically
 applied with convenience.
 3.   Account of Experiments to Measure the Direct Force of
        the Waves of the Atlantic and German Oceans.                           By
        Thomas Stevenson. Communicated by David Stevenson,
        Esq,
     The author has attempted to supply a great desideratum in the
 practice of marine engineering, by instituting a series of experiments
 to  ascertain what force the waves exert against opposing barriers.
     For this purpose he suggests, in some peculiar situations, the use
of columns     of water or of air, by which the force of each wave can
be   ascertained ; in the one case by the rise of the water-column,, or
in the other by a pressure-gauge,         shewing the same result in atmo
spheres by compression.           But in all the observations as yet made
he has used an instrument which may bo termed a
                                                              "
                                                                self-registering

                                            14
Marine Dynamometer."                 This dynamometer             is contained in an iron
cylinder, which is fixed to the rock where the experiments are to be
made.    The instrument consists of a plate or disc attached to a
powerful spring, which is lengthened by the action of the waves.                        In
graduating     the instrument,         the pressure required             to lengthen   the
spring,    given quantity is ascertained by loading the disc with
           a
weights, so that when the quantity that the spring has yielded by
the action of the sea is known, the pressure due to the area exposed
is known also.        The   employed varied from 3 to 9 inches in
                            discs
diameter, and the resistance of the springs from about 10 lb. to
about 50 lb. for every £ inch of elongation.  With a view to check
the results, three instruments,       of very different powers of springs,
were besides placed each      other on an exposed rock, for a space of about
six months, and the results were found to                     be remarkably   concordant
As the action of a wave may be supposed                       to combine the effects   of   a
sudden impact with a subsequent continuous pressure, an objection
might be urged against estimating these effects statically ; and the
author has accordingly made some remarks relative to this subject,
which it is not, however, necessary              here to state.
   The results obtained are,           up            in number, and
                                            to this date, 260
these embrace a continuous register of the agitations of the Atlantic
(as ascertained at the Skerryvore Rocks, Argyllshire,) for the last
22 months ; together with a later train of similar observations, on
the German Ocean, made at the Bell Rock Lighthouse.                             The fol
lowing is a digest of the results obtained                :   —
                                    Atlantic     Ocean.
  Average of results for            5 summer months, during the years 1843
and 1844, is 611 lb. per square foot.
   Average of results for 6 winter months during the same years
is 2086 lb. per square foot, or thrice as great as in the summer
months.
  Greatest result yet obtained at Skerryvore,                       being on the 20th
December 1844, is 4335 lb. per square foot.
                                    German Ocean.
   Greatest result yet obtained at the Bell Rock, being on the 9th
October  1844, is 3013 lb. per square foot.
   The greatest effect of the sea, which has been observed,    there           is,
fore, that of the Atlantic, which    equal to about
                                            is       tons per square 2
foot.
   There   are also few observations (made in April and June 1842)
                      a
upon the Irish Sea, on the coast of Kirkcudbright, but the weather

                                     15
was unfavourable    for such observations   ; the highest result was 840 lb.
on a    square   foot.    The communication concludes with an ac
count of several Instances of the effects of the waves in the eleva
tion of spray, and in the transportation of heavy masses of rock.
The greatest observed elevation of spray was at the Bell Rock
Lighthouse, on the 20th November 1827, during a calm with a
ground    swell.    On this occasion the spray was projected to the
height of 106 feet, which shews the existence, on the large scale, of
a pressure of about 3 tons.         The pressure which projected this
column of spray exceeds, therefore, the greatest result obtained by
the  Marine Dynamometer.       The largest      stone that  is mentioned in
the  paper,   as having been    moved    by the sea, is 42 tons weight.
This stone, which is on the shores of one of the Hebrides, was seen
to move under the influence of each wave.

     The following Communications          were read   : —
 1.   On   a  Peculiar Modification of the Doubly Refracting
        Structure of Topaz.      By Sir D. Brewster, K.H.
    While examining, in polarised light, some of the crystals which
 he had discovered   in Topaz, the author observed certain optical phe
nomena, depending on a peculiarity of structure.       This peculiarity is
 manifested either inthedepolarisation  of light, when it gives rise to four
quadrants of light, separated by the radiiof ablack rectangular cross si
milar to the central portion, or the tints of the first order in the uni-
axal system of polarised rings, or in the unequal refraction of com
mon light, which gives rise to the mirage of a luminous point, in the
form of concentric circles surrounding the centre of force.        In every
case there was found a quadrangular cavity in the centre of the in
tersection of the cross, generally dark and opaque, but in one case
having a luminous spot in the centre.        These cavities are from the
jjsVff to the T<yVo of an m°h m diameter.
    These cavities are quite distinct from all those formerly described
by the author    ; and from the phenomena      above  described, he con
cludes that the contents of each cavity have exerted an elastic force
on the surrounding     mineral while in a plastic state.    In  some cases
fissures are seen proceeding from the central cavities, but these are
supposed    to have been produced after the mineral had become indu
rated, and had already been subjected, in the plastic        state, to the
pressure or force above indicated.
    These cavities never accompany the cavities with two fluids, but
occur in specimens containing numerous embedded           crystals,   differ
ing little from Topaz in refracting power.
    Since the mineral must have been plastic when it yielded to the
pressure here noticed, it cannot have been formed by the aggrega
tion of molecules having the primary form of the crystal.
    These considerations, along with others connected with the crys
tals, which occur in the cavities of Topaz, have led the author to
adopt the idea of a new and peculiar kind of crystallization,      to which
he will soon direct attention.

2.   Extracts from Letters to the General Secretary, on the
        Analogy of the Structure of some Volcanic Rocks with
        that of Glaciers. By C. Darwin, Esq., F.R.S. Specimens
         were exhibited.        With Observations       on the same sub
        ject, made by Professor Forbes.
     " I  take the liberty of addressing you, knowing how much you
are interested on the subject of your discovery of the veined struc
ture of glacier ice.      I have a specimen    (from Mr Stokes's collection)
of Mexican obsidian,         which, judging from your description, must
resemble, to a considerable degree, the zoned ice.            It is zoned with
quite straight parallel lines, like an agate ; and these zones, as far
as   I  can see under the microscope, appear entirely due to the greater
or lesser number      of excessively minute, flattened air cavities.      I  can
 not avoid suspecting that in this case, and       in many others, in which
 lava of the trachytic      series (generally of very imperfect    fluidity)  are
 laminated, that the structure is due to the stretching of the mass or
 stream     during its movement, as in the ice-streams of glaciers.
                                                                           * * *
     "  If the subject of the lamination of volcanic rocks should interest
 you,    I would   venture to ask you to refer to p. 65—72 of my small
 volume     of  '
                  Geological Observations on Volcanic Islands.'*         I  there
     * The laminated, volcanic rocks of Ascension,       consist, as described
 by Mr Darwin, of excessively thin, quite parallel layers of minute crystals
 of quartz (determined by Professor Miller) and diopside ; of atoms of an
 oxide of iron, and of an amorphous, black angitic mineral ; and, lastly,
 of a more or less pure feldspatbic stone, with perfect crystals of feldspar
 placed lengthways. The following is a portion of the passage referred to :
 — " Several causes appear capable of producing zones of different tension
 in masses semiliquified by heat.      In a fragment of devitrified glass I have
 observed layers of sphaerulites, which appeared, from the manner in
  which they were abruptly bent, to have been produced by the simple
  contraction of the mass in the vessel, in which it cooled. - In certain
  dykes on Mount iEtna, described by M. Elie de Beaumont, as bordered
 by alternating bands of scoriaceous and compact rock, one is led to sup
  pose that the stretching movement of the surrounding strata, which ori-
           produced the fissures, continued, whilst the injected rock remained
  finally
    uid.   Guided, however, by Professor Forbes's clear description of the
  zoned structure of glacier ice, far the most probable explanation of the
  laminated structure of these feldspathic rocks appears to be, that they
  have been stretched, whilst slowly flowing onwards in a pasty condition,
  in precisely the same manner, as Professor Forbes believes, that the ice
  of moving glaciers is stretched and fissured.      In both cases, the zones
  may be compared to those in the finest agates ; in both, they extend in
  the direction in which the mass has flowed, and those exposed on the
  surface are generally vertical. In the ice, the porous laminee are rendered

 throw out the idea,      that the structure     in question may perhaps        be
explained by your views on the zoned structure of glacier ice, the
layers of less tension being, in the case of the Ascension obsidian-
rocks, rendered apparent, chiefly by the crystalline and concretionary
action superinduced in them, instead of, as in zoned ice, by the con
gelation of water.
                                     *               *               *
     " How   singular   it at first appears, that your discoveries in the
structure of glacier ice should explain the structure, as         I  fully believe
they will, of many volcanic masses.           I, for one, have for years been
quite confounded whenever        I  thought of the lamination of rocks which
have flowed in a liquified       state.    Will your views throw any light
on the    primary laminated rocks       ?    The  laminae  certainly seem very
generally parallel to the lines of disturbance and movement.                   Be

    To Professor Forbes.
     Professor Forbes confirmed the previous remarks by others, made
by himself on the specimens transmitted to him by Mr Darwin, and
on specimens from Lipari and Iceland in the collection of the Royal
Society, as well as by direct observations            made   by himself on the
lava streams of iEtna.
distinct by the subsequent congelation of infiltrated water ; in the stony
feldspathic lavas by subsequent crystalline and concretionary action.
The fragment of glassy obsidian in Mr Stokes's collection, which is zoned
with minute air-cells, must strikingly resemble, judging from Professor
Forbes's description, a fragment of the zoned ice ; and if the rates of
cooling and the nature of the mass had been favourable to its crystalliza
tion, or to concretionary action, we should here have had the finest pa
rallel zones of different composition and texture. In glaciers, the lines of
porous ice and of minute crevices seem to be due to an incipient stretch
ing, caused by the central parts of the frozen stream moving faster than
the sides and bottom, which are retarded by friction. Hence, in glaciers
of certain form, and towards the lower end of most glaciers, the zones
become horizontal.       May we venture to suppose that, in the feldspathic
lavas with horizontal laminse, we see an analogous case ?           All geologists
who have examined trachytic regions have come to the conclusion, that
the lavas of this series have possessed an exceedingly imperfect fluidity ;
and as it is evident that only matter thus characterized would be subject
to become fissured, and to be formed into zones of different tensions,
in the manner here supposed, we probably see the reason why augitic
lavas, which appear, generally, to have possessed a higher degree of
 fluidity, are not, like the feldspathic lavas, divided into laminse of differ
 ent composition and texture. Moreover, in the augitic series, there
 never appears to be any tendency to that kind of concretionary action,
 which, we have seen, plays an important part in the lamination of
 rocks of the trachytic series, or, at least, in rendering that structure ap
 parent."

3.  Professor Forbes then read the following Letter from
       Professor Gordon, of Glasgow, also on the subject of
       the Viscous Theory of Glaciers.
                                                    Glasgow, January    31. 1845.
    *    *     *     When you requested me to give you a memorandum of
what   appeared to me to be the very glacier-like motion and appearance
of Stockholm pitch flowing from a barrel,            I considered my observation
to have been too casual to be worth            writing, and having foreseen that
I  could arrange an experiment at Gateshead in the beginning of the
year,   I delayed       giving you the memorandum you wished.                I  had
hoped to have been able to inspect and report on my experiment
about this time ; but        I  cannot go to Gateshead for some time to come,
nor have     I had any report       of the progress of my pitch glacier since
the 6th    January, when I         was informed it had not moved since the
day after     I  left it, on the 28th December.          Your note of yesterday
induces me to offer you the following still perfectly vivid impressions
of the analogy between ice and Stockholm pitch.
                                                           I
    Allow me, in the first place, to mention that read your travels in
the   Alps, in May last.          That    on the  24th of June     I  spent almost
20 hours on the glaciers of the Grindewald.                    I went up by the
lower glacier, prepared with poles to prove the motion, and actually
observed a progress of about 12 inches in the course of 13 hours,
from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m.            I traced   the  " dirt  bands"   on the surface.
I  was let down into several crevasses,           one  of them to a depth of 30
feet and could trace the slaty structure of the ice.                 The alternate
clear blue thin veins, and the transition to opaque grey or even
white.      I descended      from the glacier with a much better appreciation
of the theory of glaciers than I- had had, and a strong conviction
that the facts      I  had observed, could not be otherwise accounted for
than by the mechanical theory you have given.                In  passing through
 Gateshead      in August, a broken headed barrel of Stockholm pitch at
 the Wire Hope Factory, attracted my attention.               Its general appear
 ance is represented in Fig. 1.
    A   mass     of Stockholm pitch broken from           a barrel in August (at
the time     of the observations     I am   about to mention) presented a dark-
brown colour,        a glassy lustre,    translucent edges.     The substance is
fragile,    fracture conchoidal, and very uniform.             A    mass,  Fig. 4.,
which was brought to me by the workman having charge of this
department, and which he had broken from the end of such a
stream as        I  have represented coming from the barrel, presented
generally      the same appearance as a mass broken from an entire

                                          20
barrel,* but had this remarkable peculiarity,            that there were lines
— structural      lines, a a a a— whose texture          and colour were dif
ferent from the general colour of the mass               recognisable on such
points as     6 6  6, between any two such structural lines.
    Fig 2. is an elevation of the stream of pitch, shewing pretty
nearly the dimensions and outward appearance of the stream.                  The
striated slaty structure appears here on the outside, as is more dis
tinctly (intended to       be) shewn in    Fig. 3.   There were certain well-
defined lines, and on either side of these            for some little distance,
other small lines or cracks (but not open cracks or fissures), and then
a space of smooth glassy-looking pitch.
    I  am strongly impressed with the idea, that the structural lines
 are a result     of the motion, and that they correspond with the veins
 of glaciers.       The lines incline most when the surface       is steepest, as
 at h,  Fig. 3., and are very faint and nearly horizontal at i, where
the surface of the stream is nearly so too.            I  left Gateshead with
 out having an opportunity of getting a sectional view of this stream.
 I can get no real Stockholm pitch in Glasgow, else              I  should have
 made the experiment you have incited me to attempt here.              I am, &c.

   The following Communications                were read: —
1.  On the     Existence of peculiar Crystals in the Cavities of
      the Topaz. Part I. By Sir D. Brewster.
2.  On   the Use of Colourless Ink in Writing. By Sir George
      Mackenzie.
   Many years       ago, the author had attempted to separate        the com
ponent parts of common          ink, with the view to get rid of its incon
venience     in soiling   everything with which it eame in contact, by
committing some of the parts to paper, and some to the pen. Work
ing with solutions, he found that, in all his trials, the paper was,
sooner or later, discoloured more or less, so         as to  unfit it for the
market, and he abandoned          the attempt. He afterwards tried salts of
iodine,   but  failed  to  fix the colour which they yielded.      After an
other interval, the subject again recurring, he was led, by an acci
dental    circumstance, to think he might attain the long sought-for
object by using dry powders for the paper, instead of solutions. The
first  trial satisfied him that        he was,  at length, to succeed ; and,
after persevering a considerable time, he brought certain processes
so far as to yield good paper.             With an almost colourless ink,
prepared     with permuriate of iron, traces were instantaneously pro
duced,   dark enough for ordinary purposes.          The powder introduced

diluted with rice flour, that enough, and no more of the powder than
enough, remains among the fibres of the paper.          The paper is sized
before being passed through the machine,      and  is  afterwards finished
in the usual manner.         Specimens of different qualities of paper
were laid on the table, and written on with the colourless ink by the
members present.
 3. On the Use        of Metallic Reflectors for Sextants, and on
       the Determination of the Errors arising from Non-
       Parallelism in the Mirrors and Sun-Shades of Reflect
       ing Instruments, By John Adie, Esq.
    The object of this communication was to shew that, by the use of
 metallic   reflectors for sextants, greater accuracy was obtained in
 the observed    angles, and also that larger  angles could be observed.
 Objects were seen reflected by metallic       mirrors, which could not
 be seen when glass was used ; and that when the alloy was formed
 of pure metals, it was not subject to rust or tarnish, even when
 exposed to action of the sea air.
    The author then exhibited a sextant fitted with these mirrors,
 which had been employed for a season in the survey of the north
 coast of Scotland, under Mr Mossman, and read extracts of letters
 from that gentleman.
    In   the second    part, he describes methods by which the non-
 parallelism in mirrors and shades may be determined with great
 accuracy, before they are applied to reflecting instruments.

    The following Communications            were read       : —
1.   On the Existence of peculiar Crystals in the Cavities of
       Topaz.     Part    II.   By Sir D. Brewster,           K.E
    The author, after alluding to his former papers on the fluids in
topaz, described, in Section I., the form and position of the strata in
the minerals in which the cavities occur.           They generally occur in
immense     numbers,     occupying   extensive    strata,    and injuring     the
transparency of the mineral.          These   strata occupy every possible

                                        24
 position, and have every possible curvature ; their shape is equally
 irregular ; and it is probable that, in every case, some edge or angle
 of the stratum touches the surface. The cavities are sometimes con
 centrically arranged, and sometimes occur in parallel straight lines.
 In one specimen, they radiate from a centre. -When different strata
 occur in the same specimen, they generally differ in the character of
 the cavities, one stratum containing flat, another deep cavities, &c.
 The whole facts lead to the conclusion, that the strata of cavities
 have been formed under the influence         of forces propagated through
 a plastic mass,   carrying   with  them gases and vapours, which came
 to a position   of rest previous to the crystallization of the mineral.
 In  Section  II.  the author   describes some     new observations    on the
 two fluids   formerly    discovered    by him.     In   some   cases  of flat
 cavities, the faces   of which are parallel to the planes of       easy clea
 vage, the application    of heat forced the fluid between the      laminae of
the crystal    to a distant part.     In   one  specimen, a white ball was
 seen to be projected from one cavity to the edge         of the specimen,  as
 in a case formerly described.       In other specimens, where the dense
fluid was accompanied by a bubble of some gas, the application of
heat increased the size of the bubble, which then threw off a smaller
to a distant spot.     On cooling, the latter disappeared, and the former
recovered its original size.       Apparently the gas was here absorbed
by   the liquid  on  cooling.   While the bubble expanded by heat, the
liquid was forced into minute tubes or slits, from which, on cooling,
it returned.     In Section   III.  he described the form and position of
the crystals in the cavities of topaz.            They are both fixed and
moveable, and often beautifully formed.           They are very numerous,
and occur in several different forms, which are enumerated, a very
frequent one being the cube.           In  Section   IV.   he treated of the
physical properties of these crystals.       Many of them melt or dissolve
in the fluid in a gentle heat, others with difficulty, some not at all.
 Those which melt are commonly reproduced, on cooling, of their
original form, with modifications.          The tessular crystals have no
action on polarized     light; but there     seem to be two substances      in
this form, as some tessular crystals melted, while others were found
infusible in any heat used.          The doubly refracting crystals would
appear to be of three kinds, as some melted easily, others with dif
ficulty, others not at all.      They did not depolarize white light, or
the highest order of colours.        One crystal melted, and was repro
duced, without any fluid being present.          In another cavity, several
crystals, when heated, darted across the cavity, while others rotated

                                         25
 rapidly round their middle point.            Too strong a heat often bursts
 the cavities, separating the laminae of the topaz.          The volatile fluid,
 escaping, leaves   a crystalline    residue  ; the dense fluid disappears en
tirely, and is probably a condensed gas.           In one specimen, the faces
of the cavities formerly filled with the volatile fluid, are corroded,
as  if by a solvent, developing crystalline structure ; an appearance
analogous to that which has been observed on tho external surface
of topazes.     In  Section   V.  the author described crystals embedded
in the mass     of the topaz, some of which can only be detected by
polarized light, as they do not affect the transparency of the crystal
by common light.         He concluded by describing cavities lined with a
doubly refracting      crust or shell, with optical and crystallographies
axes — a phenomenon which has no parallel in mineralogy.                   These
cavities have the appearance           of  embedded     crystals,   but are de
tected   by depolarizing     a uniform     tint with  a variable    thickness of
crystal.
2. On the      Extraction of pure Phosphoric Acid from Bones,
       and on a New and Anomalous Phosphate of Magnesia.
       By Dr Gregory.
    The author, after explaining the methods            hitherto   proposed    for
purifying the phosphoric acid of bone earth,           and pointing out their
inconveniences, mentioned that the chief difficulty was the separa
tion of the magnesia always present in bone earth.                 The lime, it
has been for some time known, may be entirely removed by means
of sulphuric     acid.    In  repeating the process of Liebig, which did
not succeed in his hands, and which requires the use of alcohol, he
found that, after the separation          of the lime, there     is obtained,   by
evaporation and heating, a clear and colourless glass, containing              all
the magnesia      : that this    glass dissolved completely by boiling in
water ; but that the solution, if again evaporated and heated to
600° for a quarter of an hour in a platinum capsule, became turbid,
and deposited the whole magnesia as an insoluble salt. When water
was added, so as to dissolve       the phosphoric 'acid, and the insoluble
salt separated by the filter, the filtered liquid was found absolutely
free from magnesia, and was a solution of pure phosphoric acid.
    The insoluble     salt of magnesia above mentioned is new.               It is
remarkable for its insolubility in water and acids ; and its composi
tion, as ascertained by several concurring analyses, is—

                                    26
                     Magnesia,                  16.54
                     Phosphoric acid,          83.46
                                              100.00
 It  contained no water, and must therefore be composed according to
 the formula, 2 My0+3 P20g.         This formula, the author shewed,
 could not be reconciled with the prevalent views of the constitution
 of phosphates, and the existence of this salt might therefore lead to
 some modification of these views.

    The following Commmunications           were read    : —
 1. On the    Improvement of Navigation in Tidal Eivers.              By
       David Stevenson, Esq.
    Three compartments are pointed out as existing in all rivers, when
viewed in connection with the sea, possessing different characteristics,
and requiring different classes of works for their improvement.
 These are,  first, The "  sea proper,"  characterised  by the presence
of unimpaired tidal phenomena, and including all works connected
with the improvement of bars.        Second, The " tidal compartment
of the river," characterised by the modified flow of the tide, produced
by the inclination of the bedr and embracing works connected with
the straightening, widening, or deepening, of the beds of rivers ; the

                                            27
 formation of new cuts         ;  the erection of walls for the guidance of
 tidal currents, and     the shutting up of subsidiary channels.                And
 the third compartment is the           "  river proper," which is characterised
 by  the absence of all tidal influence, the improvement of which is
 generally effected by means of dams erected in the bed of the river,
 and forming stretches of canal communicating                 with each other by
 means   of locks in the dams. The practical remarks are confined to
 the improvement      of the tidal compartment only, which possesses
 sufficient importance to entitle it to form the subject of a distinct
 communication ; the prosperity of the ports of London, Bristol, New
 castle, Glasgow, and many other places, being intimately connected
 with it.
    The author shews, that, owing to the smallness of the rivers of
this comparatively        narrow      country,    they  can   be    advantageously
navigated    only  while   their   waters     are deepened by    the  influx of the
 tide, and proposes, as the surest means of effecting improvement,
 such works as produce an increase in the duration              of tidal influence.
    Instances of the success of these works are given.                  The rise is
the bed of the Tay from Newburgh to Perth (8-56 miles), in con
sequence of works that have been executed, has been reduced from
four to two     feet.    The time occupied in the           passage     of the tidal
wave between these         places has been decreased          fifty    minutes, and
the speed     with which it travels increased            lj of a mile per hour.
 The duration of flood-tide at Perth has been increased fifty minutes,
and the time during which the river at that place is uninfluenced by
 the tide, has been decreased forty-Jive             minutes.     It is also calcu
lated that an additional           quantity of sea water, amounting, on an
 average,  to  760,560      tons,   is propelled into, and again withdrawn
from, that part of the river extending above Newburgh every tide.
 At the Rubble in Lancashire, similar benefits have resulted from
 similar operations    ;   the tidal      range at Preston        having been     in
 creased between three           and four feet, and the propagation           of the
 tidal wave accelerated about         forty minutes.
    The following are the practical inferences which the author draws
 from the facts brought forward           : —
    First, That owing        to the comparatively       contracted country from
 the drainage    of which our rivers derive their supplies, it is chiefly
 from increased duration of tidal influence that we must expect im
 provement in tide navigation, the regulation of the fresh water
 stream being an operation of secondary importance, but not, on that
 account, to be overlooked.

                                   28
    Second, That the whole tidal phenomena of the navigation to be
improved ought to be ascertained, in order that the engineer may be
enabled to discover in what part of the river the most prejudicial
retardations of the tidal wave, and obstructions of the current, take
place.
    Third, That, in tracing these retardations to the proper cause,
and suggesting means for their removal, works should be adopted
which do not injuriously abstract tidal water from the sea channels.
    Fourth, That the works best suited for attaining the desired end
consist chiefly in lowering the bed of the river, and removing all
natural or artificial obstructions, and in erecting low rubble     walls
for the direction of the currents.
    Fifth, That although general views of the nature of these opera
tions may be given, the precise details of such works as shall bo
best suited to particular localities can, in the present state of our
information, be determined only by Engineering experience.        And,
    Lastly, That, by the execution of works designed in accordance
with these    general  views, very beneficial  results have been,   and
may be, produced, for a comparatively small expenditure.
2. On the     Solvent Action of Drainage Water on Soils. By
       John Wilson, Esq., F.G.S. Communicated by Dr Gre
       gory.
    The author, being resident for a time in East Lothian, in order
 to study the system of agriculture, it occurred to him that the very
extensive and complete drainage must materially affect the soil by
removing large quantities of its soluble ingredients.
    He was disappointed, owing to an accident, in examining, quanti
 tatively, the water which had been first collected for the purpose ;
 but on examining, qualitatively, some that was collected after the
 drain had been running very copiously for 36 hours, he found it to
 contain 18.4 grains of soluble matter per gallon.     This was chiefly
 the usual salts of lime and organic matter.
    He examined the surface and subsoils of the field, and found
 them to contain, besides silica and alumina, iron, lime, and traces of
 magnesia, with organic matter.      The iron in the surface soil was in
 the state of protoxide, but in the subsoil it was found peroxidised.
     The author concludes that the drainage water carries off a very
 large quantity of the soluble matter of the soil, which he calculates
 as possibly amounting to   775 lbs. per  acre  in the year, a quantity

                                         29
  equivalent   to a good dose of manure.         He recommends the adoption
  of some means to prevent        this great   loss, and  promises to continue
  his  researches, and bring forward more precise results.

 1.    Observations on the Temperature of the Earth at Trevan-
      drum, in Lat. 8° 30' 32".           By John Caldecott, Esq. Re
      duced, with some Remarks, by Professor Forbes.
      The present notice is a sequel to one presented to the Royal
 Society on 1st May 1843, containing the results of Mr Calde-
cott's Observations on the Temperature of the Earth in India, made
by means of thermometers sunk to depths of 3, 6, and 12 French
feet, corresponding to those employed in the three stations near         Edin
burgh, of which the results are already before the Society.
      The position of the instruments is mentioned in the former notice
 (Proceedings, vol. i. page 432).
     A later note from Mr Caldecott,          dated   10th   August 1843,   ac
companies the detailed observations made upon the three thermome
ters    four times a-day (every 6 hours) for the whole year, from         July
1842 to July 1843, Sundays excepted.
     The most remarkable circumstance            connected   with the observa
tions, is the extraordinary        excess   uniformly observed of the earth
temperature above        the air temperature.       The index error of the in
struments is so large, as might have excited a suspicion of some in
accuracy in its determination, but for the known experience and
skill of   Mr   Caldecott.   I shall  therefore quote what his letter says on
this point.      "  The readings of the thermometers, as given in these
tables [containing the observations at large], require a correction in
order to reduce them to those of the standard             thermometer.    This
correction, derived from        a comparison of them        with the standard,

                                             30
made every two hours            for rather     more than       a  month, before they
were put into the ground, is as follows              :—
                                                                          o
    No.   1 — 12 feet       long, requires the addition of                2.133.
         2— 6                                                             2.172.

    This detail is even too minute to render a considerable mistake
at all likely ; we must therefore take the results as we find them,
which are contained in the following table, where the numbers are
all corrected, and compared with the mean temperature of the air,
and the quantity of rain.            It will be observed, that several of the
observations of the warmer months have been lost, owing to the large
index error having misled the maker as to the range which would
be required, and consequently the              spirit  rose above the scale.

              The Thermometers are corrected              for  index error.
    With    a view to deduce        more carefully the results of this curious,
and hitherto unique series of observations,                I  have had the observa
tions for the year projected in the form of curves, on the same scale
as those    formerly submitted          to the  Society, of the earth       tempera

                                           31
  tures at  Edinburgh.      These curves are now          submitted to the So
 ciety, and the results    may be thus briefly stated.
     I. The annual curve of temperature at Trevandrum                 is a very ir
 regular    one, but has  only    one  great  well-marked    inflexion,    giving a
 maximum temperature in the beginning of April, corresponding ex
 actly to the period    of commencement of the rainy          season.     The tem
 perature    of the air goes   through its whole range in the course of the
 following three months      ;   but there is no decided minimum in the an
 nual curve.
     II.   The mean annual temperature of the air appears to be under
 80°, whilst that of the earth reaches 85° — a remarkable difference.
     III.   The accidental, as well as the main annual fluctuations of
temperature of the atmosphere, are faithfully reproduced in the curve
 of temperature at a depth of three feet.           They are diminished in in
tensity, and have a slight retardation         in  point of time, not exceeding
 ten or twelve days, at the depth of three feet.
     IV.   The range    at three feet is nearly 2° greater than at the
 surface.      This is a very remarkable circumstance ; and arises ap
parently from the atmospheric maximum being prematurely checked
by the approach      of the rainy     season.
     V. At six and twelve       feet, the range is rapidly diminished, and the
casual fluctuations      almost entirely disappear, leaving maximum               in
spring well marked.        Notwithstanding       the deficiency of some of the
 maximum temperatures, it may be inferred, that the range at six feet
 is 5*° ; at twelve feet, 2|° ; the range at three feet being 8°.
     VI. The retardation of epoch is also plainly indicated, although,
from the deficiencies just mentioned,          it cannot    be so accurately de
termined.        According to the     best guess   I can   form, the three feet
maximum occurs about the 8th             April ;  the six feet maximum about
the    20th    April;   and that at twelve feet about the 11th                May;
giving     a pretty regular rate of progress       of the heat downwards, of
one foot in three and a-half or four days.
     From these facts, it is easy to deduce, generally, that the pheno
mena of the propagation of that into the ground near the equator,
resemble perfectly those in our own latitudes, though modified in
extent.      Even at   a depth of 12      French    feet,  the annual variation
has not nearly vanished, nor would so, even              approximately     at more
than douhle the depth.            Mr Caldecott's experiments conclusively
establish the error of the doctrine of Boussingault (at least in the

                                       32
 eastern hemisphere), that the annual temperature near the equator
 remains unchanged at the depth of a foot below the surface in the
 shade.    This mistake     is the more important    to correct, because  M.
 Poisson has attempted to confirm his own mathematical            theories of
 heat, by applying them to this alleged fact.*
     Mr  Caldecott's experiments appear, farther, to prove a consider
 able excess of the temperature of the earth above that of the air at
 Trevandrum.       This result is in opposition to the opinion of Kupffer,
 which supposes    the earth temperature       to be less than that of the
 air at the equator    ;  and of Boussingault,     which supposes them the
 same.
     The results of Mr Caldecott are confirmed in both particulars by
 Lieutenant Newbold, of the Madras Army, in a paper lately read to
the Royal Society of London. f
        2. Miscellaneous Observations           on  Blood and Milk.
                           By Dr John Davy.
     The author first treats of the state of combination of the alkali in
the blood.     Enderlin, from his recent analysis of the ashes of the
 blood, has inferred     that its alkaline  reaction   is not owing to the
 presence of carbonate, but of the tribasic phosphate of soda.           The
 author, even admitting the accuracy of Enderlin's results, questions
the propriety of applying them to the condition of the alkali in the
 liquid blood.    Carbonate of soda, he observes,       is decomposed   when
 heated with phosphate       of lime ; added in small quantity to blood, it
 is not to be detected in its ashes.        This may account for its not
having been found in its ashes. Were the opinion referred to correct,
an acid added to blood or its serum, after the action of the air-pump,
ought not, on re-exhaustion, to occasion a farther disengagement of
air  ; but he finds that it does.     This, with other results, induces him
to give the preference to the conclusion, that blood contains the sesqui-
carbonate of soda.
     He next considers the viscid quality of the blood particles, and
their tendency in consequence to adhere together in groups distinct
from their aggregation in piles, and to adhere as well to other objects.
Under the microscope, using the compressor, the quality in question
is still exhibited ; when a cluster of blood corpuscles is broken up,
and its parts set in motion, some of them, while adhering to each

                                            33
other, and only then, are drawn out almost to a fibre ; and yet the
instant the adhesion is broken, the detached              particles, now solitary,
recover   their circular outline.        This viscid property of the blood cor
puscles appears      to be  distinct   from    that of coagulable lymph ; lymph
being viscid, not in its liquid state, when it attenuates even the serum,
but   in its transition   state,  just before and when in the act of         coagu
lating.
    The third subject treated        of,   is the tendency of     fibrin in  coagu
lating to a certain arrangement of its particles.              In proof of this, he
adduces the instance of the investing pellicle or membrane of the
buffy-coat    ;  the tubes of the fibrin formed as a cast, when blood is
stirred with a rod in the act of coagulating.                The cyst-like cavities
occasionally     met   with  in   fibrinous     concretions,  whether filled with
 the serum or puruloid        fluid, found after death in the heart and great
 vessels  ; —m    all which a kind of nisus formativus is displayed, and
 an arrangement       more or less regular        ; and which may be applicable,
 he believes, to account for the cysts           of aneurisms speedily following
 punctured      wounds of arteries,       and for the sacs of false aneurisms,
 continuous     with, and hardly to          be distinguished    from, the    lining
membrane of the vessel.
     The last subject treated of, is the effect of serum in promoting the
 coagulation of milk — a property which serum possesses in common
 with the -white and yolk of the egg, on the application of heat. The
 results of trials of mixtures of serum and milk in different propor
 tions are stated, from which it appears, that 1 part of the former
 heated with 5 of the latter, will occasion its coagulation, and even
 when mixed with a third more.                  From analogy, the author infers,
 that serum and white of egg may have a like effect on vegetable
 juices containing albuminous matter similar to casein.                  The action
  of one animal fluid, and those         so  like as serum and milk, he refers
  to as a curious subject for speculation, and as deserving            of attention,
  not only in relation to culinary         and some manufacturing        processes   ;
  but also,   it may    be,    in connexion with physiology,           and perhaps
  pathology.

   The following communications           were read   : —
1.  On   Dr Wollaston's Argument from the limitation of the
      Earth's Atmosphere as to the Finite Divisibility of
      Matter. By Dr George Wilson.

                                       35
    The author commenced by stating         at some length, the nature of
Wollaston's argument, the object of         which was to affirm that the
limitation of the earth's atmosphere         justified the conclusion, that
the air consists of indivisible particles    or true atoms.    He then dis
cussed    the opinions which have been offered by Daubeny, Dumas,
Whewell, and others,        as to the validity of Wollaston's conclusion,
and stated that the special object      of his communication was to shew
that the inference from the existence of a limit to the atmosphere,
that matter is only finitely divisible, is quite unwarranted.
    Wollaston, he observed, had only succeeded at the utmost in
establishing,     that the atmosphere consists of a finite number of
 mutually repelling molecules, without supplying, or even offering
 any proof,   that these molecules were true atoms.        The author urged
 that the repelling molecules of the carbonic acid         and water in the
 atmosphere, are certainly not atoms, but groups of several particles ;
 and that, for anything we can prove to the contrary, the molecules of
 oxygen may be equally or even more complex ; and farther, that
 even if it could be shewn that oxygen and nitrogen are chemically
 homogeneous, it would not entitle us to assume that their repelling
 molecules were single atoms       instead of groups of several, since we
 have   no means of estimating         what  the complexity    of  a gaseous
 molecule may be.       The author concluded by stating, that Wollaston's
 argument     left the question of the finite or infinite divisibility of
 matter exactly where      it found it.
 2.   Biographical Notice of the late Professor Henderson.
        By Professor Kelland.
     In  undertaking    the task which has been      assigned me, of laying
  before the Society a brief history of the life and labours of one of
  their most valuable members,        I am influenced as much by my re
  gard for the deceased, as by my duty to the Society.           I  feel that,
  in a place where    I  am a comparative stranger,      I have lost a friend
  — a loss the greatness of which can only be appreciated by those
  who have experienced, as      I have done, the    integrity of his charac
  ter, and the warmth of his heart.        Mr  Henderson was a man whose
  every action was the dictate of a right conscience.          With society,
  his intercourse was marked by an utter want of selfishness — a rare
  characteristic   ; with his friends, it was stamped with true and un
  ostentatious kind-heartedness.        He was ready and happy, at all
  times, to lend them aid, or afford them sympathy in every difficulty,

                                        36
scientific or social.    That his eulogy has fallen to the lot of one so
little  qualified to do    it justice,  I sincerely regret ; but   I lament it
the less when     I reflect, that in other quarters it has found the able
advocacy   of my friend Mr Galloway, and that both he and myself
have had the invaluable assistance of Mr William Ivory.
    Thomas Henderson, Professor of Practical Astronomy in our
University, and Astronomer-Royal for Scotland, was born in Dun
dee on the 28th of December 1798.               His father died early in life,
leaving five children,     of whom     he was the youngest, to the care      of
his widow.      His   eldest brother    having been bred to the law, and
seeing prospects of     success before    him, destined his brother Thomas
for the same profession.        Accordingly, having received an excellent
preliminary education at the grammar school of Dundee, he was
sent, at the age of thirteen, to the academy of that town, where he
remained two years under the able tuition of the present Professor
Duncan of St Andrews.           Here he acquired the rudiments of mathe
matics and natural philosophy, in which he made              such progress as
to merit being styled by the Professor          one of the best scholars he
ever   had under his care.         Even at this time his predilection for
astronomy had developed         itself ; but it cannot be supposed that his
acquirements      sufficed to enable him to do more than manifest a
partiality towards that science.          In 1813 he was placed with Mr
 Small, writer, afterwards town-clerk of Dundee.            He now bestowed
considerable attention to the decyphering of the manuscripts, and
particularly the ancient records of the burgh.         He also laboured hard
 in the acquirement of an accurate knowledge of history and chronology,
for which his remarkably retentive memory well qualified him.               At
the age of twenty-one he repaired to Edinburgh, to pursue his legal
studies, and entered the office of Messrs J. and W. Murray, W.S.
While in their employment, an application was made to him to under
take the arrangement and classification of the Records of the Burgh,
of Dundee — a work for which         he was amply qualified, and which he
satisfactorily   performed.      His abilities and business habits      recom
mended him to the good offices of Mr Gibson-Craig, who became his
patron, and ever remained his steady friend.            At his recommenda
tion, he acted as clerk to the late Lord Eldin, both prior and subse
quent to his elevation to the Bench.          After his Lordship's resigna
tion, Mr Henderson accepted the office of secretary to the Earl of
Lauderdale, in which capacity he visited London, where he made
the acquaintance of the principal           astronomers   of the metropolis,
from whom he received great kindness.              In  particular, Sir James

                                        37
 South gave   him    access to his observatory, and thus enabled him            to
 familiarize himself with the use of instruments.
    But it is to Professor Wallace,          ever his     steady friend,    under
 whose  care the Observatory       of the Edinburgh Astronomical         Institu
tion was then placed, that he owed his rapid progress             in astronomy,
if not  his ultimate adherence to the       science.    Finding in     Mr Hen
derson a zeal for the study, and an ambition            to distinguish    himself
in  it,  Mr Wallace, with       his  accustomed disinterestedness,        unhesi
tatingly placed the Observatory at his command, and thus afforded
him the means of acquiring that practical skill for which he was
celebrated.      To this circumstance I attribute much of Mr Hender
son's   success   in astronomy.       However true it be, that talent will
develope itself in spite of obstacles, it is no less certain, that, in sciences
like this, which owe so much to the external aid of expensive instru
ments,    the fortuitous    circumstance      of an   access   to the requisite
machinery,      is a strong stimulus       to   exertion,   without  which    few
would undergo the drudgery of acquiring a mastery of the practical
details of the science.        With an observatory at his disposal, Mr
Henderson      saw the road to eminence          in practical astronomy open
before him, and he hesitated not to labour zealously to fit himself
for the walk to which his inclinations prompted him.
    As might     be supposed,   he had not long       entered on a systematic
course of reading, ere        improvements       suggested   themselves to his
acute mind.       The first which he    made public, relates to the compu
tation of an observed      occultation of a fixed star by the moon.          This
he   transmitted    to Dr Thomas Young, then secretary             to the Board
 of Longitude in 1824.          It was published by him in the Nautical
Almanac for 1827 and the four following years ; and Mr Henderson
 received   the thanks of the Board           for his communication.         This
 paper, and many others of his, were likewise inserted in the Quar
 terly Journal of Science. It is probable that the subject which
 actually brought     Mr   Henderson     into notice with astronomers, was
his detection of an error in the data furnished to            Mr Herschel for
the determination        of the difference of longitude         of London and
 Paris. His paper on this subject was published in the Philo
 sophical Transactions for 1827, and the Royal Society voted him
a copy of the Greenwich Observations, in return for his labour.
 This communication had also the effect of procuring for him the
friendship    of Mr Herschel, whose estimate of its importance is
 expressed in a testimonial which he gave Mr Henderson in 1829,
 when candidate for the chair of Practical Astronomy, in the following
    VOL. II.                                                     E

                                        38
terms   : —"   I  . . . assure you    .   . . how highly     I appreciate your
astronomical     acquirements,    especially your      habits of accurate and
scrutinizing calculation.      I have, on a former occasion, experienced
the value of this investigating spirit and laborious industry, in your
detection and correction of an error overlooked by myself in the
statement sent me from          the Royal      Observatory,    relative   to the
operations for determining the difference of longitude of Green
wich and Paris in 1825 — a correction which had the effect of
raising a result, liable to much doubt from the discordance of the
individual day's observations, to the rank of a standard scientific
datum ; and thus conferring on a national operation all the import
ance it ought to possess."
     Thus flattering  was Mr Henderson's       first connection with the Royal
 Society ; nor was his reception by the Astronomical Society less so. In
 1828, he prepared an ephemeris for 1829, of the occultations of Alde-
 baran by the moon, for      ten different     observatories in Europe.        In
return for this and other valuable communications, the Society present
 ed him with a copy of     their Transactions,       handsomely bound.
     Mr   Henderson's   reputation as an astronomer was now          fully  esta
 blished, and it was his own wish and the desire of his friends, that he
 should be placed in a situation more congenial to his favourite pur
 suit.     Two such situations presently opened ; to neither of which,
 however, was he immediately appointed.              The Town-Council of the
 city  of  Edinburgh    had  granted    to  Mr   Short,  in 1776, a lease of a
 portion of ground on the Calton        Hill,  on the condition that an Ob
 servatory should be erected on it       ;  but it was not until about forty
 years afterwards that any instruments adapted to astronomical pur
 poses were placed there, and even then the want of funds prevented
 it taking its place as an operative establishment.                Some years
 prior to the time of which we speak, a number of gentlemen
 formed themselves into a society, under the designation of the
 Edinburgh Astronomical Institution, and by their exertions pro
 cured the erection of the present building.                Having exhausted
 their funds, they applied to Government for a grant, which they
 succeeding     in obtaining.      From the want of endowment, how
 ever, the business of the observatory was somewhat irregularly con
 ducted.     In 1828, Dr Robert Blair, Professor of Practical As
 tronomy in the University of Edinburgh, died.                  The office had
 hitherto been a sinecure, and it occurred to many interested in the
  science,  that it might   be made useful by the appointment          of  a per
  son qualified to perform the duties of a practical observer ; and          that,

                                       39
 consequently, this vacancy was a favourable          opportunity for uniting
 the professorship     with the observatory.      As might      have been    ex
 pected, great exertions      were made    to place    Mr   Henderson     in the
 situation, but, for the present, ineffectually,      from the circumstance
 that the Government        had resolved to postpone any appointment,        un
 til it had been maturely considered on what footing the professorship
 could be placed, with the greatest prospect of success to the science
 of astronomy. Another opening occurred within a few months of this,
 occasioned     by the death of  Dr T. Young. Shortly before his        decease,
 he delivered to Professor     Rigaud of Oxford,     a memorandum, recom
 mending      Mr    Henderson   as his  successor    in the superintendence
 of the Nautical Almanac.         The appointment did      not take place, but
 there exists perhaps      no higher testimony to      Mr  Henderson's     merit
 than this recommendation, when it is remembered that it arose out of
 his   scientific reputation, altogether unaffected by private friendship,
 and that    Dr Young ranks among the very highest of the philoso
 phers of the present century.
     Although disappointed in the instances we have mentioned, a situa
tion shortly fell in Mr Henderson's way, which appeared likely to
establish him in a suitable manner.          On the death of Mr Fallows,
the astronomer at the Cape of Good Hope, his qualifications were
so   well known to the parties with whom the appointment lay, that
the office was offered to him without        any solicitation on his part, or
application on that of his friends.       Mr Henderson accepted the ap
pointment, and sailed for the Cape in January 1832.               Immediately
on his    arrival there,  he entered on his duties      with ardour   ;  and  so
indefatigable were his exertions that he amassed a most valuable
series of observations, and found time, besides, to prepare and trans
mit to the Royal and Astronomical           Societies, various papers con
nected     with the science.     The principal results of his labours at
the Cape were, the determination        of the latitude and longitude of his
station — of the positions of stars near the South Pole, for fixing the
polar positions of his instruments — of the amount of refraction near
the horizon     — and  of the moon's horizontal parallax ; together with
observations on the planet Mars, for the purpose of computing his
parallax, and that of the sun — of Encke's and Biela's comets — of
occultations of fixed stars by the moon      — of a   transit  of Mercury—
and    of between 5000 and 6000 declinations.           Prior  to his appoint
ment to the Cape Observatory, Mr Henderson had had slight symp
toms of a disease of the heart, and he soon found that the labours and
anxieties incident to his position, together with the serious disadvan

                                        40
tages attendant on the building          in which he was compelled to reside,
rendered it impossible that he should retain the situation.              Accord
ingly, in a letter, dated May 27- 1833, he tendered his resignation
to the Lords of the Admiralty, adding that, on his return to Eng
land, he would immediately proceed to the task of calculating and
reducing the various observations he had made, and of extracting from
them those useful results they were intended to afford.
    Amongst the other annoyances to which Mr Henderson was subject
 at the Cape, may be mentioned that, which had been the source of much
 vexation    to his predecessor, the state of the mural circle.               Mr
 Fallows had found remarkable anomalies amongst the readings of the
 several microscopes, in different positions of the instrument, during
 a revolution upon its axis ; whence          he had been led to infer that     it
 had suffered a change of figure since leaving the maker's hands. Mr
 Henderson's first employment was the rigid investigation of these
 anomalies, the results of which are printed in the eighth volume of
 the Memoirs of the Astronomical Society, p. 141.               He came to the
 conclusion, that the anomalies proceeded partly from an oval form
 which the instrument had acquired, and partly from variations in
 the position of the centre of the instrument while revolving, relative
 to the microscopes, owing probably to the pivots not being               exactly
 circular;     whilst,    in  addition,    the  whole   instrument    frequently
 changed its position upon the pier, from the Y support of the front
 pivot not being perfectly steady.           He agreed, moreover, with Mr
 Fallows in concluding, that the mean of the readings of six micro
 scopes   is  little, if  at all, affected by these causes    ; so that,  on the
 whole, it appeared that the degree of accuracy to be obtained from
 the instrument was not inferior to that given by the best instruments
 of similar construction hitherto made.            The conclusion of the mat
 ter is this  : — on   the circle being brought to this country and ex
 amined by Mr Simms, it was found that the large steel collar car
 ried by the conical axis was quite loose ; — " a child's hand could
 turn  it."
    On Mr Henderson's return          to  Edinburgh   he set about reducing his
 own observations       ;  a task voluntarily    imposed on himself, and one
 which he sacrificed his own interests to fulfil.       No long period elapsed,
 however, before a situation opened, in every way suited to his taste.
 An agreement was entered into between the Commissioners of the
 Treasury and the members of the Astronomical                Institution of this
 place, whereby the latter gave their observatory and instruments to
 the use of the Professor of Practical Astronomy in the University,

                                        41
and the former agreed to supply a salary to the Professor.         Mr Hender
son was selected as the proper person to occupy this situation        ;  and he
entered on the duties of the office in October 1834.              The value of
the observations which       he made     during the ten years he held this
appointment is too well known to        need comment.      But Mr Henderson
did not confine   himself   to the routine of Observatory duties, important
as  they are.     No    sooner   had he got the Institution into working
order, than he again vigorously attacked his Cape observations, and
laid the results before the world.         He commenced        by communicat
ing to the Astronomical Society a valuable catalogue of the mean
declinations of 172 principal fixed stars for January 1. 1837. This
 was   followed   by a memoir        on the refraction      of stars near the
 horizon,    in which he concludes, that no difference of refraction
 north and south of the zenith appears as far as to 88° of zenith dis
 tance.     Another very important communication of Mr Henderson's
was the determination of the equatorial horizontal parallax of the
 moon.      This is best effected   by the comparison     of results north and
 south of the equator.        It is well known, that to obtain it by this
 method, was one of the chief objects of La Caille's voyage to the
 Cape in the middle of the last century.          Ever alive to the interests
 of the science, Mr Henderson determined to avail himself of his own
position when at the Cape, to repeat the observations.            The result to
 which he arrives      is extremely    satisfactory, differing as it does but
 slightly from La Caille's.
     These and similar labours place       Mr   Henderson     high in the esti
 mation of astronomers.         But something more is requisite to give a
 man interest in the eyes of the world at large.                In the field of
 science,   many a patient cultivator who has conferred a real boon on
 mankind has been altogether forgotten.           The successful opening of
 some unexplored district, or the discovery of some popularly inter
 esting fact, confers, and properly confers, a wide-spread fame. The
 development of scientific       knowledge, as of every thing relating to
 the preparation of the races of mankind for their future destinies,
 is regulated by an All-wise hand, which, whilst it dispenses sufficient
 to   satisfy each generation as it passes, kindly holds back an inex
 haustible store to supply the intellectual cravings of races yet to fol
 low.     The natural sciences have not yet (as a philosopher unwisely
 asserted a century ago they had) nearly attained their ultimate per
 fection ; and doubtless are not destined soon to do so.                 Hence,
 whoever      is privileged    to   make    a  discovery,    however    trifling,
 is worthy of respect, as having contributed        towards the fulfilment     of

                                                    42
vast designs, slowly but steadily progressing towards their accom
plishment.   Should the investigation of the parallax of a, Centauri,
which Mr Henderson gave to the world, turn out correct, of which
there   is,   at -present, little doubt, then shall we claim for him the dis
tinction which      I     have marked with honour                 — the     distinction of having
extended astronomical measures                      beyond the limits           of our system.*
Nor will      it   diminish his            fame    that   a    similar determination       was at
tempted before, or that an equally successful one was nearly contem
poraneous with his own.    In few cases has an individual made                                     a
successful essay, without having                    been preceded           by others, not des
tined to reach the goal, or accompanied                             by   some one, to share the
honour.    There     reason to fear, that,                           in the present instance,
whatever honour             is is   due   will fall to the lot of another.            It   is   to be
regretted, that (whether the conclusion shall ultimately be verified
or not) no scientific award was made him, in consideration for the
skill displayed      ;    whilst his contemporary received for his labours a
medal from this country.                     Let   us hope that          his reward will   be the
association of his name with the discovery.
   There      is   another point wherein,                 as   Mr   Henderson's     advocate,    I
  *   On this subject    beg to refer to my friend Mr Main's admirable
                             I
 memoir in the Transactions          the Astronomical Society, v.
                                             of                         .  It
may be interesting to add the following remarks from a private com
munication of his to myself: — "At the time when           was requested to I
draw up a memoir on the subject of annual parallax, the amount of evi
dence of its sensible existence for any star whatever, which had even
arisen from the discussion of investigations previous to Bessel's, was
exceedingly small      and
                         ;    believe that, at that time, any new attempt
                                      1
was likely to be received with the smile of incredulity, which repeated
failures will always, in the long-run, tend to produce. No sensation was
caused in England by the announcement of Bessel's investigation and                        ;      I
remember that, to some astronomers,        his confidence in the certainty of
his result seemed far from warranted.           At present there exists very
little scepticism with respect to our knowledge of the parallax of
61 Cygni.     But    was deduced by a method with which English astro
                     it
nomers were,       may assert, in general, unfamiliar, perhaps through the
                   I
want of a good heliometer                         It was an evidence of very
creditable faith, therefore, which induced Mr Henderson, in default of
other means, to attack this star rigorously by meridian observations in
both elements, and this notwithstanding his accurate knowledge (for no
man living excelled him in his knowledge of every thing that had been
done in every department of modern practical astronomy, from its com
mencement) of that total failure of every attempt that had been made
under the ablest astronomers of this country, in the northern hemisphere.
And so fully was he impressed with the conviction of his ultimate suc
cess, that he left   as a legacy to his successor, who has sent over a very
                       it
complete and beautiful series of observations, which, after their discus
sion by Mr Henderson himself, not long before his decease, has, in the
minds of many, pretty nearly decided affirmatively the question of the
existence of    aconsiderable parallax."

                                       43
would assert his    claims to reward.        During a long series of years,
he devoted much of his leisure time to the reduction of the Cape
Observations, which having been made in a public observatory, it
was the duty     of the public to present in a proper shape to the world.
Mr Henderson performed this duty with no other remuneration than
the satisfaction derived from giving a perfect form to his own results.
We lament, however, that his infant daughter will reap none of the
fruits of that excessive midnight toil which hastened her father's
progress to the grave, more especially as she is an orphan indeed —
deprived of both her parents.         To the memory of her mother, who
died shortly    after her birth,   it is fit    I  should pay a tribute.      She
was the daughter      of  Mr   Adie, the celebrated optician of this city.
In his selection of this lady   as his partner, no less than in the other acts
of his life,  Mr   Henderson manifested the soundness           of his judgment.
She   was in every way suitable for him.             A  member of a talented
family especially devoted to scientific pursuits         ;  herself gifted with a
mind of great capacity, which a liberal education had cultivated and
refined ; of an amiable disposition and a cheerful temperament, she
was   well fitted to sympathise with the depressions of          a spirit weighed
down    with   fatigue,   or  to  brighten     those   passages of life, which,
 without her aid, would have appeared gloomy.                Add to this, that
 her attainments     were considerable    ;  so much so as to render her not
 only capable of appreciating and admiring her husband's ardour and
 enthusiasm in his favourite studies, but even of occasionally assisting
 him in the prosecution of them.          Under these circumstances, it need
 scarcely be said that their union was a happy one.              Her death, at a
 time when their fondest wishes seemed             realized in the birth of a
 daughter, was a shock from which he never recovered.               His manner,
 which had always been deficient in buoyancy, became from that
 moment solemn.         In anticipations of the future, he rarely indulged ;
 in a melancholy retrospect of the past, too often.                This, added to
 his late habits, preyed rapidly      on his constitution,     and hastened his
 death.    He expired on the 23d of November 1844, of                 a disease of
 the heart.
     To draw his character — scientific or social — is an             easy  and a
  pleasing task.     As an observer, he was ingenious and accurate
  — in testimony of which it is sufficient to say, that his observations
  carry the entire confidence of every astronomer in Europe.               On this
  head,  I cannot   do better  than   allow   one  of their  number    (Mr  Main)
                       He          " The
  to speak for me.          says,           praise of being the first discoverer
  of our distance from a fixed star, even should it be ultimately esta

                                      44
blished, though a brilliant addition to his fame, is not precisely that
which will cause his name to be remembered with gratitude by every
one who understands what ought to be the routine duty prescribed
to himself, and practised by the astronomer.           His business in gene
ral —his every-day work —is not speculative, but practical ; not con
versant, except, by the way, with the almost despaired-of problems
of the   science, but with the establishment       of the data which belong
to his epoch.      He  is to fix, with indisputable accuracy, the places of
the most remarkable of the stars       ; he is to bring his contribution       to
the perfecting of the lunar and planetary tables ; he is to assist in
the measurement of our own planet, as the basis of all our ulterior
comparisons     ; and he must do this by submitting to a routine, whose
irksomeness and labour no one can appreciate but himself.              Professor
Henderson      did all this in a way which lays just claim to the grati
tude of succeeding astronomers ; his speculations on our connection
with the sidereal system were but the recreations of a mind that
never swerved from the amount of toil imposed by the less dignified,
but more useful occupations of the astronomer.              His observations,
followed up as they have been by Mr Maclear, will be the basis of
all the astronomy that is peculiar to the southern hemisphere ; and
it is to his results, that the astronomers of the next        age   will look for
 the facts of their science."
     I apprehend, however, that no slight    foundation of Mr Henderson's
future fame, will be found to rest on the admirable use which he
 made    of his own observations.     Having acquired a thorough know
 ledge    of all that had been      done, and all that was desirable in
 astronomy, he was ever on the alert to seize any opening which the
circumstances under which these were made, might seem to offer.
 Witness his memoirs on refraction, and on the parallax of the moon,
 which were suggested by the position of the observatory in which
 he was     at that time placed.      The arguments,      too, from which his
 conclusions were drawn,       are marked     by singular perspicuity and
 acutoness.     The standard which he adopted in mathematical reason
 ing, was the works of Euler.        Not many days before his death,            I
 found him reading some book of travels, and on expressing my
 pleasure at finding him so employed, he remarked,
                                                              " I   should very
 much prefer      a  volume of Euler, but        I  cannot get at it."         In
 astronomy he looked upon Bessel as his model,          almost   as  his  master.
 It was my good fortune to participate in his entertainment of that
 distinguished astronomer, as we had previously united in the recep
  tion of Encke.     I   would fain efface from my memory the pleasure

                                          45
 we  experienced on both       those   occasions.    In  the case of Bessel, his
 was the    delight of a son who had found a father.            He hung on his
words and watched his looks with a mingled feeling of affection and
pride.      That he profited by studying the writings of these great
men, his own researches sufficiently testify.           His path lay not in the
complex analytical       investigations of the French school ; but what he
professed, he was profoundly acquainted with.              His natural modesty
appears     nowhere   to  greater advantage      than  in  his  sternly disclaim
ing   all pretensions to knowledge with which he was only partially
acquainted.       In social life he was kind and affectionate ; ever ready
to  assist his friends, without       regard to his personal comfort.         His
naturally reserved manner unfitted            him to occupy that position in
general society which his extensive information and accurate memory
amply qualified him for.           He felt, too, what his position, as Her
Majesty's Astronomer for Scotland, demanded, and having no facility
of adapting himself to the peculiarities of others, he was content to
limit his circle to a few chosen        friends.    Amongst these       he  never
forgot his early patrons, towards whom he manifested to the last the
same deep feelings of gratitude.             By them, and by all who knew
him     intimately, he was much beloved, and as much respected.
They will agree with me in saying that we have lost a valuable
friend, — a man liberal and high-minded, — conscientious to a degree,
— ready with heart and hand to assist, when assistance was called
for, — with a judgment so sound, and experience so improved, as to
render him a safe adviser, and an invaluable coadjutor.                 May the
reputation he has left, and the kind remembrances which his friends
cherish of him, stimulate        us to follow his example, and imitate his
virtues.
 3.  On the Chemical           Relations of Creosote. By              William
                Gregory, M.D., Professor of Chemistry.
    The author      stated,  that, being struck with the singular resem
blance between the properties of creosote and those of carbolic acid,
as  described in all chemical works, he had tried the action of a
mixture of chlorate of potash and hydrochloric acid on creosote, and
had    thus obtained a very large proportion of chloranile, the com
pound     yielded by Carbolic acid, when treated in the same way.              He
had also obtained, by the action of nitric acid on creosote, evidence
of the production       of nitropicric acid, which is        also obtained from
carbolic acid.
    VOL.    II.                                                      F

                                          46
    He drew the conclusion, that             if  these   two compounds be not
identical,   they      are,  at least, very     closely   connected,  and in all
probability,   contain the same radical.           It  is possible that creosote
may be a definite compound of carbolic acid with some allied body.
At all   events,    it  is very remarkable,     that these two compounds, de
scribed as different,       should agree in density, taste, smell, antiseptic
property, power        of combining with bases, power of dissolving resins,
indigo, &c., and finally in composition ; although probably perfectly
pure creosote has not yet been analysed.
    The author mentioned these results very briefly,                 having    dis
covered,   just   before the meeting,       that he had been       anticipated   in
his experiments on creosote, by           M. Laurent, who had obtained the
same results, and drawn very nearly the same conclusions,                in a very
recent paper, and who was              therefore   entitled   to priority in the
matter.
 4. On the    Thermometric Correction of Magnetic Instruments.
                             By J. A. Broun, Esq.
     Mr  Broun points out the defects of the usual methods of ascertain
 ing the corrections for temperature, applicable to magnetic instru
 ments generally, and the vertical force magnetometer in particular.
 The usual methods depend upon the knowledge of the time of vibra
 tion, or upon the statical deflection produced by a neighbouring
 magnet, under differing circumstances of temperature.                 Mr Broun
 shews that both these methods are liable to great objection ; and he
 has succeeded     by arranging the ordinary hourly observations of the
 instruments     in groups, in obtaining consistent results for the tem
 perature correction by a process of elimination.
  5. On the      Constitution of Bebeerine.                By Douglas Mac-
       lagan, M.D., F.R.S.E., and Thomas G. Tilley, Esq.,
       Birmingham.
     Bebeerine     is a vegetable alkaloid, discovered by Dr Rodie of
  Demerara, in the bark of tho Bebeeru tree, Nectandra Rodiei, Schom-
  burgk.    The properties of the alkaloid and its application in the
  form of sulphate, in the treatment of disease, were formerly described
  by Dr Maclagan in a paper read before the Society, and published
  in their Transactions,       vol. xv., part 3.

                                       47
    As bebeerine     does not crystallize,   and is coloured, its purity could
 only be ascertained by analysis.      The authors describe a new method
 of purification, in which oxide of lead is employed to separate
                              .....
 tannin, &c.
    The mean results of the analysis performed, were as follows           :—
                 Carbon,                                   71-92
                 Hydrogen,                                  6-49
                 Nitrogen                                   4-75
                 Oxygen,                                   16-84
                                                          100-00
    The mean atomic weight, as deduced from the analysis of the
double salt of hydrochlorate of bebeerine, with bichloride of platinum,
is 3756-77 (oxygen = 100), and, making this the groundwork of
the calculation, the authors were led to the formula            C35      N2 06
for bebeerine, which gives the atomic weight 3681-38.
    It is remarkable that this formula is the same as that generally
 admitted for morphia, and not, as might be expected from the action
 of bebeerine, allied to those of quinine and cinchonine.         The mode of
 arrangement of the atoms is, no doubt, different in morphine and in
 bebeerine, notwithstanding the apparent identity of proportions.           In
 fact, the difference of physical properties       proves a difference in the
grouping of the atoms.
    The authors were not able to obtain sipeerine, the substance which
 accompanies bebeerine, in sufficient        quantity for analysis.     It ap
pears to be also an alkaloid.

    Sir T. M. BRISBANE, Bart., President, in the Chair.
   The   following Communications                  were read    : —
1.  On the Sums of the Digits of Numbers.                           By the Right
      Rev. Bishop Terrot.
   It was shewn, that,      if the ultimate suras of the digits of the terms
of any arithmetic      series, whose difference is prime to the local value
of the notation     employed, minus 1, be taken, such sums will range,
without   any recurrence, through all the digits of the notation, and
then  recur in the      same   order as before.         It was then shewn,      that
in any integer     series formed upon a given law, the sums            of the digits
of the terms    will  have a fixed period        of recurrence.    This was proved
in polygonal and figurate numbers, in the series of squares,                  cubes,
&c., in the successive powers of a given root; in the series                  whose
general term is m.m +        1            m +  r — 1;   and in that whose gene
                                    ...
                                  .  . .
ral term is x    m
                   + a x™—1     .            + I.
   It was shewn, that whenever the variable or number of the term
occurs as a    multiplier, the      suras   recur after n     1   terms, with cer
tain definite relations     between       the  intermediate terms.        When the
variable  occurs as an index, then the recurrence was shewn to take
place at shorter intervals      ;   in the decimal notation, according as the
root was of the form 3 p, or            3p±l.         From the determination of
the different    periods of recurrence          in the last case, it was shewn
that every     sixth power is of the form 9 n, or 9 n +               1 ;  and  that
   VOL.   II.                                                             G

 every seventh     power   is   of the form    9 m, or 9 n +    the root em
 ployed.

I. Notes        on the     Topography and Geology of the Cuchullin
      Hills in Skye ; and the Traces of Ancient Glaciers which
      they present — (concluded).          By Professor Forbes.
      The first part of this paper refers to the relations of the hyper
 sthene rock of the Cuchullin Hills to the adjoining formations.
      The author undertook the observations here detailed without the
  slightest view to publication.     He made only brief notes on the spot,
 collected but few specimens, and drew the first sketch of a map
 which accompanies the paper, for his own amusement and informa
 tion.      Finding, however, that the published writings of geologists
 contained little or no notice of some facts which he had clearly estab
 lished, he undertook this paper as a groundwork for future and more
 systematic researches.
       The details of the geology of the Cuchullins which exist are
 almost all to be sought for in the Description of the Hebrides by Dr
 MacCulloch.          The present writer    has strong  reason for believing
  that    Dr M. acquired his chief information      from following the coast
  in a vessel,     and by an excursion to Coruisk, leaving out the more
  plain    and   instructive phenomena which the eastern and northern
  sides of the range present.        Having walked completely round the
  Cuchullin group, and ascended two of its principal summits, the
  author     thinks that he    has  established the exact boundary of the
  hypersthene rock on the eastern and northern sides, stretching from
  Ben Blaven, which is included within the hypersthene line, by the
  eastern base of Scuir-na-Gillean, under the northern slope of Bruch-
  na-Fray, and so round to Loch Brittle, where it becomes less well de
   fined, the hypersthene rock graduating into the common trap of that
   country.     But along the boundary first described the hypersthene
   may be seen overlying the claystone of the Red Hills, and forming

                                         55.
a   sort of huge bed dipping at a moderate angle with the horizon
from NW. to SE., and probably thinning out in the latter direc
tion.     In confirmation of this view, it is stated that the junction of
the hypersthene        and claystone occurs at a height of 2050 feet on
the northern slope of the Cuchullins, all below being common trap ;
but    the junction descends      to the very bottom of Glen Sligachan
 near   Loch-na-Nain, which is little elevated above the level of the
 sea.    The hypersthene appears to have a decidedly slaty structure
 parallel to this bed, which, with its singularly intractable nature, and
 its resistance to weathering, occasions the jagged forms for which it
 is so  celebrated.     The author    believes  that it has a triple cleavage,
 one   parallel to the bed and two perpendicular to it      ; and that the nu
 merous claystone veins which traverse the           mass  of hypersthene up
 almost to the very summit, have, likewise,             a  threefold direction
 parallel to these cleavages.       The author thinks that the posteriority
 of the hypersthene to the neighbouring rocks is probably deducible
 from the facts which he mentions.
     The   second part of the paper refers to what he considers unequi
 vocal traces    of glacier-action in many directions around and amongst
 the Cuchullin Hills.        These are principally —
     (1.) Furrowed and striated rocks and roch.es moutonnees, undis-
tinguishable in kind from those in the Alps, and, if possible, ren
dered more remarkable from the unparalleled hardness and toughness
of the rock operated on, and the palpable incongruity              which these
forms present to those natural to the hypersthene rock.             These fur
rows are to be seen parallel       to the direction   of the different ravines
of the Cuchullin      Hills, and that at all points of the      compass,  thus
radiating     from this    little mountain group     as a centre, and clearly
localizing    the cause —the wonderful         mechanical cause — which has
produced such a phenomenon ; which, when the nature of the rock
 is taken into account, must be considered as one of the most wonder
 ful instances of abrasion of which the world presents an example.
     (2.) Coupled with this is the transportation of angular blocks of im
 mense mass,      transported over chasms, and lodged high and dry in
 fantastic positions on ledges of rock, and on the summit of the ice-
 worn domes of smoothed hypersthene.              These phenomena, so well
 seen at Coruisk, and so graphically described, though unexplained
 or misunderstood, by       Dr MacCulloch, are in all respects analogous
 to  the blocs perches of the Alps.        Of banded and terminal moraines
 examples are pointed out in radiating directions, east, north, and

                                       56
  west   from the Cuchullin group,        completing   the evidence  for the
  origination of the requisite force within the Cuchullin group itself.
  Other localities appear to exhibit traces of a great and general wave
  which has acted parallel to itself over a vast extent of country ; but
 here no such explanation         can apply, and in steep ravines, scarcely
 half a mile long, we cannot imagine the generation of vast and re
 peated waves, or floating icebergs or pent-up lakes, as any of the
 machinery which has elsewhere been used to account for facts less
 stubborn than those presented by the adamantine surfaces of the
  Cuchullin hills.
 2. On      the    recent    Eruption of Hecla,        and the    Volcanic
      Shower in Orkney. By Dr Traill.
     Dr Traill read an account of dust falling from the atmosphere on
 the 2d and 3d of September last, in the islands of Orkney.
     This dust was observed by a gentleman in the island of Rousay,
 falling from the air in the morning of the 2d. It was collected by
 another at Skaill, on the western shores of Pomona, on the morning
 of the 3d    ;  and by two other gentlemen in Kirkwall on the same
 day.     It appears also to have fallen in several other parts of Orkney,
 probably over all the islands ; and was observed also to reach the
 northern coasts of Caithness, within an area of which the radius can
 not be less than 30 or 40 miles.
     It covered,    to the depth  of from  ^s to $ inch,  linen laid out to
 dry, glass frames in gardens, and the leaves of plants of every kind,
with a fine brownish-grey dust, almost impalpable to the touch, but
 meagre and crowding between the teeth.              It does not effervesce
 with acids, and consisted chiefly of silex, alumina, oxide of iron, with
a trace    of lime.
    This dust bears much resemblance in composition and appearance
to that which covered the decks and rigging of vessels in the West
Indian seas, when the eruption of the Soufrifere took place in St
 Vincent, in 1812.         Those who collected the dust in Orkney, state
the probability that it proceeded from some eruption of Hecla, as the
ashes of that volcano once before fell in Orkney ; and the wind for
several days before the 2d of September had blown strongly from
the   NW.
    The truth is, that     such an occurrence has at least three times be
fore happened in the Orkney and Zetland Isles, when there has been

                                            57
an eruption     in Iceland.        In 1755, during    a violent eruption of the
Kottlugiaer     Jokul,      showers of ashes fell in the Zetland isles.          In
 1766,     during  a great      eruption of Hecla,   showers   of ashes reached
the Orkneys, and were long remembered there under the name                  of the
 black snow.       Again, in 1783, a similar dust was observed to de
 scend  in Orkney, which was coincident with a terrible eruption of the
 Shaptar    Jokul   ;  the most calamitous which ever happened in Iceland.
    Thus, the volcanic        ashes  of that island have thrice before reached
our northern       islands    ;  and recent intelligence brought by Danish
 fishing vessels from Iceland announces, that, in the end of August,
Hecla, after being quiescent since 1766, has emitted a violent erup
tion from its flanks       ;  and there can be little doubt that the dust now
exhibited is derived from that eruption.
    The distance      between    Hecla and the Orkney Islands      is about 550
miles.      Volney and other writers assure         us that the ashes     of Etna
are often carried to the plains of         Egypt, or to double that distance ;
and the eruption of the Tomboro, as described by Raffles, in the
eastern archipelago,          appears to have exerted a no less astonishing
projectile force.

        Relation of the Variations of the Earth's Magnetism to
        the Solar and Lunar Periods. By J. A. Broun, Esq.
        Communicated by Sir T. M. Brisbane, Bart.
    The observations from which the following results             are deduced,
 were obtained during       the years 1844    and 1845,     by means of the
 bifilar magnetometer, described in the Makerstoun           Observations for
 1841 and 1842      ;  they are    corrected for temperature by a method
 previously described.*
    From the Observations for the year 1844, the diurnal variation
 of the horizontal force is found to consist of two maxima and two
 minima; the minimum occurs at 10h 20m a.m. (Makerstoun mean
 solar time is used throughout), the maximum at 5h 30m pju. ; a
minimum occurs at 2h 20mA.M., and           a maximum at 5h 30m, or 40m
a.m.: two inflexions occur in the mean curve between 3h and 4h p.m.,
and between 8h and 9h p.m.           The periods of maxima and minima
vary throughout       the year, and the morning       maximum        is greater
than the afternoon maximum in winter.
    The diurnal range is greatest in July and least in January ; the
mean of the ranges for these two months, the range for the month of
March and for the month of October, are each nearly the mean
diurnal range for the year.
    The author   shewed to the     Physical Section of  the  British Associa
tion in   June 1845, that      the  Makerstoun   Observations for 1842 in
dicated a well-marked       annual period of horizontal   force, consisting of
maxima     near the   solstices, and  minima   near the  equinoxes ; in cor
recting the Toronto Observations for 1842, by the method already
noticed, he had arrived at the same result.           He has now verified
this period from the Makerstoun         Observations for 1843, 1844, and
1845.
   * Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, Vol.        XVI.   Part. 1.

                                      59
    The mean horizontal     force for each month is nearly the same      as
the mean for    midnight and for    lh  p.m.
    The secular variation is positive, the increase being considerably
less for 1845, than for any of the previous years.
    When the annual variation is eliminated from the means for each
month, the author finds that the secular variation is scarcely sensible
about 6h 40m a.m.,      an hour   after the morning maximum,         in the
first six months of the year 1844, and about 4h 40m p.m., an hour be
fore the afternoon maximum, in the last six months        of the same year.
    A lunar   period for the horizontal force has been deduced,       which
(like the annual period, and the sun's declination) shews maxima
when the moon has its greatest N. and S. declination, and minima
between these periods.        Each of the years 1844 and 1845 give
nearly the same result.
    The author has also deduced a period depending on the moon's
phase or synodical revolution, consisting of a maximum of horizontal
intensity, about two or three days after the new moon, and a mini
mum about two or three         days after the full moon : this period is
shewn with     the same distinctness and regularity in each of seven
months of 1844.
    The Observations for 1844 and 1845 have          each been investigated
for the determination     of  a  period connected with the moon's hour
angle ;   the author finds this period to consist of two maxima and two
minima.      From the Observations for 1844,     the minimum occurs about
 6 hours    before the moon's meridian passage, the maximum about
 1* hours after the passage of the inferior meridian ; a maximum oc
curs before 4h after the meridian passage, and a minimum about
 8 hours after the meridian     passage.     These periods have been veri
 fied by the Observations for 1845, excepting that, for 1845, the se
 condary maximum occurs before 3 hours after the meridian passage :
 the range for each year is nearly the same, being about a tenth part
 of the mean diurnal range for the year.
     3.  Experiments and Investigations as to the influence
        exerted over some Minerals by Animal and Vegetable
        matter, under certain conditions.             By Mrs Margaret
        Henrietta Marshall.        Communicated by        Sir T. M. Bris
        bane, Bart.
     It occurred  to the author, while    examining the fossils of various

                                      60
 strata, that possibly the animal matter of the animals originally in
 cluded in the rock might have played some part in its consolidation,
 and thus, after their   destruction as living animals, they might have
 continued to serve a useful purpose.
     After many unsuccessful experiments,        made  with common lime,
 and raw animal or vegetable matter, she had. recourse to sulphate of
 lime, and found that plaster of Paris, when mixed with water, and
 with not more than T|gth part of the weight of the whole mass of
 mixed animal and vegetable matter, it did not set instantly, but con
 tinued for some hours quite plastic, developed, in setting, more heat
 than usual, and finally acquired a remarkable degree of hardness,
 and the power of resisting both water and fire to a very great degree.
 A specimen, was exhibited, made in this way.
    In  other specimens, three parts of sand had been mixed with one
 of gypsum, and -j^th of the whole of iron had been added, with the
 same amount as before     of organic matter.     One specimen had been
 exposed   for two years to running water, and was but little affected.
    Time and exposure have a most remarkable effect in increasing
the hardness and compactness       of these mixtures.
    Specimens were shewn of      Arran granite, broken down and re-
consolidated by means      of tVth of gypsum, and the usual propor
tion of organic matter.        One of these has even taken a certain
amount of polish.      The author suggests, that possibly granite may,
in some cases,    have been    brought    into its present state,  not by
fusion, but by the combined agency of fire and water.         She expects
a favourable result from an attempt to consolidate granite without
gypsum, which is now in progress.
    Marine sands may be consolidated by the same          means   as those
above    employed, but more slowly.         Several specimens   were ex
hibited, one with an alga imbedded and well preserved.          Liquor of
mussels and sea-weeds were found to yield sufficient animal and ve
getable   matter to effect consolidation.
    In  several specimens, star fish and other mollusca were imbedded,
and generally continued distinctly visible.         They also discharged
the colour of iron from the parts surrounding them.
    The animal   and vegetable matter      used  by the author was glue
and starch, in her first experiments         with gypsum ; but in those
made with marine sands, and those in which remains were imbedded,
sho employed the animal matter contained in the liquor of mussels,

                                          61
and the vegetable matter         of fuci.    The materials   wero  boiled toge
ther, and then     left for a longer or shorter time    till consolidation took
place.
   As gypsum, which was used in most of these experiments, does
not occur in the strata supposed to have been possibly consolidated
by the action     of animal and vegetable matter, the author, to          ascer
tain whether gypsum might be dispensed with, employed pure mag
nesia, and with success.         Specimens of consolidated magnesia were
shewn.     From      some   other   experiments, the author is inclined to
believe that animal       matter, fossilized in the centre of a mass con
taining lime, attracts to itself the lime from the general mass.
   Further experiments must determine how far the observations of
the author are capable of being applied to explain any part of the
phenomena of the consolidation of strata, or of the fossilizing of or
ganic remains.

    The following Communications              were read   : —
 1.  On the Action of Soluble Lead Salts on Natural Waters.
       By Professor Connell.
    In   a former communication        to the  Society,  the author noticed
 that spring, well, and river waters, even after being boiled, usually
 yield, with acetate of lead, a precipitate readily soluble, in whole or
great part, in acetic acid; and as the solution appeared not to be
attended with effervescence,       it was conceived to be due to organic
matter.     The author has since found that effervescence is more
common than was at first supposed,          and in that case the precipitate
is due to the presence of carbonate of lime in the water.            It was
ascertained by boiling a solution of carbonate of lime in water con
taining excess of carbonic acid, that the trace of carbonate of lime
retained in solution     after ebullition, was too slight to explain the
reaction of the spring waters, on the idea that it had been originally
taken up by them in this way.           It was  farther found that distilled
water, when left in contact for several days in a close vessel with
impalpably pounded marble, took up a very little more ; but what
the author conceives to be the more probable source of the carbonate
of lime in the spring waters is double decomposition between a so
luble lime-salt and a carbonated alkali.         The reaction may be imi
tated by adding to an ounce of distilled water one drop each of
carbonate of potash, muriate of lime, and sulphate of magnesia,
when acetate     of lead will be found to yield a cloud like spring waters,

                                        63
ioluble with effervescence       in acetic acid.    When     the precipitate   in
the spring      water is truly dissolved without      effervescence   by acetic
acid, it is due to organic matter, provided no chloride is present in
sufficient quantity to produce the reaction.

       Sir T. M. BRISBANE, Bart., President, in the Chair.
      The following Communications              were read    : —
  1.   On the Decomposition and Dispersion of Light within
          Solid Bodies.       By Sir David Brewster, K.H.
      After noticing various cases of solid and liquid bodies, which dis
  perse light of a colour quite different from the transmitted tint, and
  Sir John Herschel's explanation of the phenomenon in the solution
  of acid sulphate of quinine, which, although itself colourless, dis
 perses    light of a bright blue, the author considers —
      1 . The internal dispersion of fluor-spar.        By employing      a more
 intense light than Sir      J. Herschel    did — namely,   a condensed beam
                       —
  of the sun's light he conceives that he has proved that the disper
 sion is not, as     Sir J. Herschel    supposes,  superficial or epipolic, but,
 on the contrary,      belongs, in some specimens at least, to every part
 of the crystal.       The phenomenon is only seen in the green fluor of
 Alston, and in some pink and bluish-yellow varieties from Derby
 shire.      Some specimens     are formed of strata alternately      dispersing
 and non-dispersing.        The author      has not found the same appear
 ances    in any other mineral       ; but he has    observed similar pheno
 mena of dispersion        in several kinds of glass, and even in some co
 lourless glasses, which disperse a fine green tint.
     2. On the internal dispersion of the acid solution of sulphate of qui
 nine.      Here, also, by using a more intense light than Sir     J. Herschel,
the author establishes that the peculiar dispersion occurs, not only
 in  a stratum    l-50th of an inch thick at the surface of the liquid,
but at all parts of it ; and he concludes — First, That a beam of
light,    epipolised by the action of a solid or a liquid, is capable of
further dispersion, provided the thickness of the medium has not
been sufficient to disperse      all the dispersible rays.     Secondly, When
such a     medium is thus rendered incapable of dispersing more light, it
is not, as Sir    J.  Herschel supposes, because the light has lost a pro
perty which it previously possessed, but because it has been deprived
of all the dispersible rays it contained.
     The rays thus dispersed      are few  in number, and, by their mixture,
yield blue light, but they extend over a great range of refrangibility ;
while other rays, equally refrangible, are either less dispersible, or not
dispersible.      But this appears less surprising when we advert to the
phenomena of absorption.

                                         65
   The difference between absorption and dispersion       that,     the       is,             in
former case, the absorbed light    extinguished
                                         is       while, in the latter,
                                                                ;
the dispersed light     visible.
                         is      Hence,       in powerfully absorbing
                                                        if,
bodies, the absorbed light could be rendered visible, we should have
the phenomena    of epipolised light.
     3. On the polarisation of dispersed light.                     Sir   J.    Herschel had
                              of epipolised light
failed to detect the polarisation                 but the author,         ;
by using a condensed sunbeam, discovered that the dispersed beam
was polarised, partly in the plane of reflexion, and partly in                                      a
peculiar manner    ;   which the author calls quaquaversus polarisation,
like that effected     congeries of small doubly-refracting crystals,
                       by
                       a
having their axes in all directions.   He afterwards discovered in
stances in which each of these kinds of polarisation was found alone.
These experiments have led to more extended investigations, to be
subsequently communicated.   The remainder of the section contains
a   minute description    of the beautiful phenomena of the polarisation
of dispersed light.      The author thinks    probable that the study of
                                                   it
these phenomena may throw much                light     on the internal             structure of
the substancesexhibiting them.
   4. On the causes of the decomposition and internal dispersion of
light. The author ascribes the phenomena (which do not, in fluor
spar, belong to the species, but only to certain varieties) to irregular
crystallisation, and the successive deposition of strata of different
refractive and dispersive power.              He   does not, at present, offer any
theory of the cause in liquids.
 2.   A    few Remarks suggested by Professor Forbes's Descrip
          tion of the effects of Glacial Action among the Cuchullin
          Hills, and Mr Maclaren's views of the facts observed                                       by
          him at the Gareloch.           By Sir G. S. Mackenzie, Bart.
      The object of this paper        was to shew,       that   if    it      be assumed           that
 glaciers had actually existed among the CuchulUn Hills, or in other
 parts of this country, one of two conditions must necessarily have
 been  present — either       a   climate     much        colder      than          the
                                                                                      existing
 climate of Scotland, or      higher position of the
                                  a                                            land where the
 supposed  marks of glaciers are seen.  With respect to the first con
 dition, the permanency of the relative positions of the heavenly
                              of the earth's axis, and the adaptation
 bodies, and of the inclination
 to existing climates of animal and vegetable life, were appealed to
      voij. ii.                                                                           h

                                     66
as rendering     it improbable.     The other condition was maintained
as probable,    on the ground that the changes which have undoubted
ly  taken place in the positions of the rocky masses forming the crust
of the earth, prove that parts of these masses had been depressed,
while others had been elevated ; so that the probability was, that
the Cuchullin    Hills had   stood at a higher elevation than they do at
present, reaching above the line of perpetual congelation.
    The crust of the earth having     been broken up, was formerly pro
pounded by the author of this paper as having been the cause of
such a disturbance of land and water, as would fully account for all
the phenomena now presented by the surface of the globe.            It was
stated, that, while no proof could be brought to shew a change of
climate, we had evidence        in abundance of intense    internal   heat,
which has been known to have         produced force sufficient to elevate
the land.    Nothing seems more likely, when the bursting of the
crust gave vent to the expansive matter, than the sinking of much
of the crust into the vacuities produced by its escape, and the tilt
ing up of the rest    ; thus   giving to the surface its present rugged
and uneven aspect.         During such a convulsion, masses bearing
glaciers may    have  sunk  with them below the line of perpetual con
gelation.
    The observations on     Mr M'Laren's     theory, which   ascribed two
different co-existing phenomena (striated marks and travelled boul
ders) to two causes
                      — the one glaciers, and the other icebergs —went
to shew, that, if a glacier had existed in the Gareloch, it would be
necessary to determine whether the boulders were deposited, and
the glacier was formed before or after the rising of the sea, and
after its subsidence ; the sea having been supposed to have risen
 2000 feet,   to admit   of icebergs bearing boulders floating into the
Gareloch.     This elevation of the level of the sea had not been ac
counted for in any way       ;  nor had it been  considered that the sup
position involved its having risen all over the globe ; and no space
had been provided to receive it when it retired.       It was shewn that,
in such a condition of things, Scotland must have been a cluster of
 small islands, the summit of the present mountains, which certainly
 would have had a climate colder than the country generally has
 now.    But it was also shewn, that were the sea elevated, as sup
 posed, 2000 feet higher than at present, the regions where icebergs
 exist now would have been a solid mass of immoveable ice, extend
 ing far above and beyond the land from which icebergs, in our day,
 are occasionally detached.       It was supposed that the phenomena

                                      67
described   by  Mr M'Laren      could be well accounted  for by the effects
of the    crust of the earth having burst.       The author did not enter
on  this subject.
3.  Remarks on certain grooved surfaces of Rock on Arthur's
                   Seat. By the Rev. Dr Fleming.
    Dr Fleming read a paper, entitled " Remarks on certain grooved
surfaces   of Rock in Arthur's Seat."       He referred, in the first in
 stance, to the surface of the bed of porphyry, known as the Bog
Crag, and contiguous to the Hunter's Bog; and shewed, from the
 directions of the markings being neither parallel to the valley, nor
the neighbouring     cliff, that they could not be the result of glacial,
diluvial, or iceberg action, but were probably caused by the sliding
of the contiguous beds at their upheaval ; and this view he consi
dered strengthened by the state of the detritus of the cliff of the
Well Crag.       He then took notice of   a grooved surface of basalt, con
tiguous to a singular trough to the east of St Anthony's Well,
 but which might have been produced either by glacial or diluvial
 action.

1.   Biographical Notice of the late Sir John Robison, K.H.,
                 Sec. R. S. Ed. By Professor Forbes.
    " A laudable
                    usage was forruerly more prevalent in this Society
than it is at present, of recording the merits and services of persons
who have conferred honour upon it by the one, or rendered them
selves    its benefactors by the other.      Some very elaborate biogra
phies have thus been communicated ; but, in the old
                                                              " History of
the Society" (to which our published " Proceedings" are in some
degree parallel), numerous short notices are to be found of a kind
imposing less labour on the biographer, and admitting of more ex
tensive application than the larger memoirs just alluded to.            In
the hope     that such notices may be more frequently contributed,        I
beg now to offer, within the short compass       in which the very limited
materials     now at my disposal enable me to condense my task, a
brief notice of the Life of the late Sir Jphn Robison, whose most
energetic efforts were, for many years, constantly directed to the
promotion of the welfare of this Society ; a circumstance which
seems     to call for more specific notice than was comprised in the
thanks and acknowledgment voted by the Society during his life
time,* and which naturally devolves         upon me the duty of drawing
it up, not only    as his successor  in office, but as having enjoyed his
friendship, and having been, on several occasions, indebted to him,
in no common degree, for personal kindness.
    " Sir John Robison     was born on. the 11th   June 1778.   His father
was the late eminent      Dr Robison, Professor of Natural Philosophy
in our own University,       and Secretary of this Society, who died in
 1804   ;  and his mother, formerly Miss Wright, still survives him, at
an advanced,     but robust old age.
      Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, vol.   XV.,  p. 680.

                                          69
    "Mr    Robison was educated at the        High School of Edinburgh, and
afterwards     attended some classes at College, including, of course, his
father's, who, perceiving in him a decided mechanical turn, removed
him from thence, after three years' study, and placed him under the
charge of     his old and valued friend,      Mr   Houston of Johnston, near
Paisley, who was at that time erecting extensive manufactories upon
his estate for the spinning of cotton, with the advantage of the then
recently invented machinery         of Arkwright.       Here Mr Robison ap
pears   to have acquired the taste for constructing and superintending
machinery, which remained with him during life. Two or three years
afterwards,     Mr Robison was removed to Manchester, where he re
mained    in some degree Under the protection of the late Mr Watt, whom,
it is probable, that he visited at Soho, and made there the acquaint
ance   of the younger Mr Watt, and the other members of that               cele
brated establishment.          His father's great intimacy with the illus
trious   inventor     (as he must in strictness be termed) of the steam-
engine,    and   the great mutual services which these eminent men had
rendered to one        another (by far the greatest, however, in the Ordi
nary acceptation of the term, being conferred by Dr Robison), of
course, introduced Mr Robison with the utmost advantage to an
establishment, then not only the first, but the only one of its kind,
and must naturally        have strengthened his own bent towards mecha
nics, and introduced him to more enlarged and correct notiohs of
engineering than he was likely to attain in the direction even of the
greatest     cotton factory.      I mention these     circumstances now, be
cause, though      little information has    reached  me   of his early connec
tion   with the Soho establishment,           there  can be no doubt that it
exerted     the most important        influence   on his future   life, and the
friendships which he then formed were amongst the most valuable,
and, to Ihe honour of all parties, the most lasting which he enjoyed,
as we    shall presently see.
    " The truth of what        I have  now stated, as to the probable enlarge
ment of his views and knowledge by his intercourse with Mr Watt,
will appear from the speedy change in his professional views which
followed upon his visit to Manchester ; for, having remained in busi
ness there only      a  year or two, he obtained, through the influence of
his father'6 friend, General Hay Macdowall,              in 1802, a mercantile
situation in Madras,* which occasioned his being sent up the Country
to Hyderabad,        to establish a branch of the business for the pur
pose    of collecting and transmitting         the muslins and other manu-
   * It would appear from a tetter addressed to him by Mr Watt junior,
which is still preserved, that his first destination was to Ceylon.

                                        70
factures    of the natives.      His activity and mechanical tastes did
not, however, probably -find sufficient scope in this merely mercan
tile position, which offered nothing resembling the superintendence
of the machinery to which he had been accustomed at Johnston and
Manchester      ; and he managed, under favour of circumstances which
are unknown to me, so to improve his relations with the natives, and
with the native prince the Nizam, in whose territories he resided,
that he contracted for the establishment and maintenance of the
artillery corps in his Highness's        service, including the furnishing of
guns and ammunition.           Of  this concern Mr Robison was not only
 the upholder,      but also   the commanding       officer  ;   the   subordinate
 officers were appointed by him,          and every    expense      defrayed.    In
 security for the annual charge thus incurred, the taxes of a particu
 lar province or district    were assigned    over to him.       Every branch of
 artillery-engineering      must therefore have become           familiar to him,
 and probably constituted one chief attraction of his situation.              I un
 derstand that he obtained from England the very best implements
 of manufacture,       but we may easily conceive        the scope given to his
 remarkable ingenuity in conducting so extensive an undertaking in
 so remote a place.        He always spoke with admiration of the intelli
 gence and mechanical talents of the natives.
      " His contracts were fulfilled,    as I understand,     with satisfaction to
  his employer,      and profit to himself.     His mechanical skill, and his
  acquaintance with the advanced state of Art in Britain, were duly
  appreciated by the Nizam, who desired him to construct and lay out a
  house and grounds on the      English model, and to procure for him many
  European conveniences.          The best understanding existed between
  them, until having realized a competence and desiring to return
  once more to society and his home, he left India in 1815, being
  then thirty-seven     years of age.     His father having        been long dead,
  he settled in the west of Scotland,       and married,       the following year,
  Miss Grahame of Whitehill, who died»in 1824.                  He, subsequently,
  married Miss Benson, who also predeceased him.                    Two daughters
  by his first marriage survive him.         Mr Robison' s first residence was
   at the Grove, near     Hamilton   ; but after some years he came to reside
   in Edinburgh, of which the first account           I   have was, that he was
   elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 22d January
    1816, and took part, in 1821, in the formation of the Society of
   Arts. And here the third and best known part of his life commences ,
   —that    in which we are more particularly interested.
       " I shall first speak of his connection with the Royal Society. The
   division of the Physical and Literary Classes of the Society was then

                                           71
more     strictly preserved than it        is  at present.     Mr Robison      was
elected   Secretary of the Physical Class in 1823 ; and upon the retire
ment of Dr Brewster from the chief secretaryship in 1828, Mr Robi
son succeeded him, and continued to hold that office till 1840, when
he   resigned, contrary to the wishes of all those who had been most
nearly connected with him in the discharge of the duties of his office.
It   may be safely affirmed, that, under the favouring              circumstances
 of affluence       and leisure, seconded by congenial tastes and singular
 habits of    order,    he conducted the affairs of the Society with more
 watchful and anxious superintendence than is often found in such
 cases ;   and during the course of years already mentioned, the care
 and direction       of our affairs might be said to be his chief business ;
 for, unencumbered by any professional demands on his attention, he
 passed     successively from object to object of the many schemes, in
 ventions, and projects, which successively occupied his attention, but he
 always attached himself to the concerns of our Society as his chief
 and main occupation.           Having    been, even before my admission as a
 Fellow, in frequent communication with Mr Robison, and almost
 ever since, until his retirement, having acted as his co-operator and
 junior    Secretary, with the valuable         co-operation of my senior, Dr
  Christison,      I   have  had    innumerable opportunities (and         I know
 that    Dr  Christison    will unite in the     same  statement) of observing
  the unbounded pains which he took, publicly and privately, of fulfil
  ling what he considered to be his duty, and of maintaining, at any
  sacrifice of trouble,      the   rights   of the   Society, and those of its
  members.         In particular, we owe to       him,  in conjunction with our
  worthy President, Sir Thomas Brisbane, the endowment which
  we receive from Government,           and which places     this Society upon a
  surer footing of independence and respectability than any other cir
  cumstance       connected   with its affairs which has occurred for many
  years.
      ',
         Sir John Robison, as we must now call him (for he received the
  honour of the Guelphic Order from King William IV. in 1837,
   and of Knighthood from the present Queen in 1838), rarely contri
   buted to our scientific     proceedings, and the circumstance is worthy
   of remark    :   his only printed paper being one on Whitelaw's escape
   ment, and the time-keeper set up in our            Hall.*     This  can only be
   attributed to one cause,       to a  motive, in fact,    highly honourable    to
    him.     Sir John Robison never        made any pretension to be considered
     * Edin. Trans., vol. xi., p. 345.        Tins paper was read 7th Feb. 1831.

                                        72
as a   fully accomplished man of      science,  although, undoubtedly, many
persons have been ranked as such upon very inferior           claims.   It was
part of his character.        Like Dr Wollaston, he had the most precise
and methodical line of demarcation between what he wished to be
considered competent to decide, and what he declined offering any
opinion upon.         It was a caution which might be well deemed ex
cessive,    as his real acquirements were undoubtedly greater than even
his intimate friends were         fully aware of.      .His own opinions also
were, for the same reason, often sheltered under the impersonal form.
In almost no instance that          I  recollect of did he suffer his name to
be put as a responsible        member of a Committee        of the Council to
decide     on the merits      of purely    scientific   communications.    Nor
could this have arisen from any unwillingness to such occupation or
responsibility ; for in another Society, of whose general business he
considered himself a competent judge, no one was more active in such
capacities.       His backwardness in this particular can only, there
 fore, be ascribed to a very strict appreciation          of his own acquired
 knowledge. His youth and middle life were spent, as we have seen,
 in circumstances little favourable to the acquirements of abstract
 science,    or of literary dexterity.      When leisure permitted, he did
 not become a regular student, which could hardly be expected at his
 time of life   ; and he seldom made a profound or consecutive         study of
 any of the scientific topics which continually presented themselves to
 his acute remark during his multifarious occupations.             Thus, when
 he associated     with scientific men,    after so many years spent remote
 from European         society, he   was  generous    enough rather to throw
  useful hints in the way of others, and to aid their prosecution, than
 to hoard the many happy ideas which he struck out, or present
  views essentially philosophical      in a crude or merely practical form.
  I  conjecture, too, that, clearly as he at aft times expressed himself,
  whether in conversation or in writing, he had a sort of dislike to formal
  literary compositions, which contrasted with his father's extraordi
  nary fluency in this respect, and which hindered him from attempt
  ing them.       This may    be inferred   from the paucity of his acknow
  ledged compositions during so active a life, which consist only, so far
  as  I know, of the paper on Whitelaw's Timekeeper already mentioned,
  an article on Turning, in the Edinburgh Encyclopaedia ; a descrip
  tion both in English and French (at least the latter), of two Plates
  published by Mr John Milne, of a large Pumping Steam-Engine ;
  an account of the failure of a Suspension Bridge at Paris, and
  another paper in the Edinburgh Journal of Science, and two or three

                                          73
of the numerous communications presently to be mentioned as contri
buted to the Society         of Arts.
     " In all other                     as a contributor,
                        respects than                        his services  to the
Royal Society were numerous and incessant.                 By his example and
assistance,      its  affairs   were   conducted in a more methodical and
exact    manner than had previously           been usual ; he kept more exact
minutes than had before been don*            ; he contributed to our Museum
and its re-arrangement          ; he charged himself almost exclusively with
the    editorial labour of      our Transactions ; and, by his extensive ac
quaintance with the scientific          men   of Paris, where he     was   himself
favourably known, he also extended the connections and character of
this Society.
     " But whilst thus intimately connected with the Bxiyal
                                                                      Society, he
 took a great deal of concern in another, the Society             of Arts, which
 he had contributed to establish,         of which   he acted as Secretary from
 1822 to 1824, and of which he was twice Vice-President, and finally
 President for the year 1841-2.             By far his most numerous public
 communications        were to that Society, and the complete        list of them
 which the present Secretary, Mr Tod, has, with great courtesy and
 labour, extracted for me from the minute books, includes about 60
 contributions of one kind or other, spread over a period of 17 years.
 It    would   be wrong       to judge   of these    communications     as  formal
 papers    ; the nature of the proceedings of the Society admitted of
 merely verbal and occasional notices not necessarily of an original
 character.        During his frequent visits to Paris he seldom failed to
 pick up some improvement            in the ornamental or useful arts, which
 he thought worthy         of being known      to  practical men   at home, and
 farther publicity he did not desire.             Such were    many of his com
  munications ; others of very various             degrees  of importance were
  properly original, comprising the results of his own experiments on
  mechanical subjects. And though many of these appear trivial by the
  titles, few persons capable of judging of or appreciating the ingenuity
  of his improvements, or the beauty of the workmanship by which he
  rarely failed to illustrate them, considered them really to be so.            To
  myself, who was for a long period a constant visitor of his work
  room, these memoranda recall the rapid succession of most ingenious
  plans and contrivances with which he was almost continually occu
  pied, and    of which only      a very small     part ever underwent even a
  partial publication.         Amongst the more prominent of his communi
  cations to the Society of Arts may be reckoned his improvements in
   the difficult   art of cutting accurate metal screws, for which the Keith

                                         74
Medal of that Society          was awarded to   him, after    a sufficient interval
had elapsed to test the utility of the invention, which is declared by
the Committee who examined it, " from the numerous testimonials
by practical men in favour of the method described, and detailing the
superiority over others in use, to deserve the highest mark of the
Society's approbation."  An honorary medal was soon after awarded
to Sir John for a notice of experiments on the Forth and Clyde
Canal, on the resistance to vessels moving with different velocities, —
a subject of great interest and importance, then newly brought into
special notice, from the ascertained possibility of tracking vessels
advantageously at a high speed.   Amongst other subjects of general
interest included in his communications were the application of hot
air to warming houses ; of gas to the purpose of illumination, and
also to the purpose of heating.     These two last subjects, which
admit of a great deal of practical sagacity in their study, were
for many years almost constantly under his notice, and many of his
friends recollect his success in organizing a kitchen in which gas was
the chief combustible.
    "   It
       may, no doubt, be matter of regret that Sir John Robison did
not apply more of his attention to practical problems, the solution of
which would be of extensive value.             The truth     is,
                                                     that the occupa
tions of his life in Britain were only pastimes, and he never attached
to them      a   very serious importance.      I   may mention one instance
which came to my knowledge, of  practical suggestion,
                                         a              believe of       I
his own, which  undoubtedly
                     is     of much  utility. He  remarked  to me,
a   few years before his death, that         the construction       of astronomical
instruments       appeared     to be much misunderstood          by opticians,      who
are generally by no means skilled in the engineering of structures,
or in mechanics on a large scale.   Most astronomical instruments,
whether large or small, have been, from the earliest times, construct
ed of a multitude   detached fragments, screwed and clamped to
                          of
gether, very elegantly, indeed, but with a complete sacrifice of the
firmness to be gained by solid castings.  For large instruments, es
pecially, Sir     John    observed   that a Manchester machine-maker would
turn out     a   far better article than the best optician         in   London has the
power of making, wanting the necessary implements.     was much         I
struck by the remark,  and not long after    heard exactly similar
                                                     I
views expressed    Mr Airy, the Astronomer-Royal, who has de
                          by
tailed them in an able paper in the Notices           of   the   Astronomical So
ciety, 13th May 1842, where he describes            a   zenith sector, construct
ed upon engineering principles,          identical with those of Sir          J.   Robi

                                            76
son's,    the principal pieces        having    been   both cast and worked by
Messrs Maudsley.*
     " To sum up here what may be said on Sir John's mechanical
talents,     it may be affirmed, that his intimate acquaintance with
Technology         or the useful arts, was        equalled by very few persons
living.       Many persons who have been delighted by the exquisite
specimens of handiwork produced by his own lathe, may have sup
posed that his sagacity consisted in what may be called neat-handed-
ness.      But it    was so   far from being limited       to this, that   he may be
said to have        possessed   a minute     technical acquaintance with a host
of different     trades   ; and such combined knowledge is an              uncommon
and valuable         acquisition    in itself.    Any one who had occasion to
ask advice or information            on any point of the numberless operative
 professions into which         modern     ingenuity    and modern luxury have
 divided the comparatively few practical trades known                 a  century ago,
 were    rarely disappointed in receiving from Sir John Robison                 a clear
 and categorical       answer as to the processes and materials in use, and
 not unfrequently        a suggestion for their extension           or improvement.
 I   can safely say that       for many years our late Secretary was to me
 an    unfailing referee upon such         questions  ; he formed a valuable       link
 between       the   men of theory and the men of practice              of our time.
  Amongst        my own acquaintance,         Mr   Babbage and Professor Willis
  are the only persons who could be brought into comparison with him
  in this respect.
      " This extensive technical knowledge had several                    antecedents.
  First, may     be ranked a larger share       of theory than     he ever took credit
  for, or than any one would readily have supposed that he possessed                   ;
  this   I  have only learned by casual circumstances : Secondly, a con
   tinual   intercourse with well-informed          persons in every department
   of  art, — not only with such        men    as the present     Mr Watt,     who has
   kindly communicated to me his own testimony to the value set upon
   Sir John Robison's talents and acquirements, not only by himself,
   but by his illustrious       father,   and by Messrs Boulton and Murdoch
   his coadjutors      in the Soho establishment,           or as   Mr Peter Ewart,
   formerly of Manchester,         then of Woolwich,      or as   the late Mr Barton
   of the Mint, or Mr Oldham of Dublin, who were his particular
   friends, — but with the wholesale and retail manufacturers and engine-
    makers of Birmingham, and more particularly of Manchester, where
      *  I cannot affirm positively that Sir J. Robison's opinions were ori
    ginal to himself, but    I understood them to be so ; and         I know that his
    conversation with me long preceded the date of Mr Airy's paper.

                                      76
he retained the connection of a constant friendly         intercourse, which
probably in many instances dated with his residence          in that town at
his outset in life.      He   was   also intimately    acquainted with the
workshops     of numberless     ingenious tradesmen, not only in the
strictly manufacturing    towns of England, but in London, Edinburgh,
Glasgow, and Paris, by whom he was known and valued.                     But,
thirdly, all this would have been unavailing, had he not practically
executed his own designs, and learnt, by experience, more or less of
the difficulties of almost every trade which        came   under his notice.
The varieties of the constructions which he executed shew great di
versity of acquirement. From boring a cannon to drilling a needle's
eye, nothing was strange to him     ; the first, we have seen, was amongst
his earlier serious occupations, the last was a problem which occu
pied him     not long before his death.          Masonry, Carpentry,      and
manufactures in metals, were almost equally familiar to him             ;  his
house    in Randolph   Crescent was built entirely from his own plans,
and nothing, from the cellar to the roof, in construction or in furni
ture, but what bore testimony to his minute and elaborate invention
and superintendence.       A door handle, a chair castor, a pair of tongs,
and a candlestick,    he deemed     equally worthy of attention with the
more important      particulars   of warming      and ventilation,   security
from fire within,    and from wind       without.     Some panes of glass
having blown in by a storm, he was led to some curious observa
tions (communicated to the Society of Arts) on the proper mode of
placing window-glass in the sashes.              Many particulars of his
minute and ubiquitous experience may,          I think, be found in different
parts of the useful writings of the ingenious      Mr Loudon, with     whom
he was in frequent correspondence.          The poet Cowper says, " How
various his employments whom the world deems idle."               And those
who knew Sir John Robison well, and who know at the same time
the immense expenditure of time required for attaining mechanical
dexterity in any department, or, when attained, the labour necessary
to produce even the smallest or simplest object when of exquisite
execution, wondered how he was enabled to perform so much.                His
correspondence alone would have been more than an ample occupa
tion to most persons.     The secret lay, as in all such cases, in habits
of perfect order, of never doing two things at once, and of devoting
his whole thoughts and skill to what immediately occupied his atten
tion  ; but to this we must add habits of great personal activity, which
throughout his life rendered him incapable of sleeping for more than

                                       77
a  short period, and a powerful constitution, which enabled             him for
long periods almost to dispense with exercise.
    " There were other public bodies in which               he took an interest
besides those which      have been     mentioned     ; but they may be brief
ly passed over.       For  a number      of years   he was     an active mem
ber    of the Highland Society,         and commonly         Chairman   of their
Committee on Agricultural Implements             and Machinery.       He assist
ed   in the formation of    the British Association      for the Advancement
of Science at the meeting at       York in 1881      ; and he acted most enerr
getioally in the capacity of Local Secretary to that body upon occa
sion of its visit to Edinburgh in 1834, when he also entertained M.
Arago at his house.        Nor did he think the regulation of the affairs
of the      City Police below his notice ; and, like the distinguished
scientific foreigner and friend just mentioned (whom I have heard
dilate as warmly upon the achievement of paving a boulevard as upon
the discovery of a comet), he sat for some years amongst the Police
 Commissioners, and suggested some improvements, generally felt to
be such,, though the originator is not ao commonly known.              He would
undoubtedly have introduced many others             ;  but his coadjutors pro

        Before closing this brief notice have pleasure in adverting to a
 trait of pur late Secretary's character, which did him honour. *I
 mean his sincere; desire to render      himself useful     to those with whom,
 as  officially representing the Society, or from congeniality of pur
 suit, he was brought in contact          It may be, that all whom he thus
 favoured were not equally deseryipg, but that, as a general rule, he
 endeavoured to attract) notice to, merit cannot be doubted.                 The
 slightest    recommendation,   or  none   besides  ingenuity, were sufficient
 to claim a# interest in him, and during many years his house and his
 table were hospitably open to those who asked his advice or required
 his epcQuragementt        I have a pleasure in recording my personal ob^
 ligations to him at      a time    when    I  had scarcely a single scientific
 friend   ; when, and for long after,     I  received from him such substan
 tial proofs of kindness,    as it is impossible that     I  should ever forget.

 manner      was a favourite topic with him, and it is a duty of the police
  certainly too much neglected, more especially in London.                    The
  substitution of our present cast-iron lamp-post, with the name of the
  street cast on each, replacing the expensive, ugly, and ineffective con
  struction of the old ones, was, I believe, due to Sir John.

The considerable number of foreigners who annually visit Edinburgh,
and to whom his leisure was always dedicated,           found at his house
almost a home     ; and as he spoke the French language with fluency
and correctness, his society was invariably sought by them, what
ever might be     their department of study, their country, or political
opinions.     The exiled Royal Family of France, and their numerous
friends, had, during their stay in Edinburgh, reason to be gratified
by his attentions, and they shewed that they were so.            Down to the
period of his death    he remained   in correspondence with some of those
whose acquaintance he then made ; and their letters shewed that his
zeal for their interests was not restricted to the period of their stay
in this country.*
     " Sir John Robison   was, like his distinguished father, of a tall and
commanding figure.        No likeness has,    I believe, been preserved of
him, except a daguerreotype and some calotypes, done shortly before
his death.     One of these is an admirable portrait.          In  general he
enjoyed excellent      health,  and was scarcely ever absent from the
meetings of any society which he usually attended.            A considerable
deafness, which affected him for the last two or three years, was,
however, exceedingly irksome to him, and interrupted            this regular
ity.    Although subject for many years (at least       since   1831)   to oc
casional palpitation     of the heart,   he kept disease at a distance by
habitual abstemiousness      ; and his constitution did not appear to suf
fer any shock until       the 6th February 1843, when he abruptly
quitted his usual place at the table of the Royal Society Club, owing
to some indisposition, which did not, however, immediately assume a
threatening form.      The activity of his mind did not desert him ; for,
 on the 27th February, he gave a notice of Messrs Naysmith's beau
 tiful invention of the Steam Forge-hammer at the Society of Arts,
 which was also the principal subject of his last personal communica
 tion with myself.     His death, which took place after only      a few days'
 illness, and which was occasioned     by the rupture of some important
 bloodvessel, occurred     on the 7th March 1843, being then in his
 65th year."
     * A letter to him, from one of the exiled French nobility, which ar
 rived a few days after his decease, was filled with commissions involving
  no common trouble and responsibility, which he was requested to exe
  cute.

2.     On a method               of rendering Magnetical Instruments Self-

the motion         of the needle-point will               be indicated

filings       attracted by the magnet, separate themselves from
              which,
the homogeneous dust around.   The fineness of this line will de
pend  on the sharpness of the needle point, and the smallness of the
particles of iron the distance of the point from the paper will de
                            ;
pend on the strength of the magnet, and the smoothness of the
surface on which                the particles lie.        In   some       experiments        already
made, lines have been obtained as fine as could be produced                                     by the
sharpest pointed pencil, and this with    portion only of    small

                                                 a
ments to determine the best size for the magnet, and the best kind
of paper for the filings.  The particles of iron having a certain
weight, are not easily shaken from their position   moderate care              if
be taken.
       If a

 nation magnet, and      sheet of paper dusted with iron filings be
                                  a
 moved by clock-work,    in the direction of the magnetic meridian, the
 oscillations of the magnet towards the E. or W. will be indicated in
 the iron filings by the corresponding motions of the vertical needle.
       One scale division of the declinometer                       used      in the Makerstoun
 Observatory           is   equivalent to about 40", and            a    tenth of      a   division or
 4" can be estimated              :   with the addition        of   a   light and rigid rod to
 the declination            magnet, by means of which the vertical needle could
 be       placed at    a    distance of about three feet from the suspension
 thread, a change of declination to the amount of 6" would be equiva
 lent to a motion of -001 of an inch at the needle,      quantity which        a
 may be estimated with the aid of     scale and vernier.

       Mr Brown         proposes      to convert   a     vertical into     a   horizontal     motion,
     employing the influence of a magnet moved vertically upon
     by
 another suspended horizontally.   In this way he intends to measure
 the movements of the vertical force magnetometer, and of the com
 mon baromoter, by means of                  a   floating magnet.

3.   Verbal Notice respecting the Thyroid, Thymus, and Supra
                renal Bodies.     By John Goodsir, Esq.
    In a verbal notice   of researches  into the nature of the thyroid,
thymus, and suprarenal bodies,   Mr Goodsir stated that    these three ano
malous organs, situated respectively in the neck, chest, and abdomen,
are in the embryo connected together in the form of two continuous
masses, one on each side of the spine, from the base        of the cranium
to the origin of the omphalo-mesenteric          arteries.    The first or
abdominal portion of each of these masses,           grouped around the
origins   of the omphalo-mesenteric    arteries, become    the supra-renal
capsules.     The middle or thoracic portions, situated in the lateral
parts of the thorax, where the lungs, at this period in the middle
line, are afterwards to be, pass forwards to give place to the latter,
and unite across the front of the pericardium, and become the
thymus gland.
    The anterior or cervical portion of this united mass separates from
the posterior or thymus, groups itself around the anastomosing
branches (inferior and superior thyroid arteries) of the first and
second branchial arteries (the carotids and subclavians), and remains
permanently as the thyroid.
    The two lateral masses, out of which these       three bodies are thus
 originally  formed,  Mr Goodsir  has found to be a portion    of the mem-
 brana intermedia of the area vasculosa     of the egg.     Such being the
 morphology, the detection of the function of these three bodies would
 require very delicate chemical inquiry.      In general terms, however,
 it may be stated to be the same as that of the blastoderma.

1.   On the recent Scottish Madrepores,    with Remarks on the
         Climatic Character of the Extinct Races.  By the Rev.
         Dr Fleming.
   The author, in this communication, referred, in the first instance,
to the three species   of Lamelliferous Polyparia, described in his
" British Animals," Edin., 1828,
                                  exhibiting specimens of the Caryo-
phyllea cyathus, and Turbinolia borealis of that work, together with
a characteristic drawing, by the late Mrs Hibbert, of the Pocillopora
inter -stincta, there alluded to as a native of the Zetland                 seas.        He
then exhibited a specimen,            six pounds in weight, of the Madrepora
,prolifera of Miiller, which was found last summer by fishermen,
their lines having become entangled with                 it,
                                             in the sea between the
islands of Rum and Egg.     This species was known to Pontoppidan,
as   anative of the Norwegian               seas, and   is   now ascertained to be        a
native of the Hebrides.
   The author next exhibited specimens of the Turbinolia sepulta of
the crag, together with    new and recent species from the Cape of
                                  a
Good Hope.           In    conclusion, the author observed,           that while, from
an acquaintance with the habits of a few individuals, we could safely
speculate respecting the geographical and physical distribution of a
species, we cannot, from our acquaintance with the history                of one   species
of   genus, predicate with any confidence respecting the character of
     a
other species       of
                the same genus.   Thus, there are species of Madre
pores natives of tropical seas, and there are species natives o.1 the
North seas. After illustrating his views by reference to the species
                                                         a
of the genera Bos and Elephas, the author closed his observations by
stating, that the evidence,         proving the climate, during the deposition

                                          83
  of the mountain limestone, to have been warmer than at present, as
  derived from    its contained organic remains, was defective, since the
  organisms compared did not belong to individuals of the same species,
  but to species of similar genera.
  2.   On the principle of       Vital Affinity, as illustrated by recent
         Observations        in Organic Chemistry.           Part I. By Dr
         Alison.
      The objects of this paper were, first, to vindicate the use of the
  term   affinity, and assert the principle which that term is intended to
  express, viz., that in living bodies ordinary chemical affinities under
  go a certain change or modification, either by the addition of affini
  ties peculiar to the     living state, or the suspension of     some    of  those
  which act elsewhere       ;  and, secondly, to attempt,     from a review of
  facts  recently ascertained, an exposition of the laws, according to
  which these modifications of ordinary chemical affinities take place,
  and a discrimination      of those changes in living bodies, which may be
  ascribed   to them.
      In proof of the first of these points, the author referred particu
  larly to the facts known as to the formation           of starch, or its allied
  compounds, from carbonic acid and water by an action of certain
  parts of living vegetables under the influence of light, whereby the
  carbonic acid is decomposed        and   oxygen evolved ; maintaining that
  this change, essential to the condition of all organized bodies, is so
  distinctly at variance with the ordinary chemical relations of carbon
  and oxygen, and even          with  those which    shew themselves     in other
  parts  of vegetables in the living state, and in all parts in the dead
  state, — that we are equally bound to regard it as a strictly vital
  phenomenon, as the contraction of a muscle on a stimulus ; and that
  we   cannot rightly apprehend either         phenomenon unless we regard
  them as dependent on certain laws of vital action or           of vitality.
      On the    second   point, he observed,     that the physiologist is con-
-
  cerned only with      those formations      and resolutions of organic com
  pounds    which take place in the interior of living bodies, and that,
  premising that the first introduction of every species of organized
  being into the world must have been by a miraculous interposition
  of Divine Power, beyond the limits of scientific inquiry, the objects
  of investigation in this department of physiology appear to be more
  definite, and the strictly vital affinities which now operate, from the
  commencement of the life of vegetables to the death and decomposi

                                      84
tion of animals, to be fewer and simpler than had generally been
supposed.
    I. The    first kind of action which may be ascribed to vital affinity,
he described as the mere selection and retention, by certain portions
of a solid, of certain substances, whether elementary or compound,
already existing in a fluid that is brought in contact with it, or what
 is called by some a chemical filtration.       This power is exemplified
in living vegetables, particularly in the appropriation by them of
some of the earthy and saline matters which are brought to their
roots, and the rejection of others ; it is more strikingly seen in the
development of the lower classes of animals, especially those of the
radiata and mollusca, which have horny or earthy integuments ; and
it is certainly the chief power concerned in all        those   functions of
animals, to which we give the names          of absorption, secretion, and
even nutrition.
    In  regard to this simplest form of vital affinity,       the following
points seem ascertained       :—
    1.  That it    is usually, if not always, performed in a perfect or
ganized being, by an attractive agency of living or growing cells
which seem always to perform the double office of extracting from
the nourishing fluid the material of their own growth and reproduc
tion, and extracting also the fluid or solid matter which they are
to contain, or with which they are to be incrusted.
    The matters thus consolidated from         a fluid in which they pre
viously existed, by a simple process of attraction and increased ag
gregation, not precipitated by any chemical separation of their com
ponent parts, assume        the forms peculiar to each organized body to
which they are thus added, but retain that peculiarity which in in
organic matter exists only in fluids, — that the smallest portion of
them contains all the chemical ingredients which belong to the mass,
and thus any crystalline arrangement is prevented.
    2. That no difference, of form or of composition, can be detected
in the different cells of an organized structure, to explain the differ
ence of the matters which they thus extract ; and that, in the first
development of organized beings, the difference of selecting power
exercised at different points of the germinal membrane, appears to
be determined       by no other condition than their position, —just as
different portions of nervous matter, differing only in anatomical po
sition, exert perfectly different vital powers, or, in the state of dis
ease   (e.g., of inflammation), peculiar attractions and repulsions ap

                                         85
pear to exist, for a time, simply at particular         spots   of the vascular
system.
    The attractions by which living cells thus appropriate to them
selves portions of contiguous fluids, are obviously analogous to those
by which      even   inorganic porous substances attract different fluids
with different degrees of force, and thereby produce the phenomena
of endosmose      and exosmose, but are broadly distinguished from them
by the peculiarity        of the changes thus effected, by their infinite
variety, even in different parts of the same structure, and by their
uniformly temporary existence.
     II.   The actual transformations, or       new arrangements of the che
mical elements which take place in living bodies, and are peculiar
to   them, are illustrated by the examples of the formation of starch
from water and carbonic acid, oxygen             escaping ; and of the forma
tion of fat from starch, carbonic acid and water escaping.
     It appears to be in the cells of organized structures that those
 transformations are likewise effected        ;  and as the action of cells in
simply extracting        portions   of the nourishing    fluid, is analogous to
 the physical      principle of   endosmose,    so their action in these meta
 morphosis may be illustrated,         but by no means      explained, by com
 paring them to those chemical actions to which the term catalysis is
 applied.
     Two general observations may be made on both these modifica
 tions of the power of vital affinity, — first, that they obviously trans
ferred from the portions of matter already endowed with them, to
 those which, in the growth of living beings, are added to, or substi
 tuted    for, those portions of matter     ; just  as muscular fibres already
 existing, communicate to all the matter which is added             to them by
 the process     of nutrition, the    same contractile   properties which they
 themselves possess ; secondly, that every portion of matter to which
 any such vital properties are imparted, appears to enjoy them only
  for a short time     ; losing them so rapidly that a vital process of ab
  sorption    and   excretion  is necessary, throughout the whole existence
  at least   of animals, to eliminate     from their bodies     materials which
  have    lost these    properties   and  reverted to the condition of dead
  matter.
      After stating    these general principles regarding vital affinities, the
  author made some more special remarks on the most fundamental of
  all the changes in organized beings which may be referred to their
   a<;tion, viz., the formation of starch and its allied compounds from

                                      86
 carbonic acid and water under the influence of light, and consequent
 purification  of the atmosphere    ;  and he insisted chiefly on the fol
 lowing points : —
    1. That this change is probably gradual; the carbonic acid being
 taken into the juices of the plant and slowly decomposed there, more
 or less completely, according to circumstances, whence result not only
 starch or its allied compounds, but likewise different organic acids
and various oils.
    2. That the formation of sugar in plants is probably to be regarded
 rather as a simply chemical action than as a result of vital affinities ;
 or that it is a first product of the decomposition of starch by the
agency of water and oxygen.
    3. That, on the other hand, the formation        of lignin, containing
 more carbon and less oxygen, from starch or from cellulose, and from
 the carbonic acid and water brought into the cells, appears to be the
 result of a strictly vital affinity, strongest at the period of greatest
 vigour of the plant.
    4. That in this, as in other of the metamorphoses          which take
place in living beings, and which he proposes farther         to examine,
the carbon, thus originally    fixed on the earth's surface from the at
mosphere,     appears to be the chief material   employed by nature for
the formation of all organized structures, and to be invested, for that
purpose, with peculiar and transient vital affinities, while oxygen
hardly appears to exert any chemical powers in living bodies, dif
ferent from those which it manifests elsewhere ; but is taken into
the interior of all living bodies, only that it may support the excre
tions which are continually going on in them, and resolving organized
into inorganic matter ; and thus, that it gradually resumes its power
over the carbon which     had been temporarily      separated  from it for
the formation of the animated part of creation.

 2.   On the appearance of the Great Comet of 1843,                   at the
        Cape of Good Hope, with illustrative Drawings.                    By
        Professor C. P. Smyth.            Communicated by the Secre
        tary.
     This  comet attracted much attention from its excessive brightness
 at and near its perihelion      passage,  as well as from the length and
 form of its tail.       The drawings were intended to represent these
particulars,    and  the changes which occurred during the time that the
comet remained visible from the Cape Observatory.
     It was seen for a short time, but not generally, before the perihe
lion passage, which took place on the 27th February 1843 ; and it
ceased to be visible      by the naked eye towards the end of March,
though it could be discerned with the telescope till the 19th April.
     After passing the perihelion, this object was seen on the 3d March,
about a quarter of an hour after sunset.      The head then glistened like
a   star of the second magnitude, and had a well-defined planetary disc,
about 20" in diameter, having an envelope of rays, the brightest of
which came out like wings on both sides.          The tail, which was 40°
lonn;, was in form bifid ; its two sides were very narrow,       bright and
straight, the space between       the sides almost as dark as the neigh
bouring sky.       There were also two faint streamers on either side of
the tail.
     On the 4th March, one of the streamers had disappeared, and the
space between       the central streamers had become       less dark.    The
planetary disc was also less defined.
     On the 9th March, the planetary disc had disappeared,       in place of

                                   88
which there was a mere coma, having a thickening towards the mid
 dle. Both streamers of the tail had disappeared, and the dark axial
 space was filled with a faint luminosity.    The tail, however, had  be
 come longer.
    The tail, which   was  at this time preceding the head, was curved
 slightly towards the aphelion, and was also in advance of a line
joining the sun with the comet's head.
    With a small telescope of low power, indications of   a nucleus often
appeared, but were as often dispelled by the employment          of more
 powerful instruments.      When the tail appeared to the naked       eye
 upwards of 40° long, nothing like a solid or stellar nucleus could be
discovered.     There was only a mass of vapour, which, though con
 densed in certain   parts, was still permeable to the rays of the mi
 nutest stars.

    The following Communications             were read     : —
1.   On the Description of Oval Curves, and those having a
       plurality of Foci. By Mr Clerk Maxwell junior ; with
       remarks by Professor Forbes. Communicated by Pro
        fessor Forbes.
    Mr Clerk Maxwell        ingeniously suggests the extension of the com
mon theory of the foci of the conic sections to curves of a higher
degree    of complication in the following manner : —
    (1.) As in the ellipse and hyperbola, any point in the curve has
the sum or difference of two lines drawn from two points or foci =
a constant     quantity,   so  the author infers,    that curves to a certain
degree     analogous, may be described and determined by the condi
tion that the simple distance from one focus plus a multiple distance
from the other,     may be     =  a constant  quantity  ;  or more generally,
to  times the one distance + n times the other = constant.
    (2.) The author devised a simple mechanical means, by the wrap
ping of a thread round pins, for producing these curves.              See Figs.
 1  & 2 (Plate II.) He then thought of extending the principle to
 other curves, whose property should be, that the sum of the simple or
 multiple distances of any point of the curve from three or more points
 or foci, should be   =   a constant quantity  ;  and this, too, he has effect
 ed  mechanically,   by a very simple arrangement         of a string of given
 length passing round three or more fixed pins, and constraining a
 tracing point, P. See Fig. 3. Farther, the author regards curves of
 the first  kind as constituting   a particular  class of curves  of the second
 kind, two or more foci coinciding in one, a focus in which two strings
 meet being considered a double focus ; when three strings meet a
 treble focus, &c.
     Professor Forbes observed that the equation to curves of the first
 class are easily found, having the form
                      */x2 +y2 —a      +  bV (x— c)a +y2,

                                              90
 which is that of the curve known under the name of the                       First Oval
 of Descartes.*         Mr Maxwell had already observed that when one
 of the foci     was   at an infinite distance, (or the thread moved parallel
 to itself, and was confined in respect of length by the edge of a
 board,) a curve resembling an ellipse was traced ; from which property
 Professor Forbes was led first to infer the identity of the oval with
 the Cartesian oval, which is well known to have this property.                      But
 the simplest analogy of all is that derived from the method of de
 scription, r and       ¥ being the radients        to any point      of the curve from
 the two foci ;
                               m  r  + n     / = constant,
 which in fact at once expresses on the undulatory theory of light
 the optical character of the surface in question, namely, that light
 diverging from one focus F without the medium, shall be correctly
convergent at another point            /   within it   ;  and in this case the ratio
  71
 —   expresses      the index of refraction of the medium.-)-
  m
    If we     denote by the power of either focus the number of strings
leading     to  it by Mr Maxwell's construction, and if one of the foci be
 removed to an infinite distance, if the powers of the two foci be
equal the curve is a parabola ; if the power of the nearer focus be
greater than the other, the curve is an ellipse                 ;   if the power of the
infinitely distant       focus   be   the greater,        the curve is a hyperbola.
The first      case  evidently corresponds to the case of the reflection of
parallel     rays to a focus,     the velocity being unchanged after reflec
tion  ;   the second,     to the refraction of parallel rays to a focus in a
dense medium          (in which light moves          slower)  ;   the third case to re
fraction into a rarer medium.
    The    ovals   of Descartes    were described        in his Geometry, where he
has also given a        mechanical method of describing one of them, \ but
only in a particular        case,   and the method is less simple than Mr
Maxwell's.         The demonstration of the optical properties was given
by Newton in the          Principia, Book I., prop. 97,               by the law  of the
sines   ;  and by Huyghens         in 1690,     on    the Theory of Undulations in
his Traite de la Lumiere.             It  probably has not been suspected that
so easy and elegant a method exists of describing these curves by the
use of a thread and pins whenever the powers of the foci are com-

mensurable.       For instance, the curve, Fig. 2, drawn with powers                 3
and 2 respectively,       give the proper form for a refracting            surface of
glass, whose index       of refraction is 1-50, in order that rays diverging
from    / may   be refracted to      F.
     As  to the  higher    classes   of curves with three or more focal points,
we cannot at present            invest them with equally clear and curious
physical     properties,      but the    method of drawing a curve              by so
simple a contrivance, which shall satisfy the condition
                   mr    + n     / + p r"    + &c. = constant,
is  in itself not a little interesting ; and if we regard, with Mr Max
well, the ovals above described, as the limiting case of the others by
the coalescence      of two or      more foci, we have a farther generaliza
tion of the same       kind as that so highly commended by Montucla,*
by    which Descartes elucidated the conic           sections    as particular   cases
of his oval curves.
 2.   On the Influence of Contractions of Muscles on the Circu
     lation of the Blood.           By Dr Wardrop.
     In  this paper,   Dr Wardrope         states that he has endeavoured           to
 shew, by a series of observations and experiments, that the muscles,
 besides being the active organs of motion, perform, by their contrac
 tions, an important office in the circulation of the arterial as well as
 venous blood ; an       office which     has  not hitherto      been   described   by
 physiologists, but which appears to be capable of explaining several
 interesting phenomena in the living body, of which no satisfactory
 account has yet been given.
 3.    On the Solubility of Fluoride of Calcium in Water, and
     the relation of this property to the occurrence of that
      Substance in Minerals, and in recent and Fossil Plants
      and Animals.         By Dr G. Wilson.
     After   a preliminary reference to the existence of fluorine in recent
 and fossil bones,     Dr Wilson stated that he had made a series of ex
 periments with a view to discover what solvent carried fluoride                     of
 calcium into the tissues of plants and animals.                His first trials were
 made     with carbonic acid, which was passed in a current through
 water containing pure fluor-spar in fine powder suspended in it. The
 fluor was by this treatment dissolved, yielding a solution which pre
 cipitated oxalate of ammonia, and when evaporated left a residue
                * Hietoire   des Mathematiques.    First Edit,. II., 102.

                                       92
which,    on  being heated     with  sulphuric   acid, gave  off hydrofluoric
acid.
    The author    was, in consequence,    inclined to suppose that carbonic
acid conferred upon water the power of dissolving fluoride of calcium.
But on observing that long after the whole of that gas had been ex
pelled by warming the liquid, the latter remained untroubled, he
became satisfied that water alone can dissolve fluoride of calcium,
contrary to the universal statement of writers on chemistry.
    On prosecuting the inquiry, he found that water at 212° dissolved
more of the fluor than water at 60°, but he has not yet ascertained
the proportion taken up by that liquid at either temperature.
    The aqueous solution of fluoride of calcium was found to give, with
salts of baryta, a precipitate which required a large addition of hy
drochloric or nitric acid to redissolve it.         The author pointed out
the difficulty which must in consequence occur, in distinguishing be
tween dissolved fluoride and sulphates, and suggested that fluorides
 may have     been mistaken     for sulphates in the analysis of mineral
 water.
    He referred     also to the objection which must      now lie against the
present method of determining the quantity of fluorine present in
bodies, consisting, as it does, in converting that element into fluoride
 of calcium, which, in the course of the necessary analytical opera
tions, is washed freely, and must be sensibly diminished in quantity          ;
a fact which has      of necessity  been hitherto overlooked.     Dr Wilson
stated that he was not yet able to suggest         an unexceptionable quan
titative process   ;   but that the fluoride    of barium, being much less
 soluble than the fluoride of calcium, might, in the meanwhile, be
 substituted for it in the estimation of fluorine.
    The author     proceeded   to state, that in consequence of the obser
 vations he had made as to the solubility of fluoride of calcium on
 water, he had been led to look for that body in natural waters, and
 had found it in one of the wells of Edinburgh, namely, in that sup
 plying the brewery of       Mr  Campbell    in the Cowgate, behind Minto
 House.      At  the same time, he stated      that preceding observers had
 already found it in other waters.       He   believed, however, that he was
 the first to detect     it in sea-water, where, by using the bittern or
 mother-liquor of the salt-pans in which water from the Frith of Forth
 is evaporated, he had found it present in most notable quantity. The
 author referred to the presence of fluorine in sea-water, as adding
 another link to the chain of observed analogies between that body
 and chlorine, iodine, and bromine.

                                      93
   Dr Wilson further     stated, that he had confirmed the observations
of Will,  as to the presence    of fluorine in plants, and Berzelius' dis
covery that fluorine exists in the secretion from        the kidneys    ;  and
tad, in addition, detected fluorine in the blood and milk, in neither
of which has it been     hitherto suspected    to occur.    The paper was
concluded   by some observations on the presence      of fluorine in fossils,
and its relations   to animal life.

 stated,  that in searching for that substance among the more volatile
 products of the distillation of coal-tar, he had been enabled to con
firm its existence in small quantity,    as well as that   of the     new base
to which he has given the name of picoline.
    Picoline is obtained in the pure state by several successive distilla
tions of the mixed bases contained in coal-tar, after the perfect separa
tion of pyrrol and empyreumatic oils, by processes described at length
in the paper, and finally by collecting the product which distilled at
272° Fahrenheit.        The analysis of the  base purified     by these pro
                                                   —

    This corresponds with the formula    C12 II7 N, which is that of ani
line  ;  and the author further found by    the analysis of the platinum
salt of picoline, that its atomic weight is identical with that of aniline.
    The identity in constitution, however, of these substances is accom
panied by an entire difference in properties. Picoline having a specific
gravity of 0-955 boiling at 272°, and being soluble in water in all pro
portions ; it is incapable of giving the violet colour with chloride of
lime, and the yellow colour to fir wood moistened with hydrochloric
acid, which are produced by aniline, and it gives, with chloride of gold,
a highly characteristic precipitate, soluble in hot water, and deposited,
on cooling, in delicate yellow needles.   The author    observed that these

                                                     95
properties approximated   in some respects to those of Unverdorben' s
odorin, and stated that he had separated from the oleum cornu cervi,
a   mixture of several oily                bases, one     of which       was soluble       in water,
but which did not agree perfectly either with the characters                                of pico-
line, or those which Unverdorben                      has attributed          to odorin.
   The author then details the properties and constitution of the com
pounds of picoline, which differ in many respects from those of aniline.
It gives with sulphuricacid an acid compound whichdeliquesces rapidly
in the air, and which has the formula C12 H7 N + 2 (H O, S 0                                       3).
Its platinum salt          is    identical in constitution with that of aniline, but
its mercury         compound         is   C12   H7   N    +   Hg   Cl2   ,   while that of aniline
is  2
        (C12   H7   N)     +    3   Hg CI       2.
     The author then treats of              the products of the decomposition of pico
line, a branch of the subject on which, owing to the small quantity
of  the substance at his disposal, he was enabled only to make  few                           a
observations, which, however, tend to shew that the action of reagents
on   itremarkably different from that which they produce on aniline.
          is
The action of nitric acid was found to be extremely slow and par
tial, long continued ebullition producing only  very slight evolutiona
of  nitrous acid, without any of the blue colour which aniline gives,
and apparently            without      the formation          of carbazotic acid.
                                                          Bromine
gives an oily product heavier than water, and different, of course,
from the solid bromaniloid of Fritsche.
   The author concludes by remarking, that the present     the first                   is
perfectly established case of isomerism among organic bases, those
previously recorded being devoid of absolutely conclusive evidence,
and by pointing            out the interest which attaches to the isomerism of
two substances            such      as aniline and picoline,         which are members of
one     of the most interesting and extensive groups of organic                                 sub
stances, the indigo, salicyl, and benzoil series.
2.    Notice of Polished and Striated Rocks recently discovered
       on Arthur Seat, and in some other places near Edin
       burgh. By David Milne, Esq.
     Mr Milne stated, that, in the gully situated between Arthur Seat
and Sampson's          great extent of rock had been recently ex
                          Ribs,   a
posed (by the removal of clay and other superficial deposits) which
was found to be smoothed as well as furrowed or scratched.
     The gully       is   about 30 feet wide, at the lowest level to which                         it

                                              96
has been hollowed out, and at one part, both of its sides are composed
of these smoothed furrowed rocks ; but, in general, it is only on one
side, viz., that next to Arthur              Seat, that rock exists.      There, the
appearances of smoothing and rutting extend for about 80 yards.
  The gully runs about NW. and SE. by compass.        The highest
point in it is near the north end.                  At   both ends it is open       and
sinks    to    a level     with the adjoining        level country.   The gully is
about 200 feet above the level of Duddingston                  Loch, and 400 feet
above the sea.    Arthur Seat forms on the east side of it a precipi
tous cliff of about 250 feet.
   The walls of the gully consist (so far as yet exposed, in the for
mation of the Victoria road), for about 5 feet upwards, of vertical
rock.
     This rock towards the north            end    of the gully is a compact por
phyry; towards the south             end,   of friable porphyry. At the north end
the polishing        has been greatest.
     The scratches       are in general      nearly horizontal   ;   a few slope    up
wards to the south         ;   these are at the north end of the        gully, where
it is narrowest.
    The longest         scratches    are about 6 feet long, from -J to        i inch
deep and an inch wide.
     There are, especially towards the south end of the gully, many
spots   of    a few inches square, where there has been neither polishing
nor scratching.          These all face towards the south.
   The deposit immediately above those rocks, and which has com
pletely filled up the gully, is a brown tenacious clay, full of boulders
of all sizes. The boulders consist of traps (some of them of rock not
existing in the neighbourhood) and sedimentary rocks. Whilst there
are sandstone  fragments, which are very similar to those on Salisbury
Crag,  there are  limestones, supposed not to exist nearer than Fife.
   This boulder clay is not so tenacious as the blackish-blue boulder
clay generally prevalent in the Lothians.   It, however, resembles in
all respects a deposit of the same kind, existing at the foot of Samp
son's   Ribs, which is about 160            feet below the level of the    gully.
   Above the boulder clay in the gully there is a mass of debris, de
rived apparently from the crumbling of the rocks above on the face
of Arthur       Seat.     Three     species of marine shells have been found          in
this    mass    ;   but, as human bones            and Roman     remains have       also
been discovered in         it,   the probability    is, that these shells have been
brought by human hands.

                                         97
    In the cuttings for the North British Railway,           between  Arthur
 Seat and Musselburgh,        the upper sides of the large boulders are ge
nerally found smoothed and scratched.          The scratches seem to be from
NW. to WNW. by compass.                On some of the boulders there are in
dications of more recent scratches running W. * S. by compass.
    The boulders in the railway cuttings between Haddington and
Dunbar exhibit scratches running from NW. to WNW.
    The opinion formed by the author on these data was, —
    (1.)   That the agent which had polished and scratched the rocks
on   Arthur Seat,       was   the same    as that   which had polished     and
scratched     the boulders.
    (2.)   That it had acted from the north-westward over a large and
low district of country.
    (3.) That the polishing and scratching had been effected by the
gravel and angular blocks existing in the boulder clay and diluvial
gravel.
                                       rushes of water along the country,
    (4.) That there had         been
which bore along the mud, sand, gravel, and boulders now spread
over the country, and which, in passing over the rocks and large
boulders,    smoothed and rutted them.
    (5.) That, at this period and subsequently, water must         have stood,
in a comparatively       tranquil  state, above the level of Sampson's   Ribs,
to account      for the beds of sand existing on the south side of Arthur
 Seat, and at a level of 200 feet above Duddingston Loch.
    (6.)   That the outline or configuration       of the district, thus  sub
merged, could not have been materially          different from what it now
presents.
 3.  Results of the Makerstoun Observations, No. II. On the
         Relation of the Variations of the Vertical Component
         of the Earth's Magnetic Intensity to the Solar and Lu
         nar Periods. By J. Allan Broun, Esq. Communicated
         by General Sir T. M. Brisbane, Bart.
    The following      results are deduced    from the observations of the
 balance or vertical force magnetometer described in the Introduction
to the Makerstoun        Observations.      The observations were corrected
for temperature by a method previously described.
    The diurnal variation of      the vertical   component consisted, in the
year 1844, of three maxima           and three    minima, occurring    as  fol
lows   : —

                The principal minimum at 14 10 Makerstoun mean time.
                A  secondary maximum      at 20 SO
                A secondary minimum       at 22 50
                 The principal maximum at 6 80
                 A third minimum          at 12 10
                 A third maximum          at 13 10
     The third maximum and minimum are but faintly marked.                        The
 form of the diurnal curve, and the periods and number of maxima
 and minima,       vary     throughout the year ; neglecting the inferior
 maximum and minimum, the diurnal curve is single in winter and
double in summer, the principal minimum occurs at noon in summer.
     The diurnal range is greatest at the equinoxes, and least at the
solstices, the range at the former being nearly two and a half times
that at the latter.
    Each of the       mean values      of the vertical component at 21h and
 0b , is nearly equal to the mean for the year.                 The secular varia
tion is negative.
    The investigation for the relation of the variations of the vertical
component to the moon's hour angle, gives for the mean of the two
years 1844 and 1845          —
The principal minimum about 5 hours before the moon's passage of the inferior meridian.
The principal maximum about 8 hours after
A  secondary minimum about 4 hours before                             superior
A secondary maximum about     1 hour after
    The results for     each year differ      little from the   mean  of both   ;  the
secondary maximum            and minimum are not so well shewn in 1844
as   in 1845.      The observations of single months, when free from
magnetic disturbances, have been found to give the same periods.
    Investigations were made for a period connected with the moon's
phase or synodical revolution ; each of the years 1844 and 1845
indicates maxima         of the vertical component near the quadratures,
and minima near the syzygies.
4.    Two Verbal         Notices.          (1.) On the Geology of Arthur
        Seat.     (2.) On the Dentition of the Walrus.                       By the
       Rev. Dr Fleming.
    (1.) Dr Fleming read the following passage from Townson's
" Tracts and Observations in Natural History," Edin. 1799, when
treating   of the " Rocks in the Vicinity of Edinburgh :" — " The first
of the chains or ranges of rocks that              I lately described, as lying at

                                         99
the back of      Salisbury Crags, extends from Arthur Seat           to St  An
thony's chapel.        It  is composed   of basalt and sandstone, neither of
which are like the whin and sandstone              of Salisbury Crags.      The
basalt    is the same as      that near Duddingston Loch.       The stratified
matter forms        a bed     two or three yards thick near St Anthony's
chapel.      Some of it is very hard, and strikes fire with steel, but ef
fervesces    with  acids, and has an argillaceous      smell, but the greatest
part is soft and friable, and seems to be merely the finer debris and
powder of the breccia, perhaps a kind of trass or terrass.              It  con
tains a great many vegetable impressions, with the charred matter
still existing.     They appear to be the same which are so frequently
found    in the strata that accompany coal.         The large irregular basal
tic columns at     St Anthony's chapel        rest upon this." P. 214.        Dr
Fleming stated that he was induced to bring into notice this seem
ingly neglected observation of Townson, as likely to interest those
 members of the Society who attach themselves to the study of the
geology     of the district.
    (2.)   Mr Lyell,    in the first volume of his " Travels in North Ame
rica," London 1845, p. 258, has the following remarks in reference
to the skull of a Walrus, from the tertiary beds of Gayhead, in the
island of Martha's Vineyard, Mussachusetts,           —"   I purchased from a
fisherman, residing near the promontory, a fossil skull, which he
 told me had fallen out of this conglomerate upon the beach below.
 It retained but a small portion of the original animal matter, was
 slightly rolled, and Mr Owen recognised it as the cranium of a Wal
 rus or Morse, nearly allied to the existing species (Trichecus Ros-
marus, Linn.)         On comparison it was observed to differ from it, in
having six (a misprint for three, as is evident from the figure given of
the organism in Plate V.) molar teeth, instead of four on each side of
 the upper jaw.       There are eleven specimens of recent species in the
 College of Surgeons, in all of which there are no more than four grind
 ers on each side. The tusk, also, of the Gayhead fossil has a rounder
form than that     of the recent Morse     (see Plate V.)" Dr Fleming stated
that, on perusing the above passage, he was induced to examine the ex
amples     of the recent skulls of the Walrus in his     possession.   This ex
 amination led him to observe a degree of irregularity in the denti
 tion of this animal, differing from the statement in the passage, as
depending on the appearances              of the eleven     specimens    in  the
 Museum of the College of Surgeons of London.                He placed    on the
 table four examples.
     1.  In  the first specimen there were three grinders        on each side,

                                      100
as  in the fossil example,   and an alveolus on each side, behind, nearly
filled up.
    2.  In   the second   example there were four grinders on the one
side and five in the other, the last being small.
    3.  In  the third example there were four grinders on each side,
and two shallow sockets on each side behind, out of which the teeth
had recently fallen, and the trace of a seventh obliterated alveolus on
each side.
    4.  In  the fourth example there were         five grinders   on each side
and one nearly obliterated alveolus on each side.
    The incisors appeared     to be equally    irregular in their number and
development.       Thus,  in the 1st, there was one incisor on the one
side and only an obliterated      socket   in the other.      In   the 2d, one
incisor on one side.     In  the 3d, two incisors on one side and one in
the other.      In the 4iA, one on each side.
    Dr Fleming concluded his communication by stating, that the few
examples which were before the Society, while they indicated very
plainly an irregularity in the dentition of the Walrus, not perceived
in the   eleven  London examples, forbade our attaching any import
ance to the Gayhead        organism,   as   referable    to an extraordinary
variety, and still less to a new species of the genus Trichecus.

Sir THOMAS MAKDOUGALL BRISBANE,                                                       Bart., Presi

  The following Communications                           were read            :   —
1. On the  Mean Height of the Barometer in different Lati
     tudes. By Professor Hansteen of Christiania.    Com
     municated in a letter to the Secretary.
  Professor Hansteen first shews, that the remarkable difference of
1-62 French lines, by which the barometer reduced to the level of
the sea, is higher at Paris than at Christiania, cannot be ascribed
solely to the effect of the difference of gravity of the mercury in the
barometer at the two places. The author then gives an empirical
formula to represent the mean height of the barometer in any lati
tude which he compares with observations.                            This formula is the fol
lowing —
  ,v|/=336-810         + 1-304 cos.           2p--748         cos.    4p-0-914           cos.   6p
                                   +,   0-543 cos. 8          <p.
Where    4*   is   the oscillation in French lines, and                  tp   the latitude.

 2. On the      Extent to which Fluoride of Calcium is Soluhle in
       Water at 60° F. By Dr George Wilson.
    Dr Wilson stated, that the object of his communication was to
supplement a paper read to the Royal Society, April 6, 1846, on
the solubility of fluoride of calcium in water.                He was not then able
to state the extent   of its solubility in that liquid, but he has since as
certained the weight of the salt in question, which water at 60° can
dissolve.      The solutions referred to in the following statements were
prepared from native well-crystallized fluor-spar.                 This was first di
gested   in warm dilute     aqua    regia, to remove any trace of metallic
oxides, soluble lime-salts,      or other foreign matters, and afterwards
carefully washed     till it  exhibited no acid reaction.             Distilled water
was then boiled on the purified            fluor   till it  became    saturated   ;   the
solution filtered whilst warm, and left at rest for some days in stop
pered bottles, at a temperature of about 60°, till it deposited the ex
cess  of salt soluble  above    that temperature.             It was then filtered a
second    time.    A  certain volume of this solution, measured at 60°,
was   evaporated to dryness on the vapour bath, in a counterpoised
platina basin.
   Twenty-four pints of the solution were thus made use of. In six
experiments, 1 imperial pint of the solution (16 fluid ounces, or 7000
grs.) was taken at each trial.             In four trials, 3 pints were evapo
rated at each experiment.          In  one, 6 pints were employed.
   The following are the results        : —
                                                                          Per Pint.

                                                                                       Per Pint.

Twenty-four           pints of distilled water thus dissolved 6-330 grains of
fluor-spar,         so that the mean amount dissolved by one pint will be
0-2637 grains.    One grain, therefore, of fluor will require 26-545
grains of water at 60° to dissolve                    it,
                                      or water, at that temperature,
will take up         of its weight of that salt.
             26545th
     The solubility here indicated must                     be considered        great for   a    salt
hitherto reputed quite insoluble.                     It    is   still more soluble in water at
a high temperature, as the deposit left                          by   warm solutions on cooling
shews.
     These facts will now be connected
                                    with the appearance of fluoride
of calcium in plants and minerals, as well as in mineral veins and
elsewhere;          and   may,     perhaps,       prove          sufficient    to explain these
hitherto somewhat perplexing phenomena.
3. New Observations                on the Glaciers of Savoy.                        Part   I.     By
                             Professor          J.    D. Forbes.
     This paper describes the remarkable changes which the glacier
of   La    Brenva, on the south side of Mont Blanc, has undergone be
tween the years 1842 and 1846.
     It   has increased to such an extent, that                        it   has risen against the
opposing wall of rock on the side of the valley nearly 200 feet ver
tically   has covered a large additional surface of ground, and ap
          ;   it
pears to be approaching the moraines of 1818.       The author de
scribes the measures which he took for comparing its size at any fu
ture period, and he cites some observations made by the Vicar of
Courmayeur   (M. Guicharda),                which plainly establish its continued
motion during winter.
     Professor Forbes then describes the remarkable development of
the veined structure which has occurred since his last observations
oppositeto the promontory of rock on which the chapel         built,                    is
which was formerly partially ruined by the glacier.  He     of opi                    is

                                        104
nion, that the position in which the veined structure              has been     de
veloped is conclusive as to its cause, being the forced separation of
the central parts of the glacial mass from the lateral portion, which
has become checked by the rocky promontory alluded to, in such a
way as to assist the motion of the sides of the glacier, in a way
which was not the case in 1842.              He confirms this view by actual
observations of the velocity of different parts of the glacier, which
shew that the lateral ice is completely embayed, and must undergo
such a wrench from the central part as had been supposed, to which
the veined structure is ascribed.

 1.  New Observations on the Glaciers of Savoy, (concluded).
       By Professor Forbes.
     The    Second   Part of this paper contained an account of the
 determination of the motions of several glaciers which had not
been before observed,     such as the glacier of Talefre, Nant Blanc,
Miage,    and  Brenva,   and the results of a comparison of the measures
made in 1846 with those of former years, at different points of
the Mer de Glace ; shewing the unusual speed of motion during
last summer.       There   is detailed also the history    of the loss of a
knapsack in the ice of the glacier of Talefre in 1836, and the
recovery of its fragments in 1846, shewing a motion of 4300 feet
in ten years, on a declivity of about 15° at a mean.         Some remarks
were then made      on the process of the conversion of the neve into
glacier, which the author ascribes entirely to intense pressure and
friction, aided by the molecular influences which time develops.
The first stage of glacification is the formation of the blue bands,
nearly vertical, which are due to the friction arising from the differ
ential   motion of the particles.      The paper concludes by some re
marks    on the apparent ejection of stones and other foreign bodies
from glaciers.

          from a Letter of Baron Berzelius : —
     " Inthe investigation of the vegetable alkalies which  have made          I
for the new edition of my Hand-Book,                       I
                                               consider myself to have
established, in a satisfactory manner, that the alkaline constituent of
these substances            is ammonia, coupled with a variety of different com
pounds, such as carbo-hydrogens, organic oxides, chlorides, oxychlo-
rides, sulphurets, amides, and even saline compounds.    The ammo
nia in these substances can be converted into amide, ammonium, or
oxide of ammonium, under different circumstances.                           Although, how
ever,     I   conceive      we are now on the     right road with the          basic consti
tuent of the alkaloids, we are still very much in the dark with re
gard to the substances which are coupled with the ammonia.     The
investigation of these will be a much more difficult problem,                         if,   in
deed, we ever succeed in solving it.

     I                                      visit of Fritsche of St
              had, during the month of October,                a
Petersburg, accompanied by young Struve, the son of the astronomer,
in companionship with whom, Fritsche has discovered and examined
a new acid compound of osmium, part of the investigations of which
were performed in my laboratory.                  This     acid    is   of great theoretical
interest      ; a fulminating acid, whose silver salt explodes at 66°
                  it   is
Cent, as violently as the fulminate of silver.  As far as the difficult
analyses          have gone, its constitution     is—
                                     Os 04 + Os N.
It   is   therefore osmic acid, coupled with the nituret                    of osmium, and
constitutes, as nearly as may well be,             proof of the view which
                                                       a                                    I
some time since suggested,             with regard to the constitution of the
common fulminic acid, viz., that            it    might consist of a non-explosive
acid, coupled with   metallic nituret.

 pound,   and that it may   be obtained from the lignin of any vegetable.
 It is not  xyloidine,  which   is a compound peculiar to starch alone.         I
 have prepared it, for example, from the sphagnum palustre, which
 had been previously treated with potash ; and, best of all, from de
 cayed wood    (also after treatment with potash), which will probably
 form the cheapest raw material for its preparation, especially in a
 country so rich in forests and half-rotten saw-dust as ours is. Rein
 deer moss and Iceland      moss afford only xyloidine      when treated with
 nitric acid.
    "  I consider the gun-cotton     to be a sort of nitrate of lignin, and the
 products of its explosion contain much cyanogen ; so that its consti
tution must be such, that the nitric acid may exactly suffice to form
carbonic    acid and cyanogen, with the carbon = 2 NO5             +   C9, toge
ther with HO, in a hitherto undetermined quantity."

1.    An Attempt to Elucidate and Apply Mr Warren's Doc
        trine respecting the Square Root of Negative Quantities.
        By the Right Rev. Bishop Terrot.
     The author           in the first
                    shewed,                    place,    that the successive radii of
a    circle forming equal angles with          one another, are properly symbo
lized by the successive         expressions, a, a        .   -   —      a                 &c., where
a is the arithmeticallength of the radius, and S the angle which the
several radii make with one another. He proceeded to shew how this
theory of symbols, first advanced by            Mr Warren,               is applicable to the
problems of plane trigonometry.   This was shewn in several ele
mentary propositions, in a new demonstration of Cotes' properties of
the circle, and     in the demonstration of             a property closely connected
with these, namely, that         if A   be the extremity           of a diameter, and
P, Px.     P^ &c., be the extremities of a
           P2>

 2.   Notes on the Superficial           Strata of the Neighbourhood                                    of
       Edinburgh, concluded.              By Dr Fleming.
      The author                     to the position of Edinburgh as
                    began by adverting
 favourable to the study of geology, from the proximity of the transi
 tion rocks, the old red sandstone, and the coal measures    and then                     ;
 stated, that the deposits     belonging to the modern epoch were equally
 accessible     and interesting.
      In   order to illustrate the character of the superficial strata, the
 author considered, in the first instance, the condition of the surfaces
 of the rocks, on which these loose deposits rest.   He had found many
 examples, as at Craigleith, Granton, and Sampson's Ribs, where, on
 the removal     of the boulder-clay, the surfaces of the rocks were dressed
 and scratched in      a   direction    nearly from          W. to E.           ;   while in other

                                     112
cases, as on    Arthur's Seat, the Calton   Hill, and Tordufl- to the west
ward of Bonally, near Colinton, the surfaces were equally dressed and
scratched although the superficial strata were absent.
    In the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, the oldest member of the su
perficial strata is the  boulder-clay, which rests on the dressed sur
faces.     The boulders are chiefly of trap, rounded, and, in many in
stances,   scratched, and the accompanying fragments are portions of
the strata in the immediate neighbourhood.            The author was in
clined to the belief, that the boulders had acquired their form pre
vious to their enclosure in the clay, through which they are irregu
larly distributed, scarcely ever in contact    ;  and in which, even sup
posing the mass in motion, they must, in a great measure, be in re
lative rest.
    The author considered it probable, that the dressing had taken
place previous to the formation of the boulder-clay, and at the pe
riod when the boulders themselves acquired their form ; and that it
was produced, when the rocks were           under water, by the attrition
of   stones or ice.    He here adverted to the action of icebergs, and
considered their influence as having been exerted in fresh water, ac
cording to a notion which he had long entertained, that, during the
formation of the older members of the superficial strata, the land
under consideration was covered by a lake of fresh water.           He then
adverted to the glacial theory of Agassiz, as      well fitted, if otherwise
probable, to account for the dressings ; because,      if a sheet  of ice co
vered the country for a series  of years, it must  have experienced innu
merable shiftings, and produced corresponding abrasion of the rocks,
by its expansions and contractions as a solid, with every change of
temperature, independent of any dilatation by freezing.
    The author here took notice of the structural character of the trap
rocks of the district, as exhibiting, in the crumpled surfaces of their
strata, and the slickensides with      which they abound, appearances
which may readily be confounded with dressings.
    The difficulties attending any explanation, yet proposed, of the
mode of formation of the boulder-clay, the author considered as very
great, and frankly stated that hitherto he had not been able to ar
rive at any satisfactory conclusion.
    The boulder-clay    becomes   more sandy towards the upper portion
of the mass, and passes, by means of alternating beds, into the next
newest formation, the boulder gravel and sand.            The gravel forms
 the lowest portion of this mass, and frequently contains numerous
 boulders of trap towards its lowest portion.       The sand towards the

                                   113
upper   portion is horizontally stratified with numerous examples of
disturbance, while, towards the boulder-clay, it is very imperfectly
assorted by water.      Throughout the upper portion of the mass there
are beds  of silt or brick-clay.
   The author then proceeded      to the consideration of the great de
posits of brick-clay and stratified sand at Portobello     and Granton.
At the former place the clay is finely stratified, graduating by
alternations with fine sand, into the incumbent sand.        At Granton
the brick-clay is very imperfectly stratified, and is abruptly covered
with a mass of gravel distinctly assorted by water.
   On comparing the relative       position of the boulder-clay, gravel,
sands, and silt, and their transitions, the author considers them as
the production of a single series   of changes, and in the later   stages
as  having a soil with plants and animals at no great distance.
   The subject of Erratics was next brought under the notice of
the Society ; and the author remarked that those which occur on the
surface, at the north end of Salisbury       Crags,   had probably been
exposed   by the washing away of the boulder-clay.        There were no
angular blocks resting on the surface to be seen in the immediate
neighbourhood, such as abound in the district around Aberdeen, and
which are different from the contents of the inferior clay.
   The Marine Diluvium next occupied the attention of the author.
He stated that this deposit occurred on the sea-shore from Portobello
to Granton, and had been regarded as an ancient sea-beach, now
exposed in a raised position by an elevation of the land.             The
author,   after   illustrating the character of a modern sea-beach,
stated that this bank of shells did not exhibit any of the characters
of a beach, but gave unequivocal proofs of its being storm-raised, in
the mixture    of littoral and deep water shells, in overturned boulders
with limpets, barnacles, &c, in their original position, in the direc
tion of flat stones in the bed, and in the appearances of stratification.
This view the author stated had been forced upon him by an exami
nation of the prolongation of the same bed at Borrowstonness, and
which he had published in Dr Thomson's Annals of Philosophy, for
August    1814.
   The author concluded his remarks by stating, that the sea-shells
found a few feet below the surface of the carse clay at Clackmannan,
Stirling, &c., were in like manner derived from a violent inundation
of the sea, and could not be considered as an old sea-beach    — an   opi
nion which had been adopted by several of the authors of illustrations
of the geology of the district, on very insufficient grounds.

      The following Communications                  were read            :   —
 1.   A    Speculation,  connecting the origin of Trap-Tuff, the
          cause of Earthquakes, and of Partial Changes of the
          Bed of the Ocean. Part II. By Sir G. S. Mackenzie, Bart.
    The author, having observed in Iceland some remarkable intermix
 tures of lava with volcanic tuff ; and, more recently, on the coast of
East Lothian, a somewhat similar intermixture                       of       masses of green
stone in trap-tuff, conceived          the idea that cavities existed underneath
the crust       of the earth, or deeply        seated within        it, containing water
exposed to heat, and the agitation            of which,    occasioned by the produc
tion of steam, had reduced the materials of trap-tuff to the state in
which we find them, which had been afterwards erupted at the bot
tom   of the      sea, or forced between      the beds of superincumbent rocks.
Some  time afterwards, on reading the researches of Mr Hopkins in
Physical Geology, he was gratified to find that profound philosopher
advocating the existence of vast cavities containing lava, and connected
with volcanic vents at a depth such as would admit of steam-power
throwing the lava to the surface.  It did not now appear difficult to
imagine similar cavities containing heated water, and the materials
of trap-tuff; and he therefore extended the hypothesis of Mr Hop
kins so as to account for its origin, and for masses of trap occurring
init, the form of which seemed to indicate that they had been forced
into the tuff at the time of its eruption,                from some neighbouring
cavity containing melted matter.

                                               116
     The author next adverted              to the phenomena    of earthquakes       ;   and
referring to the Great Geyser, the eruptions of which, at the time
when he saw       were preceded by sounds resembling the discharges
                    it,
of artillery, and trembling of the ground, he inferred that the noises
and shaking of the ground during earthquakes, were caused in the
same manner in great cavities, such, most probably, as those which
contained the materials for trap or volcanic tuff.               The     cause   of the
noises the author conceived tc be the occasional production of masses
of steam, reaching the upper and colder portions of the cavity, or
coming in contact with water and being suddenly condensed, so as to
produce vacuum with extreme rapidity, the collapse, on its being in
          a
stantly filled up, causing sound and concussion. To explain this part
of the subject,               paper on sound, which he had read to
                     he referred to       a
the Society some years before, and part of which will appear in the
number of Jameson's                Journal for April 1847.
   The author next proceeded to extend the hypothesis of Mr Hop
kins farther  and endeavoured to shew, that the operations going on
                ;
within the cavities would necessarily go on extending their dimen
sions,   and weakening their roofs.              This weakening would      be greatly
increased      by   the eruption        of the contained matter, and the    enormous
masses    of         rocks existing in volcanic districts and elsewhere,
                igneous
proves    that proportional spaces must have been left empty under
neath.     Vast tracts of land            by
                             being thus undermined may have sunk
and disappeared under the ocean.   Several geologists have supposed
itprobable, from various facts, that Europe and America were once
united, the Northern Atlantic having been occupied       land.   This
                                                                    by
being admitted, the author referred to the probability of the sinking
of the land having been caused (perhaps in large portions at different
periods)     the extension of such cavities as those which Mr Hop
               by
kins has supposed to exist, and to their roof giving way. The British
Islands, the Faroe Island, and Iceland, may be regarded as remnants
of the lost continent and the latter island exhibits the strongest possi
                               ;
ble indications of preparation for the catastrophe of its disappearance.
The precipitous           shores   of   these remnants prove that violent fracture
had taken place           ;    and that this island had been    more     elevated       at a
former period,            is   rendered    probable by the exceedingly shattered
condition of their rocks.                 Admitting this, and the extension of the
land over the Atlantic, the climate of Britain                 must formerly have
been severe enough              to produce glaciers, which have left those marks
which have been ascribed to them.

                                               117
    The author took occasion to shew, that the effect of the                               sudden
 sinking of a great mass of land, and the access of the sea                                 to the
 emptied space, would be to raise, by vast currents rushing into     an                     it,
 enormous mass of water to     great height, forming
                                       a                huge initiatory         a
 wave, consisting of greatly agitated water, loaded with the debris of
 the former land, as well as terrestrial                 and aquatic animals, many of
 them dragged from warmer latitudes,     the violent currents rushing
                                                         by
 from all sides towards the empty space.   This huge mass of water,
 as soon as its weight balanced and overcame the momentum of the
current that had lifted          it,
                           would produce    wave which, being propa
                                                              a
gated till   reached our land, would break over
               it                                    and form power       it,
ful currents guided by the inequalities of the land, and leaving be
hind them the detritus which at present covers the rock surface.
    The author also noticed, in               consequence         of     some discussion that
had taken place on the appearances  presented by the diluvial masses,
a fact he had several times observed, shewing that the appearance of
stratification might not, in every case, depend on deposition from
water comparatively at rest.  On artificial heaps of heterogeneous
matter which had been left undisturbed for many years, being cut
down, he had noticed,    and pointed out to others, that the materials
had arranged themselves in lines, in the manner of flint in chalk, and
strata of finer materials.   Hence he supposed       probable that, in   it
many cases, the diluvial masses had, in like manner, arranged them
selves, and assumed         a   stratified appearance.             He     was led also to the
inference that, instead of having been quietly deposited, many of the
great masses of sandstone, now exhibiting distinct layers, had been
produced at once by ancient debacles.
    2.   On Vital Affinity.                Parts   II.   and      III.        By Dr Alison.
    In continuation of his former paper, Dr Alison                            proceeded    to re
view the chief facts known in regard to the formation of the oils and
the albuminous          compounds in organized bodies, with the view of                       il
lustrating         the modification given by vitality to chemical affinities.
The formation   of fat or oil in vegetables appears to be effected
simply by the separation of oxygen from some of the varieties of
starch  but in animals, where no oxygen
         ;                                     evolved, and where,is
nevertheless, oily compounds may certainly be formed                                from   starch
(as shewn by Liebig, Chevreul, and Milne-Edwards), this appears
to be effected by an affinity of the greater part of the carbon and
hydrogen of the starch, for    small part of the oxygen, to form fat,
                                       a
    VOL.     II.                                                                     L

                                        118
while a smaller part of the carbon and hydrogen, with the greater
part of the oxygen of the Btarch, aided by additional oxygen ab
sorbed from the air, passes off as carbonic acid and water.                   In
both cases, the essential characters of          that affinity, which    appears
to be peculiar to the state     of life, lies apparently in the attraction of
carbon for hydrogen, with a much smaller proportion of oxygen
than exists in the compounds of these elements existing in the in
organic world ; and as no such compound is formed from starch,
under the same circumstances in other respects, without the pre
sence   of living cells, he regards the formation of oil in living bodies
as an effect of vital affinity ; although admitting that in the course
of the decomposition of animal compounds, by various chemical
agents,   oily matters may    be formed by simple chemical action, as in
the well-known example of the formation of adipocere from fibrin.
   The fact that the formation of fat in the animal             body is so noto
riously diminished or restrained by exercise, increasing the supply of
oxygen, and promoting, therefore, the excretion of carbonic acid and
water, he thinks       very important, as indicating, along with other
facts, the principle     that vital affinities do not supersede the usual
chemical relations of the elements that are liable            to them, but are
merely added to these, and allow of a division of those elements be
tween compounds formed by vital and by simply chemical powers.
    He next referred to the important question, now warmly disputed
among chemists, whether albumen               can be formed in the animal
body, or only passes into it, directly        or indirectly,   from vegetables,
where it      is  believed to be formed,        by   a  vital action, from the
elements    of starch, and those of ammonia (in whatever way this last
may be supplied), the elements of water and a little oxygen passing
off at the same time in the usual exhalations of the plant.                  He
pointed out that, by the addition of a full            supply of oxygen, it is
quite possible that the elements        of starch with ammonia in the ani
mal body may divide         themselves     into two portions — the one con
taining the greater part of the carbon falling by vital affinity into
the proportions of the albumen, while the other, absorbing the
oxygen, passes off as carbonic acid and water, the constant excretions
of animals ; and he conjectured that the elements of ammonia, requi
site for this action, may be supplied in animals by the air which is
continually     taken into the stomach, in the water and in the saliva
which are habitually swallowed, and which will there be under con
ditions very similar to those in which air and water are known to
form ammonia.         He stated likewise that as it is certain that fat is

                                               119
formed   in the animal body from starch, and that gelatin is formed
in it, probably from albumen, it is certain that the term assimilation,
in the physiology of animals, cannot be restricted to the mere selec
tion and appropriation of compounds already formed in vegetables
 (asDumas supposes), but must                  include, also, certain           processes   of
transformation (as maintained             by   Dr Prout).       And admitting that
the question, as to the actual formation of albumen                     in animals, can
only be finally decided by ascertaining whether the whole quantity
of azote thrown off from an animal in     given time  agreater than        is
is introduced into     in the form of albuminous ingesta, he urged
                          it
various reasons for inclining to the opinion, that                  a   certain quantity
of albumen        is   formed, chiefly from       the anylaceous ingesta, in the
animal body.
   He admitted, however, that      comparison of the proportion of
                                          a
the elements in the azotised aliments, and in the excretions, shews
that the formation of albumen in the animal frame must be to    very                 a
small extent only    and stated that the general distinction of the
                         ;
azotised, or the chief nutritious            of the aliments, and the
                                               portion
non-azotised or chiefly calorific portion of them, and the doctrine of
these last protecting the albuminous part of the blood, and the tex
tures from the agency          of the oxygen taken into the blood, and that
of the wasting of the textures, and death by ancemia                        in weakening
diseases, being due to the action of the oxygen, appear to him                         to be
quite consonant with clinical observations in various diseases, and to
be an important addition to pathology             ;   besides     giving        us more pre
cise ideas as to the nature of the function of digestion, and the law
of Prout, of the necessity of mixture of aliments for the support of
animal life.        This doctrine
                              the strongest illustration of what was
                                     is
formerly stated as to the use of the oxygen taken into the animal
body,    viz., — not to take any direct part in the formation of                         com
pounds     by strictly vital     affinities, but to       exert    a    simply chemical
action on         all organic compounds capable of yielding                       to simply
chemical affinities, and       so to   support the excretions.
   The formation of gelatin in the living animal body, he considered
as certainly owing to the separation of carbon and hydrogen, by help
of the oxygen of the air     but pointed out the possibility of this
                                 ;
taking place, not merely, as Liebig states, from the action of the
oxygen on the elements of albumen, but likewise from its action on
the elements       of starch with ammonia, provided that            a   certain quantity
of   oil or fat   is   formed at the same time*-

                                          120
    He then     proceeded     to consider the general theory of excretion in
the animal body, beginning this subject with the striking fact, noticed
by both Prout and Liebig, that although oxygen from the air must
be a main agent in forming all the excretions (because oxygen exists
in them all in a larger proportion than in those aliments and those
textures of the body from which they must be respectively derived),
yet the oxygen taken in at the lungs does not appear to enter into
the combinations by which the excretions are formed (particularly,
does not form carbonic acid), as long as it is passing along the ar
teries, but    "  changes    its mode of action" when it reaches the capil
laries, where it must meet with the matter absorbed from the tex
tures.     He    stated it as the general, and apparently first, opinion            of
physiologists, that the excretions are furnished partly by redundant
ingesta, and partly by
                               " effete" matter in the system itself ; but the
important agency of oxygen in maintaining them had not been so
generally recognised, and the term
                                                " effete" has in general no very
definite    idea   attached to it.       But, combining together all that           is
known as to the continued            interstitial    absorption in animal bodies,
the continual introduction of oxygen into them, and as to the nature
and quantity of the excretions, as compared with the ingesta, he
 stated  it  as the most general expression            of these facts, that through
out all the parts of any living animal where nutrition and absorption
are going on, i. e., at the extremities of the capillary vessels, in the
more perfect animals, carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and oxygen, are
continually forming two sets of compounds, — certain portions of
these elements, recently introduced in the form                 of aliments, either
separating, in the form of the organic compounds, from the other
constituents of the blood, or uniting to form those compounds, — and
in either case attaching to themselves particles of earthy and saline
and inflammable bodies, taking the form of cells or fibres, and build
ing up the organised frame ; while other portions of the same, which
have been for some time in the body, rejecting these adventitious
matters, and uniting with oxygen from the air, are continually fall
ing into the proportions by which the compounds                   destined  to excre
tion are formed, which are poisonous to the system if retained, which
tend always to the crystalline form, and, in fact, are steps in the
process    of the gradual restoration of          these elements to the inorganic
compounds, carbonic acid, water, and ammonia, out of which the
 agency of vegetable life had originally formed them.
     This general     fact he considered    as the clearest proof      of that princi

                                        121
pie  of the modification      of chemical affinities   by the contact    of living
structures,    to which the term      Vital Affinity is applied    ;  and, at the
same time, as an indication         of this distinctive peculiarity of the vital
affinities, that, like all other actions strictly called vital, they are of
transient duration only ; and that the life of every individual ani
mal is maintained        only by the successive life and death of all the
atoms of organised matter of which it is composed ; every portion,
as  it dies, being removed from its place by interstitial absorption,
becoming liable to the influence of the oxygen (as it would be, if
separated     from the body, and undergoing decomposition), and serving
for the maintenance of the different excretions.
    This opinion he     stated as having been adopted by several physiolo
gists of late years,      in regard to those portions of animal textures
which are engaged        in active vital operations, particularly muscular
and nervous parts ; but its importance             as a general      physiological
principle,     connecting together the necessity        of continued nutrition
for the maintenance         of animal life (even during the decline of the
body), the intention of interstitial absorption, the use of respiration,
and the necessity and nature of the excretions, had not, as he thought,
been pointed out in any physiological            work.   He    acquiesced,    how
ever,   in the statement of some recent authors, that this partial death
of portions of the animal frame appears to be greatly accelerated by
local increase of any of the strictly vital actions ; and under this law,
he thought we may include not only the fact of the loss of power in
a  muscular or nervous part from over-exertion             (leading to increased
interstitial absorption,      and thereby,     in a healthy constitution, and
 where the      exertion   is not excessive,    to subsequent    deposition    and
 hypertrophy), but likewise, the increased interstitial absorption, the
 ulcerative absorption, the partial sloughing, or general gangrene of a
 part that has been inflamed,       — all  these being results of the death of
 certain particles   of matter    concerned  in the inflammation, and varying
 in degree as this death is more partial and gradual, or more general
 and sudden.
     On the whole, therefore, he maintained, that not only the general
 principle may be held to be ascertained of peculiar vital affinities
 actuating the portions of matter by which the organic principles are
 formed, and organised structures developed, but that the facts already
 known on the subject,       justify several important inferences in regard
 to the  peculiarities of these affinities,      both as to their     nature and
 duration   ;  and that we can point out, with at least much probability,

                                      122
the share which these affinities take in all the changes to which the
elements composing organised hodies are subjected, from the time of
the first separation of carbon from oxygen, which            is essential to
vegetable   life, till the restoration of all the elements thus employed,
by the aid of oxygen taken into the body, to the condition of inor
ganic compounds, in the excretions that are continually thrown off
from living animals.

1.   On the co-existence      of Ovigerous Capsules and Spermato
       zoa in the same individuals of the Hydra viridis.                By
       Dr Allen Thomson.
   In this communication,      the author described some       observations
made    by him in the autumn of 1845, by which he had ascertained
that  in the Common Green Polype,        as had previously been observed
in the  Hydra fusca, generation takes place at the approach of winter
by the   development of impregnated ova.
   Professor Thomson ascertained, that, at this season, while a num
ber  of the polypes bore the spermatic capsules near the base of the
arms, a few animals were to seen, on which, besides these capsules,
an  ovum was developed from the exterior of the middle of the body.
   The act of fecundation was observed      :  the sub-division of the yolk,
while the ovum     still remained in its capsule, attached to the parent,
was   distinguished, as well as the subsequent separation of the ovum ;
but the author had not an opportunity         of tracing the formation of a
young polype from the ovum.

    The author   was not inclined to regard the process  of gemmation,
which is the more frequent mode of multiplication in these animals,
as explicable on the supposition that the buds are developed from ova
that have been previously impregnated, and are retained in the sub
stance   of the parent's body.

stated, that though he had proceeded to Glen Roy under a strong im
pression that Mr Darwin's marine theory afforded a solution of the
question, he had felt himself constrained, after an examination of the
 valleys, to abandon that     theory,  and that he had satisfied himself
 that the shelves had been formed by lakes of fresh water.       He re
 ferred to the proofs   still existing of the  mode  in which these lakes
 had been discharged, and he described particularly the unequivocal
 traces of an old river course running from the head of Glen Glaster
 to Loch Laggan, with a delta at the level of shelf 4 on Loch Lag-
 gan side, formed by this ancient but now extinct river.
     The author    considered that the blockage of the waters in the
 valleys   had been formed of boulder-clay and other ancient detrital
 matter.     There was proof that this detritus had been deposited in
 the district before the waters had begun to be depressed, as the
 shelves were, in some places, indented on the boulder-clay ; and this
 detrital matter must, when deposited in the valleys, have been in
 sufficient quantity to have dammed back the waters, as there were
  still abundant traces of it on the sides of the hills at a higher level
 than that of any of the shelves.
      The author differed from Dr MacCulloch and Sir Thomas Dick
  Lauder, in supposing that it was necessary to assume the occurrence of
  an earthquake or any convulsion of nature to account for the breaking
  down of barriers, by which the lakes were blocked up.          He con
  sidered that it was an error to assume that the first depression of the
  lake in Glen Roy was 82 feet, and shewed that there must have been
  at least three intermediate depressions ; and that after the first de
  pression, the water must have flowed out by Glen Glaster into Glen

                                    125
Spean.     He adduced several considerations to shew that the blockage
at the west end of Glen Roy could have been nothing else than de
tritus capable of being worn down and removed by the gradual ope
ration of a stream, and in this manner be accounted for the ultimate
removal of all the blockage which had previously dammed back the
water  in the several valleys marked by shelves.
    He next adverted to the theory of Agassiz, that the waters had
been  blocked up by the moraine of a glacier descending from Ben
Nevis ; — a theory which, at the best, could not explain the formation
of a lake   in Glen Gluoy.    The author    shewed,  however, that it would
not  explain the shelves in Glen Roy     ;  as the two uppermost shelves,
stopped short by two miles     of the place where the Ben Nevis moraine
is said to   have been formed,    and the lowest shelf went beyond this
place by three or four miles.

      The following Communications            were read    : —
  1.   On the Course of Observation to be pursued in future at
      the Royal Observatory of Edinburgh.               By Professor C.
      Piazzi Smyth.
      Being at present chiefly taken up with       the computation of his
 predecessor's    observations, the author takes this opportunity of ex
 amining into what is going on in other Observatories ; and then en
 deavours,   from the results of such a survey, to select some unpursued
 branch of Astronomy,       as the proper subject to which the    Edinburgh
 Observatory should be devoted ; and he dwells much on the great
 caution to be used, in the present multiplication of astronomical ob
 servatories, that several of them be not working against each other
 on the same subject ; and urges the extreme importance of first se
 lecting an appropriate object of research, and then following it up
 with a constancy enduring through ages, after the manner of the
 Greenwich Observatory, which has consequently produced results of
 such inestimable service to the promotion of the science.
     He then   proceeds to describe the several  observatories,  and the ob
jects pursued at Greenwich, the Cape of Good Hope, Cambridge,
 Oxford, Armagh, Durham, and Liverpool ; and concludes that they
are all doing their work so well, that it would be quite useless          for
any other establishment to follow in the same paths.
     But while the movements of the planets round the         sun are so well
attended   to at Greenwich, he remarks that the question of the mo
tion of the sun itself amongst the stars, is equally important, is pe
culiarly the business of our age to investigate, is only possible to be
solved by public observatories with good meridian         instruments, and,
being unpursued elsewhere, may well be adopted as the peculiar mis
sion of the Edinburgh Observatory.
     The proposed method of solving this problem is then described,
and consists generally in procuring accurate places of a great number
of stars, for three distinct epochs, during a period of thirty years ;
constants and fundamental        points being taken, for specified reasons,
from Greenwich.
     The Edinburgh Observatory is not, however, to be wholly en
grossed in this long and distant inquiry, but is also to do something
immediately useful      for amateur     astronomers,  by fixing the abso

                                      127
lute places  of all stars which    have been used by those        gentlemen in
differential measurements ; the want of some establishment to which
private observers    might    send for the determination       of their stars of
reference, having long been a matter         of regret.
    In conclusion, the author alludes      to the various foreign       observa
tories, whose subjects     of observation will, he thinks,         by no  means
interfere   with that    selected  for Edinburgh     ;   and he congratulates
himself that having made his election entirely on independent physi
cal considerations, he has at last arrived at the same point to which
his predecessor    seemed to be drawing nearer and nearer every year.

    The following remarks in Major-General Cullen's letter illustrate
 some particulars      of the observation.
    " In   a dry  season the spring sometimes ceases altogether, but   it is
very singular, that on its reappearance after a few days' rain, its tem
perature continues the same nearly as before.
    " Ihad
             supposed that the temperatureof such a spring, as that shewn
by  Mr    Caldecott's ground-thermometers, would have been nearly the
mean annual temperature of the atmosphere at the place of observa
tion, but    I  perceived that his mean annual temperature for Trevan-
drum is only about 80°         ; but Colonel Sabine has already pointed out
some peculiarities in the meteorology of Trevandrum which may have
a  wider application than has hitherto been suspected.        The early sea
breezes which affect the barometer, &c., may not extend their effect
below the surface       of the ground.
   " Even the temperature of the wells is remarkably uniform, though
lower than that of the spring.          In none does the monthly tempera
ture differ above 1° from the annual.          The kitchen and village well
are upon the top       of  a swell, while the garden-well is on a consider
ably   lower   level,  down   a slope half-way down to the spring, and the
average depth of water of the garden-well is also greater than the
other two.       May  these differences account for the higher temperature
of the garden-well      1   The depth from the surface of the ground of all
the wells was nearly alike, 40, 48, and 36 feet."

       (1.) On a Fatty Substance derived from Animal Matter.
    This substance, derived from a pig buried for fifteen years on the
side of a hill, was found to consist of free fatty acids, with a mere
trace of animal matter, and no appreciable trace of phosphate of
lime.      The bone earth appears to have been dissolved by the water
percolating through the soil.

    This powder      was found to have the composition of humus in a
very    advanced    state  of decay, and was probably derived from peat.
It contained 77 per cent, of carbon ; and left, when burned, hardly a
trace of ashes.

     The author, after describing this              acid, and the interest attached
to   it,   gave an improved, easy, and productive method of preparing
it, and exhibited specimens of the acid so prepared.
    The process consists in boiling the urine of the                   horse with lime,
and then rapidly boiling down the filtered solution, after which the
addition of hydrochloric acid causes      deposit of impure hippuric
                                                     a
acid.   This   easily purified by a repetition of the process of boil
                  is

1.   Remarks on the Hypothesis of Progressive Development
      in the Organic Creation. By Sir G.   Mackenzie, Bart.   S.
   This paper the author considered as nothing else than an abstract
of the thoughts he entertained on the subject.     His object was to
shew there was no analogy in nature,                 prospective law
                                       rendering                   a

                                     131
of progressive development from lower to higher types probable ; and
he   brought forward various examples to prove that, in all cases in
which variation took place among domestic animals and vegetable
productions, the varieties, though they might be regarded as im
proved or new, were not permanent,         but required selection and care
to  preserve them ; so      that new forms and qualities appearing, could
not confirm      the progressive hypothesis.
    Referring to what may have been the original condition of things
on   their being created, that condition, in respect to many, may not
have altered, either      in improvement    or deterioration.      It  is appa
rent, however, that special constitutions      must have     been   given ori
ginally to those animals and vegetables, more          particularly intended
for the use of man, which admitted of natural           or artificial, but not
permanent, variation.         Man himself   possesses   the constitution giv
ing a tendency to vary, so that        every individual    may be deemed      a
variety    ;  but no natural progress towards a higher type is apparent.
 In   this case, as well as in portions of inferior creation, though we
 can compare one being with another, and perceive improvement or de
 terioration, we have no standard to appeal to for the purpose of ex
 amining the extent of variation, one way or the other, from the period
 of creation downwards to our time.        Man, in his best condition, can
 only aspire     to see his race  possessed of what he esteems desirable
 in moral, intellectual,    and physical qualities  ; and may, to no incon
 siderable extent, succeed in his endeavour to advance,        if he   make an
 effort.     Unless, however, it be a sustained one,     he  will fall  back in
 the    scale of humanity, instead of advancing,        as  daily   experience
 proves.      Whoever will look carefully    at what is called the progress
 of civilization, may be convinced that the honoured word is applied
 too exclusively to the progress of wealth, power, and luxury, rather
 than to the promotion of the qualities that properly distinguish hu
 manity, and which are found wanting wherever an effort has not
 been made to elevate the human character by education and moral
 training.      The very   idea of education indicates a tendency to dete
 rioration, and the necessity of an effort to counteract it.             On the
 whole, it does not appear that any natural analogy can           be   found to
 support the idea of progressive development from lower to higher
  types.     We see no new races appearing, and we find only varieties.
  The stronger, because cultivated (not newly developed), intellect and
 energy of Europe are subduing or extirpating the inferior and
  weaker races     in other parts of the world  ;  but the substitution of a
  better race in this manner is not progressive development.

2. On the  Parallel Roads of Lochaber ; with Remarks on the
   change of relative Levels of Sea and Land in Scotland, and
   on the Detrital Deposits in that Country.    Part II. By
   David Milne, Esq.
   The author      proceeded   to shew that the lake theory of the Loch
aber shelves       was   not inconsistent      with any established geological
truths, but was on the contrary supported by them.
   He alluded to the occurrence in the Lochaber district,            as well as
in other parts of Scotland, in valleys far from the sea, not only of
lakes at high level, but of beach lines on hill-sides precisely analo
gous to those of Glen Roy, and shewing depressions of water to nearly
the same extent.         One of the localities referred to is a valley near
Inverournan,    where three parallel roads are to be seen shewing a de
pression first, of about 197 feet, secondly, of 94 feet, and lastly, of
184 feet.    The blockage required for this ancient lake, and of which
a small remnant      still exists,    was nearly as extensive as that required
for Glen Roy.
   Other localities were pointed out where parallel roads on hill
sides, similar to those of Lochaber, were to be seen.
   In corroboration of the existence of lakes at high levels which no
longer exist, reference was made to the existence of River Haughs
at considerable heights above the present course of the rivers.
   The author proceeded next to shew, that when the rivers ran in
these higher channels, the sea stood at a higher level than at present.
He, in proof of the former submergence of the land beneath the waters
of the ocean, and its gradual emergence from               it,
                                                     referred, 1s*, to
the occurrence of marine remains at considerable heights above high-
water mark     2d, to the existence of extensive sand-banks which
               ;
could have been formed only at the bottom of a deep sea            ;   and, Bd,
to lines of ancient sea-cliffs and terraces along the coast.
   The author alluded next to the nature of the deposits formed,
when the land was covered by the sea, and endeavoured to shew, that
during this period the boulder-clay had             been   transported by some
great oceanic movement whereby the valleys were filled with detritus.
He shewed that the detritus had come from the westward, and, there
fore, that valleys situate, like those of Lochaber, on the east side of
lofty mountains, would be            especially liable to be blocked up by de
tritus.
   Reference was made to        a     number of boulders resting on beds     of

                                      133
sand and fine gravel in the counties       of Nairn and Moray, which      ap
peared to have been floated by ice, at a later period, and as the land
was emerging from the sea.
   An account     was given  of a number of phenomena, which apparently
were due to the emergence       of the land from beneath the waters of the
ocean.      In particular,  an account was given of beds of gravel lying
over beds of sand and mud, contrary to the law of specific gravity ;
of long ridges     of gravel and sand generally parallol to the lines of
coast,   or the direction of valleys, and of old sea-cliffs and sea-ter
races at various heights above the sea.
     In reference to this last point, the author   observed, that there were
reasons why geologists should not reject as unworthy           of notice, the
possibility,    that the land may, in some cases,        not have been the
moving body, but that owing to elevations and depressions in the
bed of the ocean, the waters may have advanced or receded, and thus
formed the lines of ancient sea-cliffs.

    The following Communications               were read      : —
 1. On     Certain Products of Decomposition of the Fixed Oils
       in Contact with Sulphur. By Dr T. Anderson.
    The investigations contained in this paper were undertaken with
the view of ascertaining the nature of the action of sulphur in tho
free state on organic substances.          The author endeavoured, in the
first instance, to examine the action of that agent upon some of the
simpler organic compounds, but without             obtaining any definite re
sults ;   and finally confined his experiments entirely to the fixed oils.
    The distillation    of oil of almonds with sulphur, which is attended
by the violent evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen, afforded a pecu
liar nauseous oil, and a crystalline product deposited on cooling from
the latter portions of the oil.         In order to ascertain the source of
these products, comparative experiments were made               with pure stearic
and oleic acids.      It   was thus found, that stearic acid, when distilled
with sulphur, gave products identical with those obtained by its sim

                                            135
 pie  distillation,  but that oleic acid gave an oily fluid and crystals si
 milar to those produced from the crude oil.
     The crystalline matter obtained from oleic acid, was an acid, and
possessed all the properties of margaric acid ; but being formed in
very small quantity, the author, in obtaining it for analysis, made
use of almond oil, expressed at a low temperature, which, by a com
parative     experiment, was found to yield no margaric acid when dis
tilled alone.       The analysis of this acid gave the following results,
 which correspond with those of margaric acid : —

     The silver-salt    gave 28-53        and 28-70 per cent, of silver, the cal
 culated results being 28-65, and the analysis of its ether was like
 wise found to correspond to margaric ether.
     The oil which distilled along with this substance, and which pos
sessed a most disgusting odour, was rectified ; the product collected in
separate portions,       and analysed ; but without affording            concordant
results.      It was found, however, to contain a substance               capable of
giving precipitates with corrosive sublimate and bichloride of pla
tinum.
    The precipitate obtained by corrosive sublimate was purified by
washing with ether and solution in boiling alcohol, from which it is
deposited on cooling.            It   then forms  a white pearly powder, which,
under    the microscope, presents the appearance of tabular crystals.
It  is insoluble in water and ether, sparingly soluble in alcohol, and
rather more so in coal-naphtha.                It gave  to analysis the following
results,   corresponding to the formula           C16 H16 S6  Hg4 Cl2,

    The author, from the similarity of the properties of this    substance
to those of the mercury compound of allyl, considered it         to possess
an analogous constitution, and to be derived from a substance        having
the formula C8 H8 S2i existing in the oil.       According   to which view
its rational formula may be represented by
             (Cg H8 S2 + Hg2     Cg    + (C8 H8  S2 + Hg2 S.)
    When treated with sulphuretted hydrogen it became black, and
an oil was separated, having a peculiar odour, and giving precipi
tates with corrosive sublimate and chloride of platinum.          This the
author considers to be the compound C8 H8         S2 ; but he was unable
to obtain enough for analysis.
    The precipitate with bichloride of platinum is yellow, insoluble in
water, and sparingly soluble in alcohol and ether. By hydrosulphu-
ret of ammonia it is converted into a brown powder.
    The oil from which these substances were separated likewise con
tained sulphur ; but the author had not yet proceeded with its inves
tigation.
2. On the     structural relation of Oil and Albumen in the Ani
               mal Economy.       By Dr    J.  H. Bennett.
    Nitrogenised principles of food are subservient to the formation of
albumen, whilst the non-nitrogenised are mostly converted into fat
or oil.   The fact, that  a union   of these  is essential to nutrition,  is
explained, according to the chemist, by supposing that albumen con
stitutes the basis of the tissues, and that oil furnishes the elements of
respiration and animal heat.       This theory, however, does not ex
plain the origin and maintenance of all growth, which is so essential
to the vital functions.    The author considered that the necessity of
oil and albumen was accounted for by their being both necessary to the
formation of the tissues, and he endeavoured to shew that there is no
elementary cell into which these principles do not enter as constituent
parts.
    Dr Ascherson of Berlin     shewed,  in 1838, that oil could not come
in contact with fluid albumen, without the formation of a membrane,
and that, on producing an emulsion by rubbing them together, cells
were formed composed of an albuminous membrane inclosing-oil, which
were identical with those found in milk.         That the milk globules

                                        137
were not loose particles       of oil, the author considered to be proved by
the following     facts  : — 1st, They float in a fluid, roll freely over each
other,   and do not unite.        2dly, They possess the property of endos-
mosis   and exosmosis.        Sdly, An excess of ether dissolves them, leav
ing behind a molecular mass.            4.thly, Acetic acid dissolves the albu
minous envelope, leaving the oil unaffected, when the globules are
easily made to unite,           bthly, Mechanical means are necessary to
extract the butter from milk in the dairy           ; the act of churning lace
 rates the minute envelopes.           The   author  obtained the same results
with the globules formed artificially by the union of oil and albu
men.      On mixing oil with other glutinous substances, however, such
 as  gelatine, gum, and syrup, he could not obtain the haptogen mem
 brane of Ascherson, and he found that the mechanical globules so
 formed,    readily united together when at rest.          That a delicate al
 buminous membrane possesses the property of rolling up and unit
 ing its edges so as to form shut sacs, the author has demonstrated,
 by lacerating     nerve tubes, which may then be seen under the micro
 scope to form globules       with double lines.     From all  these facts it was
 concluded that the globules of        milk,  as well as those formed mechani
 cally by the union of oil and albumen, were structures composed of
  an envelope and contents, and that they were endowed from the
  moment     of their formation with the physical property of         endosmosis
  and exosmosis.
      The author then alluded to the elementary molecules, granules,
  and nuclei found      in the blastema of all organised formations, which,
  he agreed    with Ascherson, might be demonstrated to possess a like
  composition and structure to the globules formerly described.               He
  quoted some recent experiments of Professor Matteucci, which proved
  that an oily emulsion would pass through a membrane by endosmosis,
  if the fluid pn the other side      was slightly alkaline.     He noticed also
  the fact ascertained by Donne, that after the removal           of the globules
  from milk, the remaining fluid contained fat in solution.          He thought
  there would be no difficulty now         in   recognising that the action of
  the stomach and intestines was directed to the formation            of an emul
  sion  of oil and albumen, which, on passing through the intestinal
  walls, constituted the basis of chyle, and that the property of endos
   mosis and exosmosis must be in continual operation in elementary
   molecules,   nuclei, and cells.
      The structures found in milk, or produced mechanically by the
   nion of oil and albumen, are not vital structures, but when formed

                                      138
in the animal body under certain conditions, they         become    so.   The
physical relations pointed out are only necessary preliminary steps
 for the addition of that unknown force called vitality, which directs
 the ultimate forms these      structures  assume.      They   are a sine qua
non, without which      vitality cannot   be  called into existence.      The
author thought that these facts, without being capable of explaining
the mystery which envelopes the assimilation of organic into orga
nised matter, will constitute another link to the chain of physical
actions introductory     to its accomplishment.        This chain he consi
dered might be composed as follows : — 1st, Introduction into the
stomach and alimentary canal of organic matter.            2d, Transforma
tion of this by the chemical process of digestion into albuminous and
oily compounds.       3c?, The physical imbibition of       these,  and their
union to form elementary granules and cells in the villi and lacteals ;
and, 'lastly, the vital transformation of these into blood. We observe
the same order of changes when exudation takes place from the
blood ; viz., 1st, Exudation of liquor sanguinis, containing oil and
albumen in solution.       2d, The mechanical       union of these to form
elementary granules and nuclei       ; and,  3c?,  The vital transformation
of  these into various tissues.
     The author then   proceeded   to point out various conditions      of the
animal economy in which the healthy relations of the oily and albu
minous principles were more or less deranged.
     Sometimes we have general or local collections of fatty matter as
in   obesity ; fatty  degeneration of the liver, kidney, and muscles ;
fatty tumours    and  the compound granular corpuscles so common in
inflammatory softenings, which he considered evidences of local fatty
collections.    In  the same manner we have         excessive leanness, and
alterations known as cicatrices, indurations, strictures, and fibrous tu
mours, which are local accumulations of the albuminous compounds.
To this class also belong tubercular deposits. The excess of one of
these in a tissue leads to atrophy of the other ; thus in fatty liver we
have excess of the cellular and diminution of the fibrous element,
whilst the contrary is the case in cirrhosis.        The emunctory organs
of these two principles are exposed to like alterations from excess
of fat or albumen, and those principles themselves give rise to crys
tallized products, viz., cholesterine and uric acid, causing obstructive
diseases.                                                             ,
    Inflammatory diseases in healthy persons give rise to an exuda
tion containing corpuscles, with nuclei and cell walls composed of oil

                                      139
 and  albumen    in certain proportions.      These diminish in organisablo
power as the exudation abounds in albumen or becomes tubercular,
and assume an excessive growth and power of reproduction, as it
abounds    in the oily element, as in soft cancer.      Tubercle is generally
found    in organs destitute of fat, such as the lungs and fibrous mem
branes, whilst it is rare in fatty organs, such as the brain and liver.
On the other hand, cancer is most common in fatty organs, such as
the mamma        and liver, and is exceedingly rare in the lungs and fibrous
tissues.     Again tubercle is common in the young, in whom assimila
tion rarely produces an excess      of fat ; whereas cancer is most frequent
in advanced life, when obesity and fatty accumulations are especially
apt to occur.      The importance of these facts in regulating the diet
of animals,     and in a system of therapeutics, must be evident.

1.   On the Boulder Formation and                   Superficial Deposits of
       Nova Scotia.        By  J. W.    Dawson, Esq.            Communicated
       by  Dr Gregory.
   In this paper the author, describes         1st, the geological position       of
the gypsum deposits.        The gypsum beds of Nova Scotia all belong
to the carboniferous system.        No gypsum occurs in older formations,
and in the overlying new red, only slender veins and small nodules
are found.      The gypsum characterises the lower members of the
carboniferous series, underlying the productive coal measures.                The
associated    rocks  are  red  sandstones     and    clays, with   very few fossil
plants, and thick beds of limestone abounding in marine shells.                  In
the only well ascertained instance of gypsum occurring above the
coal measures, it is accompanied by limestone with some of the same
shells.    The gypsum forms regular conformable beds sometimes 100
feet  thick.    They are much fractured and difficult to trace from the
wooded state of the country       ; but one thick bed was traced by the
author for ten miles.
   The    beds or gypsum often rest on, or are overlaid by, limestone,
and these rocks sometimes pass into one another, as at Ogden's Point
and Wallace Harbour.          In other cases the gypsum is embedded in
marly    sands and clays, or   in reddish grey and purple sandstone         ;   but
limestone is never far distant in ascending or descending order.
    2d,  Its characters.     The gypsum      is remarkably       pure and usually
white.     This purity, according to the author, indicates its chemical
origin, as distinguished from the detrital character of the associated
beds.     It is also highly crystalline, being often large grained and dis
tinct ; but usually lamellar    ; the plates of selenite having occasionally
a stellar arrangement.        The beds rarely exhibit a fibrous structure,
which is chiefly seen in the narrow            veins   ;  but they often shew a
laminated structure, parallel to the beds.
    3d, The foreign matters contained in the gypsum.                These are, 1,
grains of quartzose sand ;      2,  coaly or bituminous matter. Near the
 mouth of the Shubenacadie is a bed of black gypsum, included in
red sandstone, without a trace of bitumen          ;   3, crystals and fragments
of carbonate of lime, and small grains of magnesian limestone                 ;   4,
 red oxide of iron, especially in the veins ; 5, anhydrite.
    The anhydrite      is usually   associated    with the common variety,

                                        141
 sometimes     forming thick     beds,   and large rounded masses.       It is
white or grey, and crystalline, lamellar,      or granular.    It contains  oc
casionally bituminous matter.          It does not occur in veins, but is tra
versed by veins     of gypsum.
   The gypsum beds are entirely destitute of fossils.
   Many salt springs rise from the lower carboniferous and gypsi-
ferous rocks, but rock-salt has not been discovered.
   The lower carboniferous limestones are usually filled with shells
and corals   ;  but there are some limestone beds which are granular
and crystalline without fossils.       These beds agree with those of gyp
sum in their structure, and in containing bituminous matter.
   4iA, The origin of the gypsum.           The author concludes by stating
his opinion, that the gypsum beds cannot have been formed            in situ ;
but that they may have originated from the action           of sulphuric  acid,
conveyed by the rivers into       estuaries of small extent, the waters of
which,   from the abundance of marine fossils, must have been rich in
carbonate    of lime.     The acid may, he thinks, have been derived
from the oxidation      of iron pyrites, which is very abundant in the
older formations.       That  free acid may have    been   present, he consi
ders probable, from the blanched appearance            of certain sands and
clays adjoining the beds, while the neighbouring beds are strongly
coloured by iron.       Moreover, as might be expected, on the hypo
thesis of the decomposition of pyrites, oxide of iron is very abundant,
both colouring     the rocks very strongly, and in the form of large beds
of brown    hematite.      The oxidation of the pyrites may have been
promoted    by internal heat, of the action of which on the older rocks
there is abundant proof.        There is also good evidence that the beds
of gypsum were deposited in trough-shaped hollows of small extent ;
and if we suppose the supply of acid to be intermittent, this would
account for the alternation of beds of gypsum, and of shell limestone.
   The author considers the regular bedding of the anhydrite and its
association    with unaltered rocks, to preclude the idea of its being
gypsum altered by heat in situ ; and thinks it may have been first
altered by heat, and subsequently deposited at the bottom          of the  sea,
although its great purity is not favourable to this hypothesis.
   There was exhibited, in illustration of this paper, a large collec
tion of specimens, presented       by the author to the Society.
2.   On the mode of occurrence of Gypsum in Nova Scotia, and
       on its probable origin.          By the Same.
    In this paper, the author, after      a general description of the geolo

                                       142
gical character of the country, describes the superficial deposits which
he divides into —
    1.  The unstratified drift or boulder formation.           This, the lower
of the two superficial deposits, is characterised by the circumstance,
that most of the materials have been derived from the rocks on which
they now rest, or those in the vicinity.         The fragments are angular,
and altogether devoid      of any regular arrangement.       This unstratified
drift, however, does contain boulders from distant localities, which
may generally be traced.         The   appearances   indicate that the mate
rials have    been transported from the northward,         and also, to a less
 extent, from the southward, and, indeed, in various directions.
    Polished and scratched surfaces have been observed only in a few
localities  ;  but do not indicate a uniform direction.
    2. Stratified sand and gravel.           This deposit generally rests on
the former.        Sections were exhibited shewing this in two localities.
The    pebbles   of this gravel are comparatively small.       It often forms
mounds of singularly regular form, resembling works of art.
    After minutely describing various localities, the author proceeds
to say that the facts indicate more than one cause of change.        1st, He is
disposed   to consider the contour of the surface on which these depo
sits rest as the result of powerful submarine currents, occurring pro
bably during the gradual rise of the land.         2d, He considers the un-
associated    state  of the unstratified drift, and the small amount of at
trition it has undergone as proofs of subaerial disintegration, possibly
effected by the frost and thaws of an extreme climate.                3d, The
great confusion of the fragments, and the presence of foreign boulders
indicates, he thinks, a subsequent period of submergence, and the
agency    of icebergs, transporting     these boulders  in various directions.
Lastly, the mounds and ridges of stratified gravel may have been
formed during this period of submergence, or during the gradual rise
of the land.
    The agencies which have produced these deposits have played a
very important part in preparing the surface of the country for agri
cultural operations ; and this is possibly one of the principal uses
which these deposits have been intended to serve.
3. On certain Anomalous             Deviations of the Transit Instru
       ment at the Royal Observatory.                 By Professor C. P.
        Smyth.
    Professor Henderson had found a connection between the changes
in the level of the transit axis and the readings of a thermometer

                                       143
which he conceived to shew the temperature of the surface                of the rock
outside the Observatory        ; and was accustomed          latterly to determine
the level error    of the axis merely from the indications of the ther
mometer.
    The author     has   found from Professor         Henderson's    own observa
tions, a temperature effect on the azimuthal position of the axis               four
times as strong as      in the  case of the level.
    Indeed    the extent was so great as almost to vitiate the observa
tions  ;  for the amount of error varied regularly to such an extent from
day to day, as to preclude the possibility         of employing the only unex
ceptionable     method of determining       the azimuth of the instrument           :
viz. three consecutive observations of a star above                 and below the
pole.
    In   order to try to ascertain how heat produced this effect, or what
were the parts acted on, six different thermometers were discussed.
Five (Professor Forbes' s) had their bulbs buried in the rocks 50 feet
outside the Observatory, at the depths of 24, 12, 6, 3, and 0- French
feet respectively ; the last having its bulb merely covered              with sand  ;
a  sixth thermometer had been observed              under the floor of the Ob
servatory, and its indications came between the 0- and the 3 feet in
struments.
    The deeper the thermometers, the greater was found their differ
ence from the azimuthal errors of the transit ; the test consisting in
the prominence and similarity of the daily variations, and the degree
of retardation of the grand annual wane of heat.
    Of the former it was difficult to get a numerical estimate, but of
the latter a result was obtained shewing the             ratio of the quantity of
heat   in the first half   of the  year, to   that  in the last : —
      In  the case  of the 3 feet Thermometer, the ratio was 1         : 1-94:1
                            Thermometer under floor,              .  1 : 1-639
                            0- feet,        .       .      .      .  1 : 1-351
                            Instrumental errors of Transit,          1:1-158
plainly shewing that the parts acted on by temperature were more
quickly affected by it than a thin coat of sand, and so could neither
be   the rocky foundations of the piers, or the massive stone piers
themselves     ; but must be, considering too the effect of the walls and
roof covering the instrument, something very small, and most pro
bably metallic.
     The field of inquiry being thus curtailed, the           brass supports   of the
 axis on the top of the stone piers were examined, and the cause was

                                    144
then supposed     to be discovered in a bad principle        in the mode        in
which the adjustment for level was contrived.
    The experimentum erucis which the author proposes, is to do away
with the adjustable bearings, and have plain simple blocks of brass in
their stead, trusting to calculations and not to screws for correcting
the instrument.     But, as the adoption of this proof will take up a long
period, he, in the meanwhile, shews, that this cause which he thinks
to have discovered is a vera causa, is sufficient, so far as the quantity
is concerned, and is agreeable as to the direction in which it would
act : and as a farther test that the disturbing cause is something near
the instrument, and not the rocks outside, the readings of the ther
mometer attached to the barometer, and the outer thermometer read
off during the mural circle observations were       discussed,    and gave the
following highly confirmatory results : —
   Barometer- thermometer,   first half of year : second   half :  : 1 : 1'220

4.   Results of     Makerstoun Observations No. III. On the
       Solar and     Lunar periods of the Magnetic Declination.
       By J. A.      Broun, Esq. Communicated by Sir T. M.
       Brisbane,    Bart.
    The absolute westerly declination at Makerstoun, for the mean
epoch, June 1844 = 25° 17-12.
    The annual motion of the north end of the needle towards the
east=5'-67.
    The annual period of magnetic declination           consists    of a double
oscillation, having nearly the following      epochs    of maxima and mi
nima.*
A  max.  Jan. 30.   The min. Ap. 30.    The max. Sep. 10.      Amin.     Dec. 10.
    The author examines Cassini's observations (1783-7).               Although
they confirm this law to some extent, it is not conceived that they
can be trusted for such     a determination.       The author      also   verifies
his result by grouping a large mass of modern observations.                  The
observations at Washington and Toronto, with other facts, prove that
the oscillation is inverted, when the secular motion        of the    needle has
an opposite sign, and Colonel Beaufoy's observations (1817-20) seem
to prove, that when the secular motion is zero, the annual period is
   * By maximum is always meant an extreme westerly position of the north end
of the needle, and by minimum an extreme easterly (or rather northerly) posi
tion.

                                        145
a  combination of the oscillations for a positive and negative secular
motion.
    The mean range of the annual period at Makerstoun is 0'-96.
    The variation with reference to the moons age, consists of
               A   principal maximum 2 days after full moon.
               A   principal minimum 2 days after new moon.
with two secondary maxima           and two secondary minima, which are
exhibited with considerable regularity in each of the results for 4
years.      The range of the mean = 0'-83.
    The variations with reference to the moon's declination            and dis
tance from      the earth are less distinct       for evident   reasons.    The
former seems to consist of
    The maximum about the time of the moon's greatest N. declination.
    Minima                            when the moon is on the equator.
    A secondary maximum               of the moon's greatest S' declination.
    Diurnal periods.        1.  The Sun's hour angles.         In  the mean of
two years observations        (1844-5),   the north end of the needle moves
nearly 8' towards the west from 6h 10 a.m.             till 45m past noon, and
as much to the east from the latter epoch            till llh p.m. ; from llh
p.m.   till 2h 35 a.m., the north end      of the  needle   moves 0'-7 towards
the west, returning to the east again about as much by 6h a.m.              The
epoch of the greatest westerly declination seems to be connected with
its annual period, or with the value of the mean westerly declination,
and the epoch of the principal mininum, with the sign of the secular
change.       The author considers that the diurnal oscillation is double
 at all seasons of the year.
    2.   The Moon's hour angles.         The following are the result.
    Moon in opposition north of the equator; mean of 13 lunations               ;
 oscillation single; range = 0'-8.
    Maximum       lh before inferior transit.      Minimum      4h or 5h before
 superior transit.
    Moon in opposition south of the equator          ;  mean of 12 lunations    ;
 oscillation double ; range =0'- 6.
    Maximum 2|h, and minimum             6h after superior transit.      Second
 ary maximum        at inferior transit.   Minimum 5h after it.
    Moon in opposition northward, south of equator ; mean of 25 lu
 nations ; oscillation double ; range = 0',6.
     Secondary maximum 4 Jh, and minimum 8h after superior transit.
 Maximum at superior transit, minimum 6h after it.
     Single lunations verify these epochs very nearly.

3.    Notice of two Ores of Copper, one of them a new Mineral.
                      By Professor Connell.
   The first of the two ores here described, found in Cornwall, is a
new combination of chloride of copper, sulphate of copper, and water.
It occurs in beautiful small deep blue acicular crystals, of high lus
tre, grouped in bundles.   The quantity was too small for a quanti

     The other is essentially      a double carbonate            of zinc and      copper.
It   is from Matlock.      It    is pale-green, with a laminated              structure
and pearly lustre.      In
                        the qualitative examination of    the author    it,
observed indications of one, or even of more than one, metallic oxide,
which he could not identify satisfactorily           with any known substance.
This oxide     was found to adhere to the copper, when that metal was
precipitated by sulphuretted hydrogen.     When the sulphuret was
dissolved in aqua regia, and precipitated at boiling heat by potash,
                                                         a
the new oxide remained dissolved in the alkali,                    and the solution
yielded on evaporation       a   small quantity of      a   soluble salt of   a   beauti
ful orange-yellow colour. The solution of this salt, when acidulated,
gave, with sulphuretted hydrogen, a red-brown precipitate, which,
when dry, was insoluble in muriatic acid, but soluble in aqua regia.
On comparison with other known oxides yielding yellow compounds
with bases,  appeared to differ from all but the author had so mi
               it                                   ;
nute   a   quantity to operate on, that he cannot pronounce decidedly                  till
he has made further investigation.
     The analysis of 3-16 grains of the mineral gave for 100 parts,

    The following Communications                were read    : —
1.   Biographical Memoir of the late Dr Hope.                   By Dr Traill.
2.  Note on the Constitution of the Phosphates of the Organic
       Alkalies. By Dr Thomas Anderson.
    The author had         been   led to investigate the phosphates of the
organic alkalies, with the view of determining             the accuracy of an
analysis of the phosphate of strychnia by Regnault, which gave results
incompatible with the known constitution of the inorganic phosphates.
He alluded      to  the investigation       of the phosphates of aniline by
Nicholson,     and proceeded     to  the statement of his own observations.
    Phosphate     of Strychnia, with        one equivalent  of Strychnia,    was
obtained     in  long     truncated    needles,   by digesting strychnia in
tribasic phosphoric acid.        It  dissolved readily in water, and was acid
to   test-paper.     By analysis it       gave  results corresponding to the
formula
                       (C «   H23 N2 O4    HO)  2 HO P05
The crystallized salt       was found to contain 4 equivalents of water of
crystalization.
    Phosphate    of Strychnia, with two equivalents of Strychnia.            By
long-continued     digestion     of strychnia with the foregoing water in
solution, an additional atom of the alkaloid is dissolved, and the solu
tion on cooling deposits rectangular tables of a salt which is neutral
to test-paper.      It  is less soluble   in water than the acid phosphate,
and its constitution was found to be represented by the formula
                        2(C44H23N2       O,  HO) HOPO5
    Phosphate     of Brucia, with two equivalents of Brucia,        is obtained
by the solution of Brucia in phosphoric acid,           and crystallizes   from
the concentrated solution in short prisms.            The crystals are neutral
to test-paper, and contain a large quantity of water of crystallization,
which they lose by efflorescence.            The formula of the salt is
                        2 (C44   H23 N2 O7    HO) HO PO,

                                          149
 A  double phosphate of        Brucia and     soda was also   formed, but could
 not be  obtained perfectly pure.
    Phosphate       of Quinine, with     three   equivalents of Quinine.        By
 digesting   quinine      with phosphoric acid, a solution of this salt is
 obtained,  which becomes a solid mass of silky needles on cooling. They
 are extremely soluble in hot water, and are quite              neutral to test-
 paper.    They     gave, by analysis, a result corresponding with
                            3(C20H12NO2HO)POJ
    These results the author considered sufficient to establish the fact,
that the phosphate of the organic alkalies agree in            their constitution
with the inorganic salts of that acid         ; and he concluded his paper by
observing,    that the relations of these bases to phosphoric acid might
be made use     of   as a means   of classifying them. Thus quinine, which
replaces three equivalents of water in phosphoric acid, might be com
pared to oxide of lead and the oxides of the heavy metals.                  Brucia
might    represent the inorganic         alkalies.   While strychnia, which,
under ordinary        circumstances, replaces only one equivalent of water,
belongs to a class which has no analogue among the               series  of inor
ganic bases.    ,

      The following communication was read                    :
  Examination of some Theories of German Writers, and of
           Mr Grote, on the Authorship of the Iliad and Odyssey.
           By Professor Dunbar.
      In the first part of the paper the question         was examined, whether
  the art of writing was known and              practised at the time in which
 Homer is         supposed   to have lived   ?  It was found that there was no
 evidence,       either in the   Iliad or Odyssey, that it    was practised at that
 time    ;   but that these poems must have          been   transmitted       orally by
 the Bards for a period of nearly three centuries.                  It  was then con
 sidered whether poems of such a length               as the     Iliad    and Odyssey
 could have been composed and committed to memory by one man                            ;
 and it was shewn, from several examples, that there was no impos
                                                        " that no such
 sibility in the matter. Mr Grote's theory,                                 poet of the
 name of Homer ever existed," was then examined, and shewn, from
 the testimony of several of the most eminent Greek authors,                      to be
 fallacious.        It  was stated   that lays, containing       the history of the
 ancestors of powerful chiefs, were composed by the Bards attached
 to their families, and that Homer, in all probability, availed himself
 of them in working up           the  Iliad and Odyssey.        The    mode in which
these poems were circulated through Greece by the Nomads, was next
pointed out, by their reciting them on public occasions                 in every part
of Greece.           It was shewn    that they were not committed            to writing
 till  a   little   before  the age of Solon and Pisistratus.              Wolfe and
Lachmann's theories were then examined, and shewn to be altogether
fallacious.         The opinion of Mr Grote that the Iliad               was first   an
Achilleis, and that the         books, including the second and the subsequent
ones to the eleventh, were the compositions of a later or later poets,
was examined, and           it was shewn, by a reference to several           incidents
in these books, that they must have been composed by the same author,
and formed a necessary           part of the story of the Iliad.        It was stated,
contrary to        Mr   Grote's opinion, that the   Iliad   possessed      more unity
than the Odyssey, and that internal evidence               proved that it was         in
all probability        composed    by the author of the     Iliad, and not by a
piecing together of the lays of later poets.               The opinions of some
German critics, that the Odyssey was of             a  later date than the Iliad,

                                           155
 was then    examined, and shewn to be well founded.                It  seemed  likely
 to have been composed          in Homer's old     age, and bore the same resem
 blance to the    Iliad in point of execution         as the Paradise Regained of
 Milton to that of the Paradise Lost of the same poet.                     The paper
 concluded with a quotation from            Mr   Grote, in which he seemed           to
 have departed from his original           opinions.

    The following communication was read : —
       1.  On Algebraical Symbolism.              By Bishop Terrot.
    The author commenced by proving the propriety of             the adoption
of the minus sign for quantities of an affection opposite to those
affected by the plus sign, and detecting the limits within which this
use  of the absolute minus       was reasonable and effective.
    He   observed    that this was merely a particular case of the nota-
                                                                           J_
tion which symbolizes         the inclination   of lines by the factor    l2 *,
namely, the case where 5 = 180°, and proceeded to shew within what
limits the algebraical rules for the treatment of exponential          quanti
ties are applicable to the symbols of inclined lines.
    After referring     to the use  of this notation in all the problems of
plane Trigonometry, especially those which treat of the sines and
cosines of multiple arcs, he gave some examples of its applicability

                                       157
to some    elementary      propositions  in the first and fourth       books    of
Euclid.

    The following Communications                were read      : —
 1. Account of a Geological Examination of the Volcanoes
        of the Vivarais.        By Professor Forbes.
    The author having, on former          occasions,   stated some results     of his
 travels in Auvergne and the Cantal, gives a more                detailed descrip
 tion of the volcanoes      of the Vivarais, which          have   been   less  fre
 quently and less accurately described.
    He first   gives an account    of the journey from Le Puy            across the
 chain of the Cevennes      which culminate at the volcanic summit of the
Mezeuc, by the course of the Loire, to Montpezat in the department
of  the Ardeche.
    The best descriptions of the Vivarais are those of Foujas de St
Fond and      Mr   Scrope.    The plates illustrating the work of the lat
ter leave almost nothing       to desire.     These authors have described
more or less fully the following volcanic orifices — Coupe de Jaujac,
 Souillolsor   Neyvac,    Mouleynes      or Thuez    ;  Montpezat     and Aysac.
Other writers have described the cone of Bauzou, and the (so-called)
crater of Elevation of Pal, which are generally supposed not to have
given birth to any lava stream.            The present author has given a
more minute and detailed account           of each of these volcanoes, and of
the great beds of basaltic lava to which they have respectively given
birth.    He  discusses the relative age, the remarkably columnar struc
ture, and the surprising erosion by water of these (comparatively
modern) lava flows, which he illustrates by an exact map of the
formations, based upon Cassini's, and by very numerous levels baro
metrically determined.        He   has also been able to add to the          list of
known volcanoes       in this district, two craters which he believes never
to have been described, occurring in remarkable positions, and giving
rise to extensive lava streams, one in the valley of Budzet, the other in
that of la Bastide.    The former    he believes to be unparalleled amongst
ancient or modern lavas for the length and slenderness              of its stream,
shewing a surprising liquidity, which he illustrated             by some experi
ments on the powers of melted iron solidifying             in narrow channels.
    A  series  of  specimens   illustrating   the paper had formerly been
presented    to the Society.

    2.  Geological Notices.             By Dr Fleming.
       (1.) Additional example of Diluvial Scratches on                   the Rocks
             in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh.
    The author     stated that,       recently, an opportunity       had presented
itself of observing, at a newly-opened sandstone             quarry, dressed and
scratched    surfaces, at an elevation above the level of the sea greater
than   any examples of the same              kind of diluvial action      as yet re
corded,   as occurring      in the neighbourhood.           The locality is east
ward   of the east   Cairn Hill, in the Pentland Hills, at a place termed
" Thomson's Walls," and its elevation,
                                                     according to Knox's map of
Mid-Lothian, is 1400         feet.
    Dr Fleming then       stated,    that, last autumn, in addition to the ex
ample    of  a dressed    and scratched surface 130 yards westward of
Granton Pier, on a level with the beach, he had observed a similar
occurrence at the east side of the harbour of North Berwick,                     near
the  " Auld Kirk,"      on the surface      of a rock of amygdaloid;      and added,
that he had found similar scratches,           at the sea-level, on the south side
of Montrose Basin.
    The author next adverted              to   an example     of  dressed     vertical
surfaces,   with horizontal scratches, on the northern               base  of North

a  vertical face of rock recently exposed              at the Hadderwick        Lime
Quarries, north from Montrose.
    Dr Fleming next called the attention of the Society               to the   Black
ford   Hill example of a dressed and scratched surface, and intimated
that the scratches     had a dip to the eastward, reaching, in some cases,
to  50°.    He stated it      as probable, that the phenomena, instead               of
having    resulted from diluvial         action,    had been    produced      by the
abrading operations of the Braid Burn.

of quartz     and calcedony, in the form              of cakes   or circumscribed
stalagmites, from the fort of Aden in the Bed Sea, which had been

sent    to him       by    Dr Buist of Bombay.            They   were     remarkable as
having a few minute crystals of fluoride of calcium, the matter of
which aggregated during the evaporation of the water, which                           had
furnished, in greater quantity,              the    siliceous materials    forming        the

1.     On the Preparation of Kreatine, and on the amount of                               it
        in the flesh of different Animals. By Dr Gregory.
    After     some remarks on the present state of animal chemistry, the
author commenced                 brief account of the recent discoveries
                             by giving   a
of Liebig in regard to the constituents of the " juice of flesh," or the
liquid contained in tho substance of the muscles, which           distin      is

                                         161
guished    from the blood by the large proportion of free acid it con
tains.    This remarkable animal fluid has been found, by Liebig, to
contain    phosphoric    and lactic acids in large quantity, inosinic acid
in small proportion,       and some other acids           not yet studied     ; also,
potash   in large quantity with a little soda, a considerable proportion
of magnesia, and a little lime, chloride of potassium, with a little
chloride    of sodium, and,       besides   some compounds of animal origin
not yet investigated, the new base        Kreatinine, and the very remarkable
substance, Kreatine, first discovered by Chevreul, but in vain sought
for by Berzelius and other chemists.
    He then described the       process, essentially that of     Liebig,   by which
kreatine is extracted from the flesh of quadrupeds, birds, and fishes,
in all of which hitherto tried, it         has   been  found, although in small
and variable quantity.          A   table was exhibited,       shewing     the per
centage obtained from different kinds of flesh and fish, and the re
sult was,    that this interesting       substance may be most easily and
cheaply prepared from           fish, especially cod,      herring,  salmon, and
mackerel, all of which yielded much more than beef or horse-flesh,
and nearly as much as fowl, which was the most productive.                      The
maximum       proportion    of kreatine     was    3-2 per 1000 parts of flesh.
The    average  about 1-5 per 1000.
    The author stated that          he had     found inosinic acid     only in the
flesh  of fowl  and* turkey   ;   and he is informed, by Baron Liebig, that
it is quite    possible that this acid may also have             been confined to
the flesh of fowls    in his experiments,       as it was often absent,    although
he cannot now ascertain the cases in which             it was present.
    He concluded by stating, that as kreatine is found in the urine,
along with kreatinine, it appears to be, in part at least, a substance
intended for excretion.        Its crystalline character renders this proba
ble  ;  and, at all events,   if it  has any function to perform in the body,
that function is not yet known.           It   must be regarded, in the mean
time, as one of the numerous series of less complex products derived
from the decomposition, in the body, of the effete tissues               ;   and al
though we cannot yet produce it artificially, yet, from the rapid pro
gress recently made in the study of the products of decomposition of
the albuminous substances, we may hope "soon, not only to do this,
but also to discover, from these products, the true formulae of the al
buminous compounds.

2.  Notices of a Flood at Frastanz, in the Vorarlberg, in the
       Autumn of 1846.           By William Brown, Esq.
   The author noticed the general          effects of running water, in dis
solving, rubbing down, and transporting to a lower level, the solid
parts of the earth's      surface;     and referred to the gradual change
which it is producing on the relative level of sea and land.            He then
described an occurrence which he had witnessed in the Vorarlberg,
during the autumn of 1846.
   After a hot and dry summer,          a succession of heavy rains for nearly
a fortnight, swelled all the streams flowing into the river        111,  flooded
the lower grounds, and inflicted a great deal of injury on the fields,
roads, and bridges.        At Frastanz,       a small  stream brought down
from the mountains an enormous quantity of gravel, which continued
for  at least three weeks after the rains had ceased.          When first    seen
by him, on the 6th of September, the volume of water in the stream
was   not very great, nor was its velocity unusual         ;  but immediately
beneath the surface of the water, which was quite transparent,                 in
 numerable stones were seen to be in motion.                 These stones were
generally of the size of an egg.             The quantity of gravel brought
down was    so  great, that the bed of the stream was elevated            to the
height of 25 feet in one part.          The village of Frastanz was consi
dered to be in danger, from this curious torrent of stones rolled along
by the water ; and several hundreds of men were employed to bank
it in by large   trees laid   lengthwise,     and supported by strong posts
driven into the ground.           In   the course of the following      year, a
wooden canal was formed         in the lowest part of the stream, by which
about a   third of the mass of gravel has been washed down. This
has raised the level    of the   111, into which the Frastanz stream flows,
for two or three miles.        The quantity of loose stones in the upper
part of the ravine is     still so great as to threaten a renewal of the
catastrophe at any time when an unusual flow of water shall set                  it
in motion.
3.   Contributions to the Phenomena of the Zodiacal Light.
                    By Professor C. Piazzi Smyth.
    The purport of this paper       was to place on record certain observa         -
tions made during the years        1843-4-5, in the southern hemisphere,

                                       163
at those times of the year when the Zodiacal Light cannot be seen in
the  Northern hemisphere       ;  to test, by means      of  these new data,  —
which, besides the novelty of the geographical position, had the fur
ther one of being determined by instrumental             measurement, — what
laws  of the phenomena may         be considered   to have been satisfactorily
made out, and what required further          elucidation  ;  and to recommend
these latter to the attention     of  observers  situated in more favourable
parts of the world than those commanded by European Observatories
generally.
    After discussing the history of the subject,            and mentioning the
results arrived     at by different observers, the author mentions the
manner in which his attention          was  first particularly directed to the
subject, describes the particular course of observation which he then
commenced, and which consisted           principally   in observing the right
ascension and declination        of the apex of the light, by means of a
small equatorial instrument of particular construction, which gave
results not affected with more than 2° of probable error.                Combin
ing his own observations with those of former investigators, the author
concludes, that the hypothesis proposed         by Cassini,    and subsequently
maintained by      La Place, Schubert, Poisson , Biot, and Humboldt, viz.,
that the Zodiacal light is in the form of a ring encircling the sun, is
decidedly untenable, but that it is rather, as first suggested by Mairan
and since affirmed by Olbers and Sir        John Herschel, in the form of a
lenticular mass.      Mairan's idea, too, of the     body being excentrically
disposed about the sun, being endued with a rotation, and occasionally
crossing the earth's orbit, seems to be confirmed.                 But the exact
quantity of such excentricity,       the period of rotation,      the position of
the plane     of the body, the question of any actual periodical increase
in the size    and brightness of the Zodiacal light, and the physical na
ture of that light, whether entirely reflected,       or whether, as rendered
probable by some observations, partly direct, are matters, for the sa
tisfactory determination of which more data are required.                For the
assistance     of those who   may be inclined      to prosecute the inquiry,
the author adds descriptions,        both verbal and pictorial,      of what  thu
Zodiacal light is like, what observers        may expect to see     ;  and men
tions the times of the year at which, in different latitudes, the phe
nomenon may be best seen,          together with a number of other atten
dant circumstances which are necessary          to be complied with, in order
to procure undeniable observations.

    The following Communications                were read     : —
 1. Practical Illustration of the Adjustments of the Equatorial
        Instrument. By Professor C. Piazzi Smyth.
    The object of this paper was partly to introduce to the notice of
 travellers and residents in tropical countries, a small equatorial in
 strument, specially contrived for observing the Zodiacal               light ; and
 partly to bring forward before amateur astronomers,                 prominently,

                                        165
  the advantage      of equatorial mountings in general ; as well as to ex
  emplify the best and easiest methods of adjusting and rectifying the
  instruments, and placing the telescopes         in every respect in the most
  favourable circumstances for yielding good results.          After describing
  how,   in the history of astronomy, equatorial or parallactic           stands
  were   twice    taken   up  and abandoned       again,   from the erroneous
  estimate formed of the purposes to which they were adapted, the
  author     mentioned    the  impracticable     nature   of  the altitude   and
 azimuth      mountings which followed     ;   and dated the present era of
 the perfection and the rational employment            of equatorials   to have
 commenced in 1820, when Sir           J. Herschel,    in conjunction with    Sir
 J.  South, erected one of these instruments, to give, by its         A. R. and
 Declination     circles, absolute places roughly    ;  and, by means of a mi
 crometer applied to the focus of the telescope,         small differences very
 exactly   :  the old error having been, to attempt to determine abso
 lute places with the utmost precision.
    After particularising the various merits and imperfections of the
 two grand divisions      of equatorials, viz., the English and the Ger
 man, and mentioning a new construction in progress for the Edin
 burgh Observatory,        combining with the single-pier      and short polar
 axis of the German form, the advantage which the English possesses,
 of large circles, and a position for the telescope between the two
 bearing ends of the polar axis, together with an exceeding degree of
 firmness and stiffness, — the author proceeded to describe the six
errors of adjustment to which all equatorials are subject, and to
shew,    by means of a model placed within           a representation    of  the
celestial sphere, contrived for the purpose, how all the rectifications
might be made by means of observations of stars.
    The application of clock motion       to equatorials, for the purpose      of
keeping a celestial object stationary        in the field,   was next entered
into  ; and the plan explained       by which the hitherto       ungovernable
fits of  " knocking" of the
                                revolving balls in the later form of English
clocks, has been remedied in the case of the Edinburgh Equatorial;
— viz., by having three pendulum-balls 120° apart, attached to the
vertical spindle of the governor, instead of only two at 180°.
    As  a proper micrometer to be used for very faint objects,         in place
of the ring micrometer, — which the author unhesitatingly condemned,
as never having furnished accurate results          either in  A. R. or Decl.,
but more especially in the latter, in any person's hands, though so

                                            166
strongly recommended, and extensively used, on account of the beauty
and truth of one of the theoretical principles involved in     — he                     it,
recommended          a   bar-micrometer,     wherein right ascensions were mea
sured by transits across three parallel bars, marking both the immer
sions and emersions, so as to get rid of error                of focus and irradiation
of light     ;   and declinations were measured by a bar at right angles
to the former, the objects being bisected alternately with either edge
of the bar.          Observers already provided with position-micrometers
might easily have some of these bars inserted, which in one position                               .
might be used for           A. R., and in another for Decl.                   Such     a   micro
meter has been found to require no illumination on the darkest nights,
even     in telescopes of small aperture, and to produce results, with
the amorphous masses of faint comets, almost equal                            in   accuracy to
those obtained from stars observed                with fine wires in an illuminated
field.
     The paper concluded with         a short special description               of the Zod.
Light-equatorial, which, for economy, lightness,                       and    general effec
tiveness, seemed well fitted for scientific travellers.
2. On the      Vertebral Column, and some Characters that have
         been overlooked in the Descriptions both of the Ana
         tomist and Zoologist. By Dr Macdonald.
     After noticing that the vertebral skeleton                has usually been com
pared to column, of which the basis (in man)
             a                               formed by the sa     is
crum and coccyx, the shaft or columnar part being the bodies of
the true vertebrae,         as they   are    usually styled, and surmounted by
the splendid composite capital the cranium,                   the author proposed re
stricting the observations to the columnar                    portion,       usually divided
into     7   cervical,   12 dorsal, and      5    lumbar vertebrae.            This division
was      denounced,      and beginning       at the summit,            he shewed that the
upper or cervical region consisted only of                6   verteb               the 7th, in
its normal position in the mammal class, had                  a   rib partly articulated
to   its body, and therefore acquired the character of                  a    dorsal vertebra.
     Restricting the cervical to six, the arrangement of the atlas and
axis indicates the tendency to         a     combination into pairs in the course
of the vertebral axis.          The body of         the   atlas   is   almost entirely re
placed by the intrusion of the odontoid process of the axis                        ;   and thus,

                                        167
by their combined form and articulations,            the head resting on them
is provided with an equatorial          and azimuth motion, as the astrono
mers say.      The pairing of the       1st   and 2d osteologically, is further
strengthened neurologically,       which is also applicable to the next pair
of   the 3d and 4th.    These     two pairs are more properly to be consi
dered as the acostal    cephalic portion, as the cervical plexus is princi
pally distributed to the upper region of the body, as far as the moto-
sensory    part of the system     is concerned, although it also contributes
to the thoracic and abdominal portions of the nutrient or splanchnic
system.      The third pair, formed by the 5th and 6th cervical ver
tebrae, are the acostal constituents of the humero-brachial                 regions, and
with the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th, are neurologically connected to
gether in supporting the nerves, forming the brachial plexus as they
emerge from the spinal canal. This arrangement completes the cervical
region in all the mammals except the Bradipus tridactylitis ; which is
also illustrative  of the coupling or pair principle here proposed, as
the   additional vertebrae only form another pair. The idea of the dif
ferent classes of vertebrae composing the cervical region, as proposed
by De Blainville and Knox, was examined, and shewn to be incom
plete, as it considered the 7th vertebra to be a class by itself.                  As De
Blainville's view coincided with that         now submitted, in separating the
7th from the upper vertebrae, it was pro tanto adduced in evidence                           ;
but the most striking corroboration           was found in the examination                of
the skeletons of many of the mammals, several of which were ex
hibited and demonstrated, where it was shewn that in many,                          if   not
all, mammals, the normal position of the head of the rib was opposite
the intervertebral     space, and that as 12 ribs require 12 spaces, there
 must be 13 costal vertebrae.             This additional thoracic or costal
 vertebra is provided by the 7, which             is only     (in man) deprived of
 its costal connection possibly by the traction of the subclavian artery,
 which is the remains of one of the primitive reptilöid                          branchial
 arches,    even here the first   rib   is occasionally    in its normal situation,
 and when it is found that, in all cases, there are in man eight and
 generally nine of the ribs in their normal              situation,       and, also, that
 an undue share is given to the 8th vertebra, as the whole                      of the 1st,
 and part     of the 2d, rib is connected to       it,   we are surely authorised
 to consider this as the normal position in         all mammals.               The impor
 tance     attached to this osteological discovery           is,   that   it   corrects an

                                         168
 error in the universally assumed character of mammals, which Dau-
 benton              first applied, with the sole exception above no
              and Cuvier
 ticed of the Sloth, which, however, still remains the exception to the
 number, while it corroborates the principle of coupling or pairing
 the cervical vertebrae, which is of considerable use in unravelling
 the cranial vertebrae, and which De Blainville speaks of as still un
                  "   to those who have been unable to elevate               themselves
 intelligible
 tothis kind of questions" (the signification of the skeleton transcen-
 dentally considered)
                       " partly on account of the nature of their
 minds, and partly from the want of proper and sufficient subjects                      of
 contemplation."
      In    this view of the cervical vertebrae,     there was no examination
 of what are known as floating or cervical           ribs, first pointed out and
 described by     Vicq d'Azy                of the Academy of Paris for
                               z in the Memoirs
 the year 1774, and which lately, Professor T. Bell of King's College,
 London, has described in the case of the Bradypus.    This class of ribs
ought to be regarded as quite different from the thoracic ribs                    ;   and
there was a beautiful         example    exhibited       on     the table, which the
kindness of Professor         Goodsir    enabled the author to shew              to the
Society, and which forms part of a series collected and described                     by
Dr Knox, in the London Medical Gazette,                  some years ago.         In   va
rious classes there are similar ribs, quite unconnected with, and dif
fering from, the thoracic ribs, which are rather homotypes of the sty
loid process of the temporal bone, and possibly of the lower floating or
the 10th, 11th, and 12th, or abdominal ribs.                  (?)   The consideration of
these,      in the next part of the communication, with the exposition of
the cranial vertebrae,       will form   a   subject for      a     farther communica
tion.
   Having demonstrated that the 7th rib    attached to the 7th ver
                                                    is

situation of the 1st rib in Man on the 8th vertebra, instead of be

 who  depend on organic structure for the characters of their classifi

    The following Communication              was then read     : —
On the Theory of the Parallel Roads of Lochaher. By James
    Thomson, Esq. jun., Glasgow. Communicated by Professor
    Forbes.
    The author, after briefly stating the views of Mr Milne, and the
remarks of Sir G. S. Mackenzie, gave his reasons for agreeing with
the former, that the terraces were          the beaches of lakes, formed by
barriers across the valleys   ; and, with the latter,   in holding that  these
barriers could not have been formed of earthy detritus.              He then
proceeded to shew that the theory of Agassiz, according to which the
barriers were formed of glaciers, was the most probable yet advanced,
and while it required some modification in the details to render it
consistent with recently observed facts, was strongly supported by the
researches   of Professor   Forbes,     both in regard to the former exis
tence  of glaciers in our latitudes, as demonstrated in the case of the
Cuchullin Hills, and in regard to the laws of the motion of glaciers,
as developed in Professor Forbes's papers on the Glaciers of the        Alps.
   He pointed out that all the difficulties of the theory of earthy bar
riers were connected with the notion of their being composed of
earthy detritus, and that both Sir T. D. Lauder and           Mr Milne     ad
mitted the great difficulty of accounting for their disappearance.
   He then explained the modifications which were required            to ren
der the theory of Agassiz capable of explaining        all the facts hitherto
observed.
   The highest shelf in Glen Roy         stops short just  above the opening
into Glen Glaster, and this would have been the result had the bar
rier which formed that shelf blocked up Glen Roy above the latter
glen, and thus forced the water to be discharged           by the water-shed
at the head of the valley of the Spey.           It  must also have   blocked
up Glen Collarig nearly to the Gap.           To form the middle shelf, this
barrier had only to retire   a  little,   so as to open    up Glen Glaster,
when the water would discharge itself by the ancient river-course
leading from the water-shed in Glen Glaster,           first pointed out by
Mr Milne.
   The lowest shelf would    be formed when the glacier retired to near
the mouth of Glen Spean.

                                         171
   The blockage of Glen Gluoy seems to have been unconnected with
that of the other glens.         The author ascribes it        to a glacier occupying
the site of Loch Lochy, and fed from the high mountain to the north.
He explains the occurrence of a lower shelf in Glen Gluoy, which
stops short of the mouth of the glen, by a reference to analogous
phenomena          observed   by Professor    Forbes in the Lac de Combal.
   The shelf in a glen near Kilfinnan                 observed by    Mr Darwin,           is
accounted      for by the glacier supposed           to have    occupied the site of
Loch Lochy.
  Mr Milne          objects, to the notion of a glacier descending from Ben-
Nevis, and crossing Glen Spean to block up Glen Roy, that the in
equalities of the intervening ground are so great as to render the
existence     of a glacier in this direction highly improbable,                more espe
cially as the ice had a comparatively               easy outlet northward          towards
Fort-William.
  The author, however, endeavours                  to shew, that,    if   we assume a
climate intermediate between that which produces the glaciers of the
Alps, and that which forms the glaciers of the arctic and antarctic
regions, there is no real difficulty in imagining the existence of a
great expanse of ice descending from Ben-Nevis, at a level consider
ably    higher than that of the intervening hills,             as well as     of the high
est    shelf in Glen Roy.
  That       such a climate may very probably have existed, the author
considers     as proved by the researches             of Professor    Forbes        among
the    Cuchullin Hills,       the elevation of which is much less than that of
Ben-Nevis.
   There      is,
           in the phenomena of the great erratic blocks of the Alps,
proof of the former prodigious horizontal extension of glaciers,
although, in the existing climate of the Alps, the glaciers no longer
exhibit the same horizontal development.                  The author          also referred
to the indications of glaciers         found in many parts of Great Britain,
some of them in the Lochaber district, to the occurrence of organic
remains of an arctic character, and to the marks of the supposed
action of icebergs, as supporting            the view of the existence of           a   gla
cial climate at some remote period.
   The diluvial theory of Sir G.             S.   Mackenzie was briefly examined,
and certain objections urged against it.
  The author also alluded to the objection urged by                  Mr Lyell        to the
glacial theory, on the score of the changes               of relative         level on sea

     The following Communications              were read   : —
     1. On an Instrument for measuring the extensibility of
        Elastic Solids. By Professor Forbes.
     This instrument       is almost a faithful    reproduction of S'Graves-
ande's apparatus       described in his     " Physices Elementa Mathema
tical' 1742 (but not in the previous editions).            It is described or
alluded to by few modern writers, except Biot in his
                                                                  " Traite de
Physique."       It consists  of a strong wooden table or frame, with a vice
at each end, between which a wire or lamina may be stretched with a
determinate tension by means of a weight attached by a cord, pass
ing over a pulley in the manner of the musical apparatus, called a
Monochord.        After the tension     is adjusted, both vices  are   screwed
 fast, the space included between them          being exactly 50 inches.     If
 now, any deviation of the middle point of the wire included by the
 vices   be made (similar to the action       of sounding  a harp-string),  the
 force required to pull it a certain distance aside will depend, 1st, on
 the length of the wire ; 2d, on its tension ; 3d, on its extensibility,
 or the modulus of elasticity.
     S'Gravesande      employed his apparatus         to verify Hooke's    law,
 that the extension is as the extending force within the limits of per
 fect elasticity.     But it  does not seem to have occurred to him,        nor
  (singularly enough)     to later experimenters, to deduce from the forces
 required to produce given deviations, the specific extensibility,            or
 what Dr Young calls the Modulus of Elasticity of the body.
      VOL.  II.                                                   R

     It is   essential that the deviation from the rectilinear position of the
wire should be ascertained with great nicety, and                                              S'Gravesande's
contrivance          effects     this    in    a    very neat and satisfactory way.                                  A
fine steel chain attaches by a hook                                 to    the middle point                      of the
extended       wire, the other end being secured to the circumference of a
nicely centred wheel.                   Another chain attached similarly to the wire
of the same wheel, has a scale                          attached to            it,    a   weight           placed in
which causes the wheel to revolve, and by means                                           of       the    first chain
and hook, pulls the wire out                       of the straight line.                           A     long    index
fixed to the same axis with the wheel, points out the deviation on                                                   a
much magnified                 scale,   referred to            a    divided          semicircle            of brass.
Thus     a   weight being placed in the scale, the corresponding deviation
is   instantly shewn.
     Let P  be the weight in the scale, D the deviation of the wire,
s    = half the length of the wire between the vices   was proved in                      ;   it

where     M    is    the modulus          of       elasticity, measured in grains which                              is
easily reduced           to the equivalent length of                      a    similar wire or lamina,
according to         Dr Young's definition.                        This    is   on the supposition that
Hooke's Law of Elasticity (the extension                                  is   as the extending force)
is   correct       and that law          is   verified        if   the term          M                   be found   for
                                                                                              ^—   ^3

value of       M, the modulus,            is    also at once given by                     a    single observed
deviation, the tension being known.
     A   small correction in the value of                      P     is   to be made, for the weight
of the wire deflecting             it   from a straight line.                        This small correction
had not escaped the notice of S'Gravesande when he verified Hooke's
law.

     The numbers in the last column should vary as the cubes of              those
in the first, or be as 1, 8, 27.         If we deduct 10 grains from          each
of them for the     action  of the weight of the wire depressing itself, we
shall have these numbers —
                        90             710            2390

     Hence the mean      result for    M          for D = -25, or     -    = XJT,
                                           (")3
 is nearly 89 grains, consequently,
                                   J*    , =  89
                                  (100)3
 and   M = 89,000,000 grains.
     But a foot in length of the wire         in question     weighs  1 1  grains.
 The equivalent modulus of elasticity is therefore very nearly
 8,000,000 feet of the wire in question, which agrees closely with
 the received numbers for steel-wire.
 2. On the     Anthracite of the Calton Hill.               By Dr Fleming.
     The occurrence of anthracite in this locality         has been noticed and
  recorded by several observers,       who seem to have overlooked some of
  its more remarkable peculiarities.         At present, this mineral may        be
 detected   in a series of anastomosing vertical veins of calcareous spar,
  including, at the same time, angular portions of the claystone
  porphyry in which they are situate, on the upper north walk on the
  north   side  of the Observatory.           The anthracite      occurs, 1.    In
 rounded, drop-like      pieces,  on which     the calcareous spar has been
  moulded, not unlike the colophonite of Norway.              2. In  masses with
 plane surfaces,    apparently produced by the laminae of the surround
 ing spar.     3.  In  angular masses, with       sharp edges, and     a  conchoi-
  dal fractured surface.      The drop-like pieces must have been solid
 previous to   the solidification of the spar, while the flattened masses
  have yielded    to the pressure      of its crystallization.      The angular
  masses, however, which       are   the most numerous, occur crowded to
  gether, of different sizes, while the neighbouring          fragments unequi
  vocally indicate, by their corresponding shape,           that they had been
  broken when in     a  hard state, and separated in the very spot they
  now occupy, being suspended       in the calcareous parts which afterwards

                                            176
became spar.         The author exhibited analogous examples of fractures
and separations in the Beryl and Tourmaline.
     The author next adverted to the opinion, that the Calton                     was    a
mass of trap which had             burst through the coal formation          ; and that
the anthracite was the altered bitumen, which the rising trap had
enveloped in its passage.             But, in opposition to these views, although
countenanced by Jameson,                Cunningham,     and Milne, he stated that
the Calton, with the exception of its two small trap dykes, consisted
 of   a series   of sedimentary matters or strata, which had been assorted
 by water      ;  and that, in position, these         strata occupied       a place   far
 below the mountain           limestone, as is demonstrated by their dip and
 connection with the group extending                under the coal measures         from
 the Castle      Hill  to Joppa, which       he had no hesitation      in referring to
 the old red sandstone.
 3. On some Phenomena                 of Capillary Attraction observed with
         Chloroform, Bisulphuret of Carbon, and other Liquids.
         By Dr George Wilson.
      The   object of this communication           was to bring before the Society
  some phenomena which               are exhibited    when certain liquids, denser
  than water, are exposed, while contained in glass or porcelain vessels,
  to the alternate action of acids and alkalies.             The liquids with which
  the phenomena described             were noticed, were chloroform,         bisulphuret
  of carbon, Dutch          liquid     (C4  H4 CI2),     bromine,    oil of    cloves,   of
   sassafras,    of cinnamon, and of bitter almonds.            The majority of the
   experiments       were made        with chloroform,     and the phenomena pre
   sented    in common       by    all the liquids mentioned      were      described    in
   full, as presented by chloroform.
       When that fluid          is dropped into water, contained           in a glass    or
   glazed porcelain vessel, it falls to the bottom as a brilliant, highly
   mobile globule.         If    potass, soda, or ammonia, be now added, the
   globule at once collapses, sinks as if pressed down by the alkali, and
   flattens out on the bottom of the containing vessel.                      On slightly
    supersaturating      the alkali with an acid, the flattened chloroform
    recovers, with      great rapidity,       its globular    shape,    as   if suddenly
   relieved from pressure.
       When the acid in its turn                is supersaturated     with alkali,      the
   flattening     again occurs      ;  and by alternating      the addition of these
   re-agents, the same globule may be successively flattened and rounded
    for any number of times.

                                     177
    If the  experiments referred to be made with quantities of chloro
form sufficiently large to touch the walls of the containing vessel         on
every side, and to form a stratum of some depth, the effect of adding
alkaline water is to give the chloroform a surface apparently hori
zontal, and the addition     of acids  makes    its upper boundary highly
convex.
    Change in configuration, however, is not the only alteration which
the globule of chloroform undergoes.          Several of its physical pro
perties are strikingly modified by its contact with aqueous solutions
of   acids  and alkalies.   When   these   are alternately   made to act on
chloroform     at the bottom of a flat white porcelain vessel,          which
admits of the resulting phenomena being distinctly observed,          the re
agents   in question change  the sensible characters of the denser liquids
in the following way.      Under acidulated water the globules       are bril
liant, very mobile, and obedient to the solicitation      of gravity.     De
tached globules, when they meet, readily run together, and scarcely
one is to be seen without a bubble      of air attached    to its upper sur
face, and adhering tenaciously.       Under alkaline water,     on the other
hand, the globules      of chloroform    spread   out into flat discs, with
rounded edges     ; or elongated into irregularly ovoidal or flattened
cylindrical forms, which vary their       shapes on the slightest impulse.
These flattened globules are, moreover, much less mobile than the
rounded ones under acid.       They move sluggishly, cling to the vessel,
 and leave a   tail behind them when urged to move          rapidly.    Their
brilliancy is sensibly diminished,     and no air-bells adhere to their
 upper surfaces.
    Chloroform     admits of being coloured by digestion          on  litmus,
 alkanet root, &c. &c.      Globules   of the coloured liquid flatten out
 greatly more under alkalies than the colourless chloroform does, so that
 blue or red globules spread over an irregular       area five or six times
 greater than they occupy under acids.       Their apparent viscidity,    loss
 of mobility and of brilliancy, are also more marked than when colour
 ing matter is absent.
    Phenomena similar to those noticed with the colourless chloroform
 were observed with the several liquids       previously mentioned.       The
 author, in conclusion, declined to enter on the theory of the pheno
 mena described, further than to ascribe an important         share in their
 production to the action of lighter and heavier liquids on each other.

     The following Communications                    were read        :   —
1.   Notice of the Orbit of the Binary Star a Centauri, as re
      cently determined by Captain W. S. Jacob, Bombay
      Engineers. By Professor C. P. Smyth.
     The object of this paper is          to point    out the extremely important
and interesting characteristics           of the orbit of the two stars of a Cen
tauri round their centre of gravity, with the object of procuring                                as
many observations as possible from southern observers                                 during    the
periastral passage in 1851-5.
     Professor Henderson and Sir            J.   Herschel,     the only two observers
who had specially           applied themselves to the subject previously to
Captain Jacob, were not able to make any thing of                               it,    with such
materials as had been accumulated up to their time.                             They merely
ventured to predict,           that   a   very    close   affinity    of the two stars
might be expected           about the year 1867       ;   and both seemed to consider
that the period of revolution was something very great, — that the
star was increasing in distance at the time that                     it   was observed           by
Lacaille in 1751,          and byMaskelyne       in 1761   ;   and that       it   had occupied
the intervening time in reaching its maximum distance, without any
sensible     change    of angle of position.
     Sir   J. Herschel,     in concluding his review of the subject, said, " that
no subject        more worthy of continued and diligent                       attention        could
possibly     be   urged on the attention of southern astronomers                      ;"   and this
has since been most eminently borne out by Captain                             Jacob's obser

                                         179
 vations, which, beginning about the time that Sir John left off (1838),
 have been continued        up  to the    present year.      All  the conclusions,
 indeed, ventured on by former authorities have turned out erroneous                  ;
 but the close approximation         to  the  truth    now obtained exhibits far
 more     interesting   features than were ever expected.            At   the epochs
 of Lacaillo and Maskelyne, the distance was on the decrease,
 instead of the increase ; and the stars were seen in almost exactly the
 same relative position by the latter         observer in 1761, as by          Sir J.
 Herschel in 1838        ; and in the interval they      had, instead of merely
 gaining the aphastre without sensible change of angle of position, really
 made a whole revolution, and altered that angle by 360°.                The period
is about 77 years ; the mass three-fourths            of the solar    ; the greatest
distance 22"-5, the least distance 0"-5          ; and the periastre takes place
in 1851-5, when, on account of the excessive excentricity of the orbit,
the change of angle of position will be actually 2° 40' per day.
     That will, therefore, be a most crucial period for testing the theory
by observations of the facts       ; and affords the very best and strongest
instance for it of all the double stars yet discovered            ;  in addition to
which, the accurate determination             of the parallax       of the star by
Professor Henderson gives it         a  crowning importance.
   2. On the      Colouring Matter of the Morinda citrifolia.                   By
            Dr Thomas Anderson.
    The     substance    examined by the author was imported into Glas
gow from Bombay, under the name of sooranjee,                 as a substitute for
madder,      but had been found useless        by the dyers.      No information
could be obtained        regarding its botanical origin in this country, but
the importers having written to their correspondents received a quan
tity of seeds, labelled, Seeds of the Sooranjee plant, Morinda citrifolia.
These seeds did not germinate, but agreed in their characters with
those    of M. citrifolia ; and, for reasons stated at length in the paper,
are considered by Dr Balfour to belong to that plant.
    The colouring matter to which the author applies the name of
morindine, was extracted from the bark of the root by boiling alco
hol,    and purified by successive       crystallizations,  and    finally  by solu
tion   in boiling spirit, acidulated with hydrochloric           acid, which was
found necessary       for the separation of the last traces of ash.          It then
was   in the form of minute acicular crystals of           a  fine yellow colour.

                                     180
 and satiny lustre, sparingly      soluble in water, and in cold alcohol,
but much more      so in boiling dilute spirit, from which it is deposited
on cooling, and insoluble in ether.           It dissolves in alkalies with a
fine red, and in sulphuric       acid with a violet colour, and is decom
posed by heat with the production          of  a crystalline   sublimate.     The
analysis gave the following results      : —
           Carbon,        .      55-46           55-40          55-39
           Hydrogen,      .       5-19             5-03
           Oxygen,        .      39-35           39-57
                               100-00           100-00
    From which the author         deduces    the formula C^ H15       O15,  which
differs from that of sublimed madder purple, the probable formula of
which is   C28 H16 O16,     by  a  single equivalent of water         only.     It
approaches very closely in many chemical characters to the madder
colouring   matters, but differs from them in its relations as a dye.
For the author had found that it       was incapable       of producing colours
with alum    and  iron mordants, but with turkey-red mordant it pro
duces a dark red.
    By the sublimation       of morindine,      the author obtained another
substance,  to which he gives the name of morindone,             in the form of
fine red needles     of considerable length, and which           is insoluble   in
water, both hot and cold, but soluble in alcohol and ether.                It dis
solves also in alkalies with a magnificent purple colour, and          in strong
sulphuric acid, with the      same colour.        The author had been able
to make only an imperfect        analysis of this substance, the results of
which approximated to the formula           C2s  Hio  Oio>  and should this be
confirmed, would differ only from tnadder red by a single equivalent
of water, and be a polymeric of gentianine.
    The author    concluded    by remarking       that morindine formed the
type of a new class of colouring       matters, fixing only on turkey-red
mordant, which would, in all probability,            throw some light on the
obscure subject of the theory of turkey-red dyeing.
3.  An Attempt to improve the present Methods of determin
    ing the Strength and Direction of the Wind at Sea. By
    Professor C. P. Smyth.
    The laxity of the present methods having             been brought, by his
friend Captain    Cockburn,     R.N.,   before the author, with a desire to

                                          181
be furnished     with    some    sort   of anemometer, and with         some easy
means    of eliminating the      effect of the motion of the vessel, he began
to consider    what would be the most              appropriate form of      anemo
meter to be used at sea          ; for several kinds had been already tried,
but had failed, as he thought, from not being constructed on a suit
able   principle.     The    species which      the author considered     the best,
was that which should imitate, as nearly as possible, mutatis mutandis,
the   log-line  by    means     of which the ship's way through          the water
is determined     ;   for that instrument         seems   to have preserved       its
situation and supremacy over all others on board-ship amongst all
nations,    and from the time of Columbus              to the present, mainly on
account     of the appropriateness          of the principle    involved.     After
describing several means           by which     the principle might be imitated
to different    degrees,    the preference was given to          Mr   Edgeworth's
 anemometer, in which a horizontal wheel, armed with hemispheres on
the end    of each spoke, revolves in the same direction,          from whatever
 quarter the wind may blow ; and the centre of each cup moves at
 one-third the velocity of the current, by reason of the greater force
 of the wind on the concave             than on the convex side.       A   series  of
 experiments was entered on to determine the best shape and size to
 give the machine in practice,           and   the result at length      arrived at
 was exhibited    on the table, in the form of an anemometer with four
 horizontally revolving arms, on the ends of which were hemispheres,
 each four inches in diameter, with a radial distance         of six inches.      An
 endless screw on the vertical axis of this revolving           part gave motion
 to a  train of wheels which        served to count the number      of revolutions
 made in a given time.          A    weight of   l*  grains in the centre of one
 of the cups,       was  found sufficient to        overcome the     resistance to
 motion.
    Some experiments were            described   which seemed to shew that the
 instrument    could be fully depended on, and that the strength or
 velocity  of the wind at sea might          now be always entered in the log
 book, as being      of so many knots per hour, instead          of in the usual
 unmeaning manner         ; and as the vanes actually used in ships give the
 direction of the wind with sufficient accuracy, all the elements neces
 sary for eliminating       the   effect   of the motion of    the   ships, or for
 deducing    the true wind from the apparent one, may be assumed as
 being attainable, but the description of the practical method proposed
 for adoption was deferred for the next Meeting.

                                         182
    The author next       described    the problem     of determining     the true
 wind from the observed        motion of the vessel and the apparent wind,
as being merely a special instance of the general                theorem of the
 parallelogram      of forces, the course    of the ship being     one side ; the
 apparent wind, the diagonal       ;  and the true wind, another side          ;  so
 that the case might always be reduced           to  the calculation, according
 to the usual    rules for plane triangles,     of the third side and one of
the angles of a triangle, from the two other sides of their included
angle, excepting in the simpler conditions of going exactly with or
against the wind.
    But as the calculations in this way, though            easy enough,    threat
ened to be uselessly and overpoweringly burdensome, considering the
enormous number of cases which would have to be computed in any
voyage, the small        degree  of accuracy required, and the          untoward

   1. On    the Action of the Dry Gases on Organic Colouring
           Matters, and its relation to the Theory of Bleaching.
           By Dr George Wilson.
      This communication is divided into six sections.            In  the first, the
   author states that the object of his paper is to supply a defect in the

                                      184
theory of chlorine-bleaching,       by endeavouring         to explain   why the
removal of water from that gas arrests its bleaching action.               In  the
preliminary   discussion, he refers at some length to Davy's              theory,
that moist chlorine does not bleach directly, but only in a secondary
way, by combining with the hydrogen of the associated                 water, and
liberating the oxygen, which is the true bleacher.               After pointing
out the untenable       assumptions    and self-destructive       arguments on
which this theory is built, the author proceeds           in the second section,
which discusses     the influence of sunlight        on   the bleaching     action
of dry chlorine, to shew, that Davy's          proposition    that dry chlorine
does not bleach dry organic colours is true,           provided direct sunlight
be excluded,    but does not apply to the gas when exposed to the
actinic influence of the sunbeam.        In a comparative trial, one speci
men    of dry litmus paper      was found to resist the decolorizing        action
of dry chlorine for more than eight months when kept in darkness                   ;
whilst the colour of another portion of the same paper totally disap
peared after six weeks'     exposure to sunshine.         Another comparative
experiment     was   not so successful    as    regarded rapidity of actinic
bleaching   ; but both sets of trials       led the     author   to infer,    that
darkness as well as dryness is essential to the negative action of
chlorine on colours.
   The third    section   is occupied   with     the record of experiments,
instituted with a view to determine whether the presence of water is
as essential to the bleaching action of oxygen, sulphurous acid, and
sulphuretted hydrogen, as it is to that of chlorine.            The general    re
sult of the trials made was, that the gases mentioned may be retained,
when dry, for months over dry litmus, without decolorizing it ; and
that they are, therefore, at least as much dependent as chlorine                on
water for their power of bleaching.
   The fourth     section   investigates, in like manner,         the extent to
which the acid gases and ammonia have their power to change or
ganic colouring matters, influenced by the absence of water from the
gas and the colour.       The author finds that the modifying action of
carbonic, sulphurous, and hydrosulphuric            acids on colours, is totally
arrested by the abstraction of water      ;   and that that of hydrochloric
acid and ammonia is long delayed.              He infers, from the results
detailed in sections third and fourth, that there is nothing exceptional
or anomalous in the non-bleaching action of dry chlorine, and that
it is only  a particular   case of a general       law, applying     to all  gases

                                        185
 which affect colours, and teaching that elastic fluids, when anhydrous,
lose in whole, or in part, the power to destroy or change the tints
 of organic bodies, which they possess when associated with water.
      Section fifth reviews the methods employed for drying gases, and
 the tests     of gaseous dryness.      It  enters at length into the question,
 how far it is possible to confer absolute dryness on an elastic fluid,
 and suggests some modifications of the processes at present in use,
 which the author          thinks   will prove serviceable.       Non-action   on
 colouring matter is likewise pointed out as a negative test of dryness
 of some value, in relation to the gases which act on colours.
       Section sixth is devoted to the question, Does water accelerate the
  action of gases on colours, in virtue simply of its conferring mediate
  liquidity on the gas ? The author thinks not, and refers to the slow
  action which he has observed of liquid anhydrous bromine and sul
  phurous acid on blue litmus, as contrasted with their rapid produc
  tion of destruction or modification of colour when dissolved in water,
   as   shewing that the liquefaction of the gas is not the only cause of
   its rapid action when moist.          He   contends   that this is only to be
   fully accounted for by taking into consideration the power of water
   to liquefy both the colouring        matter and the gas, and thus to bring
   them     into a closeness     of physical    contact in the highest degree
   favourable to energetic chemical action.             The author was led, in
    connection with this view, to infer that dry gases would act on dry
    colours in other liquids besides water, provided only these could
    dissolve   both the gas and the colouring matter.          He finds, however,
    that this cannot be laid down         as a  general   proposition, at least  so
    far as chlorine      is concerned, the only      gas   on which ho has had
    opportunity to make researches in reference to this point.         The volatile
    oils of the type     of spirit of turpentine (C 5,      H 4) and chloroform,
     which contain no oxygen, and sulphuret            of carbon, which contains
     neither of the elements of water, dissolve the colouring principle of
     alkanet root, and also chlorine, but the gas does not destroy the
     colour.     Solutions of dry litmus, on the other hand, in chloroform
     and sulphuret     of carbon, are instantly bleached by dry chlorine.
         The author's final conclusion is, that the function of water in
     bleaching, speaking generally, is to dissolve the colour and the gas,
     and so to bring them within the sphere of chemical affinity ; and
     that water is more efficacious        in accelerating bleaching than other
      liquids, simply because     it excels most of them in solvent power.

2. On the      Products of the Destructive Distillation of Animal
        Substances, Part I.          By Dr Thomas Anderson.
    In  this communication the author details the getieral properties
of bone-oil, the substance       employed in his experiments, and those
of certain of the volatile bases contained in it.
     The oil    was   first rectified,   and    the product      collected in two
separate portions, each of which was separately agitated with dilute
sulphuric acid for the separation of the bases.              The acid solution     so
obtained    was then boiled     down to     a   small  bulk for the purpose of
separating any non-basic oil which might              have    been dissolved,    and
distilled with potash, soda, or slaked          lime.    The    bases passed over
in solution    in water, from which        they were separated        by means      of
solid caustic potass      ; similar    processes     were performed with both
portions of the bone-oil. but in the present paper the author con
fines  himself to the pure volatile portion only.
    The oil separated by this process from the             more volatile     portion
was found to be a mixture          of at least four or five different          bases,
which were separated from each other by fractionated distillation.
    The   most volatile of these,     which boils at about 175° Fahr., was
present in extremely minute quantity only.                For it the author      pro
poses the name      of petinine (from wrung, volatile.)            It  is a transpa
rent colourless fluid, highly soluble in water, alcohol, and ether.              The
smell is pungent, and resembles         that of ammonia, but is accompanied
by the odour     of decaying   apples.      It  gives, with chloride of gold, a
pale-yellow precipitate, and with bichloride of platinum and corrosive
sublimate, beautiful crystallisable        salts, the former resembling iodide
of lead, the latter in pearly plates.         The analysis of petinine      gave re
sults corresponding with the formula            C8 H10  N, which     was confirmed
by the constitution      of the platinine      salt, the formula      of which was
found to be C8 H10       N, H CI, Pt.     Cl2.     The author details,      as far as
the minute quantity at his disposal would allow, the properties of the
salts of this base.
    He then    takes up the consideration         of that portion of the mixed
basis, which distilled between       270° and 280°, which, after successive
rectifications, was found to give the formula            C12  H7
                                                                  N, and to agree
in all its properties with the base formerly obtained by the author
from coal-tar,     and described under the name            of picoline.      Aniline

                                         187
was also found present in that portion of the mixed tars which dis
tilled above 355°, and was distinguished by its reaction with chloride
of lime.
     The author also mentions the existence of several other bases, the
constitution and properties of which will be described in the second
part of his researches.
3.    Note respecting the Refractive and Dispersive Power of
          Chloroform.         By Professor Forbes.
     From an experiment made            in very cloudy weather, and therefore
rather unfavourable light,          I determined the following indices of re
 fraction for pure chloroform, prepared by          Dr George Wilson, of sp. gr.
                                  ....
     The    measure    of the refracting angle of         the prism was    39° 41'.
 References      were made     to the principal      lines of the    spectrum,   as
                                  ....
 below, the temperature of the fluid was probably 54°.
           Extreme red,           .          .        .        p =  1-4475
           B (in the red),                                          1-4488
                                 ....
           D (in   the orange-yellow),       .                      1-451
           6 (in the green),                                        1-456
           F (in the blue),                                         1-457
           H (in   the violet, being the least refrangible     of
              the two groups so designated),                        1-463
           Extreme violet,                                          1-4675
      Hence     the refractive   index     is by no means remarkably         great,
 being    nearly that of wax, spermaceti, and             several of the essential
  oils.
      The dispersive power, or         SP-   is equal to -045, which again agrees
                                      p—   1
  nearly with that of the essential oils.            The high specific gravity of
  the body appears to have no          marked influence in increasing its action
  on light.

I, Geological Notes on the Valleys of the Rhine and Rhone.
    By Robert Chambers, F.R.S.E.
   The principal            part of this paper was devoted to a description of
alluvial    terraces, as seen along the banks of the Rhine at Bonn,
Mainz, and Basle, and in the valley of the Arve, the well-known                           tri
butary of the Rhone.               These terraces, which rise high above                  the
reach    of the present river, yet slope in the same direction.                      The in
termediate    hollow or trough in which the river runs, has evidently been
cut out    of what was at first an entire sloping sheet of detrital matter,
filling the valley from side to side up              to a certain      height.       At   the
lower part of the          Arve valley, the detrital matter     has been discharged
across the        valley of the Rhone,      so as   to form a barrier for the Lake
of Geneva.
   At Vevay,            on this lake, there is a short side valley,           containing
tiers   of sloping terraces, which have             been   called ancient moraines,
 but are set          down in this paper as deltas or river alluvia, marking the
 stages of the subsidence          of   a recipient body   of water.        The chief of
 these terraces          are respectively about 165 and 442                feet above the
 present    level of the lake.
   To illustrate the formation of these terraces and deltas, reference
 was made         to the recently-drained     Lake of Lungern, in Unterwalden
 The inpour            of mountain-streamlets       into such lakes is over a slop

the edge of the lake, and passing on in the same direction, below the
lake, till, owing to the check of the water, it comes to an abrupt ter
mination,    and  stoops   suddenly down.     In  the case of the Lake of
Lungern,    on the water being withdrawn,      the stream, no longer re
ceived   into a body of still water, has begun to cut down its delta, as
 the  Niagara River cuts through the strata on which it runs, until a
deep channel is formed all the way back to the mountains, the re
moved matter being,       of course, carried forward into the     receded wa
ters of the lake.      This the author of the paper regarded as an ex
planation of the formation of alluvia in valleys, and their subsequent
intersection.     The detritus was received into a body of water occu
 pying the valley   ;  on that being withdrawn, the    river  was allowed to
 cut down and form a channel for itself in the alluvial sheet.        A  num
 ber of reasons were adduced for believing that, in general cases, this
 recipient body of water was the sea.
     A  description   was given   of an ancient lake-bed in the vale of
 Chamouni, the barrier of which was the right side moraine of the
 anciently more extended Glacier des Bois or Mer de Glace.               Some
 notices  were appended regarding      smoothings of fixed surfaces and
 zones of erratic blocks in Switzerland,     and an endeavour       was  made
 to establish the probability   of icebergs borne on the sea having been
 concerned in producing some of those phenomena.             It  was particu
 larly remarked that the     zone of blocks at Monthey was      just about the
 same height above the present level of the sea (1670 feet) as the
 uppermost of the terraces at Vevay ; while M. Saussure had found
 traces of running water on Mont Saleve, at the height of the cele
  brated erratics above Neufchatel.
     These facts were not presented in opposition to the doctrine         of a
  former greater extent for the glaciers,    which   was, on the contrary,
  admitted, though not to the extent demanded by some previous ob
  servers.   Different agencies, or the   same agencies differently applied,
  might, the author thought, often lead to nearly similar effects.

       The Very Rev. Principal LEE, D.D., in the Chair.
   The following communications               were read     : —
1.  Description of a Mud-slide at Malta.                      By A. Milward,
     Esq. Communicated by the Secretary.
   A  large quantity of mud, dredged up from the harbour of Valetta,
having been deposited on a piece of slightly-inclined               ground,   and
having been subsequently moistened to an excessive extent by rain,
and by the overflow       of  a neighbouring    tank, the upper parts began
to flow down over the lower and the original boundary, in six distinct
streams    ;  this separation being apparently caused          by the difference
of resistance and level of the under stratum.
   These      streams exhibited, to     a remarkable    degree,   all the pheno
mena     of glaciers,    and thus tended greatly       to confirm the theory
which looks upon them not as a solid, or a collection of solid masses,
but as a viscous fluid.      Curved bands of dark and light mud were seen
crossing    the streams similarly with Professor Forbes's          "dirt-bands"
on the glaciers ;       and the crevasses     had their counterparts       in the
cracks in the mud.
2.  An Attempt to explain the "Dirt-Bands of Glaciers."                        By
     A. Milward, Esq.
    A   second mud-slide having occurred at        Malta, with more marked
 features than the first,    Mr Milward     was enabled to ascertain that the
 curved bands of dark and         light mud  are not only accompanied by a

                                        196
difference of elevation in those parts, but that these wrinkles are the
cause of that difference of colour ; the more watery parts              draining
from the ridge, leave that rough, and form a smooth alluvium in the
hollow.
    Applying      these facts   to the glaciers,   Mr Milward      supposes that
the dirt-bands, i.e. the bands of alternate compact             and porous ice,
must be accompanied          by   a  similar difference of elevation, which,
though destroyed by the action of the sun on the lower parts, may
yet be visible near the origin         of the glaciers in the early spring       ;
and he further supposes that the bands may be formed, in the first
instance, by the irregular descent of the neve in winter and summer,
so   that they become in fact the annual rings of the glacier, shewing
 its age and rate     of increase.
 3.   On the rate of Progression of the Himalayan Glaciers.
      By Lieutenant R. Strachey, Bengal Engineers.
     Mr   Strachey 's letter contained some interesting observations which
 he has been making on the motions            of the glaciers in the Himalayan
 mountains     ;  and his measures,      conducted on the plan of Professor
 Forbes in the Alps, are the earliest that have been taken in Asia.
 The Pinduree        glacier, on which the observations were made during
 cold weather, was found to move 3 feet          1 inch in 5 days at the centre,
 and at the sides about       1  foot 5 inches.
     Lieutenant     Strachey's former      Researches on the Glaciers      of the
 Kumaon Himalaya (published in              one  of the Indian Journals), have
 satisfactorily proved the existence of glaciers in lat. 30° 20', which
  present in detail all the phenomena         of those of Europe.
  4. Observations        on the preceding Communications,              and espe
      cially on the cause of the Annual Rings of Glaciers.                     By
      Professor Forbes.
      Professor    Forbes   stated   that  Mr Milward's shrewd suspicion of
  the bands of ice of different consistence          being accompanied    also by
  wrinkles or elevations, had been discovered by himself some years
  before, at the very place and time pointed out as most likely ; and
  he shewed that, while there is a tendency          in a tenacious viscous fluid

greatly increased when the supply of the fluid is by fits, as it is in fact
at the head of this glacier, where the quasi-hydrostatic         pressure from
behind, combined with the frontal resistance, produces a thickening,
or convex    lip or wrinkle.
   He likewise mentioned the analogous instance of the production
of equidistant wrinkles in the sides of railway banks, from mere
pressure above;     and more particularly    in turnings of coarse mallea
ble iron, where, though the detruding force is constantly           equal, still
detrusion takes place at intervals, forming         in the shaving so many
wrinkles, by which frontal resistance too, it is thickened, and conse
quently shortened, similarly with the mechanism of the glacier.

Lassel, specially pointing out those parts in the progress of
construction, in which these two eminent mechanists and opti
cians differed, and sometimes widely, from each other; though
they have both arrived equally, at last, at the same goal of
all but perfection.

1. An Account of Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of
    Heat,* with Numerical Results deduced from Regnault's
    Experiments on Steam. \ By Professor -William Thomson,
    of Glasgow.
    The questions to be resolved by a complete theory of the motive
power of heat, are the following : —
    I. What is the precise nature of the thermal agency by                means of
which mechanical effect is to be produced, without effects of any other
kind ?
    II.   How may the amount of this thermal agency necessary for
performing a given quantity of work be estimated ?
    I.  On the nature of Thermal Agency, considered                   as a  Motive
Power.
    The whole theory rests on          a principle   generally admitted as an
axiom, which Carnot expresses          in the following terms      :| —
    " In our demonstration,       we tacitly assume       that after a body has
experienced a certain         number of transformations,         if it  be brought
identically to its primitive physical state as to density, temperature,
and molecular constitution, it must contain the same quantity of heat
as that which      it initially possessed ; or, in other words, we suppose
that the quantities of heat lost by the body under one set of opera
tions, are precisely compensated by those which are absorbed in the
others.       This fact has never    been doubted ;      it has at  first been ad-
   *   Published in 1824, in a work entitled, " Reflexions sur la Puissance Mo-
trice du Feu," by Mons. S. Carnot. An account of Carnot's theory is also pub
lished in the Journal de I'JScoU    Potytechnique,  vol. xiv., 1834, in a paper by
Mons. Clapeyron.
   t An account of the first part of a series of researches undertaken by Mons.
 Regnault, by order of the late French Government, for ascertaining the various
physical data of importance in the theory of the steam-engine, has been recently
published in the Memoires de PInetitut, of which it constitutes the twenty-first
 volume (1847).     The second part of the researches has not yet been published.

 not's Treatise.

mitted without reflection, and afterwards verified in many cases by
calorimetrical experiments. To deny it would be to overturn the
whole theory of heat, of which it is a fundamental principle.   It
must be admitted, however, that the chief foundations on which the
theory of heat rests             would require a most                attentive examination.
Several experimental              facts       appear nearly inexplicable               in the actual
state       of this theory."
   Since the time when Carnot thus expressed himself, the necessity
of a most careful examination of the entire experimental basis of the
theory of heat has become more and more urgent.                                        Especially      all
those assumptions depending on the idea that heat is a substance                                       in
variable in quantity, not convertible into any other element, and in
capableof being generated by any physical agency                                ;    in fact, the ac
knowledged principles of latent heat, would require                              to be tested by a
most searching investigation before they ought to be admitted, as they
usually are, by almost every one who has worked on the subject,
whether in combining                   the results of experimental                  researches       or in
reasoning a          priori.
   The extremely important discoveries recently                             made by        Mr Joule,
of Manchester,          that heat is evolved              in every part of a closed electric
conductor, moving in the neighbourhood of a magnet ;* and that heat
  *     I   cannot omit this opportunity of correcting an expression which                       I   made
use   of in    a note published    in    the Philosophical       Magazine (vol. xxxiii., p. 315),
in alluding  to the generation of heat by such operations, which I inadvert
                                         " known experiments, adduced by Mr
ently asserted to have been proved by
Joule." It is true that the evolution of heat in a fixed conductor, through
which a galvanic current is sent from any source whatever, has long been
known to the scientific world             ;   but   it   was pointed out by         Mr Joule that we
cannot infer, from any previously published experimental researches,                         the actual
generation        of heat when   the    current originates in electro-magnetic              induction,
since the question occurs,         Is   the heat which is evolved    in   one   part of the closed con
ductor merely transferred from those parts which are subject to the inducing influence ?
Mr Joule, after a most careful experimental investigation, with reference to
this question, finds that it must be answered in the negative. (See a paper
" On the Calorific Effects of Magneto-Electricity, and on the Mechanical Value
of Heat; by J. P. Joule, Esq.      read before the British Association at Cork,
                                          ;':
in 1843,       subsequently communicated by the author to the Philosophical
               and
Magazine, vol.  xxiii., pp. 263, 347, 435.)
  Before we can finally conclude that heat  absolutely generated in such ope
                                                            is
rations, would be necessary to prove that the inducing magnet does not become
             it
lower in temperature, and thus give compensation for the heat evolved in the

 is generated by the         friction of fluids in motion      seem to overturn the
 opinion commonly held that heat cannot be generated, but only pro
 duced    from a source         where it has previously existed, either in a
 sensible or in a latent condition.             In   the present state of science,
 however, no operation is known by which heat can be absorbed                      into
 a body, without either elevating its temperature or becoming latent,
 and producing        some      alteration   in its physical condition      ; and the
 fundamental axiom adopted by Carnot may be considered as still the
 most probable basis for an investigation             of the motive power of heat ;
 although this, and with it every other branch of the theory of heat,
 may ultimately require to be reconstructed on another foundation,
 when our experimental data are more complete.                  On this understand
 ing the author of the present paper refers to Carnot's                  fundamental
 principle, as if its truth were thoroughly established.
     If we consider any case in which          mechanical effect is obtained from
 a thermal origin, by means of the alternate expansions and contrac
 tions of any substance          whatever, and follow a perfectly rigorous pro
cess    of reasoning indicated by Carnot, we arrive at the following
conclusion, by which the first proposed question is answered : —
     The thermal agency by which mechanical effect may be obtained, is
 the transference of heat from one body to another at a lower tem
perature.
     II.  On the measurement of Thermal Agency, considered with re
ference    to its equivalent       of mechanical    effect.
     The criterion of what may             be called a perfect      thermo-dynamic
 engine is thus stated        :—
     A perfect     thermo-dynamic        engine is such, that, whatever amount
 of mechanical       effect   it can derive from a given thermal agency, if
 an equal amount         be  spent in working it backwaxds, an equal reverse
thermal     effect  will  be  produced.
     Any two perfect engines, however different in their constructions,
conductor.      I am not aware that any examination,       with reference  to the truth
of  this conjecture, has been instituted ; but    in  the case when the inducing body
is a pure electro-magnet (without any iron) the experiments actually performed
by Mr Joule render the conclusion probable, that the heat evolved in the wire
of the electro-magnet is not affected by the inductive action otherwise than
through the reflected influence, which diminishes the strength of its own cur
rent.

                                        201
or in the physical media employed, must derive the same              equivalent
of mechanical effect from a given thermal agency.              Carnot describes
a steam-engine and an air-engine, each of which satisfies the criterion
laid down above (the construction being however in each case, prac
tically impossible); and he shews how, with certain physical data,
with reference to steam in one case, and with reference to air or any
gas in the other, the equivalent of mechanical effect, derivable from
 a  given thermal agency, may be calculated.            Thus,  if M  denote the
 amount of mechanical effect due to the descent of           H units of heat (or
 caloric) from a body A         at the temperature S, through the medium
 of a perfect engine of any kind, to a body           B  at the temperature   T,
 we find, by Carnot's method of reasoning,
                               dp
     M =
             h/? {l-*)^dt=EPov0J^                         f^l^dtdq
 In the first expression,     deduced     by the theory of the steam-engine,
 p   denotes the pressure, e the density, and k the latent heat        of a unit
 of volume of saturated vapour from any liquid, at the temperature
 f.    In  the second, deduced by the theory of the air-engine,       E denotes
 the coefficient of expansion (-00366,           if the centigrade scale of the
 air-thermometer        be adopted)    of  a gas  ; p0 the pressure of a given
 mass    of  gas when reduced to the freezing point        of temperature, and
 to the volume v0 ; p the pressure of the same gaseous mass when
 occupying the volume v, at the temperature * ; q the quantity of
 heat which must be added to the same mass to raise its temperature
 from 0 to      *, when its volume is at the same time changed from           v0
  to v ; and   d   q the heat absorbed by the gas when, with its tempera
  ture kept at i, its volume is augmented from v to v + dv.
      Hence the mechanical effect to be obtained by the letting down
  of a unit of heat from a hody       A,   to a body B at a lower temperature
  *,  if the interval   between   their temperatures be an extremely small
  quantity r, will be, according to the first expression        :
                                           dp
                                 (l-<0Tr,
  and, according to the latter,
                              H 7o           v d1

                                        202
If H    be taken infinitely    small, the latter expression becomes
Hence,     if   denote the mechanical effect due to the descent          of  one
unit of heat from      A   at the temperature     t+   r to B at the tempera
ture   *, we  have

The value of p (" Carnot's coefficient"), which is independent of the
nature of the liquid or gas employed, may be determined for an as
signed temperature, by means of observations upon any gas, or any
liquid and its vapour.          The most complete series of experiments
from which the values of       p at different temperatures may      be deduced,
are those by means of which            Regnault   has   determined the latent
heat of   a given weight, and the pressure,        of saturated steam, at all
temperatures between         0° and 230°.      Besides these    data, however,
the density of saturated vapour must be given, in order that k, the
latent heat of a unit of volume, may be calculated from Regnault's
determination     of the latent heat of      a given weight.      Between the
limits of 0°and 100°, it is probable, from various experiments which
have been made, that the density of vapour follows very closely the
simple laws which are so accurately verified by the ordinary gases ;*
and thus it may be calculated from Regnault's table, giving the pres
sure at any temperature within those            limits.     Nothing   as yet   is
known with accuracy as to the density of saturated steam                between
 100° and 230°, and we must be contented at present to estimate it
by calculation from Regnault's          table of pressures   ; although, when
accurate experimental researches         on the subject shall have been made,
considerable deviations from the laws of Boyle             and Dalton may be
found.
    Such are the experimental         data on which the calculation of the
mean values of p, for the successive degrees of the air-thermometer
from 0° to 230°, at present laid before the Royal Society, is founded.
   * This is well established
                                 by experiment, within the ordinary atmospheric
limits, in Regnault's Etudet Metiorologiquw, in the Annates de Chimie.

the pressures given                     by Regnault           at the temperatures              immediately

      As an example of the usefulness of these tables, let be required                     it
to    find the amount of mechanical effect produced        steam-engine               by   a
 working with perfect economy, for each unit of heat which, after en

                                       204
tering the water of the boiler, is let down through the engine to the
condenser, and there evolved.          The   " thermal    agency"     here is a
unit of heat let down from         a body at the temperature       of the water
in the boiler to another at the temperature of condensation, and the
" mechanical effect," therefore, cannot be determined, unless those
temperatures be given.           Let  us suppose    then, in  a  particular  en
gine, that the water of the boiler is at 120°, and the condenser               at
40°, during the working         of the engine.    The required mechanical
effect,  calculated by adding the " sums" in the preceding table for
all the intervals from 40°       to 120° is found to be 328-6 foot-pounds.
2.   Theoretical Considerations on the Effect of Pressure in
    lowering the Freezing-Point of Water.                 By James Thom
    son, Esq., jun., Glasgow. Communicated by Professor W.
    Thomson.
    At  the commencement of this paper the two following propositions
are laid down     :
    I. That    water at the freezing-point     may be converted into ice by
a process    solely mechanical, and yet without the final expenditure of
any mechanical work.
    II.  That the freezing-point      of water must become         lower as the
pressure to which the water is subjected is increased.
    The first of    these  is given   as being interesting     in itself, and as
having    been    the original    means   of suggesting the      second   to the
author.     It  may be deduced directly by the application to the freez
ing of water of the principle developed by Carnot, that no work is
given out when heat passes from one body to another without a fall
of temperature      ; or rather by the application of the converse of this,
which, of course, equally holds good,      — namely,    that no work requires
to be expended to make heat pass          from one body to another at the
same temperature.         The first being established, the       reasonableness
of the second     will readily   be admitted ; because the ordinary suppo
sition of the freezing-point        being constant, would involve the ab
surdity of a perpetual       motion (or, more strictly, a perpetual       source
of mechanical work) being possible.          For if  a quantity of water were
enclosed   in a vessel with a moveable piston and          frozen without    the
expenditure of work, the motion of the piston consequent             on the ex
pansion being resisted by pressure, mechanical work would be given
out ; and there would be no expenditure of any thing whatever to
serve as an equivalent       for this mechanical work given out, because

                                      205
the  water, after having been frozen, might        be again melted, and so
reduced to its   original state, without the expenditure of work, accord
ing to   the principles of Garnot already referred to.           By the con
tinued repetition, with the same mass of water, of the processes thus
indicated, an unlimited quantity of work might be developed out of
nothing, which is impossible. It, therefore, appears that if the water
be made    to perform work while freezing, either work or some equi
valent agency must have been expended           in freezing it.     Now, the
only way    of accounting for this expenditure      is by the assumption of
the second proposition.
    The fact of the lowering of the freezing-point         by pressure being
demonstrated by the method of which an outline has just been given,
it becomes desirable, in the next place, to find what is the freezing-
point  of water for any given pressure.          The     most obvious  way to
determine this would be by direct experiment with freezing water.
This experiment has, however, not as yet been made ; and it would
be difficult to make it with the precision which would be desirable,
since  the variation to be appreciated is extremely small         ; so small,
indeed, as to afford sufficient reason for its existence        never having
been observed by any experimenter.            The exact amount of the     va
riation may, however, be deduced          in a different way from experi
mental data, of which we are already in possession.           These data are
(1.), The known expansion of water in freezing         ; and (2.), The quan
tity of work given out by a unit of heat in descending through a de
gree near the freezing-point,     which has been deduced from the experi
ments   of Regnault on steam, and has been already laid before            the
Royal Society, in a paper by Professor William Thomson.               The de
sired result is expressed    in the formula,
                                 « = -0072 P,
in which   P  is the pressure above     the first atmosphere, expressed    in
atmospheres as units, to which the water is subjected, and t the low
ering of the freezing-point,    expressed   in degrees centigrade, produced
by the addition    of that pressure.     This formula may      be applied for
any pressure from nothing up to many atmospheres.

>.  On the      Early History of the Air-Pomp in England.                             By
      Dr George Wflaon.
   The early history of the English air-pump has                     been    latterly al
lowed to fall into great confusion, so that the steps                by which the in

                                               208
strument was improved,             the periods at which those improvements
were made, and the parties by whom they were effected, are all more
or less confounded with each other, or mis-stated.
    It   is   in connection with the double-barrelled               air-pump,     that the
accepted        history of the instrument is chiefly erroneous, but the mis
takes made in reference to the more complex engine, have ultimately
involved in confusion even the authentic records of the steps by which
the earlier single-barrelled           air-pump was improved, so that the ac
count of its successive        alterations       must commence with its earliest
and simplest construction.
    The history of the English air-pump may                        be divided    into    four
stages,       three of which belong to the seventeeth century,                     and the
fourth to the eighteenth.              They    are as follow, the dates,        as given in
the original authorities, being according to the Old Style                      :—
    1659.         The construction of      a Pneumatical           Engine consisting of
a   single-barrelled      pump     with    a solid     piston, moved by a rack and
pinion, and        a globular glass receiver directly communicating               with the
cylinder, which had an aperture closed and opened by a plug moved
by the hand, and playing the part of a valve.
    1667.         The separation of the glass receiver from the cylinder,
and introduction of the air-pump plate, on which    bell-jars could be
placed and used as receivers.        The pump, still single-barrelled,
and wrought by a rack and pinion, but with an aperture in the
piston instead of in the cylinder, furnished with a moveable stopper.
    1676.          The introduction       of   a double-barrelled       air-pump,        with
self-acting valves in the cylinders and pistons, and with piston-rods
suspended at opposite ends of a cord passing over a pulley.
     1704.         The combination of the rack and pinion of the first and
second        air-pumps, with the two barrels, twin pistons, and self-acting
valves of the third.          The following          are the more      important      details
concerning those instruments.
     Sometime before 1658,Boyle having heard, as he informs us
(Birch's Boyle, Ed. 1772, vol.  p. 6), of Guericke's air-pump and
                                           i.,
pneumatic experiments, had an exhausting engine of some kind con
structed for him         by Gratorix,      a   London instrument-maker                  of the
time.          No drawing or description of Gratorix's air-pump                  is   extant,
but   it      was so ineffective   a   machine that     it   was    set aside    as useless
almost as soon as finished.               Boyle had then recourse to Robert

                                                  209
Hooke, who constructed for him the air-pump which he employed in
his 6rst series of pneumatic                 researches.         It    appears to have            been
commenced in 1658, and completed in 1659, according to the sepa
rate testimony of Boyle (New Experiments, &c, touching the Spring
and Weight of the Air, written in 1659, published in 1660, Birch's
               i.,
Boyle, vol.          p. 7), and Hooke (Waller's                Life    of   Hooke,     p.   iii.). The
first English air-pump,              which may be dated from 1659, had                       a   single
brass     barrel about 14 inches in length,                and    3     in internal         diameter.
It   stood upon      a   strong wooden tripod, with its mouth turned down
wards.       The piston         or sucker was solid.             The shank or piston-rod
had teeth cut on          it,   so as to form      a   rack, and was moved by               a   toothed
wheel     or pinion working into the rack,                 and    turned by          a   handle, as
in   the air-pumps        of the present day.              A   holo was bored in the side
of the upper end of the cylinder, provided with                          a   ground brass plug
or stopper, which          could be drawn out or pushed in by the hand.
This      was the only valve          in the engine.           The object of the inversion
of the cylinder, was to allow the globular                       or pear-shaped glass re
ceiver, from which         it    emptied the air, to be placed in                  a   vertical posi
tion above the pump.
     The receiver had           a   large opening at the top for inserting                      objects
into it.      The opening could              be narrowed          by a  tight-fitting broad
brass     ring, in the centre of which was an                   aperture provided with               a
brass     stopper to close it.  The receiver terminated                        below        in a nar
row neck cemented           into     a    brass stop-cock, which             was     ground to fit
an opening in the upper end                 of   the cylinder,        near to the valve in it.
     In   using the pump to exhaust, the piston was first made to ascend
or driven home, whilst the valve in the cylinder                            was    open,     and the
stop-cock of the receiver shut.                   The valve           was    then closed         by its
stopper or plug, the stop-cock opened,                     and    the piston drawn down.
The stop-cock        was then closed a second time, the valve opened,                              and
the rarefied    air which           had    entered the cylinder             from the receiver,
expelled from the former by the second                         ascent       of the piston, and
so on     ad infinitum.
     By reversing the order in which the valve                           and      stop-cock were
closed and opened,         the pump could be made                     to condense        instead of
rarefying the air of the receiver.                     The valve for that purpose                  was
opened,     whilst the stop-cock was shut, and the piston drawn down so
as to allow the cylinder             to be filled with atmospheric air.                  The     valve

                                             210
was  then shut, the stop-cock opened, and the piston as it ascended
condensed the air into the receiver.
   The      most important points to be noticed                about the earliest Eng
lish   air-pump,      are, that it was provided                 with    one      barrel     and a
manual valve, and that, unlike any later air-pump, the cylinder and
receiver were directly connected. The designation by which Boyle
preferred to distinguish his machine, was                  " Pneumatical
                                                                        Engine," and

              it,
              in      contradistinction        to
Pneumatical       Engine."         It     was presented       to the   Royal Society im
mediately after its incorporation              in 1662, and Boyle                desisted    from
pneumatic researches            for some six or seven years.
   In   1667 he constructed his second pneumatical engine, as appears
from    a   letter dated, 24th March of that year, and published at Oxford
in 1669, with the title,           " A Continuation of New                                    &c.,
                                                           Experiments,
&c., touching the Spring and Weight of the                      Air,    in   a   letter to Lord
Dungarvan."   Several persons supplied him with suggestions in the
way of improvements, of whom, however, he mentions the name only
of Hooke.
   The      second pneumatical engine did not resemble the first                            in ap
pearance,     but, like   it,   had   a   single brass barrel.          This      stood with its
mouth upwards, in         a   large wooden box or trough,                   filled with water,
which rose above the mouth of the cylinder,                      so that        the latter was
entirely under water.             The object of this arrangement                  was     to keep
the leather of the sucker or piston always wet, and therefore                             " turgid
and plump," so as to move air-tight in the barrel.                           The latter had
no valve in     it.    The piston which             was    moved by     a    rack and pinion
had an aperture passing vertically through                     it,   which was closed         and
opened       alternately, by thrusting          in     and    pulling out    long stick
                                                                                 a
managed       by the hand of tlie operator.                  But the great improvement
and peculiarity       in the    engine      was, that the receiver was not directly
attached to the        pump.          A   tube, provided with          a    stop-cock, passed
from the upper part of the side of the cylinder,                       in   a    horizontal    di
rection along     a   wooden board           covered               iron plate, and
                                                          with a thick
was then bent up so as barely to                project through the iron.  The re
ceiver was no longer          a   globe or pear-shaped vessel, but               a   bell-shaped
hollow glass jar, which was turned                   with its mouth downwards, like
an inverted     drinking-glass, and,          to use      Boyle's homely but expressive
phrase,
        " whelmed         on upon the plate,               well covered         with cement."
This arrangement of        an air-pump plate, and detached                   bell-jar receiver,

piston, with the aperture in it open, was forced to the bottom of the
cylinder.            The stick      was    then thrust into the hole in the piston,
and the latter drawn up.                   It    ascended      lifting the water with        it,   and

mouth of the tube communicating with the receiver, the stop-cock was
opened, and the air of the receiver allowed to expand into the cylin
der.   The stop-cock was then shut, the stick pulled out of the aper
ture in the piston, and the latter forced to the bottom of the cylinder.
The air bubbled up through the aperture, and when          had escaped,          it
the stick was inserted into the hole in the piston,                            and the manipu
lations proceeded as before.                    If
                             the stop-cock were opened, as    was                            it
liable to be, at the wrong stroke, the receiver, instead of being
emptied of air, was filled with water.
      Six or        seven years again elapsed,             without any further improvement
being effected            on the     English air-pump.                 In 1676, the celebrated
and ingenious Frenchman,                    Denis Papin, came to England, bringing
with him a novel pneumatic engine, and became Boyle's assistant.
An engraving and description of Papin's air-pump are given in
Boyle's tract entitled
                      " A Continuation of New Experiments, &c.,
touching the Spring and Weight of the Air, and their effects. Second
Part." — (Birch's Boyle,    2d Ed., vol. iv., p. 505.) The great pecu
liarity of Papin's air-pump, as contrasted with former air-pumps, was,
that       it   had two barrels, but             it   had     other distinctive arrangements,
which makes              it   singular that     it   should have been overlooked by later
writers on Pneumatics.
      It   had two pumps standing side by side, the mouths of the barrels
being turned upwards.                 Each of the piston-rods terminated in                  a   stir
rup attached to its upper end,                       and the stirrups were connected             by   a
rope       or cord,       which passed          over    a     vertical grooved wheel or large
pulley.             To work the machine, the exerciser of the pumps,                     as he        is
called in the original account, put his feet into the stirrups, and hold
ing on, as          it   should seem,      by   his hands to the upper part of the frame
work of the air-pump, or leaning against                         it   (for the description
                                                                                              is   not
precise         on this particular),       moved his feet alternately up and down as
a   handloom weaver does, or                a    culprit on the treadmill.            The pistons
or suckers had valves (probably of bladder) opening upwards like that
of an ordinary water-pump, and similar valves were placed at the
bottom          of the cylinders,          which       were    filled with water to     a    certain

                                                 212
height, that the pistons might move                     air-tight in them.         From the
cylinders, tubes passed to a common canal, terminating                           in the air-
pump plate, on which receivers to be exhausted were laid, as in
Boyle's second engine.
     It
      is not a little singular that Papin's machine should have been
overlooked by most later writers. It is not referred to in any recent
English work of authority, although its curious stirrup arrangement,
which has been employed in no English air-pump,                           might have been
expected          to direct     attention towards it.           Papin   is mentioned inci
dentally by Nairne as an improver of the air-pump.                       — -(Phil. Trans.,
1777, p- 635.) Dr Hutton, in his Mathematical Dictionary (vol.                                  i.,
p. 55, 1796), mentions Papin's two barrels and twin pistons, but
not the stirrup arrangement.                    In   Shaw's abridged Boyle, the whole
machine         is   described and figured, but Papin's name             is   not mentioned.
    Recent writers on Pneumatics having overlooked Papin's machine,
whilst they universally acknowledge the                       importance      of two barrels
with the pistons counterbalancing                    each     other, have     attributed      this
great improvement to Boyle, to Hooke,                        or to Hauksbee.
    Boyle's          imputed claim to the honour of having first constructed
a   double-barrelled air-pump, may be summarily dismissed, as he him
self disavows          the honour, refers to Papin's air-pump as new to him,
and ascribes its invention to             Papin. — (Birch's Boyle, vol. iv.,         p.   506.)
Mr Weld, however, puts Boyle's claim                        on another, and at first sight
apparently satisfactory, basis.                 The Royal Society, according              to the
former, who            is   its assistant-secretary,    possesses    Boyle's original air-
pump, which has two barrels, and otherwise much resembles                                an air-
pump of the present day. — {History                    of   Royal Society, vol.    i.,   p.   96.)
     If,    however, the instrument              shewn to visitors       to the Royal So
ciety's apartments, be the earliest English air-pump, then Boyle was
not only the first to employ               a   double-barrelled pneumatic pump, but
his earliest pneumatical                 engine had two barrels.          The instrument,
however, which, as Boyle                  informs us    ("   Continuation     of New Expe
riments, &c., on the Spring and Weight of the                       Air," Oxford, 1669,
Preface), he gave to the Royal Society, in 1662, was his "Great
Pneumatical Engine," which he described and figured in 1659.  It
had       a     single barrel,     and    was    quite unique in its construction and
appearance.             The first double-barrelled air-pump             to which   Boyle re
fers       is   Papin's, with which he did not become acquainted till some
seventeen            years after he presented his earliest air-pump to the                Royal

                                                    213
Society.      Mr Weld, therefore,                   is certainly       mistaken in conceiving
that the old double-barrelled                   pump in the Society's               possession    is
Boyle's     original air-pump.                It    is probably        not   an    instrument     of
Boyle's century.
  Dr Thomas Young also                      supposes       the first English air-pump             to
have     had two barrels,            and ascribes their introduction to                   Hooke. —
{Natural Philosophy, Kelland's edition, p. 278.)                                 The latter, how
ever, states distinctly,        that the instrument he made for Boyle had one
barrel    (Waller's Life of Hooke, p. iii.),                    and his drawing of it, which
is engraved in the vignette frontispiece on the title-page of the se
veral volumes        of Birch's Boyle, represents the great pneumatical                          en
gine as possessing but one cylinder.                       Professor Robison, in his trea
tise on Pneumatics,            ascribes     the double pump in one place to Hooke
(Eilc.    Brit.,
             7th Ed., p. 80), and in another to Hauksbee (p. 93).
Professor Robison does not refer to any writing of Hooke' s as con
taining a claim, on his part, to the invention in question                            ;   and it is
impossible to suppose               that Hooke            could have constructed a double
air-pump      before Papin did, without                     Boyle      being aware of the cir
cumstance.          At all   events,      till it   is shewn that Hooke himself claimed
the double air-pump as his invention,                      it   is unnecessary     to discuss his
supposed merits as its inventor.
   Hauksbee          appears       to have      been       the first Englishman           who con
structed an air-pump with two barrels.                          He   described    it in his Trea
tise entitled " Physico-Mechanical Experiments on various subjects,
by Francis Hauksbee, F.R.S., 1709." It was constructed in, or about,
1704, so that it cannot come into competition with a double air-pump
of Hooke's invention               (if   he ever devised one), seeing that he died                in
1702.       Still    less    can    it    supplant        Papin's instrument,         which was
brought to England in 1676,                     and must have been known to Hauks
bee.
   Hauksbee's air-pump was                  a   combination of the rack and pinion of
Hooke's pneumatical engine which he constructed for Boyle, and the
two barrels, twin pistons, and self-acting valves                        of Papin's pump.
   From all,        it   appears, that no English claimant, at least, can dis
pute priority, so far as the double pump      concerned, with Papin.
                                                                  is
Winkler, who was Professor of Natural Philosophy at Leipsic                                       in
the middle of last century, in his Sketch of the History of the Air-
Pump, refers         to Hauksbee's as the first constructed with two barrels.

2.   On the Classification of Colours.                        Part     II.     By Professor
           J.   D. Forbes.      (See     p.   190.)
     The object of this paper            is   chiefly one of nomenclature.                 Every
one has felt the difficulty        of describing with the precision the innu
merable hues which occur in nature and in art                    ;   and which    it is   equally
desirable for the optical philosopher, the artist, and the manufacturer,
to be able        to refer to in a clear and definite                manner.      But such a
nomenclature or classification must proceed                      upon some admission as
to the manner of compounding complex hues out                          of simple ones; and,
therefore, the author first treats of the
                                          (so-called) Primary Colours.
He admits       as highly probable, that all known colours may be
                   it
formed out of Red, Yellow, and Blue                       ;although, when we attempt
to compound pigments, we have                 a     very notable loss of light, and also
an unavoidable impurity, which                is    most visible in the compound tints.
The author, in passing,          endeavours          to explain clearly why the union
of pigments never can produce a perfect white, although the coloured
light of the spectrum           does so    ;     for, by adding blue light to yellow
light,     we not only change the colour,                 but we increase the illumina
tion   ;   whereas, by adding    a yellow pigment, whilst we change
                                       blue to   a
the colour, we at the same time reduce the luminousness of the sur
                       being far less reflective than the yellow ones.
face, the blue particles
Inferring from Newton's empirical rule, the quantities of red, yellow,
and blue light, which should combine to make white light           and                    ;
adopting Lambert's results as to the reflective powers of the brightest
pigments, the author concludes, that the mean illumination of a disk
put in rapid revolution, and containing coloured sectors, will be 4-57
times less than       reflected the whole incident light, or
                        if
                         it                                    will re              it
flect only about half the light which white paper does under the same

     illumination, therefore it will appear relatively grey under any given
     external illumination.
         The author then       states, that the triangular arrangement         of colours
     first proposed    by Mayer, and farther carried out by          Lambert, appears
     to  afford the clearest and truest mode of displaying at              a  glance the
     modification     of colour due to the varying            proportion   of the three
     primary elements.          In    this triangle,   perfect red, yellow, and blue,
     occupy the three corners        ; and these colours graduate into one another,
     according to the simple law of the distance of any point in the tri
     angle from the three corners.            The   sides of the triangle are occupied
     by binary colours or compounds, by two                 and   two ;  the interior is
     occupied    by  triple compounds       ;  and the centre of gravity of the tri
     angle ought to be a neutral grey.
         Hence    it will appear, that any hue not purposely diluted with

          These colours are supposed to be of the standard or maximum at
      tainable intensity.
          They may      be diluted with white on the one hand, forming              tints ;
      or with black, forming shades.
          Mayer's triangle may          be repeated with these       modifications   ;  but
      as the colour tends       to extinction,     either in the direction     of perfect
      blackness or perfect whiteness, the number of compartments in the
      triangles   may be diminished as the dilution of the colours increases.
      Thus, the whole may          be formed into a double pyramid of colour, con
      verging to white above and to black below.
          The author     has    been much indebted to        Mr D. R. Hay, the inge
      nious author of the        " Nomenlature of Colours," and other works, not

                                        216
only for specimens      of coloured papers formed by the actual mixture
of the three primary colours, but also for many valuable suggestions,
of which, in the     course  of this paper, he    has freely availed himself.
    It  is the author's wish     to be   able to obtain a series      of coloured
enamels     complete, according to Mayer's and Lambert's classification.
 Some he has already obtained from the Vatican Collection (of which
he gives a short description), and he hopes to render it more complete.
3.  Verbal Notice of Siliceous              Stalactites    on  Arthur's Seat.
        By Dr Fleming.
    Dr Fleming     began by stating, that a paper       of his,  "  On the Nep
tunian formation of Siliceous        Stalactites,"   was   read before the So
ciety, March 7, 1825, and published in
                                                     " Brewster's Journal of
Science,'' for April of the same year, p. 307.               To this paper Dr
Hibbert has referred, in his description of the           "  Limestone of Bur-
diehouse,"     Edin. Phil. Trans., vol. xiii.,     p. 280, but has misrepre
sented,    in an unaccountable manner, the facts which had been stated.
Dr Fleming, expressly said, in describing a limestone containing the
remains of dicotyledonous plants, and consisting of flinty and calcare
ous layers, that    it " dips under the great      bed of limestone belonging
to the coal formation which extends north towards           Linlithgow," which
"  encloses   the remains of those marine animals which are common in
the   limestones of the coal formation."           Dr Hibbert,      on the other
hand, confounds the two beds, or rather represents the bed with the
vegetable remains as having been viewed as identical with the bed of
limestone with marine remains         ; for he adds,  " Dr Fleming's      remark,
that this limestone encloses        the   remains of those      marine animals,
which are common in the limestones of the coal formation,                   I con
sider as a mistake."         The limestone, however, with vegetable re
mains, had been described       as differing   in structure, and occupying a
lower position, than the limestone with marine remains.
    Dr Fleming then stated that, in the paper referred to,             he had de
scribed siliceous stalactites as occurring in the trap-rocks of the north
side  of Fife (a prolongation of the Ochils), and for some time looked
for similar concretions, in vain, in the corresponding rocks of Arthur's
Seat.      Lately, however,    he had detected       them, hanging       from the
under surface of a bed of porphyry            interstratified    with laminated
clay, at the Bog-Crag on the east side of the Hunter's Bog.                   The
aqueous origin of the stalactites would not now be disputed,               nor, in
the present state of chemistry, would their occurrence excite surprise.

 1.  On some peculiar Impressions on the Surface of certain
        Strata of Greywacke- Schist, at Goldielands, in Rox
       burghshire.         By James Elliot.          Communicated by David
        Milne, Esq.
    After    some    prefatory   remarks on the general character           of the
greywacke formations in the south of Scotland, on their entire desti
tution of organic remains, or even decided impressions, and on the
general prevalence of marks, produced apparently by shallow water,
a  singular    series of schistose      strata is described, of little more than
two feet in thickness altogether, presenting everywhere peculiar fea
tures.     First, there are two       opposed surfaces, the one sprinkled over
with thin, short, raised streaks,          and the other with small cylindrical
grains, all lying perfectly parallel to each other, and consisting of a
hard substance,      differing from the material and colour of the grey
wacke rocks.        Next, there     are a few seams     of fine schist, and then
a  surface, covered with minute, sharply-defined indentations, having
every one a lip turned* up on one side, and sometimes clinging to
the  lip,  a small speck     of the    same hard brown substance,       which ap
pears on the two surfaces         first mentioned.       The lips  are invariably
on  the same side of the indentations, giving the surface the appear
ance of a farrier's rasp ; and the uniform direction in which the lips
are thrown       out from the indentations,         is exactly   parallel  to the
streaks    and grains first described.           At right  angles to that direc
tion are narrow undulating           ridges, such   as would be produced by a

                                      218
cutting wind on     a  tenacious surface.     The marks are preserved by         a
very thin coating of fine earth,         and the opposite surface is not         a
counter-impression,       but has peculiarities  of its own.      After the in
tervention of a few other seams,         there follow     repetitions   of those
already described, but somewhat         varied.    In  conclusion,    an   expla
nation of all the appearances         is attempted.      The author      suggests
that they have been caused by showers of sand, driven by a strong
wind upon the surface of the rocks before they had become har
dened.      The  sand, he supposes,     has been derived from volcanoes         in
activity at the period, and the existence of which is inferred by the
igneous    character of many of the neighbouring hills.
2.   On the Causes of Local Peculiarities                of Temperature in
       different parts of Great Britain.           By James Elliot. Com
       municated by David Milne, Esq.
    Many remarkable diversities of temperature            are observed     in this
island, which have       not yet been satisfactorily     accounted for, either
by difference of latitude       or of elevation, by shelter or exposure, or
by the influence of currents in the         ocean.    It is attempted to shew
that other causes usually assigned have no validity,         — that    the prox
 imity of high, and consequently cold mountains,              has  no effect    in
cooling the low ground near them, even              when their summits are
 covered   with perpetual snow, and that a difference in the clearness
 of the sky, or in the radiating power of the surface of the ground,
 produces   no  effect   on  the average    temperature.      The great cause,
 then, of the diversities      in question is to be found, the writer con
 siders,  in the latent heat of vapour, — in the caloric             disengaged
 by its condensation, or absorbed in its formation.              He   shews    the
 great addition which may be made to the temperature of the atmo
 sphere by a heavy       fall of  snow to the windward,      and, on the other
 hand, the great loss of temperature by evaporation.            The differences,
 in the amount of rain, he attributes almost entirely to the general
 slope   of the  surface   over which the wind passes, in connexion with
 the height of the ground over which it has previously passed, and
 the differences of evaporation to the material of the soil and its cover
 ing, and to its state of drainage, natural or artificial.         Some experi
 ments are then     detailed,   shewing the amount of moisture capable of
  being retained by various coverings of soil, moss, &c., and the ex
  tent to which some of these promote evaporation.             The writer con

                                       219
eludes by shewing the great improvement which may be made in the
general climate     of this island, and particularly in that of its moun
tainous districts,   by complete draining.
3.   Verbal Notices.         By Dr Fleming.
    1.  On the Shell referred to by Ure in his " History of Ruther-
glen and Kilbride,''1 as" a species of Patella." — Dr Fleming called
the attention    of the Society to the extraordinary        merits of  Mr Ure,
who died in 1798, leaving a memorial, in the work above                 referred
to, and which was published at Glasgow in 1793, of an acquaintance
with organic remains unequalled on the part of any contemporary
author of the United Kingdom.               This work, however, is very       sel
dom referred to by modern palaeontologists, although eminently use
ful in illustrating the progress of discovery.          It  was likewise stated,
that an additional degree of interest must be felt by the members of
the Society, in consequence        of a collection  of organic remains, chiefly
 marine, and from the carboniferous limestone, which belonged to              Mr
 Ure, having been presented by          Mr Stark,     and which now occupies
a place in the cases up stairs.
     Dr Fleming    stated,  that the description of the Patella, referred to
 at p. 305, and delineated      in Tab. xv.,  figs. 9, 10, is so obscure, doubt
 less  in  consequence    of the imperfect specimen then in Ure's posses
 sion, that   it was  not until he had succeeded in procuring examples
 in nearly the same condition, along with others more characteristic,
 that he could refer the organism to its type, or, rather to the genus
 Discina of Lamarck.        This genus was unaccountably confounded with
  Orbicula of Lamarck, by Mr G. B. Sowerby, in a paper in the thir
  teenth vol. of  Linn. Trans., 465, and the errors there introduced         have
  been propagated    in the   " Silurian  System" of Murchison; the "Geo
  logy  of Yorkshire," by Phillips;      and  the " Geological Beport on Lon
  donderry," &c., by Portlock. The species indicated for the first time
  by  Ure, is probably referable to the Orbicula rugata of the Silurian
  System, p. 610, T. v., f. 11, although much doubt must rest on the
  determination.      The shell consists of several somewhat easily         sepa
  rable layers.     The external one, cuticle-like, exhibits regular         con
  centric grooves, constituting the character of the 0. rugata, while in
  the different   aspects  of the inferior layers, may be contemplated the
  0. nitida of Phillips, and the 0. striata of Sowerby.            At the period
  when Ure wrote he seems to have been in possession of only imper
  fect examples, or the upper valve of this brachiopod, but in his col

                                         220
 lection now on the table there are good specimens of the lower valve,
as well as characteristically-marked         upper ones.
    2.  On the     "Fossil Echini" of lire. — Dr Fleming stated, that
 having found plates of Ure's Echinus in company with fragments of
spines, with proximal extremities, similar to the figure, Tab. xvi., f.
 8, and the distal denticulated extremities conjoined, he had character
                              " British Animals,"
 ised the species in his                                denominating it Cidaris
 Urii, thereby commemorating the labours of the discoverer.                   Captain
Portlock, in the work already reported,            has     described and figured
portions of, apparently, the same species, as             Cidaris Benburbensis,
manufacturing       new species besides,    without being aware of the dif
ferences    in the form of     the spines, as well as      in the sculpture of the
plates, from different        parts of the crust    ;  truths    illustrated   by the
existing     British Cidaris papillata, giving evidence to the palae
ontologist of the expediency of combining a knowledge of recent with
extinct forms.        Dr Fleming concluded this notice with stating that
he found, during last autumn, the remains of this carboniferous lime
stone organism in the lowest bed          of the old red      sandstone    series,  on
the Berwickshire       coast,  in which   he detected    marine remains, begin
ning   at the fundamental conglomerate, where            it rests on the " Transi
tion Rocks" at the Siccart Point, and proceeding westward to Dunbar.
4.   Notice by Professor Piazzi Smyth                     of Locke's Electric
       Observing Clock.
    This instrument, which        has been invented in       America, consists of
an electro-magnetic machine, which, being placed in connection with
an ordinary astronomical clock, does not interfere with the regularity
of its going, while it marks the instant of          each vibration      of the pen
dulum on a revolving cylinder, whose circumference moves at the rate
of  one inch per second.         Two wires being then taken          to an observer
at any distance,     if he, when he observes a star crossing the meridian-
wire of his telescope, makes contact with the wires, that moment is
immediately marked on the same moving cylinder where the even                      se
conds are registered.         The fraction of   a second     may be then obtained
with as much accuracy as the space of an inch may be subdivided by
ordinary mechanical means          : say to the hundredth       of  a second.    This
method is further available in many cases where the -present mode of
noting transits is not, and admits of         a great multiplication       of  obser
vations during the short space of time that the star occupies in cross
ing the field of view.

  1.   Abstract of a Communication                on Rolling Curves.
    This paper commenced with an outline of the nature and history
of the problem of rolling curves, and it was shewn that the subject
had been discussed previously, by several geometers,                amongst whom
were De la       Hire and Nicole in the Memoires de VAcademie, Euler,
Professor Willis, in his Principles of Mechanism, and the Rev. H.
Holditch in the Cambridge Philosophical Transactions.
    None of these authors, however, except the two last, had made
any application of their methods           ;   and the principal object of the
present communication           was  to find    how far the general equations
could be simplified in particular         cases,   and to apply the results to
practice.
     Several problems were then worked out, of which some were                   ap
 plicable to    the generation of curves, and        some to wheelwork ;      while
 others were interesting as shewing the relations which exist between
 different curves     ;  and, finally, a collection of examples was added, as
 an  illustration of the fertility of the methods employed.

  2.   On the    Extraction of Mannite from the Dandelion.                     By
         Messrs Smith ; with an Analysis of the Mannite, by
         Dr Stenhouse. Communicated by Dr George Wilson.
      Messrs Smith stated that they had extracted from the dandelion,
  a large  amount of    a crystalline   sweet substance, having all the physi
 cal characters of mannite.         It was analysed      by Dr Stenhouse, and
 found to contain carbon, hydrogen,          and oxygen, in the proportions
 which characterise the accepted formula for mannite           ; viz., C6 H7 Oe,
 so   that it certainly was the substance      it  was supposed   to be.
     Messrs Widnmann        and Frickhinger, it was stated, had anticipated
 Messrs Smith in the separation of mannite from the dandelion juice,
 and were led to believe that the mannite               did not pre-exist   ready
 formed    in the dandelion    ; but was formed in the juice as the result
 of a peculiar fermentation which it underwent.             This result  was con
 firmed by the Messrs        Smith, who experimented with large parcels
 of the plant, and found that even from quantities of the fresh root, so
 large as 40 lb., no mannite could be extracted, if the expressed juice
 were prevented from fermenting          ;  whilst,  if fermentation were per
 mitted, the same weight of roots yielded a large quantity of mannite,
which appears to be derived from the sugar, inulin, &c., of the dan
delion, which were converted into mannite, gum, and lactic acid.
     The Messrs Smith stated, in conclusion, that they had not               been
able to confirm the statement of Polex, that the dandelion contains
a   bitter crystallizable   substance,   such as he had described      under the
name of Taraxacine.
3.     On some new Voltaic            arrangements with Chlorous and
     Chromic Acids, with an account of a Battery, yielding elec
     tricity of great intensity, in which the negative, as well as
     the positive element is Zinc. By Dr Thomas Wright.
     Communicated by Dr G. Wilson.
     The author, after referring to the principle on which the intense
batteries of Daniel and Grove are constructed, and to the disadvan
tages connected with the use          of the porous cells in those arrange
ments,    stated that he had some time ago instituted a series of expe
riments, with a view to the construction of a voltaic circle of high
electro-motive force, capable of being excited by a single solution,
similarly     to  the battery of     Mr    Smee.    Having employed       a great

                                         224
variety of solutions, he was led to consider mixtures of chromic or
chlorous acid with dilute sulphuric acid, best adapted to the purpose
he had proposed.
    The chromic     acid battery was arranged by        twisting round     one end
of   a cylinder of coke      a  copper conducting wire, soaking the part in
boiling wax, and afterwards covering it with varnish, to protect the
wire from the acid      :  the coke was then surrounded by a cylinder of
amalgamated zinc, and firmly fixed in its place by wedges of var
nished cork.       To form the exciting liquid,       a measure     of strong sul
phuric acid was added          to an equal measure     of   a hot saturated solu
tion of bichromate of potash         : the mixture was then diluted with four
measures of water, and set aside to cool.             The    coke and zinc    cylin
der^ placed in a tumbler of the solution possessed a high degree of
electro-motive force, a single alternation being capable of decompos
ing acidulated water with platinum            electrodes.     The author     stated,
that the arrangement was not constant, its action gradually declining
after immersion.          But he considered that          a small    pair was well
adapted for the excitation          of electro-magnetic      apparatus,   from its
possessing about three times the intensity of Smee's arrangement.
In    an  experiment      made by him with        Dr Wilson,     a series   of four
pairs, roughly put together in half-pint tumblers, decomposed                acidu
lated water, at the rate of two cubic inches of mixed gases per mi
nute with a cold, and four with           a hot, charge of the chromic          acid
solution.     No   gas was      evolved from the amalgamated zinc surface
 in either   case.    One of the advantages of the battery was, that a
 series   of cylinders, however extensive, might, as in Wollaston's              ar
 rangement, be immersed and removed              from the solution at once, and
 the energetic effects of first immersion obtained at pleasure.            Platina,
 or boxwood charcoal might be used in place of coke               : a small series
 of thirteen pairs (charcoal and amalgamated zinc), each exposing a sur
 face of about a quarter of an inch square, afforded a shock equal to
 a Cruickshank's     battery of fifty pairs of four-inch plates, a perceptible
 shock being even felt from four pairs.
     The solution of chlorous or hypochloric acid (CI 04) was prepared,
by pouring a drachm of powdered chlorate of potash into a wine
glass containing an ounce of concentrated sulphuric acid, and in ten
minutes afterwards plunging the mixture into seven ounces of water.
A   pair of plates (amalgamated zinc and thin sheet-brass) excited by
the last solution gave a powerful current, until the chlorous acid was
exhausted.       The author had, however, more than             once failed to ob

                                            225
  tain any current from such an arrangement.                A  mixture of chlorate
  of potash and concentrated sulphuric            acid formed a good charge for
 the negative side       of Grove's double cell.
     The author then        proceeded    to describe the platinized zinc battery.
 He    was   led to its discovery by observing           that zinc (not amalga
 mated) has a tendency to assume an inactive state in some
                                                                          solutions
 containing a large quantity of sulphuric acid.             Two or three arrange
 ments were described,         in which    the negative plate consisted of zinc
 in various fluids, viz.,       dilute  sulphuric    acid,   hypochloric  acid and
 sulphuric     acid, solution      of sulphate of copper and sulphuric acid,
 &c.     The    most powerful       battery of this class was formed by a ne
gative plate of zinc included in a porous cell, containing a mixture
of one measure         of nitric acid with four of sulphuric acid, and asso
ciated with     a   double plate of zinc in a solution of potash or common
salt.     Such    a  circle was found t)have an intensity equal to the bat
tery of Professor Daniel, but by simply brushing the negative plate
with a very dilute hot or acid solution of chloride of platinum, the elec
 tro-motive force       of the battery was doubled, a single cell being then
capable of decomposing water with platinum electrodes.                A  platinized
zinc battery of three cells was placed on the table, the arrangement
of the porous and outer cell being that of Professor Grove.                The po
sitive plate of each        outer cell was folded over into the porous cell,
and formed the negative plate of the pair next in series               ; there was
therefore      no   necessity for binding       screws,   solderings,  or mercury
cups    in the whole arrangement.             The platinized zinc of each cell
exposed a surface of 2-5 in. by 3-7 in.               The series of three cells
gave a cubic inch of mixed gases in 37 seconds, but the author con
sidered that the battery would give two cubic inches of gas per mi
nute, when the charge of the arrangement had become warm by the
passage     of the current.        After   use, the zinc plates were well rinsed
in clean water and allowed to dry, and it              was   considered advisable
to give them a        slight brushing with the solution of platinum before
their being again used.           The platinized zinc battery was a constant
arrangement.

    The following communication                 was read    : —
 Biographical Notice of Dr Chalmers.                     By the Very Rev. E.
        B. Ramsay.
    The writer of this paper        commenced     by stating his purpose of view
 ing Dr Chalmers          as a public character only, and to avoid    all questions
 which belonged to the peculiar relations in which he stood to his own
 religious communion         ;  and after a brief outline of the various circum
 stances of his life,      and the dates belonging to each,        the paper pro
 posed to consider       Dr Chalmers, —
       I. As    an Author.
     II.  As    a  Political Economist.
   III.   As    a Speaker.
     I. Under      the first head were noted the peculiarities        of  Dr Chal
 mers's mode of treating a subject, and the distinguishing points of his
 style, the abundance of his imaginative faculty, and the effects
 which were produced by it upon his writings.
     II.  Under the       head   of political economy, the principal object was
 to exhibit Dr Chalmers as a true Christian philanthropist.                The cir
 cumstances connected with his management of the poor in St John's
  parish, Glasgow, were detailed          ; and the influence which that expert

                                        227
inent had      upon his views of pauperism and poor-laws, generally.
Some objections to his Glasgow           scheme   were   considered, and some
misapprehensions of it were explained.             Under this    head were de
tailed his views on Ecclesiastical        and Academical     Endowments,      and
his testimony to the value of the English Church and Universities.
     III.   In considering   Dr Chalmers      as a public speaker, some speci
mens     of his sermons were read, with remarks upon his eloquence in
the   pulpit. The case of his speech on the Catholic Emancipation
Bill, was cited     as an instance   of great  effect produced by eloquence    at
a public meeting.         His striking reply to     an  accusation of inconsis
tency brought against him          in the General Assembly, and a speci
men     of his  mode    of lecturing were given.       Some observations were
 then made on       his love of natural scenery, and his admiration of the
beauties of the material world.           His private character and social in
tercourse were referred to — his powers of conversation, and his per
 fect freedom from affectation, bigotry, or intolerance        ;  of these quali
 ties examples were cited, as also of his turn for humour,                and his
 keen sense of the ridiculous.         The author of the paper then conclud
 ed by stating     his conviction, that although there might be differences
 of judgment       regarding particular portions of Dr Chalmers's public
 acts and opinions, yet that no one who had known him personally, and
 who had been well acquainted with his real character — that no one
 who had studied and appreciated the spirit and tendencies of his writ
 ings, would hesitate to admit that he was a good and a great man —
 that he was a sincere friend to the poor, — and that his great aim in
 life  was to promote the glory      of God, and the wellbeing of his fellow-
  men  — that   he was a    Scotchman of whom Scotland might be proud
 — and     that his labours and his writings have gained a name, and esta
  blished a reputation, which will not pass away.

      The Right Rev. Bishop TERROT, V. P., in the Chair.
     The following Communications                       were read      :   —
1.    An Attempt to compare the Exact and Popular Estimates
        of Probability.             By Bishop Terrot.
     The author began by defining                probability     as being that         state    of
mind in which we are inclined to believe a proposition,                          without       be
ing absolutely       convinced       that it is true.        Objectively,        every propo
sition is either true or false           ;   subjectively,   it may    be certainly        true,
probable, or impossible.
     The   measure     of probability he shewed to be the same as the mea
sure of the cause producing it ; that is, the ratio of the reasons in
clining    us to believe a proposition,            to the whole number of reasons
bearing upon         it,   whether for or against        ;   all of which        reasons       are
founded, either upon necessary                 inference from experience, or from
testimony.
     How inference from experience may lead to                    a   definite expectation
of an event different              from that which has been experienced, was
shewn in the case of an urn, containing two balls, white or black,
and from which        a     white has been drawn.            There     is   then   a   probabi
lity of \   that the remaining ball will be black                 ;   and   if a   witness as
serts that at   a    second drawing black was drawn,                  his credit must be
very low indeed,           if   his assertion does not raise this probability              from
\    to above       that    is    to say, render   it   more likely that the event in
the second drawing was different from, though not contradictory, to
that observed in the first drawing, than that was not different.it

                                                229
   The author then examined the probabilites arising from combined
testimony, as expressed by the formula,
                                                 1
                                      \     V   /       p
where   p is the     antecedent         probability,      v the average      veracity of the
witness,   and n the number of witnesses.                    The    cause of an antecedent
probability    was stated to be a natural tendency to believe in the con
tinuity of series, and to be, in fact,                a modification      of the inference
from experience.
   It  was then shewn, that this expression is applicable                          to the pro
bable correctness        of the verdicts of juries, assuming                 v to represent
the probability      of correctness in          each   juryman.        Taking the number
of the    jury    at three, it appeared             that the probability of getting a
correct unanimous verdict, was to the probability of getting                          a correct
verdict by    a  majority as 3 to 4.              But,    on the other hand, it appeared
that assuming       p to    be    T9^,   the probability        of error in   the unanimous
verdict is  ^-^s, while the probability of error when two divide against
one is -fa ; that is to say, about eighty times as great as in the for
mer case.       Hence it was inferred that verdicts, by a -bare majority,
are admissible in         civil  cases, where       it is sufficient that the verdict        be
probably correct       ;   but not in criminal             cases,    where it is desirable
that the probability of correctness                should be carried as near to cer
tainty   as possible.
   Lastly, Whereas there are, in every criminal charge, a certain
number of points, all of which the jury desire to know, and which,
if  all proved, whether for or against the accused, would give a defi
nite probability of his guilt or innocence, but of which one or more
may remain untouched by the evidence, it was shewn that the jury
would not deal fairly with the case if they threw the non-established
point out of view, or           if  they gave the benefit of the doubt, as it is
called, to the prisoner.             Supposing      — - to     be the probability      of guilt,
independently of the non-established point, which must be considered
as equally    likely     to be really for as against the accused,                 we must see
that the consideration of this adds              i   to a, and the same to b.           So that

tion of the omitted point increases or diminishes the probability              of
guilt, according as a +       b is  greater or less than 2 a, or a greater or
less than b : That is to      say, the preponderance     of the greater proba
bility is diminished by the consideration of         each unproved note.      If,
as was supposed to be generally the case in criminal trials, the pro
bability from the       evidence    preponderates against the accused, then
he does get a benefit from         the due consideration of each unproved
note, though very far from the benefit he would have gained by prov
ing it in his favour.
2. On the       Gradual Production of Luminous Impressions on
       the Eye, and other phenomena of Vision.                    By William
       Swan,     F.R.S.E.
   The object of this communication was to ascertain the relation be
tween the apparent brightness of a light, and the time during which
it acts on the eye.       In   order to examine the intensity of luminous
impressions of short duration, the author made            use  of discs, having
sectors  of known angles cut out of their circumferences, which             were
made to revolve at known velocities between the eye and a luminous
object.      In  this manner, the object is seen at each revolution of the
disc for a short interval of time, of which the duration is easily as
certained.      An instrument termed        a selaometer (from ei\ag, bright
ness'), to indicate its use as a measure        of the intensity of luminous
impressions, was      devised for the purpose of comparing the brightness
of the flashes      caused   by the revolution     of the disc, with a light of
known intensity.        This instrument consists of two      screens,  placed so
as to face each      other, having each a circular aperture of the same
diameter, to which is fitted a piece of obscured glass.            A  disc, hav
ing   a sector of    a known angle, revolves in front of one of these
screens,    so  that the aperture in it is visible at each revolution
of the disc throughout the sector.             The apertures are illuminated
by gas    flames behind them, which admit of having their distances
from the screens varied, so as to increase or diminish the illumination
of the apertures.       A   rectangular prism of glass is placed half way
between     the apertures, with its faces inclined at angles of 45° to the
line joining their centres      ;  so that they are seen in apparent contact
 by reflexion from the faces of the prism, and their relative brightness

                                      231
can thus be compared with great nicety.           The light behind the    re
volving disc is kept at a constant distance from the screen during an
experiment      ;  and, before causing the disc to revolve, the apertures
are made      equally bright by varying      the distance of the other light
from its screen.         When the disc     is put  in motion,   the apparent
brightness of the aperture behind it is instantly diminished        ; and the
equality of the apparent brightness of the apertures in the screens         is
restored,    by increasing      the distance of the light from the other
screen.     The ratio of the brightness of the impression produced by
the light during the revolution of the disc, to the brightness of its
impression, when seen by uninterrupted vision, is that of the squares
of the distances of the other light from the aperture in its screen.
    The following      are the principal  results obtained by means of this
apparatus    : —
    (1.) When the eye receives, from a light of constant intensity,          a
succession of flashes of equal duration, which succeed each other           so
rapidly as to produce a uniform impression, this impression will also
have a constant intensity, provided the number of flashes in a given
time varies inversely with the duration of each flash.
    (2.) The brightness of the impression produced by flashes of light
of a given intensity, which succeed each other so rapidly as to pro
 duce a uniform       impression on the eye, is proportional to the number
 of flashes in a given time.
    (3.) When light of a given intensity acts on the eye for a short
 space of time, the brightness of the luminous impression on the retina
 is exactly proportional to the time during which the light continues
 to act.   This law      has been proved to be true for impressions lasting
 from   Tffis*     to  *i  of a second.    The intensity of the impression
 produced      by light which acts on the eye for        TJT  of a second, is
 almost exactly           of the brightness of the light when seen by un
 interrupted      vision ; and it is also ascertained that light requires
 about the tenth part of a second to produce its full effect on the eye.
    (4.) It is found that lights of different intensity act on the eye with
 equal rapidity, so that even the light of the sun produces an impres
 sion with no greater rapidity than that of a common gas flame.
    (5.) Rays of different refrangibility act on the eye with equal ra
 pidity.
     (6.) Since Professor Wheatstone's experiments         have   proved that

                                      232
the  light of the electric spark of high tension continues for less than
the millionth part of a second, and it has been shewn that the bright
ness of the impression,      produced   by light on the eye, increases       in
the exact arithmetical    proportion   of the time during which it con
tinues to act on the retina, it follows that the apparent brightness of
the electric spark    is only T5 oWff of what it would become        if    the
duration of the spark could be prolonged to ^th of a second.         From
the   great apparent brilliancy of the nearly       instantaneous  electric
spark of high tension, when compared with the sensibly continuous
light of Voltaic electricity, it is inferred that the brightness of     elec
trical light increases with the tension of the electricity.
3.   Note on the Refractive and Dispersive Powers of the Hu
       mours of the Eye, determined by Experiment.               By John
       Adie, Esq.
    The author's object in undertaking these experiments, was to dis
cover if the achromatism of the eye could be accounted for by the
differences in the dispersive ratios of the fluids forming that organ.
    The indices for several of the fixed lines were determined in the
aqueous    humour   ; with the crystalline no satisfactory result could be
obtained.
    In  subjecting the vitreous humour to experiment, only the strongest
of the fixed lines could be seen, and that with great difficulty      ;  one
remarkable feature, however, was observed, viz., that on dividing the
mass of humours two spectrums were formed, the one placed over the
other, having a greater deviation, and, consequently, refractive power.
Thus proving, that that humour is not of equal density throughout,
as has heretofore been supposed.

     The following Communication               was read     : —
1.    On Grooved and Striated Rocks in the Middle Region of
        Scotland.      By Charles Maclaren, Esq.
     In this paper an account was given of grooved, striated, and           abraded
rocks in various parts of Scotland, from Glen Spean on the north, to
the Pentland     and Lammennoor         Hills   on   the south.       After indicat
ing the direction in which the groovings pointed, it was shewn,               —that
the appearance of these grooved and striated rocks is irreconcilable
with the hypothesis which ascribes the phenomena to a supposed
great Atlantic wave or transient flood, of which one part swept across
the low lands of Scotland, while another part was turned back by the
mountains,    — that    in the district between       the Clyde and the Spean,
where the largest and best marked groovings were observed,                  there is
satisfactory evidence to prove, that they were produced by bodies                  of
vast depth occupying the valleys, moving from the mountain group as
a common centre, toward the coast              and the Lowlands in all direc
tions, and exerting an immense force            of pressure vertically       and  la
terally, — that    this quaquaversal motion, as well as the form, position,
and size of the groovings, are conclusive against the idea that they
were caused       by currents    of water    loaded     with   stones    and gravel,
since no collected mass of water exists, or could exist, of the requi
site magnitude and elevation, to send out streams in all directions
capable    of acting powerfully at    the height     of a thousand feet or more
above the bottoms of the        valleys, — that    the effects mentioned, there
fore, can only be accounted for by the agency of glaciers, as exemplified
 in the Swiss Alps, where glacier ice is found covering immense areas,
 filling the valleys, and grooving and abrading their            sides to the height
of one or two thousand        feet, — finally,   that the striae, groovings, and
abrasion seen in the great central valley of Scotland, and on the Pent-
 land   Hills, are probably    due to icebergs     or rafts   of  ice, to which also
the transportation       of many travelled boulders may          be ascribed.

   The following communications were read : —
1.  On a Simple         Form of Rain -Gauge.           By the Rev. Dr
      Fleming.
   The author     began by stating, that during a calm, when the        rain
drop was under the influence of the centripetal force only, the form

                                        235
and position of the      rain-gauge were        unimportant.      The   case, how
ever, was widely     different when the drop was likewise influenced by
wind, for then any object raised above            the surface, such as a rain-
gauge projecting     three or four feet from the ground, occasioned             de
flections and eddies, whereby the regular             fall of the rain into the
collector was prevented.         The Author then           recommended,    that in
all cases the gauge should be placed on the ground, with its mouth
on a level    with    a regularly   trimmed       grass plot, so as to prevent
eddies and evaporation.       The form which         he considered unexception
able (an example executed         by  Mr James Bryson, 66 Princes Street,
being exhibited)     was that    of  a copper cylinder,       with  a funnel-form
partition placed about an inch and            a  half below the mouth, having
an aperture for the index of a float, which             rises  as the rain   passes
into the receiving     portion of the lower part of the cylinder, at the
bottom of which is a stopcock for letting off, at times, the accumu
lated water.      A  second cylinder     of copper, closed at bottom, is pro
vided, to be    inserted into the ground for the reception of the gauge,
the   latter  having    a shoulder or flange to prevent the entrance              of
earth.     By this arrangement the collector and receiver are equal in
area, so    that errors of workmanship are avoided. The state of the
gauge is known by simple inspection              of the index of the float, and
extreme facility of emptying and adjusting the instrument secured.
2. On a      Method of Cooling the Atmosphere of Rooms in a
        Tropical Climate.         By Professor C. Piazzi Smyth.
    After stating the     case distinctly, and dwelling        emphatically on its
 importance, as shewn by individual           instances in private life, and by
the statistics of the world at large, the author proceeded to describe
the various methods adopted at present in India, and shewed their
incapacity to meet the end proposed,            as they merely agitated the      air
already in a room, or perniciously overloaded it with moisture.
    To take the most difficult       case that could occur, he chose that         of
a country where the mean temperature of day and night, and sum
mer and winter, is never below 80°, and where there could, conse
quently, be no coolness        in springs      or rivers, or in the night      air ;
 where also the atmosphere being saturated with moisture, no cold
could be produced by evaporation            ;   and   under such circumstances

                                      236
proposed that a method should be found of lowering the temperature
of the air in a room ; doing, in fact, there, the reverse of what is
effected in a cold room    by  lighting   a fire.
    The principle of the plan which he brought forward was dependent
on the property of air to increase in temperature on compression, and
to diminish on expansion ; the       air was to be compressed      by a forcing
pump into a close vessel, then cooled          or rather deprived merely of
its acquired heat of compression, and then being allowed to escape
into the room desired to be cooled, would issue at a temperature               as
much below that of the atmosphere           as  it had risen   above    on com
pression.
    That this   was a vera causa there was no doubt       ; the sufficiency and
the practicability were the only matters of doubt.           These the author
attempted to solve, by shewing the quantity of increase of heat due
to a certain amount of compression ; and by devising the most con
venient form of the necessary        apparatus, and concluded that        a one-
 horse   power should supply a room with 30 cubic feet of air per
 minute, cooled 20° below the surrounding atmosphere.              The various
 sources of mechanical power      likely to  be met   with in warm countries,
 were then described ; and    particularly     a new and simple, and at the
 same time, a remarkably compact and effective form            of windmill   ; as
 the wind is everywhere so cheap and abundant, and in the tropics so
 certain a species of moving power.         Methods also of ventilating       the
 cooled room, i. e.,  of keeping it constantly supplied with       cooled fresh
 air, and removing the vitiated, were explained,          as well as a natural
 principle for meeting the residual difficulty that might be expected to
 arise in some cases, viz., the too great moisture of the cooled air.
 3.   Notice of a Shooting- Star.         By Professor C. Piazzi Smyth.
     The object of this notice was merely to call attention to the im
  portance of observing the phenomena of shooting-stars more carefully
  and rigidly, and of applying to them more correctly than has generally
  been  the case hitherto, the measurement of time and of space,              and
  to exemplify   what may be done       in this way by the calculation of        a
  recent instance.    This instance, the rare      one of an ascending shoot
  ing-star, was furnished by Captain W. S. Jacob, Bombay Engineers ;
  and he having given the place where the body first appeared, that

                                                 237
where     it disappeared,        and     the    time, the author of the paper, who
had great faith in his friend's exactitude, considered the opportunity
favourable for trying what results would be given by the application
of Sir    J.    Lubbock's theory.
  Some dissatisfaction has been felt about theories of shooting-stars,
inasmuch as no one of them                will explain all the          observed    phenomena.
But though this is undoubtedly a necessary characteristic of a true
theory, still great allowances are necessary here where so many dif
ferent classes          of cosmical and atmospherical                   objects    may be con
founded even by practised observers                    ;   and where the greater number
of observers are utterly unpractised, and their senses wholly unedu
cated    for scientific observation.                 Allowing that       some     electrical and
magnetical        effects      have been mistaken for shooting-stars,                       but ex
cluding        the baseless      electrical,     chemical, and lunar              hypotheses, a
great proportion are undoubtedly of a cosmical nature, and belong
properly to astronomy             ;   and these may be divided into two classes of
small bodies.           1st,   Those which are circulating               round the sun as a
primary ; and 2dly, Those which are revolving round the earth as
such.  The first we may occasionally see when passing near them in
their orbits,       but are not likely to come within sight of the same
again, unless, indeed, they approach                       so   near the earth as to gravitate
towards it instead of the sun, and so become satellites                            or shooting-
stars of the second class.
  Sir     J.     Lubbock's       theory        is,   that the shooting-stars            shine by
reflected light, and are extinguished                      by   entering the earth's shadow       ;
and he has given formulae               on this supposition for computing the dis
tance    of the    body from the spectator                 by noting the place in the sky
where, and the time when, the extinction occurs.
  These formulae have been rendered more convenient for computa-
tation    by     Mr Archibald           Smith,       Phil. Mag., March 1849                 ;   and,
computed according to them, Captain Jacob's observation gives, for
the distance of the body from the observer, 1721 miles   and that                   ;
entry into the earth's                shadow    was the true cause          of the disappear
ance,    is   borne out by the fact that the direction of motion was towards
the axis of the earth's           shadow.            And,       on account of the extremely
small distance of the body, its change of place                          during flight       would
sufficiently account for its gradually                     appearing in the lower part of
the sky when coming out of conjunction,                          increasing in brilliancy dur
ing its flight (reaching, at its maximum, the brightness of Venus), and

then slowly vanishing as it entered first the penumbra and then the
umbra of the earth's shadow, in       a slanting direction   ; and lastly, the
body can hardly fail of being a satellite, as its distance        is so   much
less  than that of a shooting-star, which         M. Petit of Toulouse        has
pretty well identified as revolving about the earth in 3h 20m, or at
about 3000 miles from the surface.
4.   A  few unpublished        particulars concerning          the late       Dr
       Black.      By  Dr  George Wilson.
   The object of this communication         was to lay before the Society a
few characteristic incidents concerning       Dr Black, gathered from Mrs
Elizabeth Wordsworth,       who was a servant in his household during
the five last years of his life.
   The    facts  recorded do not admit of abridgment,          but they com
pletely confirmed the accounts contained in the published biographies
of Black, concerning his valetudinarian and methodical habits, whilst
they gave no countenance to the statement which had been credited
in  some quarters, that the great chemist was an avaricious or penu
rious man.       Some interesting particulars were       adduced   illustrative
of the amiability and gentleness      which characterised Dr Black        ;   and
the author concluded by noticing that an error had been committed
as to the date    of the philosopher's   death, which was not the 26th of
November 1799, as stated by Robison, but the 6th December of that
year, a fact which      Mr  Muirhead    first  pointed out (Watt's Corre
spondence,    p. xxii.), but which is confirmed       by the newspapers of
the period.     (Vide Edinburgh Mercury of 14th December 1799.)

     The following communications              were read   : —
 1.   On a New Voltaic            Battery of Intense Power. By Dr
         Wright.        Communicated by        Dr George Wilson.
     The author placed       on the table a battery  of four pairs, each con
 sisting of a rod of coke 2^ inches long by l* in diameter, surrounded
 by a cylinder of amalgamated zinc, 2J inches high by 2J inches in
 diameter     ;  the different pairs were firmly attached to the same bar
 of wood, and could be immersed in jars of stoneware at once.              The
 arrangement was charged with a mixture             of nitric acid   one  part,
 sulphuric acid four parts, water eight parts.        The author   stated that
he considered        the power of the battery, which       was  twice  that of
 Grove's, was due to the heat generated on the surface of the zinc by
the local action of the nitric acid.
2. On       a   New Species of Manna, from New South Wales.
        By Thomas Anderson, M.D.
    About thirty years ago a species of manna, obtained from the
Eucalyptus Mannifera, was brought from New South Wales, and
was examined by          Dr Thomas Thomson, and afterwards by Professor
Johnston, both of whom          ascertained  it to contain   a new species  of
sugar, different from the mannite which exists in ordinary manna.
The author had, through the kindness of Mr Sheriff Cay, an oppor
tunity of examining a very different species of manna, remarkable
both from its chemical constitution, and from its possessing           a defi
nitely organised structure.         This substance    was  discovered by   Mr
Robert Cay in 1844, in the interior of Australia Felix,          to the north
and north-west        of Melbourne,   where it occurs at certain seasons on
the leaves      of the Mallee plant, Eucalyptus Dumosa, and is known        to
the   natives by the name of Lerp.
    It  consists of numerous small conical cups of the average diameter
of  a  sixth of an inch, more or less distinctly striated, and covered

                                          240
on the outside with hairs of considerable length.            The cup resembles
some of the smaller           species  of patella, and its mouth is perfectly
smooth and round.           Several of the cups are frequently attached to one
another by the edges, and always            so  that their mouths form a plane,
by which it would          appear they have       been attached to the leaves.
The hairs, when examined under the microscope, were found to con
sist of uniform tubes, with a granular structure, and indistinct traces
of transverse       striae  ;  they are coloured uniformly       blue by iodine.
 The   cups are made up         of  a confused mass of closely-compacted       cells
resembling starch globules, and coloured blue by iodine.
    The    taste   of Lerp is distinctly       saccharine, but this is confined
 entirely to the hair,         the cup having merely       a mucilaginous     taste.
 The chemical examination            shewed  it to consist of an uncrystallisable
 sugar similar       in its character to that found in fruits,          of starch,
 gum, inulin, and cellulose, the absolute identity of the latter two of
 which was determined by ultimate analysis.               There were also found
 minute traces of resinous matter and nitrogen, and 1-13 per cent of
 ash.    The following        is the result of its quantitative analysis   : —
              Water,                                              15-04

              Ash,                                                 113
     The author, in concluding his paper, remarked that all            the species
 of manna before observed consisted of soluble substances,               and were
 considered    to be produced        by the puncture of an insect, which caused
 the exudation of their constituents in the fluid form, and that they
 gradually dried up upon the surface of the leaf, but that the exist
 ence in Lerp of the insoluble cellulose and starch, and the sparingly-
 soluble inulin, seemed scarcely compatible with such an explanation
  of its origin.

3.   Account of a peculiar Structure found in the Vagmarus
       Islandicus. By Dr John Reid.                       Communicated by Pro
       fessor Goodsir.
4.   Notes to a Paper on the Motive Power of Heat.                              By Pro

                                  of various Liquids.
    An important        test  of the truth of the axiom             on which Carnot's
Theory is founded, will be afforded by comparing the values of p
deduced     from observations on various liquids.                   I  am  informed by
Mons. Regnault,         that, by the end of this year, data as complete as
those which we at present possess for water,                 will  be supplied for five
or six different liquids, from           certain investigations with which he is
now occupied.          Carnot gives values of p for the temperatures of the
boiling of sulphuric ether, alcohol,              water, and essence of turpentine,
derived from various observations upon those liquids.                     The compari
son of these with the values            of /*,  deduced    from Regnault's      continu

     The coincidences of the results obtained by such very different
 experiments are very striking.              The differences certainly lie within
 the limits of the errors of observation ; for it happens that the dif
 ference   of the two results          deduced     by the different experimenters,
 from water at the boiling-point,              is   greater   than any of the other
 differences.     It   is very remarkable          that the feature of the gradual

                                                   242
decrease      of   /j.   with the temperature should be so clearly brought out
by observations performed on different liquids, at different tempera
tures.
         (2.)      On the Heat developed               by     the Compression            of   Air.
   Carnot demonstrates              the following proposition                  :   —
   Equal        volumes       of   all elastic fluids, when                compressed            to equal
smaller volumes,            disengage equal quantities                   of   heat.
   This very remarkable proposition, given                           as   a   theorem by Carnot,
was     enunciated as a probable experimental                            law by Dulong           ;   and   it
therefore       affords     a very powerful            confirmation             of Carnot'     s     funda
mental principle.
  Mr Joule          of Manchester           has    made        some      important experiments
on this subject.            The view which            he takes           of a thermal " equiva
lent" for       motive     power      is   at variance        with Carnot's theory, but his
experimental results agree with its indications in                              a     very satisfactory
manner.         In endeavouring            to effect      a   comparison,       I      found that the
following propositions are a consequence                         of Carnot's Theory.
   1.    In    compressing a gas             of    which the temperature                    is   kept in
variable, the amount               of   work      spent     is   exactly proportional to the
quantity       of   heat developed.
   2.    The amount          of   work necessary              to produce           a unit   of    heat in
this manner         is    the same,     whatever       be the        gas operated on, but de
pends upon the temperature, being determined                                  by   the expression
                                            it(I+El)
                                                  K
                          (3.) On     the Specific        Heats       of   Gases.
  Carnot proves, as a theorem, that the excess                                of   the specific heat*
under a constant pressure above the specific heat at a constant vo
lume    is   the same     for all     gases at the same temperature and pressure.
  This result            agrees well with the experimental                      results obtained by
Dulong.
  Carnot's theory affords the following                          determinate expression                 for
the difference alluded to in the enunciation                         :

(4.) Comparison           of  the Relative      Advantages of     the Steam-Engine
                                     and   Air-Engine.
    In the steam-engine, with the expansive principle pushed                      to the
utmost, as Carnot points out, the effective range of temperature,
or the fall utilised, is from the temperature of the boiler to that of
the condenser.           The superior limjj; of temperature is restricted by
the circumstance, that the pressure               of saturated steam is enormously
great for high temperatures             ;  so that   in practice, the temperature in
the boiler is not in any ordinary engines so high as 150° percent., but
is in general very much below this                limit.    Carnot    points out, that
in this respect,       the air-engine has a vast advantage over the steam-
engine    ;  as there is no      limit to the temperature in the hot part, ex
cept such as        the preservation of the materials requires ; and, there
fore, in it an enormously greater portion of the whole fall, from the
temperature of the coals to that of the atmosphere, may be made
use of.       In   other respects,      we have no reason      a  priori for giving     a
preference to one kind of engine above the other.                    We cannot, how
ever,    feel confident that any air-engine               has  yet been constructed,
which is capable of economising the fall actually used, as well as is
done by steam-engines,             with     their  comparatively     limited range of
temperature,         or even that the duty for fuel consumed has in any
actual air-engine exceeded or even come up to the duty performed
by the best steam-engines.

    The following table affords              a synoptic view of the performances
and theoretical duties, in various actual cases.*
    When heat is transmitted                 from a body at 140°,f         through     an

foot-pounds.          This   is the   "  theoretical duty" referred to in the last
column in the table.

5.   Note regarding an Experiment suggested by Professor
       Robison.       By Professor J. D. Forbes.
    In his memoir of Dr Chalmers, lately                    read   to this    Society,    Mr
Ramsay      has   referred       to   an     experiment      which    Dr Chalmers         was
anxious to have performed                 on  the tide-wave in the Bay of Fundy.
The object     was to determine the earth's density by the attraction                      of
the tide-wave on a plummet or spirit-level,                   on the same principle        as

                                            245
Maskelyne's         experiment on Schiehallion,         but with the superior ad
vantages arising from the perfect homogeneity                 of the attracting     mass,
and from the circumstance that all the observations                    might    be made
at a single station.           The experiment might, in short, appear to unite
the   advantages both of Maskelyne's and Cavendish's methods of de
termining the earth's density.
    The suggestion           was  Dr Robison's, and Dr Chalmers had it from
him.       It  is contained in the Elements           of Mechanical Philosophy,
Edit. 1804, page            339, and is given in the following words: — " Per
haps a very sensible effect might be observed                at  Annapolis-Royal in
Nova Scotia, from the vast addition of matter brought on the coast
twice every day by the tides.                 The water      rises   there above 100
feet at spring tide.             If a leaden pipe a few hundred feet long were
laid on the level beach, at right angles with the coast,                   and a glass
pipe     set  upright       at each end,     and the whole rilled with water, the
water     will   rise    at the outer end, and sink at the end next            the land
as the tide rises.            Such an alternate change of level would give the
most satisfactory evidence.             Perhaps the effect might be sensible on          a
very long plummet, or even a nice spirit-level."
     It  is needless to observe that the methods proposed by                Dr Robison
are not the best which            might   be suggested   ;  but that, in consequence
of the extreme simplicity of the observation, considered                   as a purely
astronomical one, a deviation of the direction of gravity of only                        a
very few seconds could be ascertained within small limits of error.*
     I thought       it worth while to make        the calculation      approximately
for an assumed height of the tide-wave.                 Had the result       been at   all
 encouraging        I should     have taken pains to ascertain,        on good autho
rity, the exact         rise  of the tide, and the circumstances of the locality
whence the rise is greatest.
    I have calculated the horizontal          attraction of a semicylinder of water
 100 feet thick, and of about two, four, and eight miles radius upon
a point at the extremity            of the axis of such a semicylinder        ;   because
these     conditions       can   easily be reduced to calculation,          and because
    * The micrometric observation of         a plumb-line,  as in  a zenith sector, would
 be sufficient ; or, as Professor Smyth has suggested      to me, the view   of  the wires
of  a  transit instrument, with a collimating eye-piece, as reflected in a mercury
 trough, — an observation, the accuracy of which may, he states, be brought within
     of a second.
         VOL.     II.                                                         Y

                                        24C
they represent very approximately the circumstances of an attracted
point placed at high water-mark on a vertical sea-wall facing a basin
or estuary.     The radius of     the attracting mass     of water being repre
sented    (more accurately) by       10,000, 20,000, and 40,000 feet,            I
find the influence of a tide-wave 100 feet thick upon a plumb-line to
produce a deviation of only 0-"44 (forty-four hundredths of a second),
0-"50, and 0-"53      ;   the effect  increasing    extremely slowly with the
radius, as might be expected.           If  the tide rose    only fifty feet, the
first effect would be reduced to 0-"246.
    Even the greatest of these calculated deviations affords no ground
for hoping that the method of Robison              could be applied with any
success to determine the earth's density.
    It is rather singular that this ingenious suggestion is not once al
luded to, so far   as   I  am aware, by any     writer   on the figure and den
sity of the earth; yet surely it was as worthy of notice as          Dr Hutton's
proposal to measure the attraction of an Egyptian pyramid.              — (Phil.

     1.   Personal Observations on Terraces, and other proofs of
         Changes in the relative Level of Sea and Land in Scan
         dinavia.       By Robert Chambers, Esq., F.R.S.E., &c.
     In this paper were given descriptions of alluvial formations of              a
terassiform character in the valley of the          Lir river, near Drammen,
in Norway, and of similar objects in valleys near the foot of the
Miosen lake.         The author then described      a remarkable terrace which
runs for fully fourteen miles at one elevation along the upper part
of the valley of the Logan, in the Dovre field.                It is composed on
the     left side of the valley of water-laid sand, and is believed to be
about      2150    feet  above   the level of the sea.     On the Dovre field,
several     hundred feet higher, are morasses containing the remains of
much greater trees than are now growing in that district, the highest
vegetation of which is a dwarf birch ; and Mr Chambers remarks,
that when the terrace was on the sea-level this district would enjoy
a   temperature       fit for  the  production   of  such    large   timber.     Mr
Chambers next described some remarkable                 terraces in the valleys
near Trondhiem,          and particularly   the great terrace of erosion which
overlooks that city at an elevation of 522 feet above the               sea.
     The remainder of the paper was chiefly devoted to an account of
 a' remarkable couple of terraces, which are traceable along the coasts
 of Nordlands        and Finmark, apparently at one level (57 and 143
 feet    above    the sea), excepting in the sounds near Hammerfest ;
 where,      throughout     a space   of twenty-five miles, they       are upon an

                                        248
 inclination.     This portion of the phenomena fell under the attention
of M. Bravais, of the French Scientific Expedition of the North, by
whom they were measured barometrically              and described.       The pre
 sent   observer took measurements of these           inclined terraces by the
 level and staff, in eighteen or twenty places, and thus confirmed the
 views of his predecessor.        By Mr Chambers's observations, the fol
lowing new points are ascertained          :   1. The terraces,      as being    in
clined, form an exceptive case, in contrast with those of a neighbour
 ing district of coast of much larger extent (at least 180 geographical
 miles).     2. The disturbed district has moved on an axis of rest near
Nceverfiord,      where the two terraces are about the normal height.
 3.   A  line, 14° west of north, (being nearly the line of the magnetic
meridian),     being drawn across the disturbed district,         the inclination
is shewn to be equable throughout          equal spaces of that line, which
 is thus proved to be the meridian of the movement.             4. The northern
extremity of the dip of the upper line at Hammerfest                   is   58 feet
below, and the southern extremity,           abreast of the Alten terraces,       is
 96 feet above the axis of rest.
     The author then described visits which       he paid    in September 1849
to two     of the  places  in the Gulf of Bothnia where marks have             been
made in order to        detect the rate  of movement of the land          ;  at the
rock near Lofsgrund he found the sea about six inches below the
mark made sixteen years before by Sir Charles             Lyell   ; while, on the
cliffs of Grasoe, where Flumen made a mark in 1820, the water was
exactly eleven inches lower.
                         His  Grace the Duke   of  Argyll
was duly elected an Ordinary Fellow.

       1.  Note respecting the Dimensions and Refracting Power
             of the Eye.* By Professor J. D. Forbes.
    " Whilst
                 lecturing lately   on the subject   of Vision,   I consulted some
 recent authorities      on the dimensions and curvatures         of the refracting
 apparatus of the eye         ; and having calculated from them the con-

vergence      of rays within the eye, it may save trouble to others to put
them on record.
     " The    measures      of the eye given in almost every English work on
the subject, are those given by           Young     on his own authority,       or that
of Petit.        In  the fifth volume of Dove's Repertorium,           I  find a series
of   measures       collected by Treviranus     from his own and preceding ob
servations, which         I have  converted below from French lines into deci -
mals of an English inch.             In these the curvatures are supposed           sphe
rical.      In    the same work of Dove,       I  find a series   of measures       by Dr
Krause of Hanover,           on eight recent human eyes, which seem to have
 been made with uncommon care, and                 in which the deviation of the
 surfaces from sphericity is noticed.             I  have preferred these last for
the purpose of calculation, because all the measures are taken from
the same eye, which is not the case with the numbers collected by
 Treviranus.          I  have consulted the original paper of Krause in Pog-
 gendorff's Annalen, vols. xxxi. and xxxix.,               where it appears, (1.)
 That     the     cornea is thicker at the sides than in the centre ; (2.)
 The anterior curve of           the cornea is nearly spherical,         the posterior
 parabolic     ;   (3.) The anterior surface of the lens is elliptical, the lesser
 diameter being in the axis of vision, the posterior surface is parabo
 lic  ;
        (4.) The figure of the retina, or the posterior surface of the
 vitreous humour, is an ellipsoid.

vature      of the first         Burface     of the lens              is disproportionately             great in
the last column.                 This arises from the circumstance,                              that it is de
rived by calculation, for the curvature of an ellipse at tho lesser axis,
the two axes of which are alone given by Krause.                                             Now, it         is evi
dent, that         if   we regard the lens as a whole, or even any considerable
breadth of         it,   its mean radius of curvature will be sensibly smaller.
In fact, Krause finds that                  it   may be tolerably represented by a cir
cular curvature, having                a    radius of -329 inches.                      It   occurred to me,
however, that by taking the greatest density of the lens, as given                                               by
Brewster, and the curvature                      of      the     middle part,           both anterior and
posterior, as given               by   Krause,   I        ought to arrive at                 a   close approxi
mation to the course of the axial pencil.

                                                         eye we have seen to be only
 •833 inch,       according to Treviranus,          and -855 according to Krause             ;
consequently, rays of mean refrangibility (to which Brewster's mea
sures refer) converge to a point no less than -227 inch behind the
retina, when the rays fall parallel on the cornea, and -302 when the
object viewed is at 10 inches' distance.                  The axis of the      eye, as even
measured        by  Dr Young, though somewhat greater than                  we have reck
oned    it  above,      (Dr Young       makes     it -91),   does   not come up to the
requisite dimensions          ;   and  Dr Young, with his usual                  acuteness,
ascribes the difference to the gradually                varying density of the strata
or coats of the lens,* the dense small                  nucleus evidently acting as a
lens of comparatively            short focus   ;   and this explanation is probably
the correct one, to which we may add, that the configuration                          of the
coats of equal density, which, near the surface of the lens, are very
elliptical, become,          near its centre, gradually nearly spherical.                On
this account, it is all but impossible                to predict the exact course         of
the rays through a structure             of so much complication.
    " Dr                                    the case with his usual attention and
             Young had considered
penetration.         He investigates the         focus   of  a spherical lens, or lens
with surfaces        which are segments           of spheres, and      whose     density is
variable, and the result may be recalled here as one which, perhaps,
has    not been sufficiently remarked.                " On the whole,''       he says,   " it
is probable that the refractive power                of the human crystalline in its
living     state   is to that      of water nearly as 18 to 17 [gives index
refr.  = 1-415]       ;   that the water imbibed after death from the humour
of the capsule reduces it to the ratio of 21 to 20 [1-403], but that,
on account        of the unequable density of the lens, its effect on the eye
is equivalent to a refraction of 14 to 13 [1-439] for its whole size."f
    " On the whole, these calculations, as well as the considerations
into which       I entered     in a former paper, read to the Society in 18444
on the mechanism of the focal adjustment, have left on my mind the
conviction that the optical and mechanical structure of the organ of
sight    is    even     less  understood than it is commonly believed to be.
Simple       as are      its general arrangements, and comparable, in some
respects,     to those of artificial combinations, we perceive surfaces
figured in a complex manner, and structures                      of varying refractive

density combined in          a   very complicated manner.              Krause's     measures
of the curvature        of the surfaces of the lens confirm the inadmissibi
lity of the all but universal opinion of the variation                       of density of
the crystalline being intended to correct the                   aberration of spherical
surfaces, when, in reality, no such surfaces exist.                     We are quite        un
able to trace the exact course by which the rays of light are focalised
on   the retina,     since    it  depends       on the internal       constitution      of the
lens   that they    do    not meet very far behind it              ; and it still remains
at least doubtful        how the adjustment to distinct vision of objects at
different distances is effected.
    " Finally,    the question of achromatism of the eye has its own diffi
culties.     It  is not now contended that the eye has the power of con
 verging equally rays of different                refrangibilities   ;  but it is not un
 reasonable to suppose that the chromatic aberration is at least par
tially corrected.         One result of the calculations into which                    I have
 entered (which were first in part undertaken at my request, by Mr
 James Clerk Maxwell, and since entirely repeated and extended by
 myself), is a clear exhibition of the physical conditions of perfect
 achromatism in the eye.               The form         is simpler   than    I   have     else
 where seen,      and may at once satisfy any reasonable person of the
 possibility   that the eye might be rendered achromatic,                      at least for
 objects  at a certain         distance     ;   to prove which,        so   much has been
 written, and at      so  great length.            The result may       be stated      in two
 lines.    If we   calculate the effect upon the final focal distance of the
 whole refracting       system of the eye (q"), of a variation                    in the re
 fractive index of each of its three humours                    (denoted    by  /&2, (tt,  ft).
 We find this equation when               the incident rays are parallel,            or reach
 the eye from a very distant object                 : —
                   &q" =    l-579 3ft       +   M50 5ft-2-788          3 ft.
 Let the coefficients        8 ft,   & ft,,   8
                                                ft    denote  the dispersion       or differ
 ences of the indices of refraction for extreme rays, corresponding to
 the three media, then           it is evident, from the negative sign of                   the
 third term   on the     right hand, that they may be             so chosen    as to annihi
 late the second side of the equation, or make the variation of focal
 distances nothing, for the differently                 refrangible rays.
    "  If the   rays proceed from a point 10 inches distant from the eye,
 the equation for the variation of the focus will be
                    oq" = 1-873        a ^ + 1-402 3ft -3-298 a ft,

                                           256
 and the condition which makes this equal to zero, or the focus inde
 pendent of small variation          of the refrangibility of the ray may be
 satisfied, at the same time that the former equation is satisfied also                 ;
 consequently, with three media, as in the eye, we may have perfect
 achromatism for any two distances ; which would also be sensibly
 perfect for the intervening ones.           Of   course by perfect achromatism,
 we here mean a union          of the extreme      red and violet rays    ;  the   irra
 tionality of dispersion      does not concern this question."

         fessor J. D. Forbes.
     The author, after referring to         a communication     made     to this So
 ciety, on the 18th March 1839,              on this subject, and noticed        in the
 "  Proceedings"       of that  date, stated, that being about to recommence
 his observations on         radiant heat, so long and unavoidably                inter
rupted, he had carefully examined               the unpublished     observations on
 which the previous notice was founded, with a view to ascertain what
 might be the numerical discrepancy which they present from Fresnel's
 Theoretical     Law.      The variation      in the results of experiment            for
each    of the angles      was very considerable,       arising from    a multitude
of   causes as yet imperfectly estimated, but which appear to have been
encountered by other observers, who, since that time, have undertaken
the same research.          Under the circumstances, the mean of the whole
 observations made between November                 1838 and March 1839, have
 been taken for each angle          of incidence     ; and the results being pro
jected in the usual manner, the angles of incidence forming the line
 of abscissas, and the intensities the ordinates, an interpolating                curve
 was drawn through the whole.              The numbers thus obtained (which
are presented as only a          rude first approximation), are shewn in the
 following table, and compared with Fresnel's Formula, calculated for
 an index of refraction       of 1-50.

   The results of experiment are generally in excess.             This may be
due to the impossibility of obtaining rays of heat quite parallel from
terrestrial sources.    To avoid this and other difficulties, experiments
have recently been    made in Germany by M. Knoblauch, and in Paris
by  MM. Provostaye and Depains.              The results of the last named
observers    are very conclusive   in favour of the accuracy of Fresnel's
law.    Their memoir had not      reached     the author of this paper until
his calculations were almost completed.
3. On     the solution     of certain       Differential Equations.          By
        Professor Kelland.
    Until recently, general solutions of several         classes of equations,
such as that which occurs in the theory of the figure of the earth,
could not be arrived at.       An ingenious transformation lately ren
dered it a matter of comparative ease to arrive at a solution of these
equations in those forms in which they are presented in the solution
of physical problems ; but still much remains to be done.               The ob
ject of the present paper is to supply some portion of the deficiency
 in this respect, by the introduction of a new transformation, and the
adoption of the function    r. The solutions thus obtained         are perfectly
general, and are arrived at with the greatest facility.

   Sir THOMAS M. BRISBANE, President, in the Chair.
   The following Communications                were read      : —
1, On the      Muscular Substance of the Tongue.                   ByMrZaglus.
       Communicated by Professor Goodsir.
   Professor Goodsir communicated an abstract of a paper by              Mr  Zaglus
on the muscular structure of the tongue.              The author of the paper
had found the muscular substance of the tongue to consist of a cortical

                                        259
layer, which    surrounds     the   organ on all sides, except its posterior
attachment, and in the middle line of its inferior surface.
    The cortex consists of    a complicated network of fibres, derived from
the hyoglossi,    styloglossi, lingualis, chondroglossi, and a pair of new
 muscles,  named by the author Notoglossi.         The minute details of the
 arrangement     of these     muscles have     now been    ascertained by the
 author, and their actions in producing the peculiar          volubility of the
 organ.
    The cavity of the cortex      is occupied by a medulla of transverse and
 perpendicular muscles,      some   of which are limited to the cavity itself ;
 others pass into it from without.
    The transverse system        consists of transversales   proprii, with the
 palatoglossi and glossopharyngei,         the perpendicular   of external or
 proper, perpendicular      muscles,   and internal or geneoglossi.
    The transverse and perpendicular           muscles  are arranged in the
 medulla, in transversely parallel laminae, which consist alternately of
 perpendicular and transverse systems, which pass through the muscles
 of the cortex to the mucous membrane.
     It was also   stated,  that the human tongue and the ruminant form
 two types, the latter presenting root, body, and tip, the former want
 ing the tip.    These two types, also, differ in the former possessing,
 and the latter wanting, a mesial fibro-cartilaginous septum.
    2. On the     Volcanic Formations of the Alban Hills, near
         Rome.      By Professor J. D. Forbes.
     The author thus     sums up the general results     of his memoir    : —
     " In the first place, it
                                appears that the Alban volcano (for it is
 essentially one) has acted throughout a great period of time ; for
 not only has it evidently repeatedly changed its form and materials of
 eruption, but it is surrounded by knolls of basaltic formations which
  seem to indicate very ancient        and very repeated ejections, without
  taking  the regular      form    of craters.   Such   are  probably   Monte
  Algido, Civita Lavinia, Monte Giove (Corioli), the Capuccini of
  Albano, Rocca Priore, Colonna, and perhaps even Capo di Bove, and
  several open craters, such as one a little below Albano, the Lago
  Cornufelle near Fiascati, the Lake of Gabii, and one near Colonna,

                                        260
 which, on the authority        of Ponzi, appear to have ejected peperino.
 The horse-shoe form of the old crater of the Alban Mount, which,
whether formed by the elevation process or not, appears to be com
posed of beds      of basalt, lapilli, tuff, or peperino, and here and there
of the lava called Sperone, gave way, like that of Somma, on the
 western or seaward side, and           I  cannot but think it in no small de
gree probable,      that the vast lava beds which lie under Nemi and
 Genzano, and which dip at a small angle under               Monte     Cavo, are
part of the dislocated walls of the ancient crater             displaced by the
convulsion which rent it on the western side, and which was accom
panied by a prodigious           fluid discharge of peperino, which then
 formed the strata of La Riccia and Albano, and which, overwhelm
ing the broken-down wall of the ancient crater, formed at the same
time the Monte Gentile, and the peperino beds above                Nemi.    This
is confirmed by the prodigious lava blocks imbedded              in these rocks,
which bespeak the violence of the convulsion during which they were
formed.     Ages later, the present summit of Monte Cavo and the crater
of the Campo d' Annibale were formed, and the latter gave out its cur
rents of tefrine or grey basalt, and raised the crater of La Tartaruga
and others in the valley of La Molara, and in the central crater; at the
same time ejecting great volumes          of pulverulent lapilli.   It may have
been coeval with these        perfectly regular and comparatively        modern
eruptions, or it may have preceded them, that, after a period so long
 that the surface of the ancient eruptions         of peperino were covered
 with vegetation and timber, the tremendous outbursts which forced
 open the craters of Albano and Nemi took place, the former pro
 ducing some slight ejections of peperino or boiling           mud, near Castel
 Gaudolfo    ;  and at the same time a separate orifice, opening at the foot
 of Monte Cavo, may have discharged into the valley of Marino the
 remarkable variety of peperino described in this paper, and containing
 vegetable    stems.     A  long, perhaps even a final, repose succeeded this
 paroxysm.        Even from the very dawn of Italian history these scenes
 of previous turmoil and desolation appear           to have enjoyed profound
 tranquillity, and     to have been immemorially       covered  with impenetra
 ble groves sacred to the sports of Diana.
     " It will   be seen, then, that we admit tufas or peperinos         of three
  very different periods, one of which is coeval with, or even anterior to,
  the formation of the exterior cone, another largely developed,           which

                                       261
accompanied     the great breach in it towards         the sea;     and a third,
which probably     produced some local streams, such as that of Marino,
which has evidently flowed since the ground took its present con
figuration, and was covered with plants.           Of lavas, likewise,    we must
admit at least three periods      ;  1st,  the compact basalts of       the  outer
circuit, which,   if Von   Buch's theory be correct, have flowed under a
less inclination  than they at present have        ;  Idly, The      well-marked
leucitic,   or partridge-eyed lavas, which form the interior circuit ;
and, 3dly, the compact basaltic lava which flows past Rocca di Papa
towards Grotta Ferrata, which is possibly coeval with the dikes oc
curring at Capo di Bove and elsewhere.               This   leaves  the origin of
the  lava sperone still uncertain.        It is undoubtedly one of the more
recent products, for it not only overlies the whole of the old basaltic
series at Tusculum      and Nemi, but the leucitic lavas of the newer cone
at Rocca    di Papa.     The   easiest solution would be to consider        it as a
 scoriform basalt   ; but even to this there are difficulties, not only mine-
 ralogical, but from position.        For how can      we connect     the mantle-
shaped covering of     Monte Cavo     up to its highest point,     with the basalt,
 which nowhere attains a height (so far as              I  know) within several
hundred feet of it ? It is still more difficult to conceive any contin
 uity between the sperone of the central cone and that of Tusculum,
 which is separated from it by the great valley of            La Molara.

                     Monday, January 21, 1850.
              Dr CHRISTISON, V.P., in the Chair.
    The following Communications         were read    : —
     1.  On the Gamhoge Tree of Siam.          By Dr Christison.
    Although Gamboge     has been known    in European      commerce for
 nearly two centuries and a half, and its applications in the arts have
 been extended in recent times,   the tree which     produces   it  is still
 unknown to botanists.
    The late Dr Graham, in 1836, was the first to describe accurately
a  species of Garcinia, which inhabits Ceylon, and which is well
known there to produce a sort of Gamboge, not, however, known in
the commerce of Europe.      Besting  on a peculiarity   in the structure
of the anthers, which are circumscissile, or open transversely by the
separation of a lid on the summit, he constituted a new genus for
this plant, and called it Hebrademdron cambogioides.         At the same
period the Author examined the properties      of this Gamboge, and
found that it possesses the purgative action of the commercial drug
in full intensity, and that the two kinds agree    closely also,   though
not absolutely, in chemical constitution.
   At an earlier period Dr Roxburgh described, in his " Flora In-
dica," another species of Garcinia, under the name of Garcinia pic-
toria, which inhabits the hills of Western Mysore, and which           also
   VOL. II.                                                2 A

                                          264
was thought to produce a sort            of Gamboge of inferior quality.            In
1847 specimens        of the tree and its exudation were obtained near
Nuggur on      the ghauts of Mysore by Dr Hugh Cleghorn of the East
India Company's service          ;   and the author, on examining the Gam
boge,    found it     all but identical with that           of Ceylon      in physio
logical action, in properties          as   a pigment,       and in chemical con
stitution.     The    same plant, with its Gamboge, was             about the same
time observed       by the Rev.       F.  Mason, near Mergui in Tavoy,            one
of the   ceded Burmese provinces.
    A third   species,     inhabiting the province of Tavoy, and             also pro
ducing a kind of Gamboge, was                  identified by    Dr Wight in 1840
with Dr Wallich's Garcinia elliptica, from Sylhet, on the north-east
frontier of Bengal.          Its exudation was long thought to be of low
quality.     But, although this substance has not yet been examined
chemically, it has been stated by Mr Mason to be, in his opinion,
quite undistinguishable         as a pigment from Siam Gamboge.
    It is a matter     of doubt whether Graham's character is sufficiently
diagnostic to be a good generic distinction.                  But it was shewn by
Dr Wight in 1840, that             a well characterised section       at least of the
genus Garcinia       consists   of  species which have
                                                             " sessile anthers, flat
tened above, circumscissile, and one-celled                 and that all these spe
cies, and no others, appear to exude a gum-resin                 differing   probably
very little from commercial Gamboge.
    Still the   tree which produces         Siam Gamboge, the finest and only
commercial kind,        continues unknown.            A  strong presumption how
ever arose, that the last species was              the Siam tree, as it grows in
the same latitude with the Gamboge district of Siam, and not above
 200 miles farther       west.     But   if  the information     recently communi
 cated   to  the    author     be   correct, the     Siam    tree is    a fourth   dis
 tinct species     of the same section.           In  December last he received
 from  Mr   Robert Little, surgeon at Singapore, specimens                 taken from
 two trees which were cultivated there by               Dr Almeida, a resident of
 the colony, and which were obtained by                 him " direct from Siam"
 as the- Gamboge        tree of that country.           These specimens are not
 such as to allow      of   a complete description        ; yet they are sufficient
 to shew that the plant presents the characters               of Wight's Gamboge-
 bearing section of the genus Garcinia             ; but that it is not any of the
 species hitherto so      fully described     as to admit    of comparison with it.
 The fruit is round, not grooved, crowned by a four-lobed knotty stigma,

                                         265
 and   surrounded     hy numerous sessile       or subsessile   aborted anthers,
 and by a persistent calyx of four ventricose fleshy sepals.              The male
 flowers consist of a calyx of the same structure, a corolla of four ven
 tricose fleshy petals, and a club-shaped mass of about forty subsessile
 anthers, closely appressed,        connected   only at the mere         base, one-
 celled, flattened at the top, and opening by a circular lid along a line
 of lateral   depressions    ; and there is no appearance of an aborted
 ovary amidst them.         These are the characters of the three species
 presently    known.     These    three species    very closely resemble one
 another in general appearance and special characters.                    The new
 species   presents the same       close  resemblance to them all         ; and, in
 particular, its foliage is undistinguishable from that of Garcinia ellip-
 tica, the leaves    being elliptic, acuminate, and leathery,            exactly as
 described and delineated by Wight.            But it differs from them all in
 the male flowers and      fruit being peduncled.        The male flowers        are
 fascicled, and have      a slender    peduncle three-tenths      of an inch in
 length.    The single young fruit attached to       one of the specimens     has  a
 thick fleshy peduncle, like an elongated receptacle, half as long as the
 male peduncle.        All  the other species hitherto     described have both
 male and female flowers sessile           or subsessile.    As this difference
 cannot arise from a mere        variation   in  the   same   species,   the plant
 must be a new one.         The  evidence    however that it produces Gam
 boge, and more especially the commercial Gamboge of Siam,                   is not
 yet complete   ; and, until further information on this point be obtained,
 which the author expects to receive in the course of the year, it ap
 pears advisable not to attach to it a specific name.                  A   question
may    even   arise whether     the male flowers and the fruit here de
scribed may not belong to two species instead of one            ; but this is far
from probable.
2.    Notice respecting a Deposit of Shells near Borrowstoun-
                   ness. By Charles Maclaren, Esq.
    This deposit of shells is situated about          a mile   and a half west
from Borrowstounness,         where the Carse of      Falkirk terminates in        a
strip of flat land    a furlong in breadth.       The shells are       exposed    in
two openings, each about 300 feet long, made in the soil to procure
limestone for     Mr Wilson's    iron- works.     The    bed  can be traced in
these    openings    along lines having an        aggregate length of         1000
feet.    Over all that space the shells form an unbroken               stratum    of

                                                266
very uniform depth (nearly three inches), and almost perfectly ho
rizontal.        They are         covered     by a bed of dark-brown                      sandy clay,
from two to three feet thick, and rest on a deposit of the same sub
stance,     which closely resembles              the mud spread over the present
beach.         The shells are all of one species,                     the cockle, or Cardium
edule, and of various sizes down                   to the most minute.                     They are
mixed with a portion of the clay which covers them, but lie so                                   com^
pactly, that they present to the eye the appearance of a layer of
chalk nodules.   Very few of them are fractured, and the two valves
are generally united.                 The   openings       reach within 12 or 15 yards
of the high-water          line   ;    but the number of broken shells seen on the
beach shews that the bed had once extended                             farther northward, and
that part of it has been cut away by the sea.                           The       bed is at present
about the level of high water, or a little above   while the natural        it,
abode of the cockle, according to Mr Broderip,   from the low-water     is
line to  depth of 18 fathoms.
           a                      The continuity of the bed, its re
gular level, its remarkable uniformity,                     its composition confined to a
single species, and the state of the shells, which are generally entire,
and have the two valves united, shew that they are in their native
locality, and prove that they could only have been brought to their
present position by an upheaval of the land.                               This upheaval must
have been to the extent at least of 18 feet,                                which    is   the differ
ence      betwixt   high     and low water,                but    very probably           it   was    to
the extent of 20, 30, or 40 feet.                      Inundations           of the     sea, caused
by storms, have been                  called in to account             for such deposits,            but
in my opinion         very inconsiderately.                 That       a    sudden      and violent
movement of the sea should sweep away a bed of shells from its ori
ginal locality,     is   intelligible        enough    ;    but that, while             transporting
them over some hundred feet or yards,                       it   should preserve           them un
broken, with the valves                still united, — that the rushing water, in-
stead     of ploughing     up the dry land             it   invaded,        should smooth            and
level an area of more than an acre, then spread out the shells upon
it   with mathematical            regularity,      in an uninterrupted                    stratum     of
nearly uniform depth, —that, finally,                      it    should cover them with a
bed    of clay two or three            feet thick, and then withdraw                ;— these    seem
to me to be effects utterly irreconcileable with                        the       known agency of
floods.   I    would as soon believe that the West India hurricane, instead
of levelling the planter's house, transports   en masse, with its walls,
                                                                 it
roof, and  furniture all entire, from one end of   field to the other.  a

 4.    The Effect of Pressure in Lowering the Freezing- Point
      of Water experimentally demonstrated.    By Professor
      W.   Thomson, Glasgow.
    On the 2d of January 1849, a communication, entitled "Theo
 retical Considerations on the Effect of Pressure in Lowering the
 Freezing- Point of Water, by James Thomson, Esq., of Glasgow,"
 was laid before the Royal Society, and it has since been
                                                          published
 in the Transactions, Vol. XVI., Part V.      In that paper it was
 demonstrated that,         if the
                         fundamental axiom of Carnot's Theory of
 the Motive Power of Heat be admitted, it follows, as a rigorous con
 sequence,    that the temperature                    at which ice melts will be lowered
 by the application         of pressure           ;   and the extent of this effect due to
a given amount of pressure was deduced by a reasoning analogous to
that of Oarnot from Regnault's experimental determination of the
latent heat, and the pressure of saturated aqueous vapour at various
temperatures differing very little from the ordinary freezing-point
of water.      Reducing          to Fahrenheit's             scale   the final result of the
paper, we find
                                     *   =   n        x 0-0135   ;
where t denotes the depression in the temperature of melting ice pro
duced by the addition of n " atmospheres-" (or n times the pressure
due to     29-922       inches   of mercury),             to the     ordinary pressure   expe
rienced from the atmosphere.
    In   this very remarkable                speculation, an entirely novel physical
phenomenon was predicted           in anticipation of any direct experiments
on the subject      ;   and the actual observation of the phenomenon was
pointed out as a highly interesting object for experimental research.
  To test the phenomenon by experiment without applying excessively
great pressure, a very sensitive thermometer would be required, since
for ten atmospheres the effect expected is little more than the tenth
part of a Fahrenheit degree                   ;        employed, if
                                                      and the thermometer
founded on the expansion of a liquid in a glass bulb and tube, must
be protected from the pressure of the liquid, which, if acting on                           it,
                                                                          2
                                                                          a    2

                                        268
would produce a deformation, or at least a compression of the glas
that would materially affect the indications.              For a thermometer
of extreme sensibility,         mercury does     not appear to be a conve
nient liquid    ;  since,    if  a  very fine tube be employed, there             is
some uncertainty       in the indications on account of the irregularity         of
capillary action, due probably         to superficial   impurities,   and observ
able even when the best mercury that can              be prepared is made use
of  ; and again,    if  a very large bulb be employed, the weight of the
mercury causes       a deformation      which   will produce a very marked
difference in the position of the head          of the column in the tube ac
cording    to the manner         in which the glass is supported, and may
therefore affect with uncertainty the indications of the instrument.
 The former objection does not apply to the use of any fluid which
perfectly wets     the glass ; and the last-mentioned source of uncer
 tainty will be much less for any lighter liquid than mercury, of equal
 or greater expansibility       by heat.    Now the coefficient of expansion
 of sulphuric     ether, at 0°      C,  being, according to M. I. Pierre,*
 •00151, is eight or nine times that of mercury (which is -000179,
 according to Begnault) ; and its density is about the twentieth part
 of the density     of mercury.       Hence a thermometer of much higher
 sensibility may be constructed with ether than with mercury, without
 experiencing inconvenience from the circumstances which                 have been
 alluded to.      An ether thermometer        was   accordingly constructed by
 Mr Robert Mansell of Glasgow, for the experiment which                      I pro
 posed to make.         The bulb of this instrument        is nearly cylindrical,
 and is about 3£ inches long and § th of an inch in diameter.                  The
 tube has a cylindrical bore about 6J inches long               : about      inches
 of the tube are divided into 220 equal parts.               The thermometer       is
  entirely enclosed, and hermetically sealed in          a   glass tube, which     is
 just large enough to admit it freely.           On comparing the indications
  of this instrument with those of a thermometer of Crichton's with
  an ivory scale, which has divisions, corresponding to degrees            Fahren
  heit, of about 5*yth of an inch each        ;  I found that the range of the
  ether thermometer         is  about 3° Fahrenheit      ;   and that there are
  about 212 divisions on the tube corresponding                to the   interval   of
  pressure from 31° to 34°, as nearly as            I  could discover from such
  an unsatisfactory      standard of reference.       This gives    ^  of  a degree-
                              * See Dixon on Heat, p. 72.

for the mean value of             a division.     From   a  rough calibration of the
tube which was made,            I am    convinced that the values of the divisions
at   no part of the tube differ            by more than       ^th of    this   amount,
from the true        mean    value   ;  and, taking into account all the sources
of uncertainty,       I think it probable that         each   of the divisions    on the
tube of the ether thermometer corresponds to something between                        ^
and   T\ of   a degree      Fahrenheit.
    With this thermometer in its glass envelope, and with                      a  strong
glass cylinder        (CErsted's apparatus for the compression of water),
 an experiment was made in the following manner : —
    The compression         vessel was      partly filled with pieces of clean ice,
and water      :   a glass tube about a foot long          and   y^th of an inch in
ternal   diameter, closed at one end, was inserted                with   its open end
 downwards, to indicate the fluid pressure by the compression of the
 air which it contained         :  and the ether thermometer was let down and
 allowed to rest with the lower end of its glass envelope                  pressing on
 the bottom of the vessel.             A  lead  ring   was let down     so as to    keep
 free from       ice  the water       in the compression cylinder round that
 part of the thermometer tube where readings were expected.                        More
 ice was added       above, so that       both above and below       the clear space,
 which    was     only about two inches deep,            the compression cylinder
 was  full of   pieces   of  ice.    Water     was then poured     in by   a tube with
 a stopcock   fitted in the neck of the vessel,          till the  vessel was    full up
 to the piston, after which the stopcock             was shut.
    After it     was observed that         the column of ether in the thermo
 meter stood at about 67°, with reference to the divisions on the tube,
a pressure of from          12 to 15 atmospheres was applied,               by forcing
 the piston down with the screw.               Immediately     the column of ether
 descended very rapidly,          and in a very few minutes it was below            61°.
 Tho pressure was then suddenly removed, and immediately the
column in the thermometer began to rise rapidly.                       Several times
pressure was again suddenly applied, and again suddenly removed,
and the effects upon the thermometer were most marked.
    The fact that the freezing-point            of water   is sensibly lowered by a
 few atmospheres of pressure, was thus established beyond                   all doubt.
After that,       I attempted,     in a more deliberate experiment, to deter
 mine as accurately as my means of observation allowed me to do,
the actual extent to which the temperature of freezing is affected by
 determinate applications of pressure.

    obtained, without entering at all upon the details of the experiment.
       I   found that a pressure of,                 as    nearly    as    I   have been able to esti

                   atmospheres   produced a depression measured by 7i
    divisions of the tube, on the column of ether in the thermometer                                               ;
    and again, a pressure              of 16-8 atmospheres produced                      a    thermometric

    in the latter.
      Let    us compare these results with theory.            According to the con
 clusions arrived at              by   my brother in the paper referred to above, the
 lowering of the freezing-point                      of water by 8-1                atmospheres       of    pres
 sure would be 8-1                x-0135,        or -109°       F.   ;    and the lowering of the
 freezing-point              by   16-8      atmospheres          would          be     16-8 x -0135,             or
 •227°      F.      Hence,        we have the following                  highly satisfactory           compa

     It    was,
              I     confess,      with      some surprise, that, after having completed
the observations under an impression that they presented                                           great dis
crepancies from the theoretical expectations,                       I      found the numbers           I    had
noted down indicated in reality an                          agreement           so    remarkably close,
that I                          in some degree to chance, when
            could not but attribute              it                                                          I
reflected on the very rude manner in which the quantitative parts of
the experiment (especially the measurement of the pressure, and the
evaluation of the division of the ether thermometer)                                     had        been con
ducted.
I      hope,       before long, to have               a    thermometer constructed, which
shall be at least three times as sensitive                          as    the ether thermometer
I   have used hitherto            ;   andI      expect with          it    to be able to perceive
the effect of increasing or diminishing the pressure by less than an
atmosphere, in lowering or elevating the freezing-point                                    of      water.

                                         271
    If a convenient minimum thermometer could be constructed, the
effects  of very great pressures might easily         be tested by hermetically
sealing the thermometer in a strong glass, or in a metal tube, and
putting   it into a  mixture of     ice and water,     in a strong   metal vessel,
in which an enormous pressure might                be  produced    by the forcing
pump of a Bramah's         press.
    In   conclusion,  it may    be remarked,       that the same theory which
pointed out the remarkable effect of pressure on the freezing-point             of
water, now established by experiment,            indicates that a corresponding
effect may be expected for       all liquids which expand in freezing     ; that a
 reverse effect, or an elevation of the freezing-point          by an increase  of
pressure, may be expected for all liquids which contract in freezing               ;
and that the extent of the effect to be expected may, in every case,
be deduced from      Regnault's observations on vapour (provided that
the freezing-point is within the temperature-limits               of his observa
tions), if the latent heat of a cubic foot of the liquid, and the altera
tion of its volume in freezing be known.
 5. On the     Extinction of Light in the Atmosphere.                     By W.
        S. Jacob, Esq., H.E.I.C. Astronomer, Madras.                        Com
        municated by Prof. C. Piazzi Smyth.
    In  a letter dated Madras, November             1849, Captain Jacob says,
"  I have   been much interested        in reading, lately, Professor Forbes's
paper in the Philosophical Transactions, 1842, Part 2, on the Ex
tinction of Light and Heat in the Atmosphere."                    As his results
agree very closely with those of my experience on the Trigonome
trical Survey of India, and which, though not founded on any pre
cise measures, being still the conclusions of some years' experience,
are perhaps worth noticing, particularly when they agree with the
results of more exact measures.
     On commencing work with heliotropes in 1837,              I  soon found that
for long distances      it was    necessary to enlarge the apertures more
than in the simple ratio        of the     distance (though     such was Colonel
 Everest's practice)    ;  and before the end of the first season,          I had
 formed a scale of apertures for corresponding distances, which after
 wards needed     very little alteration,       but when finally corrected by
 subsequent years' observation, stood as follows          : —

                                        272
                 Aperture.      Maximum Distance.      Maximum Distance
                  Inches.             Miles.           without Absorption.
                    0-5                 15                       15
                    10                  23                       30
                    2-0                 33                       60
                    40                  45                     120
                    8-0                 60                     240
    Our heliotropes      were  circular glass mirrors, 8 inches in diameter          ;
and for the smaller apertures, diaphragms were used                     between   the
 heliotropes and the observer.         At the    distances    stated  the light was
just visible    to the naked eye in clear weather, and when seen over a
 valley :   if the ray grazed near the surface, the light            was    much re
duced.       On   one   occasion  I employed a heliotrope         at 6J    miles, and
 used an aperture of £ of an inch, and found              it rather brighter than
usual,   so  that probably 6^ or 7 miles would be the normal                 distance
for that size.
    This   agrees well enough with the rest of the scale, but there is no
need to employ a conjectural quantity           ;   and  if the rate of absorption
corresponding to the above be computed,              so close an    agreement will
be found, as may entitle the numbers to be looked on as something
better than mere estimates, — as the results, indeed, of                a species  of
observation.
    The mean of the whole sljews a loss of -0610               in passing through
one mile      of atmosphere     ; with the barometer at 27-0 inches (that
being about the average height of my stations), but reduced to 30'0
inches, the quantity will be -0671.
    Hence the loss of light in passing from the zenith through a homo
geneous atmosphere of 5-2 miles will be -303, or only about one per
cent, less than Professor Forbes's result.             And    as my    air  was  con
siderably drier than his (the mean humidity being not much above
•30 instead of -56), this will probably account for the difference;
and, at any rate, the agreement is much closer than could have been
expected.
    I once     mentioned this matter to Captain Waugh,                  the present
Surveyor-General         of India, then my fellow-assistant          ;   but he not
only had not noticed the thing, but did not even apprehend my mean
ing.    He     assented    to my remark      on the loss      of light in passing
through the atmosphere, but asserted that the aperture should vary
as the distance, thus allowing for no loss        !  0-l inch per mile answered,

                                          273
he said, for    all distances that     he had tried    ! So it might answer for
the distances       most usually occurring        on the   Survey   ; for 4 inches
would be       proper for 40 miles, and 2 inches not much too bright
at 20, and     it is not   often that these    limits would   be passed.     Yet it
is  hardly possible      to conceive    that he should not have noticed the
different intensity of the lights ; had not his opportunities been per
haps rather unfavourable, as his work lay chiefly in plains, where,
as mentioned        above, the     light of  a   grazing   ray is very much re
duced, and the atmospheric effect would therefore be mixed                 up with
disturbing local causes.
    I myself was much astonished at first discovering that the air had
so  great absorbent powers, and many ideas                 are suggested by the
fact.  We     see at once     how easily many of the planets may be ren
dered habitable to beings like ourselves.               Mars, e.g., may enjoy      a
 temperature      little inferior to our own, by having a less absorbent
 envelope   ;  and Venus may be kept as cool as we are, by having
 one more so.

1.  Abstract of a Paper on the Hypothesis of Molecular Vor
      tices, and its Application to the Mechanical Theory of
      Heat.     By William John Macquorn Rankine, Civil
      Engineer, F.R.S.E., F.R.S.S.A., &c.
   The object of this paper is to shew how the laws of the phenomena
of Elasticity and Expansion,     as connected with      heat,    may be re
duced to mechanical principles    by means    of an hypothesis called that
of Molecular Vortices.
   The author ascribes the first distinct statement of an hypothesis
of this kind to Sir Humphrey Davy, and refers to Mr Joule as hav
ing supported it  ; but he states that its consequences,       to the best of
his knowledge, have not hitherto      been   developed     by means    of the
principles of Analytical Mechanics.
   The author   has endeavoured    to do this, so far as the present state
of experimental knowledge enables him, introducing           such modifica
tions into the hypothesis as are necessary     in order   to connect  it with
the undulatory theory of radiation.      His  researches were commenced
in 1842, but were laid aside for nearly seven years from the want
of experimental data, which, however, have at length been to a great
extent supplied, so far as gaseous bodies are concerned, by the ex-

periments of         M. Regnault.           The author        has       thus been enabled         to
resume his investigations, and has obtained formulae,                          agreeing with
experiment, and applicable                 to practice, for the expansion and elas
ticity   of    gases,     —the    of vapours in contact with their
                                    elasticity
liquids, — the specific heat of gases, — tho heat produced by their
compression, — the latent and total heat of evaporation, — the expan
          of vapours, — the power of the steam-engine, — and the
sive action
mechanical value of heat in general.
   One of the most useful in practice of those formulae,                      — that   for cal
culating the elasticity of steam                  and other vapours in contact with
their    liquids,   — was       published        separately    in the Edinburgh New
Philosophical         Journal for       July     1849,    with tables and a diagram,
shewing its agreement with experiment, but without any account of
the reasoning from which it is deduced.
   The theory of radiant heat, like that of light, having been re
duced to a branch of mechanics- by means of the hypothesis of undu
lations, it is the object           of the hypothesis         of Molecular       Vortices         to
reduce the theoryof stationary heat also to a branch of mechanics,
and thus to make a further step towards the fulfilment of the wish
of Newton, — " Utinam cetera naturae phenomena ex prin-
CIPIIS MECHANICIS DERIVARE LICERET."
   The hypothesis of molecular vortices                     is defined to be that which
assumes, that each atom               of   matter consists      of      a nucleus or central
point, enveloped          by an elastic atmosphere,            which is retained           in its
position      by   attractive forces,        and that         the   elasticity due to heat
arises   from      the    centrifugal force of          those atmospheres, revolving              or
oscillating about their nuclei or central points.                          According       to   this
hypothesis, quantity           of   heat is the vis viva       of   the molecular      revolu
tions or oscillations.
   The author, for the present,                  leaves   indeterminate        the following
questions, as he has not as yet found it necessary to make any definite
supposition respecting them.
   First, Whether the elastic molecular atmospheres are continuous,
or consist of discrete particles ]This includes the question, Whether
expansive elasticity is wholly the result of the mutual repulsions of
particles, or    to is,
                      certain extent,
                           a            primary quality of matter?
                                                    a
  Secondly, Whether,                at the centre of each               atom, there   is   a    real
nucleus or extremely small central body, or                         a   mere centre    of con
 densation and force        ?

    Tldrdly, What     are the figures  of the orbits  described   by the par
ticles of the atomic atmospheres in their revolutions or oscillations           ?
    The author introduces into the hypothesis of molecular vortices a
supposition peculiar to his own researches,       for the purposo of con
necting it with the undulatory hypothesis as to radiation.          It is  this   :
That   the  vibration which, according to the undulatory hypothesis,
constitutes radiant light and heat, is a motion of the atomic nuclei
or centres, and is propagated by means of their mutual attractions
and repulsions.      The absorption of light and of radiant heat, accord
ing  to  this supposition, is the transference of motion from the nuclei
or centres to their atmospheres, and the emission of light and ra
diant heat, the transference of motion from the atmospheres to the
nuclei or centres.      The author enumerates several      advantages     which
he conceives    that this hypothesis possesses over the common supposi
tion of a luminiferous ether pervading the spaces between ponderable
particles.
    The present paper refers solely to the condition of bodies in the
state of gas or vapour.       It is divided into two parts, the first of
which treats of the Statical Relations        of Heat and Elasticity, or
their relations when both are invariable      ;  and the second,      of their
Dynamical Relations, which take place when gaseous bodies expand
or contract, and involve the principles of the mutual conversion of
heat and expansive       power, and those    of the latent heat of expan
sion and evaporation.
    The first  section  of the first part explains   the general principles
of the hypothesis, of which a summary has just been given.
    The second section contains the mathematical investigation of the
general    equation between      the  heat and the elasticity       of   a   gas.
 The total elasticity     is divided   into two parts,    —   the  superficial
atomic elasticity, being the elasticity of the atomic atmospheres at the
 bounding surfaces     of the atoms, which is always expansive, and a
 function   of density and heat, and an elasticity arising from the
 mutual forces exerted by separate atoms, which may be expansive
 or contractive, and in the perfectly fluid state      is a function    of   den
 sity only.
    The more substances are rarefied, that is to say, the more the
 forces which interfere with the operation of the elasticity of the
 atomic atmospheres are weakened, the more nearly do they approach
 to a condition called that of perfect gas, in which the total elasticity

                                        278
  at a given temperature, is simply proportional           to the density.       This
  is therefore assumed to be the law of the elasticity of the atomic at
  mosphere of any given substance            ;  so   that the superficial atomic
  elasticity is held     to be proportional      to the density      of the atomic
  atmosphere, at its bounding surface.
      It  is shewn, that although the form of such bounding surfaces                in
  a perfect fluid is a rhombic dodecahedron, it may be treated without
  sensible error, in calculation, as    if it  were spherical,      and   the atmo
 sphere     of  each atom may be conceived        to be composed       of concentric
  spherical     layers,  the density   being uniform        for each     layer,   but
  varying for different layers.
      An oscillatory movement is      supposed     to be propagated from the
 nucleus or atomic centre in an inappreciably short time, to every
 part of the atmosphere, so that the mean velocity of movement is
 uniform      throughout.     The quantity of heat in one atom, or any
 other mass      of matter, is expressed in terms of the force of gravity,
 by the weight of that mass, multiplied by the height through which
 it must fall at the earth's surface, in order         to acquire that velocity.
 This oscillatory movement        is conceived to be resolved into two com
ponents, one in the direction of radii passing through the atomic centre,
the other performed in spherical surfaces described round that centre.
 The latter component alone produces centrifugal                  force ; and    it is
afterwards shewn to be probable, that the ratio which the vis viva of
this latter component bears to the whole vis viva of the oscillations,
depends      on the chemical constitution      of the substance.        The centri
fugal force thus arising, has a tendency to increase the superficial
density and elasticity of the atomic atmosphere, and must, at each
layer of that atmosphere, be in equilibrio with the forces arising from
the elastic pressure of the adjacent layers,           and from the attraction
towards the nucleus or centre.           The condition of this equilibrium
is expressed      by a differential equation, which at the same time shews
it  to be stable.       By the integration of that equation, there is ob
tained a     general expression for the elasticity of a gas, in terms of
its density and heat.
     The first    and largest term is simply proportional        to the density of
the gas, multiplied by a function, which varies as a certain fraction
of the heat increased by a constant.                In  a perfect gas, this term
constitutes the whole elasticity.
     It  is followed by an approximative        converging     series,   chiefly ne

                                                  279
gative, in terms of the reciprocals of tho powers of the function                                     of
the heat before mentioned, representing the effect                               of the actions of
the nuclei or centres in modifying                       the superficial-atomic           elasticity.
The numerators                 of the terms of this             series     are    functions of the
density, diminishing along with                    it,   and requiring           to be determined
 by   experiment.
  The last term of the expression represents the effect of the
mutual action of separate atoms, and function of the density, to
                                                           is
                                                           a
be determined             by   experiment.
   The third        section treats of Temperature                    and of Real Specific Heat.
Bodies are defined to be at the same temperature, when the powers
of their atoms           to communicate heat are equal                 ;   and the proper mea
sure of temperature              is    defined to be the elasticity of            a  perfect gas at
constant volume, or                its volume          under constant            pressure.   Those
quantities are, in all perfect gases, proportional to the temperature, as
measured from        point 274-6 centigrade degrees, or 494-28 de
                           a
grees    of Fahrenheit's           scale,      below the temperature               of melting       ice.
This point               called the absolute           zero, and temperatures,              as mea
sured from      it, is   absolute temperatures.
   It   is   shewn from tho equations in the preceding section, that ab
solute temperature, as thus                    defined,    is   simply proportional             to the
quantity of heat in one atom, plus a constant, multiplied                                 by    a   con
stant coefficient.             The constants          depend    on    the nature of the sub
stance, and the coefficient especially on its chemical constitution.
   The reciprocal of this coefficient is, of                         course,     the real specific
heat    of   one atom, which, being divided                     by   the atomic weight, gives
the real specific heat            of    unity    ofweight.
   The following laws, which                    have been to     a    great extent established
experimentally            by Dulong,        are inferred from the theory              —
      That   the specific heats           of   all simple atoms are either             the same, or
vary only in certain simple numerical ratios.
  That the specific heats    atoms    similar chemical constitution
                                          of             of
are either the same, or vary only in simple numerical                                 ratios.
      The fourth section relates                 to the actual        coefficients of elasticity
and expansion            of   gases.     The coefficient of increase of elasticity with
temperature at constant                   volume, and the coefficient of expansion
under constant pressure, are the same, and equal to each other, for
every substance in the state of perfect gas, being the reciprocal of
the absolute temperature                  of melting ice, (or -00364166 per centi

                                                  280
grade degree),          when the volume and pressure at                           that tempera
ture are respectively taken as units.                        The     state of perfect gas, how
ever, can be only approximated to in nature                            ;   for in all gases, espe
cially the more dense and composite, the actions of the atomic nuclei
or centres on their atmospheres, arid of separate                              atoms upon each
other, have more or less influence on the elasticity.
   M. Regnault          has made several elaborate series of experiments, to
determine the deviations              from uniform expansibility                  thus produced,
in various     gases.
   The author,         by applying         his theory to data furnished by the ex
periments of       M. Regnault,            has obtained formulae              for the coefficients
of expansion of atmospheric air, carbonic acid gas, and hydrogen,
the results of which agree closely with those of observation, in every
case   in which     a comparison is possible.
   The fifth       section    treats of the elasticity of vapour in contact with
the same substance           in the liquid or solid                 state, or what is called the
pressure of vapour at saturation.
   The equilibrium of a substance filling a limited space, partly in
the form of vapour, and partly in that of liquid or solid, is shewn to
depend      on three conditions.
   The first condition of equilibrium                        is, that the total elasticity of
the substance       in the two states must be the same.
   The      second condition        of equilibrium            is,   that the superficial elasti
cities of every two contiguous atoms must be the same at their sur
face   of contact, and hence, that the superficial-atomic elasticity must
vary continuously        ;    so   that,    if,   at the bounding           surface between the
liquid or solid and its vapour, there                   is   an abrupt change of density,
(as the reflection of         light renders probable) there must there                     be two
densities    corresponding to the same superficial atomic elasticity.
   The third condition of equilibrium    deduced from the mutual at
                                                         is
tractions and repulsions of the atoms of liquid or solid and those of
vapour.       In   a   gas   in which the atomic centres are equidistant,                      the
actions of the several atoms on oach individual particle at an appre
ciable distance from the bounding surface of the gas, balance each
other, and are accordingly treated as merely affecting the total elas
ticity by    a   quantity which
                                       is
                                       a          function of the density         ;   but near the
bounding surface between a liquid or solid and its vapour, the action
of the liquid or solid upon any atom must be greater than that of the
vapour.    A force thus produced which acts on each particle in
                         is                                                                     a

                                        281
  line perpendicular to that bounding surface, and            which is probably
 attractive towards the liquid or solid, very intense close to the bound
 ing surface, but inappreciable at all perceptible distances from it.
  Such a force can be balanced only by         a  gradual increase of superfi
 cial-atomic elasticity in a direction towards the liquid or solid.        Hence,
 although at perceptible distances        from the liquid or solid, the density
 of vapour is sensibly uniform,        the layers close to that surface are
 probably in a state of condensation         by attraction, analogous      to that
 of the earth's atmosphere       under the influence of gravity.
     Professor   Faraday has expressed        an   opinion   that certain well-
 known phenomena arise         from a state of condensation         of this kind,
 produced     in gases by the superficial attraction of various solid sub
 stances.
     This third condition of equilibrium        is expressed   by a differential
 equation, the integral of which, taken in conjunction             with the first
 two conditions, would     be  sufficient to determine the respective densi
 ties, and the total elasticity of a    liquid or solid and its vapour,      when
 in contact    with each other in a limited space at any temperature,
 provided we had     a complete   knowledge of the laws of molecular force.
 In the present imperfect        state  of that knowledge, the integral         in
 question indicates the form, of an approximate equation, expressing
 the logarithm of the elasticity of vapour at saturation, in terms of
 the reciprocals of the first and second powers         of the absolute tempe
 rature, the coefficients     of which the author has calculated empiri
cally, for water and mercury, from the experiments of              M. Regnault,
 and   for alcohol, ether, turpentine,       and petroleum, from those          of
 Dr Ure, — three     experimental data being required for each fluid, to
calculate three constants.         The agreement of the results of the
formulae    thus obtained   with those of experiment is as close as the
uncertainties of observation render possible,           throughout     the whole
range of pressures     and temperatures observed.          For  steam, in par
ticular, the coincidence    is almost perfect.       The author gives a table
of the   constants   for the fluids enumerated, and refers          to the  Edin
burgh New Philosophical         Journal for July 1849, for        the   details of
the comparison between calculation and experiment.
     The  section concludes with a speculation as to the probable effects
of the atmospheres      of dense vapours supposed to exist at the sur
faces of solid and liquid bodies.          The author conjectures that the
 presence   of such atmospheres      may be the cause which prevents solid

                                        282
 bodies from cohering when brought together, and produces that                re
 sistance   to contact which is visible not only in them but        in drops of
 liquid.     He conceives it possible that it may also be         the cause of
 the   "  spheroidal state" of liquids at high temperatures, and may
 assist  in maintaining the vesicular state, if such a state exists.
     The sixth and last section of the first part relates to mixtures of
 gases and vapours of different kinds.
     The principle     stated  in the second section that the elasticity       of
 the atomic atmosphere is proportional to its density, is here expressed
 in the form, that     the elasticity  of any number of portions of atomic
 atmosphere, compressed       into a given space, is equal to the sum of the
 elasticities which such portions would respectively have          if they occu
pied    the same space separately.        It is shewn, that   if this principle
 be considered    true, not only of portions of atomic atmosphere of one
 kind of   substance,   but also of portions of atomic atmospheres       of sub
 stances   of different kinds, when mixed,        it leads to the well-known
 laws of the elasticity and diffusion of mixed gases and vapours.             He
 also speculates on the possibility of solid bodies, which have no per
ceptible vapours of their own at ordinary temperatures, acquiring
the power of resisting cohesion by means of a superficial atmosphere
of foreign substances.
     The second part of the      paper treats   of the dynamical relations     of
the heat and the elasticity of bodies in the gaseous state.
     The first   section   contains the general theory of the mutual con
version of heat and expansive power.
    After recapitulating the mode of expressing quantities of heat in
terms of gravity, the author refers to the experiments of Mr" Joule
on the production      of heat by electro-magnetic currents, by friction,
and by the compression of air, as proving the convertibility of heat
and mechanical power.           He states reasons, however, for believing
that the mechanical value of heat as deduced from those experiments
(viz., from 760 feet to 890 feet per degree of Fahrenheit,            applied to
liquid water)    is too large, owing to various causes of loss        of power,
and gives the preference to experiments in which no machinery is
used, such as those on the velocity of sound, as data for such a cal
culation.
    The laws of    the production of heat by compression,         and its con
sumption by expansion, are then deduced              from the following      two
principles, the first of which       is peculiar to the hypothesis     of mole

                                       283
 cular vortices,    while the second    is a consequence      of the law of    the
 conservation of vis viva.
     First, As every portion of     an atomic atmosphere is urged towards
 the nucleus or atomic centre by a centripetal force equal to the cen
 trifugal force arising from the oscillation which constitutes heat, it
 follows   that, when by compression,        each   portion of such an atmo
 sphere is made to approach the centre by a certain distance, the vis
 viva of its oscillation will be increased by the amount corresponding
 to that centrifugal force, acting through that distance ; and conversely,
 that, when, by expansion, each portion of the atmosphere is made to
 retreat  from the centre, the vis viva of its motion will        be diminished
 by a similar amount.
     Secondly,   Let  a portion  of any substance undergo any changes of
 temperature, volume, and figure, and at length return to its primi
 tive volume, figure, and temperature.          Then, the absolute quantity
 of heat in the substance, the arrangement of the atoms, and the dis
 tribution of their atmospheres, being the        same as at    first, it follows
 that the algebraical     sum   of  the vires vivae consumed      and produced
 during the changes, whether in the shape of expansion and compres
 sion, or in that of heat, must be equal to zero ; that is to say, if on
 the whole, a certain amount       of mechanical power      has appeared, and
 been given out from the body in the form            of expansion,     an   equal
 amount must have been communicated             to the body, and      must have
 disappeared     in  the form    of heat   ;  and   if a certain     amount     of
 mechanical power has appeared and been given out from the body in
 the form of heat, an equal amount must have been communicated to
the body, and must have disappeared in the form of expansion.
     From   those principles  the author deduces an algebraical          expres
sion of three terms.       The first term represents the variation of heat
arising from mere change of volume ; the second, the variation of
heat produced by change of the distribution of the density of the
atomic atmospheres dependent on change of volume ; and the third,
the variation of heat due to change of the distribution        of the density of
the atomic atmospheres, dependent on change of temperature.                In all
those terms there is a common factor, bearing a constant ratio to the
absolute quantity of heat in the body.          In  the first term, that factor
is  multiplied by the variation of the logarithm of the density of the
body, and in the second and third by certain functions of the density

                                        284
  and temperature depending on the law of the influence of molecular
  attraction and repulsion upon the superficial-atomic          elasticity.
     This   section  concludes   by contrasting     the author's theory with
 that of Carnot, which has hitherto been followed, either explicitly or
 virtually, in all calculations respecting the motive power of heat
 (except in the investigations of Mr Joule, already referred to), and
 of which    a very clear and able account,        with copious illustrations,
 was read before     the Royal Society of Edinburgh,         in January 1849,
 by Professor Thomson.          Carnot considers heat to be something of a
 peculiar kind, whether     a  condition or a substance, the total amount
 of which, in nature, is incapable of increase or diminution.                It  is
 not, therefore, according to his theory, convertible into mechanical
 power, but is capable, by its transmission through            substances   under
particular    circumstances, of causing mechanical power to be deve
 loped which did not before exist.        According     to the author's theory,
on the contrary, as well as to every conceivable theory which regards
heat as a modification        of motion,   the  production of expansion         by
heat, and of heat by compression, consist in the transformation of
mechanical power from one shape into another.
     The  second section   relates to real and apparent specific heat, espe
cially in the state of perfect gas.       The apparent specific heat of a
given substance is defined to be the sum           of the real specific heat,
and of that heat which is employed in producing               those   changes    of
volume     and of molecular condition which accompany an elevation of
one degree     in the temperature      of the substance.        The    same sub
stance may therefore have different apparent            specific heats, accord
ing to the manner in which the volume is made                 to vary with     the
temperature.        The general algebraical expression for apparent spe
cific   heat is   deduced from the equations of the preceding section.
That expression being applied to the          case   of a perfect gas, or of a
gas which may be treated in practice as sensibly perfect, it is shewn
that the apparent specific heat of such a gas, at constant volume, is
sensibly equal to the real specific heat, and that the apparent specific
heat at constant pressure exceeds the specific heat at constant volume
in a ratio which       is sensibly constant     for a given gas.        Laplace's
method of calculating this ratio from the velocity of sound is referred
to, and applied to atmospheric air, oxygen, and hydrogen, using the
correct coefficients of dilatation      of those   gases,   as determined       by
M. Regnault.

                                          285
     The following laws, which         have already been inferred from experi
ment by Dulong, are then deduced from the theory                    :
     The specific heat     of unity of volume, at constant            volume,    varies
for    different perfect gases inversely as the fraction                by which      the
 ratio of the two specific heats exceeds unity.
     Equal volumes of all         substances    in  the state    of perfect gas, at
 the same pressure,       and at equal and constant temperatures, being
 compressed by the same amount, disengage equal quantities                    of  heat.
     The data now obtained being employed to calculate the value of
 heat in terms of the force of gravity, it is found that the real specific
 heat of atmospheric air        is equivalent      to  a  fall of 238-66 feet per
 centigrade degree,      and the apparent specific heat of liquid water at
 the temperature of melting           ice (being what is commonly termed a
 thermal unit) to a fall of 1252 feet per centigrade degree, or 695-6
 feet per degree of Fahrenheit.
     The author next investigates the apparent specific heat of vapour
 at   saturation.     This quantity, according to his theory, is altogether
 different from the variation          of the total heat of evaporation, with
 which, according to the theory of Carnot, it is identical.                    It is in
 general negative ; so that if vapour at saturation is allowed to ex
 pand, being cut off from external sources of heat, a portion of it must
 be liquefied     in order to supply the heat necessary for the expansion
 of the rest, in addition to        the heat set free by the        fall of tempera
 ture.
      The third section treats of the latent          and   total heat of evapora
 tion, especially for water.
      It  is in the first place proved, from the principle of vis viva, that
 the latent heats of evaporation and liquefaction, at a given tempera
 ture, are equal, with contrary signs.
      The total     heat   of evaporation is      defined to be the sum of the
  latent heat of evaporation, and of the heat                required     to raise    the
  liquid to the temperature        at which   it is evaporated, from        some arbi
  trary fixed    temperature — (generally        that of melting ice).
      The law of variation of the total heat of evaporation with tempera
  ture is then deduced       from the principle         of the conservation of vis
  viva, which, as applied to this subject, takes the following form                : —
      Let a portion of fluid in the liquid state            be  raised   from a      cer
   tain temperature to a higher temperature ;              let it  be  evaporated at
   the higher temperature ; let         the vapour     then be allowed to expand,

                                        28G
 being maintained     always at     the   temperature     of saturation for its
 density, until it is restored to its original temperature, at which
 temperature let it  be  liquefied : then the excess      of  the heat absorbed
 by the fluid above the heat given out        will   be equal to the expansive
power generated.
    From this principle it is      deduced   that when     a vapour is sensibly
in the state of perfect gas, and of very small density as compared
with its liquid, the total heat of evaporation increases uniformly with
the temperature, and the rate of increase          is sensibly equal to the ap
parent specific heat of the vapour at constant pressure.                This con
clusion is verified by the experiments of          M. Regnault upon the      eva
poration of water.      As an additional verification of         the theory, the
real specific heat of steam is calculated from the total heat of evapo
ration, and also from the specific        heat of atmospheric air     ;  and the
results of these    two processes        are found to agree       exactly, being
equal to   0183 of the apparent specific heat of liquid water.
    The fourth and last     section   of the second part is an investigation
of the mechanical action of steam, treated as a perfect gas, and the
power of the steam-engine.
    The density of   steam of saturation       at 100° centigrade, is calcu
lated from its chemical composition on the assumption of its being a
perfect gas, and found to agree with the result of experiment, being
t^Vs of *ne maximum density of water ; and thence it is inferred
that, in the absence of more precise data, steam at ordinary pres
sures may be treated in practice as a perfect gas, without               material
error.
    The mechanical action of unity of weight of steam while entering
a  cylinder, and before it has begun to expand, is found by multiply
ing its pressure by its volume.          The expansive action is next inves
tigated, taking into account the liquefaction of a portion of the steam
in supplying the heat required to expand the rest.               The exact ex
pression of this action is extremely complicated           ; but approximate
formulas of a more simple kind are given, suitable for calculating its
amount with accuracy sufficient for practice, in different portions of
the scale of pressures.      From    the sum of those two portions      of power,
deductions are made for the loss of power arising from clearance, and
for the effect of the counter-pressure of the escaping steam.            Thus  is
obtained the comple-te expression for the gross effect of unity        of weight
of steam, which, being multiplied         by the weight of water effectively

                                     287
evaporated   in unity of time gives the gross effect      of the engine in
unity of time.     The result affords the     means of calculating   all the
circumstances connected      with   the working     of a steam-engine    ac
cording to the principle of the conservation of vis viva, or, in other
words, of the equality of power and effect, which regulates tho
action of all machines that move with a uniform or periodical velo
city.    This principle  was first applied   to  the steam-engine by tho
Count de Pambour,       and, accordingly, the formulae of this paper only
differ from those of his work in the expressions for the pressure and
expansive action of the steam, which are results peculiar to the au
thor's theory.     As an illustration    of the use of the formulae,     the
maximum useful effect of a double-acting Cornish engine is computed,
and compared with the result      of the calculation of M.     de Pambour
for the same engine, shewing the latter to be too large by about one-
fifteenth.
    In an Appendix are given two tables       ; one for calculating the vo
lume of steam from its pressure, and vice versa, and its mechanical
action  at full pressure, the other for computing the amount of its ac
tion in expansive engines.
    In order to shew the limit of the possible effect from the expen
diture of a given quantity of heat in evaporating water under given
circumstances, the maximum gross effect of unity of weight of steam,
evaporated at a higher temperature, and liquefied at a lower, is com
puted in two examples, and compared with the heat which disappears
during the action of the steam,      as calculated directly.    In the first
example, the water is supposed to be evaporated         at the pressure of
four atmospheres, and condensed        at that of half an atmosphere ; in
the second, to be evaporated     at eight atmospheres, and condensed at
one atmosphere.
    In both these examples, the direct calculation of the heat rendered
effective,  agrees  with   the calculation    from the power developed,
thus verifying the methods of computation          founded on the author's
theory.
    The heat converted, in   those examples, into engine-power amounts
to only about one-sixth    part of the heat    expended  in evaporating the
water, the remainder being carried off by the steam and liquid water
which escape from the cylinder.         In practice, the proportion of heat
rendered effective is still smaller, and in some unexpangive engines
amounts to only one twenty-fourth part, or even less.            It is thus

                                           288
 shewn, that there is a waste of heat in the steam-engine,                     which   is
 a necessary      consequence     of its nature.         It  can   be reduced   only by
 increasing the initial pressure of steam, and the extent of the expan
 sive action ; and to both these resources there are practical                limits.
     In conclusion of the present paper, the author states,                  that, from
 his equations, many additional            formulae      are  deducible, with respect
 to the specific heat of imperfect gases, to certain questions              in meteor
 ology, and to the specific heat of liquids            ;  but from the want of suffi
 cient experimental data, he conceives              that they are not as yet capa
 ble of being usefully applied.
          2. On        Probable Inference.             By Bishop Terrot.
    The paper       commenced     with   a  suggestion, that, as the inferences of
ordinary logic admitted no premises but such as were absolutely cer
tain, and as the premises with which we have to deal in the business
of life were not certain, but only probable, therefore it was highly de
sirable that we should have a logic, or rules for drawing                    inferences
on the case      of probable premises.
    The attention of the Society was then drawn to the 15th section
of the article Probabilities, in the Encyclopcedia Metropolitana, and
especially to the following passage            :
                                                  " It   is an even chance that     A is
B, and the         same     that B is C     ;  and therefore,       1 to 3 from these
grounds- only that        A   is C.   But other considerations of themselves
give an even chance that            A  is C.      What is the resulting degree of
evidence   that      A  is C   V    To which query the answer in the Ency
 clopaedia   is  §.
    On this    passage it was observed,         in the first place, that the asserted
ratio of   1  to 3, or the probability         \ in   the first syllogism, was true
only on the hypothesis that          A  can be    C only through the intervention
of the middle term B.             But that when such            is not the case, when
other ways are conceivable but totally unknown, the probability                       is
not   \ but \    ;   these two fractions      representing, the one the probabi
lity of the     evidence     of a complete proof that           A  is C, the other the
probability that       A   is C ; and   it was observed,       that, in practical ques
tions, it is the latter probability alone which we have an interest in
determining.

     It   was   then    shewn generally, that,          if the probabilities          of the

     Whence it was inferred, that          if  q' = 2 p', or    if the   second premise
have a probability          of     each  of  these    fractions    becomes        J,  or the
probability      that  A   is C becomes
     It   was then shewn that a weak argument, that is to say, one af
fording a probability of less than          J,    diminishes instead of increasing
the probability arising from any previous argument or evidence                         ; and
it  was proved, that even        if  we take   J for the probability          arising from
the first argument, the probability             arising from both conjointly             was
 not    §  but §.
    The general conclusions of the paper              are as follows       : —
     1.   When the      premises,    which,   if  certain, would involve the cer
tainty of the conclusion, are not certain, but have each a known pro

                                       290
bability, the probability     of                           of the pro
                                   the conclusion is the product
babilities of the premises, in those cases only where the presence of
the middle term is necessary for the connexion of the major and
minor terms.     When this is not so, then the probability of the con
clusion is the product of the probabilities of the premises, plus the
sum       of the probabilities arising from the other conceivable         causes of
connexion.
    •2.    In       of probable premises, any premise with a proba

    3.     When various arguments of different validities have           been    ad
vanced for a proposition,      or when evidence has been brought in sup
port of argument, or argument of evidence,          the resulting probability
is not the sum, but the average of the several probabilities             ;   so that
a   weaker argument following upon a stronger, weakens             it,   or rather
weakens the probability       produced by it.

3.   On the Ante- Columbian           Discovery     of America.        By Dr
      Elton.     Communicated         by  Dr Traill.
   The   object proposed by     Dr Elton,  is a summary of the knowledge
we possess on the discovery of the Continent         of America,   by several
adventurous European voyagers,         anterior to the time of Columbus.
   This subject, which   has been for almost a century and a         half well
known to the students of northern history,         was first made   known to
the rest of Europe by the publication of the Vinlandia Antigua              of
the celebrated Torfeeus in 1705 ; and most of the facts given by Dr
Elton are extracted from that work.           Torfeeus proved from exist
ing Icelandic MSS., that America was discovered, and even attempted
to be colonized, by his enterprising countrymen,          in the end of the
tenth and beginning of the eleventh century           ; and the descriptions
transmitted to us    prove that they landed on what are now New
foundland, Nova Scotia, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island.
    The first adventurer   was   Lei/, the   son of Eirik   the  Red, who, in
a.d. 995, when attempting to pay a visit to his father, the colonizer of
Greenland, was driven by stress of weather to the coast of Newfound
land, which he named Helluland, or Rocky            Land.       From that   he
sailed south-westward,    till  he arrived at a country,     which  from   be-
    VOL.  II.

                                        292
ing covered with wood, he denominated            Markland     ;  and which, from
the course and length of his voyage, is believed to be a part of Nova
 Scotia.    Pursuing his course southwards, he reached                a   portion of
 Massachusetts, not far from Cape Cod           ;  and coasting along this, he
 took up his winter quarters        in a fertile    country,     which,    from his
 description,    is easily seen to have been about Rhode Island.                 This
 region, from the discovery of a species of wild vine found there, he
 termed Vinland.          In   the summer, he fitted out his vessel,              and
 sailed to join his father in Greenland.
    The fame of his discovery induced his brother Thorwald, in a.d.
 1002, to sail for Vinland, intending to settle there; but in one of
 his excursions he encountered and was slain by a people,                   the Ice
 landers,   in contempt denominated Skrelings, evidently Esquimaux,
 who then appear to have possessed the shores far to the south of
 their present location.
    The next and most remarkable            voyage    to Vinland, was that of
 Thorfinn Karlsefne, which took place in a.d. 1006.               He carried with
him his wife, and one hundred and thirty-one followers, and domestic
 animals, with the intention of establishing a colony at the huts built
 by  Leif in Rhode Island.         The soil and climate      were suitable,       and
they remained in that country          till 1011, when they          were   attacked
 by a vast number of Skrelings,          whom they repulsed        ;  but the hos
tility of the natives induced him to abandon his design, and               he finally
settled in Iceland.        Thorfinn, however, had a son,         Snorro, born in
America,      from whom some         of the most distinguished          families in
 Iceland are lineally descended.
    After this period, it appears that there             were    many voyages to
 Vinland,      and that Iceland sent colonies        thither    for more than a
century   ;  for it is stated in Icelandic        MSS., that Eirik, bishop of
Greenland, went to        Vinland in a.d. 1125,     to confirm the colonists in
the Christian      faith.
    The work of Torfmus also        gives us a singular account of Icelandic
voyages to a country, either a continent,          or  a vast island, lying far
to the west     of the British Islands,     and near Vinland.          It  seems   to
have been first visited by       Are Marson in a.d. 983, who            was driven
there by a great storm.         He named it Huitramannaland, or Land of
 White Men, from the complexion of the natives,            who were also Chris
tians  ; and   Are himself    was then converted from the worship            of Odin
to the religion     of Christ.

                                          293
    The same land was visited afterwards by Gudleif Qudlagson, an
Icelandic trader with Ireland ; who, in a voyage from Dublin to
Iceland, was driven      by a tempest to a far western land, where he
was taken prisoner by the natives, but delivered by their chief,
who turned out to be an Icelander.              He  was dismissed with presents,
but forbidden      to return.      The    natives   were  white, and seemed     of
European extraction, with a dialect like that               of Ireland ; and the
American      archaeologists,    with considerable reason, have        considered
that their whereabout was on some part of the new world, between
the Chesapeake and Florida.
    These early voyages seem to us very surprising              ; but they do not
seem at all foreign to the habits and enterprise           of the bold Icelanders
of those ages ; who not only traded to               every part of the west of
 Europe,   but to the Mediterranean,           and explored Baffin -s Bay, as
high as Lancaster Sound.            We have now a certain proof, that they
 were at least as high in       it as at 72°    55'; for in 1825,     a memorial
 stone  with  a  Runic inscription, and the        date  of 1131,   was found on
 the island of Kingiktersoak.
    Several Runic inscriptions are said to have been found in America             ;
 but the most remarkable of these is the mass of greywacke on the
 shores of the river at Dighton, in the township of Berkley, in Mas
 sachusetts, not far from the supposed site of the settlement of Thor-
finn Karlsefne.       This has been lately carefully figured and engraved
 in the Antiquitates Americana of the Royal Soicety of Northern
 Antiquaries of Copenhagen, and repeated in Jacob Aal's translation
 of the Chronicles of Snorre Sturleson. Dr Elton, who has examined
 the original, assures us, that this engraving is a faithful transcript.
 On this rock, antiquaries read, amid figures supposed to represent
 Thorfinn, his wife and child, and his companions, the letters — yrfm
 and cxxxi, the number of his companions.
    Dr Elton next adverted to the          voyage  of the Welsh Prince, Madoc,
 son  of the greatest of the princes of North Wales Owen Gwenedd,
 about the year 1170.           This voyage, though doubted by many, is
fully  believed   in by Dr Elton, and it is noticed by Hakluyt, Purchas,
 Broughton,     &c.    Dr Elton quotes the singular story given by the
 Rev. Morgan Jones, chaplain            to the  British commander of the    forces
 of Virginia in 1669.          Jones     was taken prisoner by the Tusscarora
 Indians, who intended        to torture him      in their usual way, when he
 began to lament his cruel         fate   in Welsh, which was understood        by

                                       294
the Indians, and he was suffered to depart in peace.              These,  Dr E.
thinks, may have been         descendants   of Modoc's followers;        and he
seems inclined to ascribe to them also those very remarkable mounds,
fortifications,   and enclosures,   which are found in such quantity in the
valleys of the Mississippi and the Ohio.        He   is inclined also to trace
to these Welsh adventurers, or at least to some early Europeans, the
now almost extinct tribe, the Mandans — a people fairer and hand
somer than the Red men, — that are now found 1800 miles above St
Louis, on the Missouri, as described by Lewis and Clarke, and Cat-
lin, the American travellers.
    These, and several      other circumstances, which might         have  been
adduced,     prove that Columbus cannot be regarded as the original
discoverer of the New World.

    The following Communications              were read    : —
1. On the        Equilibrium of Elastic Solids:           By James Clerk
         Maxwell, Esq. Communicated by the Secretary.
    This paper commenced by pointing out the insufficiency of all
theories of elastic solids, in which the equations do not contain two

                                          295
 independent constants deduced             from    experiments.        One of these
 constants is common to liquids and solids, and is called the modulus
 of cubical     elasticity.     The other     is peculiar     to solids, and is here
 called the modulus        of linear elasticity.      The equations of Navier,
 Poisson, and Lame and Clapeyron, contain only one coefficient                      ; and
 Professor G. G. Stokes of Cambridge, seems to have formed the first
 theory of elastic solids which recognised the independence of cubical
 and   linear elasticity, although M. Cauchy            seems    to  have suggested
 a  modification of the old theories, which            made     the ratio     of linear
 to cubical elasticity the same         for all substances.        Professor      Stokes
 has deduced the theory         of elastic solids from that of the motion of
 fluids, and his equations are identical with those of this paper, which
 are deduced     from the two following assumptions.
     In an element of an elastic solid,         acted    on  by three pressures at
 right angles to one another, as long as the compressions do not pass
 the  limits of perfect elasticity —
     1st, The sum of the pressures, in three rectangular axes,                   is pro
 portional to the sum of the compressions in those axes.
     2d, The difference of the pressures          in two    axes at  right angles      to
 one another, is proportional         to the difference of the compressions in
 those axes.

/t being the modulus of cubical,          and m that      of linear elasticity.
    These equations are found to be very convenient for the solution
of problems,     some of which were given in the latter par t           of  the paper.
    These particular       cases were —
    That of       an  elastic    hollow    cylinder,    the    exterior    surface     of
which      was  fixed, while the inferior        was    turned    through      a   small
angle.      The action of     a transparent     solid thus twisted on polarized
light,    was calculated, and the calculation confirmed by experiment.

   The   second case related to the torsion        of cylindric rods, and a
method     was   given   by which       m   may be found.      The quantity
          mn
E =     -         was   found    by elongating,    or by    bending  the rod
       m+ 6 n
used to determine m, and /a is found by the equation,

   The effect of pressure     on the surfaces of a hollow sphere or    cylin
der was   calculated, and the result applied to the determination      of the
cubical compressibility     of liquids and solids.
    An expression    was found for the curvature of an elastic plate ex
posed to pressure on one side       ; and the state of cylinders acted on by
centrifugal   force and by heat was determined.
    The principle of the superposition of compressions and pressures
was applied to the case of a bent beam, and a formula was            given to
determine    E  from the deflection of a beam supported at both ends
and loaded at the middle.
    The paper concluded with          a conjecture, that as the quantity   60,
(which expresses the relation of the inequality of pressure in a solid
to the doubly-refracting force produced) is probably a function of m ;
the determination      of these quantities for different substances     might
lead to a more complete theory          of double refraction, and extend our
knowledge of the laws of optics.
  2.  Two Letters from W. E. Logan, Esq., to Earl Cathcart.
     These letters were dated in August 1846           and September 1847-
Earl Cathcart intended himself           to have  read them to the Society,
but, having been prevented by his official           duties from   coming   to
 Edinburgh,    had sent them, to be communicated in his name.
     In the first letter, the author, who had      been sent to examine the
geology of Canada, describes       a  visit which he    made,   on his way to
 Fort- William, Lake Superior, to the silver and copper mines          on the
 south side of the lake, in the territory of the United States.
     He considers the formation in which the mines occur             as being
 older than the new red.          They consist of parallel ranges of trap
 and conglomerate, apparently interstratified.        They are well displayed
 at and near Copper Harbour.            They are sometimes so thick as to

                                            297
form mountain ranges.                The conglomerate       consists   of trap pebbles
in trap sandstone          ;the trap is sometimes compact, at other times
amygdaloidal.             The strata run in a curvilinear direction. They dip
to the north,       with       a slope of 16° to 30°, the veins are at       right angles
to the strata,        and run nearly north and south.              The veinstones         are
steatite, quartz, calcspar, and zeolites.                The    ores are those of cop
per, silver, iron, and lead, the two former                 being productive.             The
two metals are chiefly native, but occur also in other forms.                         They
are least abundant  in the conglomerate, more so in the trap, most
of all in the amygdaloid.   They are found also in amygdules of the
rock near the veins.   The quantity of native copper is very great.
In   the Copper Falls Mine, near Eagle Harbour, on sinking a pit to
72 feet, the compact trap and amygdaloid were found to alternate six
or seven times.            The main     vein was 18 to 20 inches thick.              In the
shaft, about 40 feet down, a mass of native copper was found, of
which the dimensions were estimated by the author,                      in situ,     to   in
dicate a weight of about 30 tons.                 It   had not yet been found pos
sible to remove it.             A
                         diagram of its position was given.
     From other shafts in the vicinity, much copper had been                              ex
tracted, but with prodigious difficulty, from the tough metal binding
the rock firmly together, and rendering blasting useless. The author
saw, on the surface, besides many pieces of 25 lb., seven masses,
varying      from     75 to 1200 lb., and weighing in all 4000 lb., or
nearly 2 tons.         Native silver is found with the copper, and a mass
of 3J- lb. had      been obtained.         The author      saw    one of 1£ lb.           The
author is of opinion that the very richness of this                    mine in native
copper may render it unproductive,                from the difficulty     and expense
of working it.
     In   the ClifF Mine, on Eagle River, there is the same abundance of
copper, with more silver.              Part of the rock        was said to   yield   7 per
cent,     of silver   ;   but subsequently was found hardly to pay for its
extraction.      The author          saw here a mass      of silver of 3£ lb.        Every
vein in the trap seen by the author contained native copper.                              At
the Eagle River Mine, silver is found in large masses, one of which
weighed 7 lb. 2 oz.
     On the Canada side,            as far as the author    had    then examined           it,
from      Fort-William         to Pigeon   River, indurated       shale prevails, over
laid by greenstone, with patches of porphyry.                     Many trap-dikes are
seen, forming         long narrow promontories and deep harbours on the

                                        298
shore of the lake.         A system   of veins occurs at right angles to the
 dikes, containing barytes, in addition to the veinstones           formerly men
tioned.      The veins vary from       6 inches   to 20 feet.      In  one of them
 14 or 15 feet thick,       well seen on     Spar    Island, gray sulphuret       of
copper occurs in considerable abundance,             especially in a part of the
 vein, nearly 5 feet thick.        Native silver also occurs in small quan
 tity. There are also veins parallel to the             dikes  which contain ores
 of copper.     But the author could not form          a decided opinion in 1846
 of the value of these mines.
     In the  second letter, he gives some of the results of an examination
 of the eastern townships of Canada, from Lake Champlain and the
 Richelieu to the Chaudiere.          He observed facts proving the green
 mountains of Vermont to be more recent than the Loraine shales, or
 Hudson River group.           Of the upper rocks, the        most interesting was
 a  band of serpentine, 150 to 400 yards broad, which                   the author
 traced continuously for 150 miles, and which probably extends as far
 again.     It has occasionally rich beds of magnetic iron            and of chro-
 mate of iron    ;   of the latter, a boulder was        found, weighing 6 cwt.
 The gravel     on the Chaudiere,      besides these minerals, contains        tita-
niferous iron and gold.          The author    expects to find platinum, as the
gravel in all other respects resembles          that of the Russian auriferous
district.     The auriferous     sand   is found on the tributaries          of the
 Chaudiere.       It  will probably  pay for extraction.        60 bushels washed
by   Mr   Derby,     yielded 18 dwt. 8 gr.,      or about      Is. 6d.   worth per
bushel.      The gold     has not yet been found       in situ.
3.    Notes on Practical Chemical subjects.                       By Alexander
        Kemp, Esq. Communicated by Professor Gregory.
                 1.   On the Purification     of Sulphuric Acid.
    The author, after describing the different methods, recommended
for purifying sulphuric acid from nitric acid, namely, boiling with a
little sugar, and heating with sulphate of ammonia, both of which
had proved troublesome and imperfect,              stated,   that after trying va
rious plans, the only one which he found to answer well, was the
action of sulphurous acid on the oil of vitriol, after diluting it to the
sp. gr. of 1-715, or lower.         He    adds   one volume of water to three
of the oil of vitriol, passes sulphurous acid gas through the hot liquid
till it is in excess, and then boils off the excess of sulphurous acid ;
or, still better, three volumes of oil of vitriol are added to or diluted
with, one of a saturated solution of sulphurous acid in pure water,

                                          290
and boiled.      The acid     is thus so perfectly purified from       nitric  acid,
that when used for making             hydrochloric    acid,  it yields a product
quite colourless, which was not the case            with the oil of vitriol puri
fied by any other process.
    If the   oil of vitriol be diluted with one-half its volume of sulphur
ous acid    solution (or of water, previously to passing the gas through
it), the sulphate of lead is also totally separated, and the clear liquid,
decanted    from the precipitate,       and boiled down to sp. gr. 1-845, is
colourless, and almost chemically pure.
          2. On the    Preparation of Pure Hydrochloric Acid.
    Professor Gregory,      in his- process for preparing hydrochloric         acid,
by heating 1 equivalent          of sea-salt with 2 equivalents of sulphuric
acid  of sp. gr. 1-650, directs the use        of patent salt, to avoid   the pre
sence   of iron in the product.
    The author observed, that there           is always    a certain quantity     of
iron in the residue, even when patent salt is used               ; but that none
passes over with      the hydrochloric       acid.    He then    added   iron and
peroxide of iron in considerable quantity to the materials.                Still  no
iron passed over.       It  would appear, that when iron had been ob
served   by Professor Gregory         in minute quantity, in the hydrochloric
acid made      by his process, from common salt, it had either passed
over at the very end of the process, when the temperature rose very
high, although      the author could not, in his own experiments, ob
serve this, or, more probably, had been present in the test employed.
It  is probable that, even when much iron is present in the materials,
the presence     of the   excess of sulphuric       acid, and also the low tem
perature at which the process goes on, prevent the formation of the
chloride of iron.
    The author's observations          enable   us to prepare, from the com
monest    and cheapest salt, perfectly pure and colourless hydrochloric
acid,  and   thus still further to reduce the price of this reagent, so
essential to the chemist.
    Professor    Gregory     also   briefly stated   some   observations by      Mr
Kemp and himself,        on the purification      of chloroform, which he was
to describe    more fully at     a subsequent    meeting.

    The following Communications            were read    : —
 1.  Analysis of the Anthracite of the Calton Hill, Edinburgh.
  By Dr A. Voelcker. Communicated by Dr George Wilson.
    Dr Voelcker    observed,   in the introduction to his paper, that we
are in possession   of analyses of anthracite from different localities,
from which it appears that different specimens vary much in the pro
portion,   but very little   in the nature, of their      ingredients.   All
samples of anthracite which have been analysed, have been found to
contain carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen, as well as more or
less inorganic   matter.     Sulphur also has generally been found, at
least when sought for     ;  but it does not appear in many recorded
analyses.
    The anthracite employed in the following analyses was furnished
by  Dr Fleming, and first carefully dried, after being finely           pow
dered, by exposing it for several hours to     a  current of dry air, at a
temperature of 230°    F.     The carbon and hydrogen were ascertained,
by burning from three to four grains of the mineral with a mixture
of oxide of copper and oxide of lead, which is much less hygroscopic
than the pure oxide of copper.       A mixture   of this oxide and chlorate
of  potass  was  also placed in the shut end of the combustion-tube,
from which    oxygen was evolved      in the usual way towards the close
of the process.
    The nitrogen was determined by Will and Varentrapp's method.
The sulphur was ascertained by projecting into a red-hot platina
crucible, in successive   small quantities, a mixture       of anthracite in
powder, with nitrate of potass and carbonate of soda, and afterwards
maintaining    the product of deflagration     at a high temperature for
some   time.    The  resulting   fused mass which was perfectly white,
was dissolved in water, super-saturated      with hydrochloric     acid, and
precipitated by chloride of barium.
    About ten grains of the mineral were employed in the determina
tion of the amount of ash.       It was red, and contained oxide of iron.
    The following are the results of the analysis     : —

    The most remarkable peculiarity of the Calton             Hill anthracite, as
appears    from the results given above, is the large proportion of sul
phur it contains, amounting          to   nearly 3 per cent.        Sulphur    has
been supposed      to occur  in the different varieties of coal in combina
tion with iron, as pyrites, but the trace of that metal present in the
Calton    Hill anthracite   is so small, that the sulphur must have been
combined with the organic constituents of the mineral.
Note on the Crystallisation       of Carbon, and     the possible derivation    of
        the Diamond from Anthracite and G raphite.                By Dr   George
        Wilson.
     The author stated that the object of his communication was, to
suggest the possibility of anthracite as well as graphite being sub
stances    from which the diamond is developed.               After referring    to
previous theories, as all assuming that carbon must have been fluid
 or semifluid,     before it crystallised, he stated        that his hypothesis
 contemplated the possibility      of graphite, as well as amorphous car
 bon, and its solid combinations, such as anthracite, undergoing crys
 tallisation into the diamond, without         losing their solidity during the
 change.      He thought anthracite more likely than           most substances   to
 yield the diamond, for the following reasons          : —
     Firstly, As it occurs in nature, in many localities, it is found        pass
 ing by insensible gradations, on the one hand, into common coal, on
 the other, into graphite     ; so that it may be regarded as representing
 the transition-state    from fossilised vegetable       matter to pure carbon,
 and    as tending, under the influence        of certain agencies,    to change
  ultimately   into the latter.
      Secondly, The chief element of anthracite is carbon, of which it
 frequently contains 91, and sometimes 95 per cent.
      Thirdly,   Its other ingredients (with the exception of the              ash,
 which is often under one per cent.), namely, hydrogen, oxygen, nitro
 gen, and sulphur, form volatile compounds with each other, and with

                                          302
   the oxygen of the air,     so  that by a slow process      of spontaneous   de
   composition, and gradual oxidation or eremacausis, all the consti
   tuents of the anthracite, except the excess of carbon and the ash,
   may be evolved, and carbon left free.
       The separation, in this way, of the non-carbonaceous           elements  of
  the anthracite would be attended          with a disturbance of the     molecu
  lar equilibrium     of the mineral, which would necessitate          a new   ar
  rangement of its particles, and might determine the induction of the
  crystalline condition characteristic of the diamond.           During this pro
  cess, the inorganic saline matter, or ash, would either be excluded by
  the power crystallising bodies are known to possess of expelling hetero
  geneous matter, or be included in the crystallising            carbon.   Either
  view would consist with observation        ;  for whilst some diamonds appear
  to be pure carbon, many leave a slight ash when burned in oxygen.
      The author further      observed,    that whether anthracite will crys
  tallise into graphite or diamond, will be determined chiefly by the
  temperature      at which    crystallisation     occurs, and the rapidity with
  which it proceeds.       Graphite represents the condition of most stable
 equilibrium,     which the crystalline molecules of carbon assume, when
 aggregated     rapidly at a high temperature.             The diamond,   on  the
 other hand, has all the characters of a crystal which has formed very
 slowly at a lower temperature, and it will not change into graphite,
 unless   it be suddenly    exposed to an intense heat.        Whenever, there
 fore, carbon crystallises very slowly at ordinary temperatures, it may
 be expected      to become     the diamond rather than graphite, and the
 latter must be considered as a substance which, when not main
 tained at an elevated        temperature, is liable to re-arrange its par
 ticles in the condition       of more stable equilibrium characteristic of
 the diamond.        The author, at the same time, observed, that he did
 not seek to affirm that all diamonds          had been produced from anthra
cite or graphite, but thought it, on the other hand, probable, that,
 like other cry stall isable substances,       carbon might be crystallised    in
various ways.
2. On the       Proportion of Fluoride of Calcium present in the
        Baltic. By Professor Forchammer of Copenhagen. With
        some preliminary Remarks on the presence of Fluorine
        in different ocean waters.             By Dr George Wilson.
     Dr Wilson reminded        the  Society that he had announced to them
in    1846    the   occurrence of fluorine in the water of the          Frith of

                                              303
Forth, and mentioned, that, in the preceding summer, he had found
it in deposits obtained during the evaporation of sea-water from the
Frith of Clyde, and the German Ocean.                       Professor         Forchammer
had   made    similar    observations on the Baltic, and had furnished                      Dr
Wilson with the account of them which follows.                            Before   reading
this, he wished to add, that he had recently examined incrustations
from the boiler of a steam-vessel sailing between Liverpool and Dub
lin, and similar deposits from the Canada Transatlantic                       steamer,     and
H.M. war-steamer Sidon, which had                   been three years on the            Medi
terranean station.  The different crusts were, without preliminary
treatment, except reduction to powder, heated with oil of vitriol, and
were found to yield an acid vapour which etched glass.                           Specimens
of glass, in illustration, were shewn to the Society.                     From    these ob
servations, Dr Wilson inferred the presence of fluorine in the Friths
of Forth and Clyde, in the German Ocean, the Irish Sea, the At
lantic, and the Mediterranean. He then proceeded to read Profes
sor Forchammer's        communication, which follows.               It is dated,   Copen
hagen, 20th December 1849.
Abstract of   a   Paper    by   Professor Forchammer, on                  the   rarer Sub
                   stances      which occur in Sea-water.
                        Fluorine and Phosphoric            Acid.
   100 lb. of sea-water, as it occurs in the Sound, near Copenhagen,
of which the average quantity of salts is between 2 and 2 \ per
cent., was evaporated.          When the solution was          so   concentrated that
it began to deposit salt, it was, without filtering  mixed with an  it,
excess of ammonia, and the precipitate collected and washed.   The
whole precipitate which contains carbonate, sulphate, and phosphate
of lime, fluoride of calcium, silica, and magnesia, was redissolved in
muriatic acid, which left the greater part of silica undissolved                       ;   the
solution was mixed with             muriate     of ammonia, and           a   second     time
precipitated by an excess of ammonia.             This precipitate from 100 lb.
of sea-water weighed 3-104             grains, and consisted of phosphate of
lime and fluoride of calcium.            It   was divided     into two equal parts,
of which the one was in         a   platina crucible, mixed with concentrated
sulphuric acid, and allowed to act on           a   slip of glass, covered with wax,
in which some words were scratched with                   a   copper needle.               The
glass was most decidedly etched,              but the words appeared            more clear

                                         304
and legible     if breathed upon.        The   second   half part   was   likewise
mixed with sulphuric acid, but in a bent tube, and distilled into a
small vessel which       contained     a  weak solution    of ammonia.         The
tube was etched, and the vessel contained precipitated silica.              It  was
thus completely proved that sea-water contains fluoride of calcium,
but the quantity in 100 lb. sea- water from the Sound at Copenhagen
can hardly exceed one-half        of a grain, or since the proportion of the
different salts varies very little in sea-water, it will be about one
grain in 100 lb. of water of the ocean, which contains between 3-5
and 4 per cent, of salts.
    All   the   residuums     from the trials     to find fluorine      were dis
solved   in muriatic acid, and thrown down by          an excess of ammonia.
The precipitate, washed, dried, and heated, was mixed with potassium
in a glass tube [and heated], until the excess of potassium was driven
off.    The lower part of the tube was cut off and thrown into water,
where it for hours continued to give out small bubbles, distinguished
by the peculiar smell of phosphuretted hydrogen, although they did
not inflame by themselves.        Thus the   existence  of phosphoric acid      was
likewise proved, although       I  could not try the delicate test for phos
phoric acid which we owe to          Mr Svanberg, it not being known at
the time when       I made   my experiments.
    In all    the different    species   of corals which   I  analysed,     I like
 wise found fluorine.
    In  a postscript to the preceding         communication, Professor        For-
chammer states, that the paper, of which it is          an abstract,    " contains
experiments on many other substances, contained in minute quantities,
 in sea-water    ; for instance, manganese, ammonia, baryta, or strontia,
besides iron     and silica, which occur in proportionally           large quan
tities:'— G. W.
 3. On an       Application of the Laws of Numerical Harmonic
       Ratio to Forms generally, and particularly to that of the
       Human Figure. By D. R. Hay, Esq.
    The author stated in      some prefatory     remarks, that    a  belief in the
 operation of the laws of numerical harmonic ratio in the constitution
 of beautiful forms had long existed, although         those laws had not been
 systematised so as to render them applicable in the formative arts.
 In proof of this, Mr Hay quoted a correspondence upon the subject

                                           305
of harmonic ratio,        between    Sir John Harrington      and   Sir Isaac New
ton, in which the latter expresses           his belief in such laws in the fol
lowing words      :
                     "   I  am inclined    to believe some general laws         of the
Creator     prevailed with respect to the agreeable or unpleasing                affec
tions of all our senses        ;  at least  the supposition     does   not derogate
from the power or wisdom of God, and seems highly consonant to
the simplicity       of the    macrocosm      in general."     The belief of this
great philosopher, the author trusted, would form some apology to
men     of science for      the repeated    attempts he has made to establish
the fact.      These attempts he had hitherto made              with reference to
architecture, to ornamental           design, and latterly to the human head
and countenance        ;   but on the present occasion      he intended to shew
the operation     of  these laws in constituting      the symmetrical beauty of
the entire human figure.
    He next     proceeded       to point   out the remarkable       similarity that
 exists in the physical constitution of the organs of hearing and                  see
ing, and the manner in which external nature affects the sensorium
through     these    organs    ;  shewing the difference between         noises    and
 musical sounds in the one case, and irregular and regular forms in the
other.     He explained that each musical sound was produced by a
number of equal and regular impulses made upon the air, the fre
 quency of which determining the pitch of the sound, their violence
its loudness    ; and the nature of the material           by which the impulses
 were made its quality or tone.            In   like manner, he shewed that the
 effect  upon the optic nerve produced by external               objects   is simply
 that of the action of light, and amenable to the same laws.                 Variety
of form being analogous to variety of pitch ; variety of size to that
 of intensity or loudness, and variety of colour to that of quality or
 tone.
     Mr Hay next explained the nature of the harmonics of                       sound,
 which result from the spontaneous division of the string of a mono-
 chord by the formation of nodes during its vibratory motion.                       He
 then shewed how the harmonics of form could be evolved                     from the
 quadrant of a circle by the following process            :—
     From    a horizontal      line  MR    (figure 1, of the annexed Plate), he
 produced two parallel vertical lines              ML  and  RS indefinitely, and
 with a radius      MR      described, from the centre M, the quadrant OR.
 From O      he divided the arc of the quadrant into parts of            J,   },     J,
 },  I, and  \.     From the centre M, and through             these   divisions,    he
 produced the lines         MN, MP, MQ, MT, MU, MV, and MS, until

                                                   306
       RS, forming the right-angled triangles MPR, MQR,
they met
MTR, MUR, M VR, and MSR. He then shewed, that as the angles
at the vertex               of each     of these triangles,          contained         respectively
45°, 30°,       22° 30', 18°, 15°, 12° 51' 26", 11° 15', they                            related to
the right angle, as the harmonics of sound, expressed by the signs
c,             e~,                     W,    relate to the fundamental            note      C,    pro
     g,   c7         g, bb, and
duced by the string of the monochord.                         These triangles he combined
in the following manner upon a line                        AB     (figure   2,   of the annexed
Plate), which             he said might         be of any given length according to
the size of the figure to be                 formed.  From     at an angle of 11° 15'
                                                                   B
with      AB   he drew the line              Bg indefinitely, and from           A   at an angle
of 15° with          AB     the line    Ar,    also indefinitely,      and cutting Bg in           K.
Through     K he drew KL                    at right angles with       AB,    forming       the tri
angles     ALK and KLB.                     Through       K   he drew the line pO parallel
to   AB.       From         A   at an angle of 12° 51' 26" with              AB    he drew       AV,
cutting pO in  M, and drew MN at right angles with AB, forming
the triangle AMN.     From A at an angle of 18° with AB, he drew
Au, cutting pO in H, and drew HI at right angles with AB, form
ing the triangle AHI.    From A at an angle of 22° 30' with AB,
he drew At, cutting pO in     and drew FG at right angles with
                                              F,
AB, forming the triangle AFG. From A at an angle of 30° with
AB he drew As, cutting pO in     and drew CD at right angles with
                                                     C,
 AB, forming the triangle ACD. From       at an angle of 45° with
                                                               C
AB and CD he drew CE, forming the triangle CDE. Thus, he ob
served,    were           the triangles       arising     from the harmonic angles con
structed upon              AB    in the same relative proportions                 to each other,
that they were when formed upon the line                           RS, figure     1.       Upon the
other side of         AB      he constructed similar triangles forming the equila
teral triangle             ACC   ;   the right-angled          isosceles    triangle       ECC,   and
the acute-angled isosceles triangles                      AFF, AHH, AKK, AMM,                     and
BKK.           Within this diagram                 he shewed       that the human skeleton
could be formed in the most perfect proportions, determining, at the
same time, the centres of all the various motions of the joints  and                         ;
also that      the symmetrical               beauty of the external           form, whether in
a    front or profile            view, was governed by these angles                    ;   thus en
deavouring           to    prove that an application              of the laws of numerical
harmonic ratio in the practice of the sculptor and painter would give
these imitative arts  more scientific character than they at present
                                 a
possess,       and, so far from                retarding      the efforts    of genius,       would
rather tend to facilitate and assist them.

   The following Communications             were read    : —
1.  Note regarding the American Electric-Observing Clocks.
                     By Professor Piazzi Smyth.
   The object of this communication was chiefly to exhibit          a speci
men of the register of the electric chronograph, wherein the        second's
beats of two clocks were     marked side     by side, one going nearly to
sidereal time, and the other to solar    ;  and the length of a second's
interval on the paper was so great, and the accuracy of the punctua
tion such, that the minute acceleration of the one clock on the other
could be registered   almost from second to second.
   The electric register   can be applied with ease to any clock, and at
any distance from the recording apparatus       ;  and two or more clocks,
or they may be simple pendulums, can be made to register        their vibra
tions on the same slip    of paper.
    The author pointed out how this method might be made available
for determining the density of the earth, by observations on the
shores   of the Bay of Fundy, during the rise and fall of the enormous
tides which occur there.      He likewise mentioned several purposes to
which Lieutenant      Maury, U.   S. N.,   proposed   to apply the electric
chronograph     ; amongst others, to determining the height of moun
tains, as he thought that the accuracy capable of being attained in
determining the time of vibration of a pendulum in this manner, was
so  extreme, that the method might be safely applied to such problems.
2.   Account of a Remarkable Meteor, seen 19th December,
                  1849.   By Professor J. D. Forbes.
    " On the evening of   the 19th December 1849, whilst walking near
the   southern part of Edinburgh, about fifteen minutes past             five.
Greenwich      time (as I afterwards estimated),     I  observed a meteor,
fully brighter than Venus at her average brilliancy, moving from
W. towards N., parallel      to the horizon, elevated      15° above it, and
followed by a distinct luminous train.        This angle    was subsequently

                                                310
 taken by estimation by daylight,                 with the aid of a theodolite          ;  and
 the compass-bearing of the meteor, when first seen, ascertained in
 the same way, must have been 47° W. of N.                             When it bore 29°
 E. of magnetic north, it            was observed       to have divided into two, the
 one part following the other at some distance                    ;  and  I   soon after lost
 sight of it in     the obscurity of the smoke            of the town.         When it split,
 its altitude was estimated            at 6°.     It thus described       an arc   of no   less
than 76°, in doing which it occupied,                 as  I  roughly estimated, about
 15 seconds, or possibly more.
     "             sent a short notice        of                      of the meteor    to the
         Having                                   the appearance
 Courant newspaper,          I    received      from many quarters accounts             of its
 having been seen under circumstances remarkably similar                             to those
just     described.     I  believe      that nearly forty communications on the
 subject    have    reached     me     from places included between Longford,
 in the centre of Ireland, to near Bervie, in Kincardineshire, a dis
 tance     of  above    300    miles, in a direction nearly                NE.    and SW.,
 whilst in a perpendicular direction, or from                    NW. to SE,        the range
 of observation      has been comparatively small ; for                I  have received no.
 information from beyond Renfrew, in the one direction, and Durham
 in the other     ;  being about 140 miles distant in a straight line.                    The
 meteor was seen at Longford, in Ireland, 74 miles west of Dublin,
but not in Dublin itself.               It was seen at Belfast, between Carlisle
 and     Gretna     at  Stewarton         in Ayrshire,      at Johnstone,        at Paisley,
 Renfrew, and by many persons in Glasgow and the neighbourhood.
 It   was also      generally      seen in Edinburgh,            in East Lothian, near
 Melrose, and at JJurham,              as   already mentioned.         Further north,         I
 have received       accounts    from Crail, St Andrews, Dundee, Perth, and
Johnshaven to the north of Montrose.
     " The
              greater number of these communications concur in estimating
 the direction of the motion of the meteor to have been from SW. to
NE., although,         as might         be expected,      they vary excessively         as   to
its distance      and magnitude           ;  being described        by some persons as
only 50 or 100 yards off, and as large as the moon                          ;  by others, as
a ball of 9 inches in diameter, or the size                 of  a large egg.       One per
son only professes to have heard a sound.                      The time during which
it  was seen was variously estimated.                 At Longford,       by   Mr  Curtis, 20
sec.   ;  at Glasgow, by      Mr Stevenson, at 20                sec. ; at Johnstone,       by
Mr    Cunningham,         15 sec.    ;   at  Perth, 15 or 20 sec. ; at Durham, by
Mr Carrington, 30          sec.  ;  at   St Andrews, 15 seconds according to one

                                              311
observer,          and 18 to 21 seconds according to another               ;   at Johnshaven,
Jths of a minute.     The hour of the appearance of the meteor, in
most of the descriptions, is stated at between 5h. 10m., and 5h. 16m.
   " The arc of the horizon which it                 was seen to traverse depended,
of course,          on the point where the meteor first caught the observer's
eye.           At    it was traced by Professor Kelland through
                     Granton,
125° of azimuth ; at Perth, 130; at St Andrew's^0; at Edin
burgh, 76° ; at Durham, 65° ; at Glasgow, from 60° to 70°.  The
division of the head or nucleus into several parts, and, first of all                         (in
most cases),          into two, has been noticed with remarkably slight varia
tion   ;   consequently, the explosion of the meteor marks                       a   well-deter
mined point in its path.               The separation             was   specially noticed at
Edinburgh, Granton, Glasgow, Renfrew, Melrose, Haddington, Johns-
haven, Perth, Durham, St Andrews.
   " In        a   majority of cases   a   luminous train was observed           ;    and
                                                                                        I    am
confident, that the existence of this train, which has been estimated
at from 2° to 3° long, cannot be questioned.                       Dr Adamson, however,
especially remarked that no train was to be seen at St Andrews.
   " On revising the whole accounts,                 it   does not appear that any of
them can be relied upon, for ascertaining the position of the meteor in
space, except the observations          of Mr Carrington of the Durham ob
servatory       ;   of Professor Kelland, Mr Stirling, and myself, at Edin
burgh      ;   of Dr Adamson           and another observer, communicated                     by
Professor Fischer of St Andrew's               ;    of   a   young gentleman at Perth,
communicated by Thomas                 Miller, Esq., Rector of the Perth Aca
demy   ;      A. D. Stevenson, Esq., and W. Gourlie, Esq., junior,
               and of
at Glasgow.   My inquiries were chiefly directed to the two follow
ing points: first, the angular elevation of the meteor in the
NW.        quarter of the heavens, where             it      is   admitted by all that its
path appeared           almost horizontal     ;    secondly, to the bearing of the
meteor at the instant of explosion.
   " At Durham, Mr Carrington saw the meteor first when the bear
ing was true NW., the altitude (by theodolite) was then 10°, or
not exceeding 11°; when     burst,  was due N. (true), and con
                                       it           it
tinued to move 10° or 12° further before                     it   disappeared.        Professor
Chevallier,         who obligingly communicated these results, states that the
meteor appeared           rather to rise as    it   approached the north, but with
a doubt.  This supposition, however,                 appears       inadmissable, from the
unanimity of the other accounts.

                                       312
    " At Granton, near
                             Edinburgh, Professor Kelland caught sight of
the meteor a little to the N. of the moon, and several diameters
below it.     This   corresponds,  by after estimation          with a theodolite,
to 75° W. of magnetic N., and an altitude of 12°.                Professor Kelland
thinks that it rather rose afterwards.           It split into two at 20°           E. of
magnetic     N., having then     an altitude   of only 5°; it continued for             a
considerable time bright,       then began     to fade, as      if  by the effect      of
distance, and also to separate into several parts            :   it  was    finally lost
sight of 50°     E. of magnetic N. (this bearing           is well       ascertained),
with an altitude estimated at only half a degree.                  The position and
circumstances of these observations, made at an elevated station above
the   Frith of Forth,     were eminently favourable.
    " Mr J. Stirling, civil    engineer, looking up North Hanover Street,
Edinburgh,      saw the meteor separate          into two parts       ;   the bearing
he afterwards      estimated at 25°      E.   of magnetic        N. (the probable
error not exceeding 1°), and the altitude            at 8° 30', certainly not
exceeding 9°.
    " I think  we may conclude, that at       Edinburgh the meteor attained
a maximum elevation of 15° (that mentioned in the commencement
of this paper), since it no doubt rose after Professor Kelland first
saw   it to the S. of the true    W., with    an altitude     of only       12°.    The
course of the meteor was evidently such as to be nearest                   the specta
tor when in the true       NW. or WNW.
    " The   place of the meteor when       it burst  stands thus        : —
                    Kelland, N. 20° E. (mag.)          Alt.    5°.
                    Stirling, N. 25° E.               Alt.    8° 30'.
                    Forbes,    N. 29° E.              Alt.     6°.
    " The             is almost 25°   E. of N., or about          1° W. of      the true
            average
meridian, the variation being nearly 26°.             The    mean       of the three
observations of altitude would be 6° 30'         ; but admitting       Mr Stirling's
to be entitled to the greatest confidence,          we   may suppose           it 7°, or
possibly a little more.
    " At St Andrews, the meteor          was   seen   by  Dr Adamson, when
riding in a northerly direction, on the Largo road.               Professor Fischer
was so kind as to accompany him afterwards to the spot, and to re
duce    his observations with      all the accuracy of which they were
capable.     It  was  first noticed when bearing 8J° W. of magnetic N.,
and    disappeared    at 42*°    E. of N.   ; the altitude was conjecturally

                                         313
stated as between     14° and I850, and it appeared to move horizontally,
but rather declining towards the          N.
   " After describing three-fourths of its        course,    it split into two parts,
which went on close together for a little, then broke into four or five,
became    dull red,  and rapidly disappeared        ; the separate pieces travel
ling  on together   until the last.
   " Another intelligent observer near St Andrews,                   whose   evidence
                                                                   °
was taken by    Mr Fischer,      first saw the meteor 29} W. of magnetic
N.,  and estimated the point where the meteor burst at 44° E. of N. ;
but this last number coincides so closely with           Dr Adamson's estimate
of the point of final disappearance, that it is perhaps allowable to
suppose,   that this second observer had mixed up these two events in
his description.     Dr Adamson's          statement, that one-fourth           of the
arc which he saw was        described after the meteor had split, would
give an azimuth at that moment of almost 30°                    E. of N. magnetic,
or 4°  E. of N. true,    as  Mr Fischer determined the magnetic decli
nation to be about 25° 46'.           The altitude of the meteor,          as seen by
this observer, appears not to have exceeded 15° (the same as at Edin
burgh) ; which number we shall therefore adopt.
   " At Perth, the                                                              North
                        passage of the meteor was seen from the
Inch, by   a young gentleman of intelligence, whose observations were
reduced   to numbers     by  Mr Miller,       Rector    of the Perth Academy,
who was so good as to         accompany him to the spot, and take the
angles with a theodolite.         Its bearing, when first           seen, was 46° S.
of W. true    ; its angular altitude was at that time only 3° 30'.                This
is by far the most southern azimuth which               has been observed.          Its
bearing, when it disappeared, was 6° W. of N., but it was then lost
in a cloud.     If I  understand right, it had, by this time, separated
into fragments.       Its apparent altitude, in the middle of its              course,
was about 17° 30'.        These observations, extending over an arc of
130°, taken along with Professor Kellaud's, clearly demonstrate that
the meteor appeared       with a very low altitude in the SW. quarter of
the heavens, and disappeared in a similar way in the                  NNE.,    attain
ing its greatest elevation about         WNW. (true.)
    " At Glasgow the meteor          was very generally and well seen.             Mr
William Gourlie junior         saw    it  move from     SW.     to   NNE.,    over   an
arc of 60° or 70°, and divide into two, when              it  bore 40°    E. of mag
netic  N.    He   estimates    its   greatest   elevation at 30°, and that it

                                         314
decreased to between       15° and 17°, or even         less, at the time          of its
separation.     He   adds, that he is not much accustomed                 to such ob
servations.     Mr A. D.      Stevenson, living       in South Portland Street,
Glasgow, saw the meteor moving along, at a height                  just sufficient to
clear the chimney-tops, on the west side of the street, an elevation
which he afterwards estimated,          as he states,    with considerable         accu
racy at 28°.     I have    received   farther and more minute accounts                 of
the appearance of the meteor from            Mr   Stevenson, who has been most
kind and intelligent in his communications ; and my friend Mr James
Peddie has verified the accuracy of Mr Stevenson's observations be
yond the possibility of mistake.           It  appears   that the meteor passed
quite clear of a stack of chimneys on the opposite side of the street,
which would give it a well-defined minimum altitude of 25° 41'                      ; but
Mr    Stevenson  is of opinion that it rose more than 2° higher, or to
not less than 28° (perhaps even to 28° 21') ; when it was highest,
its bearing was 52|° W. of N. (magnetic), and it disappeared from
his view when it bore 40° 27'         E. of magnetic N.           It  was     then    de
cidedly single.     Now, this bearing coincides           with that at which          Mr
Gourlie observed      it to become double ; and, consequently, the                 limit
towards   the N. of this event is severely defined.

not   (I conceive)  be cleared up without additional and accurate ones,
which it may now be too late to procure.                The central group of
stations, Edinburgh,     Perth, and St Andrews,         are sufficiently accord
ant, and indicate that the path of the meteor must have been nearly
parallel to a line passing through the first and last of those             places,
or in a direction   N. 27° E. (true)     ; which accords well with the ob
servations at most of the individual         stations, and particularly with
the vanishing direction in Professor Kelland's remarkable               observa
tion at Granton.
   "   2. The Durham observation is compatible with the above-men
tioned group within       the limits    of error.     By the combination          of
Durham and Edinburgh (the base line perpendicular to the assumed
direction of the meteor's motion being 95 miles),             I calculated that
the meteor passed vertically nearly over the Island of St Kilda, with
an absolute elevation of about 88 miles.             But this solution      seems
absolutely excluded by observations at Glasgow which admit of no
question, and which     I have   spared no pains in verifying.          Had the
position of the meteor      been  such as   I have    first  assumed,    it could
not possibly have been seen over even the roofs of the houses                 from
the station occupied by      Mr  Stevenson, much less over the chimney-
tops.     The bearing, at the moment of explosion at Glasgow,                  also
singularly    enough corroborates      sufficiently well the comparatively
small elevation (about 20 miles above the earth) which the combina
tion of Edinburgh and Glasgow gives ; and this bearing we have
seen to have been also accurately defined by the physical               obstacles
bounding the observer's view       ; it would   have given a parallax of 15°,
subtended    by the   perpendicular    on the meteor's path,         referred to
Glasgow and Edinburgh respectively.            Now, if    this calculation were
anything like correct, the Perth observation is entirely wrong              ;   and
the meteor could not have risen about 6° above the horizon of Dur
ham, instead of 10° or 11° as estimated.            I am    unable, in any de
gree, to explain these conflicting results.
   "  3.  The observations of Professor Kelland at Granton, and those
at Perth, through    the great azimuths of 125° and 130°, described by
the meteor with such remarkable deliberation of motion, lead, when
analyzed, to the very same results which presented themselves to the

                                                     316
mind of the spectator intuitively                ;    namely, that the motion must have
been       sensibly rectilinear,          equable,     and parallel           to    the horizon          at
Edinburgh.                Assuming that the greatest altitude at Edinburgh was
15°, and the bearing then                  N. 63° W. (true),              we may calculate that
the       altitude     should have been on this hypothesis, when first                                seen
by Professor              Kelland, 11° 47', — instead of 12°                       as   observed;        at
explosion, 6° 59' (7° observed), and at its final disappearance 0°47'
(instead of 0° 30' observed). Again, at Perth the observed altitude,
when first seen, was 3                    and the calculated altitude 5° 3', taking the
maximum altitude at 17^°.                      The coincidence              is,   on the whole, re
markable, though              it   would be rash to push             it   to an extreme, as an
error of some degrees may exist in the assumption of the direction
of the meteor's            course.      Some later observations, received from                          Mr
Curtis at Longford, and               a   consideration of the effects of perspective
at Perth and Edinburgh, incline me to admit that the path might
make an angle 3° or 4° greater with the meridian than                                   I     have above
supposed.             These conclusions are independent of the actual distance
or parallax of the meteor              ;     which, as     I      have   said, cannot be deter
mined without further                 observations, which          I     should be glad to re
ceive       from any quarter,           but more particularly                 from Ireland,           and
from the centre and                NW.     of Scotland.            If    correct, they entitle          us
to infer that the meteor               in question         was most probably            a   body moving
in    space, in       a   path little curved, and not revolving round the earth."
3.   Notes on the Purification and Properties of Chloroform.
     By William Gregory, M.D., Professor of Chemistry in the
     University.*
      1.    Chloroform        has     been    prepared both from alcohol and from
wood-spirit.              The latter has       been        used    for the sake of cheapness             ;
but as      it   is   a    mixture     of several liquids, all of which do not yield
chloroform,                        an impure product, in     proportion which varies
                  is it
                          gives                                     a
much, but                 always below that obtained from alcohol.                              There    is
     *    Although   I    am alone responsible       for   the opinions contained            in this paper,
it   is   my duty to state, that all the       experiments and observations mentioned                    in
it   have          by me in concert with my able assistant,
             been made                                                                      Mr Alexander
Kemp, of whose ingenuity and accuracy  have had constant opportunities
                                                      I                                                  of
judging.

                                                       317
therefore not only no advantage,                         but the contrary, in using wood-
spirit, which is not, after all, much cheaper than alcohol.
   2. But the chloroform from these two liquids, when fully purified,
is quite identical in all its properties.   Its smell, density, boiling
point, and action on the system are, in both cases, exactly the same.
That from alcohol is,                     no doubt, more easily purified              than the other              ;
but it also contains volatile oily impurities,                            which must be removed
before it can be safely used.                         The peculiar oils which             adhere to both
kinds of chloroform are not identical, or, at least, not all identical                                            ;
but they are of analagous constitution and properties.
     3.    Soubeiran and Mialhe have examined these oils.                                          They     con
tain chlorine, have a disagreeable smell, and, when inspired or smelt,
cause distressing headache and sickness.                                 In the    case   of wood-spirit,
some      of its own impurities distil over                         unchanged,       and are found in
the chloroform.
     4.    It   is well known that many persons,                         after the use of chloro
form, have suffered from headache,                             nausea,    and even vomiting, as                   I
have more than                     once    seen.      Headache and nausea                 I    have       myself
experienced, when                    I    have     tried different       specimens        of chloroform,
without taking                so    much as to produce the full effect.
     5. Perfectly             pure chloroform, such as is now on the table, does
not, so far as           I     have seen or experienced, produce                    these disagreeable
effects.         It     is,   therefore, highly probable that when they occur, as
they do with some individuals, from the use of chloroform                                             of    more
than the average goodness of quality, this depends                                    on the presence
of   a    trace of these poisonous oils.
     6.    All    good manufacturers of chloroform                         purify    it       by   the     action
of oil of vitriol         ;        which destroys the oils, while, at the same time,                            a
part of the acid               is   reduced        to sulphurous acid.             The chloroform,             to
remove          this,   is     then distilled with lime or carbonate of baryta, and
is   tolerably pure,               if   the process be well conducted.
     7.    But this           is   not quite pure, and contains                a   trace, more            or less
distinct, of the oils.                  I   have      found this to be the case with all the
best chloroform made here, up to 1849                                ;   and
                                                                           I       have       several times
seen headache                 and sickness from the use of such chloroform, which,
as we      all know,           was the best anywhere made.                  I      must add, however,
that the quantity of oils was, although variable within certain limits,
always, in the Edinburgh-made                          chloroform, so small, that              it   was    fit for
use, and only caused headache,&c.,                        in   a   few peculiarlysensitive persons.

                                                        318
    8.    It   was desirable to have a test for these impurities,                               as well as
an easy and effectual mode                         of removing           the last traces        of them            ;
especially as many sorts of chloroform, not made here, were far in
ferior in quality            to that prepared in Edinburgh.                             One very deli
cate test       is,   that oil of vitriol, which should be quite colourless and
pure (as     may be rendered by Mr Kemp's process, lately read to
               it
the Society), when agitated with the chloroform, becomes yellow or
brown, from its action on the oils, which                           it   chars and destroys.            Any
change        of colour     is   easily seen by the contrast with the colourless
chloroform which floats above.               Pure chloroform gives no colour to
the acid.         It   is   essential that the oil of vitriol be colourless, and
also    of full density      ;       for,   if   coloured,    it    is   not easy to      see     a    slight
change in its colour            ;     and    if    below the proper density, that                      is,   too
weak,     it    is    not much coloured by                    a   chloroform which will render
brown the acid of proper strength.
   9.     Another       test,    still more delicate,         I      find to be the smell of the
oils.        When chloroform                is   poured on the hand or a handkerchief                         it
rapidly evaporates           ;       but the oils, being less volatile, are left behind,
and      their smell, previously covered                       by that of the chloroform,                     is
easily recognised.               Until very lately,               no chloroform          was      sold, or,
indeed,       known, which would stand this test, or even the former.
   10.       Up   to 1849, the best                commercial chloroform                had    a   specific
gravity of 1-480, which was considered a guarantee of its purity.
But     it   had been obtained, by chemists, of specific gravity                              1   -494 and
even      1-497.      I     have found that chloroform                      of 1-480,         when      once
more acted on by oil of vitriol, which destroys the oils and becomes
brown, may be obtained, after removing the sulphurous acid, of spe
cific gravity 1-500 at 60°.                       This  I     take to be the specific gravity
of pure chloroform.                   Our        best   makers have         lately, much to their
credit, pushed the purification                         so far as to furnish chloroform even
of this highest density, and                     also, in other respects,         such as         it   ought
to be.
   11. There            are still, however, many makers,                          in     other places,
whose        chloroform         is    not so pure        ;    and  I      shall   now    describe the
method which, with               Mr Kemp,           I     have employed for purifying,                   per
fectly and easily, any commercial chloroform (except one remarkable
specimen,         of which more hereafter),                   a process which       will enable any
medical        man to purify          it    for himself with the greatest facility.
    12.      The chloroform, having been tested as above, and found more

                                                      319
or less impure,               is     with oil of vitriol (half its own
                                      to be agitated
volume will be sufficient), and allowed to remain in contact with the
acid ; of course in a clean, dry, stoppered                                 bottle, and with occasional
agitation,          till the acid        no longer becomes darker in colour.                           As long
as the action is incomplete there                           will   be seen, after rest at the line
of contact, a darker ring. When this no longer appears, the chlo
roform may be drawn off, and, for greater security, once more acted
on by a quarter               of its volume of the acid, which should                            now remain
colourless.             It    is now to be once more drawn off, and,                                  in    a   dry
stoppered         bottle, mixed with a little powdered peroxide of manganese,
with which it            is gently agitated and left                    in contact, until the odour
of sulphurous                acid      is entirely      destroyed, and the chloroform                           has
acquired a mild agreeable                   fruity smell.   It has then only to be
poured off into a                 proper phial.   It will now leave no disagreeable
smell when evaporated on the hand.                                      (If    the commercial              chloro
form, after having been frequently well shaken, and left                                             for     some
time in contact with the acid, has given only a moderate                                              tinge of
colour to         it,   it   is   probable that        it   may be completely purified by that
first process.               To ascertain this, test               a   small portion in         a    tube with
fresh acid, shaking well, and allowing                             it    to stand some time.                 If   it
do not colour the acid at                     all, then the whole chloroform                     has only to
be finally purified by the oxide of                          manganese.               If     the acid become
coloured in the test tube,   will be          it              as well to act on the whole chlo
roform      a     second time with                 fresh acid,         till   it    stands    the test.         Mr
Kemp          has       observed,         in repeating this process                     for    me,   the very
curious fact that, as soon as the action                               is   complete and the oily im
purities are destroyed, but not sooner, the chloroform tested with the
acid in       a   tube exhibits           a   strongly convex surface downwards, where
it   rests on the pure acid, or, what                       is   the same thing, the acid becomes
concave       at its upper surface.                    The smallest trace of impurity, not
sufficient to affect the density of the chloroform, we have found to
render the line of junction horizontal.                                It     is   probable that this may
become        a     valuable           test   of the perfect purity of chloroform,                              but
we    shall not say more on this subject until we have                                            thoroughly
examined it.)
     This     process        requires no apparatus beyond                      a    few stoppered      bottles,
and   a   syphon, or              a   pipette,   if   we wish to draw off the whole chloro
form without loss.        The use of the oxide of manganese due to Mr                           is
Kemp      ;    and, on the large scale, the chloroform may be filtered

                                                   320
through a cylinder full of it.                 In  this final purification    of genuine,
although not quite pure chloroform, no distillation                     is necessary.
     13.   It   may be considered as certain, that the use of chloroform,
thus purified, will very rarely,                if ever, cause the disagreeable effects
above noticed.*              As     to  more serious      bad results     from the use of
 chloroform, so often spoken of elsewhere, it is enough to state, that
 a large proportion of the cases must be attributed to the use of a
liquid    so impure, as hardly to deserve the name                  of chloroform at all.
 Such a product,            I rejoice    to say, our Edinburgh manufacturers have
never sold      ;   and,    I  may add, that, no doubt chiefly in consequence of
this, our practitioners have not yet seen a fatal result from the use
of chloroform.            But in London, and elsewhere, chloroform                has been
extensively sold, so bad, that               I  have examined specimens         which did
not contain half of their bulk of chloroform                  ; others with not one third
or one fourth         ;  and    I   have seen one which hardly contained any at
all.      But,    to make up for this, they were             rich in  poisonous   oils, and
    * Dr   Simpson informs me, that the purest chloroform he has used not unfre-
 quently causes vomiting.             On further inquiry I find that this occurs when it is
 administered after a full meal.            This can easily be avoided, and must not be
confounded with the headaches, nausea, and vomiting alluded to in §§ 4 and 5 ;
which symptoms          are persistent, and occurred,     in my experiments, always with
an empty stomach,          the experiments being made       an hour or two before dinner.
Dr Carmichael, assistant           to  Dr Simpson,   has mentioned to me some facts which
confirm the view          I have taken. At one period, for more than a week, Dr
Simpson and Dr Carmichael were kept in a state of continual anxiety by the
occurrence, in all the puerperal cases in which chloroform was used, of very
unpleasant symptoms,            particularly of frequent pulse and other febrile symp
toms,    lasting for some days.              At last, after much annoyance from this
cause, it occurred to Dr Simpson that he was using one particular speci
men    of chloroform, supposed to be of good quality.                 As soon  as  this idea
occurred, he threw away all that remained, and returned               to that which he had
generally used.          The unpleasant symptoms no longer           appeared.     (I regret
much that I had not an opportunity of examining that                  specimen; but I may
add that the maker, not an Edinburgh one, now produces chloroform of much
better quality, though not yet absolutely pure.) But the striking fact is this,
that Dr Simpson and Dr Carmichael state, that daring the period above alluded
to, when that      one kind of chloroform alone was used by them, their handkerchiefs
became    quite offensive from the smell left on them, which even adhered to them after
washing.      There can,      I  think, be no doubt that here the oily impurities alluded
to  in §§  4  and   5   were present in notable quantity. I suspect that a majority of
the specimens       mentioned in the Table would have a similar effect, more or less
marked.      (I have since ascertained that this chloroform, which was much above
the average     in quality, had not been subjected to the action of oil of vitriol in ttt
 preparation, which strongly confirms the view I have taken. W. G.)

often in free     hydrochloric      acid.     Very    many specimens, although
better than this, are yet so impure, that no one could, with comfort
or safety,   use them.
    14. The chloroform now, and for some time past, made here, is
of first-rate   quality.      I  have     two specimens       which are absolutely
pure, or nearly so       ; and a third, which is hardly inferior,              all made
and sold by     Edinburgh manufacturers.
    15. On the other          hand,    I   have various      specimens, maker un
known, besides some from makers in other places, which are not so
pure, although, in general, much purer than those which                    I   examined
nearly three years ago.         But   one specimen     deserves a separate        notice.
It  is labelled     " pure                        It is yellowish, has a strong
                              chloroform."
smell of the oils, and of impure wood-spirit ; and, when treated with
its own volume of oil of vitriol, developes much heat, colours the acid
dark brown, and disappears almost entirely, any trace of chloroform
it may contain being boiled off by the heat disengaged.                     It contains
also so much free acid, that the cork is corroded.                 It  is to be hoped
that this product disgraces no longer the market.                     I   do not know
the name of its maker. Three of the specimens became milky, when
mixed with the acid.           One, after contact with the acid, acquired a
strong smell of musk.           Another lost about        a  third of its bulk.       All
but two coloured the acid decidedly at once            ;   and all left, more or less,
a disagreeable smell on the hand.                One of the two which did not
 much colour the acid at first was that which acquired the smell of
 musk   ;  the other, evaporated on the hand, left a white stain, depend
 ing partly on the matters present in the skin.                  This    was    the  case
also  with another      ;  yet these two coloured the acid but little at first,
more strongly        after a time    :     but both left a smell on the hand.
Only one (Edinburgh made) specimen, of density 1-500,                           gave no
colour, or only a perceptible tinge, to the acid.
    16.   In  conclusion,    I would     remark, that       while   the   use of chlo
roform in Edinburgh, in many thousand cases, has never yet led to a
fatal result,    I   do not intend       to maintain     that the use of pure chlo
roform never can cause fatal effects.               On the contrary,         I  have   no
doubt that,      if   rashly,   carelessly,     or ignorantly       administered,      so
powerful     an agent may, like any other powerful                drug, especially in
individuals of peculiar temperament, and in cases of severe, though
latent internal disease, give rise to fatal results.               That no such cases
have here been met with is due partly to the good quality of the

                                                    322
chloroform         used,    and       to the care with which it is prepared                   ;   and
partly to the experience and judicious management of those whose
duty it is to administer it, at the head of whom stands the introducer
of chloroform, my friend and colleague, Dr Simpson.
     It   is much to be regretted that, in London and elsewhere, chloro
form is not by any means              extensively employed as it ought to be,
                                           so
in   consequence          of the occurrence of some fatal cases, attributed
(whether in all cases accurately or not, is a question) to the drug.
There can be no doubt that most, if not all, of these cases have
resulted from the use of very impure chloroform, such as even at a
recent period was largely sold in London ; and that, if pure chloro
form alone had been employed, there would, by this time, have been
no prejudice against              its use.         It   is not, as   I    have shewn, necessary
that chloroform            should be very impure,                   in order to produce very
disagreeable or even dangerous results.   It is evident that even a
small proportion of the oils above mentioned, if they are deleterious
(and this cannot,           I
                  think, be doubted), will suffice, when applied in
the form of vapour to the internal surface of the lungs, to act
powerfully        on the system.                On the other hand,                  I   am far from
blaming those chemists who                      have manufactured             impure chloroform
for anything            more than a want of due care in the preparation of an
agent so energetic.              And it is but fair to bear in mind that it                   was a
new manufacture, hardly yet                     fully understood, and that those                  who
made   it were not probably aware, either of the existence of the im
purities, or of the best mode of removing them.        have no doubt            I
they did their best to produce a good article                         ;    and my chief object in
this paper has been to put it in the power of every one to do so, and
to   point out strongly               the bad effects          of    even     a small amount        of
impurity.
     While    I   acquit the makers of impure chloroform of any desire                              to
adulterate        it,
                   I         right to add that some of them must have
                          think   it
been      entirely ignorant of what was published concerning its proper
ties.      Thus some sold     of specific gravity 1-465, others of 1-347
                                     it                                                             ;
and in the case of No.                8,   which I      have no doubt was under 1-000,
although   I      had not enough to take its density accurately, the maker
had evidently            rejected the chloroform,               and preserved the lighter
liquid floating over            it!  — not      knowing       even        that chloroform     was   a
heavy liquid.   It lamentable to think that persons so ignorant are
                            is
free, by our laws, to set up as makers of the most potent drugs.

                                      323
    I  may here add, that no rectification       at all is required    from the
first,  if the chloroform     be only washed with water     till its volume   no
longer diminishes, and then treated, as above, with concentrated sul
phuric acid.
    It  is possible that some of the fatal cases may have occurred from
an injudicious mode of administering the vapour, or from the opera
tor intrusting the administration to persons not qualified to recognise
those signs which tell the experienced practitioner          that it is time to
stop.      There ought always to      be two well-qualified   persons present,
— one      to watch,      without intermission,   the effects   of the vapour,
which he also administers as required        ;  the other, of course,    to ope
rate.     He who gives the chloroform must carefully attend to the
state of the respiration, as has been often recommended by Dr
Simpson.         But these are matters beyond the proper province of
this paper, and       I  leave them them to those who are better qualified
than    I am    to discuss them.
    I  have only to add, that this paper was written         and read before    I
heard of a recent article in      "  Chambers'    Journal "    on   the subject ;
and that      I  had not the remotest knowledge of or concern in that
article,    which   I   have not yet seen, although, as        I  am told, the
author of it agrees with some of my conclusions in regard to the em
ployment of chloroform in London.

4.   On a Peruvian Musical              Instrument,       like the ancient
                         Syrinx.     By Dr Traill.
    The author prefaced his description of the instrument, by a few
general remarks on the communication, in very remote epochs, be
tween the inhabitants of the old and new           worlds, as deducible from
affinities in their traditions,   their   cosmogonies,    their religious rites
and structures,    their astronomical cycles, and their determination of
the length of the year.

                                    326
    The Peruvian     instrument  was   discovered,     some    years ago, in a
huaco, or vast tumulus, that was believed to cover the remains            of an
 Inca of Peru.    It is not of unequal reeds, like the Greek syrinx,
 but is cut out of a piece of potstone, of a trapezoidal form, in which
are cut eight tubular holes of unequal depths.           These tubes or holes
are of equal diameter, and have been carefully made with some sort
of drill.   The breadth of the instrument, including           a short handle,
is 6-2 inches ; its greatest depth, 5 3     inches;     and the thickness     of
the stone varies from 0-7 to 0-5 inch.        The instrument in principle
and in form is analogous to the Pan's pipe of antiquity, or to the
organetto of modern Italy ; but has one remarkable difference in a
small ventilage on each of four of its pipes      ;   when one is uncovered,
that pipe is mute, but when covered by the fingers of the player, the
full sound is produced.
   A strolling Italian, who performed well           on   the organetto,    was
employed for several evenings to play on the Peruvian             instrument ;
and, with the assistance of three skilful musical friends, one of whom
was an adept on the violoncello,    the author of the paper was enabled
to ascertain the scale of the instrument.        This    scale extended from
E  on the lower line, through     F  sharp, G,      A, D,   C sharp,   F to  A,
above the lines.     By   means of the ventilages, the ordinary        notes  of
the instrument    seemed to be divisable      into two      tetrachords, — one
in the key of  E  minor, the other of    F  major — the first a perfect te-
trachord  ; the second, nearly so.
    The form of the instrument and its      use have a striking      similarity
to the Syrinx of the Greeks, the invention of which was ascribed to
the god Pan, or to Egypt ; and it is worthy of notice, that the great
musical system of the Greeks also consisted of tetrachords. A syrinx
of unequal reeds was found by the celebrated Humboldt, in the
hands of the natives, on the banks of the Orinocco.              It is in use
among the Arabs of the desert, and a similar instrument, composed
of twelve unequal reeds, is figured by Kaempfer            among the instru
ments of the Japanese.
    2. Some    Remarks on Cometary Physics.                  By Professor
                             Piazzi Smyth.
    That theories of the physical appearances of       comets have generally
failed, appeared   to the author to arise from the facts having been mis
understood   or misinterpreted in general by the observers         themselves.

                                         327
As   a particular   instance of this, the wide-spread          notion of comets
shooting forth their tails, at, or a little before the perihelion passage,
and drawing them in again afterwards, so as to be larger at that period
of their orbits than at any other, was mentioned ; and in place of
which, the author shewed that the comets were at the perihelion, of
their smallest size    ;  the tails becoming then more visible, not from
being actually produced at that time, but from being more dense,
and illumined by a stronger solar light, as well as being in general
seen from a smaller terrestrial        distance.
    The author then      proceeded    to collect together the facts which he
thought well made out with regard to comets            ;   to describe    the   cor
rections which     the apparent, required, to give the true phenomena               ;
and to detail the various practical methods by which better observa
tions might be procured.
    The so-called established facts mentioned         above, were collected       in
a series of axioms, which are here appended              ;  as they seem      to be
worthy of being discussed,         and either disproved or assented          to, by
astronomers.
    1st,  A  comet consists      of a nucleus, and one or more gaseous           en
 velopes.
    2d, The nucleus,      if  solid and material, is infinitely small.
    3d, The nucleus is excentrically situated in the gaseous body.
    4.th, Comets of longest period have the largest bodies.
    5 th, Those comets whose orbits have the greatest excentricity,              are
 the most excentrically      situated in their envelopes,     or, vulgarly, have
 the longest tails.
    6th,  A   comet revolves on an axis passing through              the nucleus,
and at right angles to the major axis of the envelope, in the same
period of time that it takes to revolve about the sun            ;  hence the tail
 being turned away from the sun in the normal                position,  is  turned
away from him in all other parts of the orbit also.
    1th, This axis is not at right angles to the plane of the orbit,
but variously inclined in the case of different comets, as with the
planets.
    8th,  A   quicker rotation round the        longer axis of the      body    also
appears to exist.
    9th,  A   comet    shines    by  reflected light, and shews        a sensible
phase.
    10th,   The   gaseous    envelope   is of extreme tenuity, is elastic, and,

                                                  328
with regard to light,          isslightly reflective and imperfectly transpa
rent   ;   it decreases    in size, but increases in density and light reflec
tive power in approaching the perihelion,                         and the reverse when re
ceding from it      ;   and this occurs in a degree proportioned to the ex-
centricity of the orbits of the comets.
   11th, The axis of the tail of a comet                         is straight at the perihelion,
but at any point between this and the aphelion,                             is curved      ;    and is
concave      towards the latter, the radius of curvature being inversely
as the excentricity        of the orbit.
     12th,    The molecules composing the                      envelope    of   a comet are only
held together by their mutual gravitation,                        each constituting almost a
separate independent projectile, and describing its own parabola about
the sun.
3.    Abstract of Professor Kelland's Exposition of the Views
          of D. It. Hay, Esq., on Symmetric Proportion.
  The fundamental hypothesis of the author was stated to be this : —
That the eye is capable of appreciating the exact subdivision of
spaces,    just   as the ear is capable              of appreciating the exact subdivi
sions of intervals of time              ;   so   that the division of space into an exact
number of equal parts will affect the eye agreeably in the same way
that the division of the time of vibration in music, into an exact num
ber of equal parts, agreeably affects the ear.                            But the question now
arises, What spaces does the eye most readily divide                             ?   It   was stated
that the author supposes those spaces to be angles, not lines                              ;    believ
ing that the eye is more affected by direction than by distance.                                  The
basis of his theory, accordingly,                    is,   that bodies     are agreeable to the
eye, so far as symmetry             is      concerned,      whenever the principal angles
are exact submultiples             of   some common fundamental angle.                         Accord
ing to this theory we should expect to find, that spaces,           the               in which
prominent lines are horizontal and vertical lines, will be agreeable to
the eye, when   all the principal parallelograms fulfil the condition
that the diagonals make with the sides, angles which are exact sub-
multiples of one or of few right angles. This application of the theory
                               a
was    exemplified        by   a   sketch of the new Corn Exchange erected in
the Grassmarket by David Cousin Esq., whose                               beautiful       design was
shewn to have been constructed                    with     a   special reference to the fulfil
ment of this condition.
     The author was stated to proceed to apply his theory to the con

                                         329
struction of the human figure, in which we should expect a            priori    to
find the most perfect development of symmetric beauty.               Diagrams
were exhibited which represent,        with remarkable accuracy, the human
figure ; and it was explained that not a single lineal measure is
employed in their construction.           The line which shall represent the
height of the figure being once assumed,            every other line is deter
mined by means of angles alone.           For the female figure,   those angles
are, one-half, one-third, one-fourth, one-fifth, one-sixth, one-seventh,
and one-eighth     of a right angle, and       no others.  It must be evident,
therefore, that, admitting        the supposition    that the eye appreciates
and approves of the equal division of the space about a point, this
 figure is the most perfect which can be conceived.           Every line makes
with every other line     a good angle.         The male figure  was stated      to
 be constructed upon the female figure by altering most           of the angles
 in the proportion of 9    :  8 ; the proportion    which the ordinary untem-
 pered flat seventh bears to the tonic.
     A  drawing was exhibited, which had been designed with great care
 from the life, by the distinguished academician        John A. Houston, Esq.
 On this drawing the author had constructed his diagrams              ;   and the
 coincidence of theory with fact was seen to be complete.               Professor
 Kelland concluded by claiming for the author the attention of the
  Society.    He argued, that a principle so simple and comprehensive
 in its character, and thus far apparently truthful in the conclusions
 to which   it leads, merits, and should receive, the most complete and
 rigid examination.      Whatever might be the ultimate result (and it
 promised to be satisfactory in the extreme), the ingenuity, energy,
 and zeal, shewn by the author, entitle him to our warm approba
  tion.

   The following Communications              were read: —
1. On the     Constitution of Codeine, and its Products of De
            composition.       By Thomas Anderson, M.D.
   The author commenced his paper by referring to the analysis of
codeine made by different chemists.         On these analyses four different
formulae  had been founded      ;  but two only, those of Regnault and of
Gerhardt,    required   special mention, the others being now known
certainly  not to represent the constitution        of the   base.     Regnault
had deduced     from his analysis the formula         C36    H20 NOs, while
 Gerhardt gives C36 H21 NOG as the expression of his results.
   The author submitted codeine to careful analysis, and obtained
the following results   : —
                                                              Calculation.

agreeing closely with the formula C36 H21 NOe, and confirmed by
the analysis of its platinum salt, which contains an equivalent of
water, and gave, as the mean of seven experiments, 19-25 per cent,
of platinum, while the calculated quantity is 19-19 per cent.
   The author then describes in detail the properties and constitution
of its salts.     The hydrochlorate crystallizes in groups of short
radiated needles, the formula of which is CS6 H21 NO6 HC1 +4
HO.     The hydriodate      is obtained   in long needles, which, dried at
212°, retain two equivalents of water, and have the formula
                                                                        C36 H2,
N06   HI  +  2 HO.     The    sulphate,   nitrate,  phosphate,     oxalate, hy-
drosulphocyanate, and platinochloride are also described.

                                         331
    The author then      proceeds to the consideration       of the products of
decomposition of codeine.
    When treated with strong sulphuric            acid, codeine    passes into   an
amorphous condition, similar          to that in which quinine         is obtained
when treated with an excess of acid, and in which state it forms
resinous compounds with acids.
    With dilute nitric acid it gives a new base, nitrocodeine, the for
mula of which is C86 H20 (NO4) NO6, which is precipitated from
its   solution   by ammonia,        in  minute     silvery  crystals,    sparingly
soluble in water, but dissolving         readily in alcohol and ether        ;  and
crystallising    on cooling in small        yellowish    needles.     It  dissolves
readily in acids, with the formation of salts, which have a more or
less yellow colour ; and      all crystallize   except the hydrochlorate.        Of
these the hydrochlorate,       sulphate, oxalate,      and platinochloride      are
described.
    By   the action   of bromine, two different bases are obtained — bro-
mocodeine      and tribromocodeine.         The first of these is prepared by
adding bromine water to powdered codeine until it is dissolved, and
then precipitating      with ammonia, when the base is thrown down as
a   crystalline   powder, which is obtained in needles              by solution in
boiling water or alcohol.          Its formula in the crystallized state is
C36   H20 Br N06 + 3 HO.             Its salts are similar, in most of their
properties, to those of codeine, and all crystallize           in small needles.
By the further action of bromine,          a yellow powder, sparingly soluble
in water, is obtained,     which is the hydrobromate of tribromocodeine,
and from which the base is obtained by solution in hydrochloric                acid,
and the addition      of ammonia.        Tribromocodeine      is a gray powder,
insoluble in water and ether, but soluble in alcohol              ;  it is an   ex
tremely feeble base, but dissolves in acids and forms salts, all of
which are sparingly soluble in water and amorphous.                   Its formula
^ C86 H18      Br, NO6.
    The author found that chlorine, by acting           upon codeine,     gave rise
to amorphous compounds,          which were not obtained          of definite con
stitution ; but by the use of a mixture             of chlorate of potash       and
hydrochloric      acid   he   obtained chlorocodeine,                    CI NO6,
                                                             C86   H20
similar in its general properties         and   constitution to bromocodeine,
and resembling that substance          so closely  that it may be easily mis
taken for it.
    By    the  action   of cyanogen      another    base was     obtained.     This

                                             332
substance    is best prepared by passing cyanogen into codeine dissolved
in the smallest possible quantity               of alcohol.    The    gas  is rapidly
absorbed,    and there is deposited          from the solution a mass of crystals
which, when dissolved in alcohol, are obtained in six-sided plates,
with a fine silvery lustre.            These crystals gave to analysis the fol
lowing results    : —

and the author attributes           to them the formula                 N06    2 C2 N,
                                                             C36 H21
and gives to the substance           the name of bicyanocodeine.        It  is a base ;
but owing to its extreme instability, no salts could be obtained. When
treated with an acid it is rapidly decomposed,            ammonia being formed,
and, after a time, hydrocyanic acid evolved.
    By treating     codeine   with     a  mixture of potash and lime, at        a tem
perature of 250° Fahr., it undergoes slow decomposition, and a vola
tile base is evolved, which differs according to the circumstances of
the experiment.        The author found that, under certain circumstances,
the base evolved      had the formula C6 H9 N, and forms the term in
the series of bases homologous with ammonia, which corresponds to
metacetonic acid, and which may be called metacetamine.                         Under
other circumstances the base evolved               had the formula C2 H5 N, and
corresponded, in all its properties, with the methylamine of Wurtz.

2.  On the Physical and Scottish Statutory Limits of Sea and
    River, as applicable to Salmon Fisheries. By Dr Fleming.
    Dr Fleming directed the attention of the Society, in          the  first in
stance, to the characteristic features of sea and         river proper    ;   and
then proceeded to consider the peculiarities         of that common space,
alternately sea and river, to which he restricted the term estuary.
He then    considered      the nature  of the  space  between    high and low
water, and pointed out the mean level, or mid-tide mark, as the only
constant and universally          applicable boundary     plane.    The     influ
ence of the tidal wave in reversing the current, checking the velocity,
and increasing the depth of the river, was next brought under notice,
and an experiment exhibited, illustrating          the conservation    of force,
which causes the waters at the head of an estuary, and the connect
ed river, in certain circumstances, to attain a higher level than the
high- water mark of the neighbouring sea-shore.           He then   considered,
successively,     the tests which, on different occasions, had been proposed
and   employed      ; viz. — point of stagnation ; presence of sea or river
water  ; the growth of sea-weeds ; fauces terrae ; deltas and bars ; and
pointed out their uselessness in determining the physical limit between
sea and river.

                                          334
     The  second part      of the paper was occupied with an examination of
the Scottish statutory limit of sea and river, as applicable to the
salmon fisheries      ;  in which the author indicated low-water mark, as
the only    limit contemplated,       and justified   the sagacity of our ancient
legislators, by proving that, with this limit, the object of the statutes
was    secured.      He pointed out the inapplicability           of the physical
test which he had previously established, and of the spurious                     ones
which had been noticed, to the settlement of the fishery question.                 He
concluded, by expressing his regret, that the Legislature                    had de
clared certain engines, for catching fish, to be legal or illegal, accord
ing as they are used in sea or river, without defining what is sea or
what is river ; and his expectation that, should any bill be brought
into Parliament, in connection with this subject, the present state of
 the law    will not    be permitted to remain in culpable obscurity.
 3.   On the Combined             Motions of the Magnetic Needle, and
     on the Aurora Borealis. By J. A. Broun, Esq. Communi

     When     a steel needle      or rod is so constructed that its centre of
 gravity is in a finely-turned        axle at right angles to its length, it will
 rest in any position when the axle is placed upon                polished planes      ;
  when, however, we magnetize the needle,              it assumes a position which
  is that of the direction      of the magnetic force at the place : in this
  way we    obtain the ordinary dipping-needle.            The dipping-needle can
  obviously move only in one plane, that to which the axle is at right
  angles  ; were it possible to suspend it freely,          so that   it could   move
  in every plane with every variation of the direction of              th,e magnetic
  force, we should then be able, by observing the variations of its posi
  tion, to determine at once the laws which a magnet in its true posi
  tion obeys   ;  this, however, we have        not  been    able to do ; even the
  small variations in the vertical plane, which we might expect to ob
  tain from the ordinary dipping-needle,            are nearly or altogether de
  stroyed by the friction of the axle upon its supports             ; and there are
  many mechanical difficulties in the way of the other methods                 of  sus
  pension.     It  has been      found convenient, then, to make use of the
   simplest methods of suspending magnets in a horizontal plane               ; and to
  endeavour    to   deduce,    from the     composition      of their   motions,    the

                                       335
laws both of the variation of the force with which a truly suspended
magnet is directed, and of the direction of that force itself.
    The most convenient of          these   is   that   termed the declination
magnet, which is suspended         horizontally by a fine silken thread      ;  the
tendency of the needle to dip being obviated by placing the point
of suspension north of the centre of gravity.               This instrument is
very convenient, especially in high latitudes, for exhibiting in a mag
nified form that portion of the motion of the freely suspended                 dip
ping-needle,   which     is at   right  angles    to the vertical   plane of the
needle.    Two other instruments,        one    termed the bifilar magneto
meter, from its suspension by two threads ; the other named the balance
magnetometer, from its resemblance to the beam               of a balance,      en
able  us to observe    the variations of the horizontal and vertical com
ponents   of the force with which the freely suspended          dipping-needle
is directed  ; whether these variations be due to a change in the total
value of the force, or simply to a change in its direction parallel to
the vertical plane.       In  high magnetic latitudes,      the bifilar or hori
zontal component magnetometer will be most affected by changes of
the direction of the force in the vertical          plane, and the balance or
vertical component magnetometer will be most affected by variations
of the intensity of force : in low latitudes the reverse is the case. In
all three instruments the magnets are forced from their natural posi
tion.   By means of a well-known formula, however, we can com
pute, from the observed variations of the two components, the variations
of the total force, and of its direction in the plane of the magnetic meri
dian.    Theoretically     this operation is simple enough, but practically
there are great difficulties; these difficulties are due to the effect of tem
perature upon the positions of the bifilar and balance magnets, which
require to be eliminated, and to sources of error that          I   have pointed
out in the Edinburgh Transactions              in the determinations       of the
change of value of either component of force, which corresponds to
a  change of, say one minute in the angular positions of the magnets.
I  conceive that  I  have, by the employment of new methods, reduced
the errors due to these causes to a very small amount             ;  and it is for
this reason that   I  claim for the results deduced from the Makerstoun
Observations, a consideration which they could not otherwise have
been entitled to.     I  refer to the part of the Transactions now in the
press, for the results relative to the separate magnetic elements, and
to the total force;    I   confine myself at present to those touching the

                                      336
motions of a magnet supposed          freely suspended     in the direction of
the magnetic force.
    I may state shortly the process by which the following results have
been arrived at.       The corrected observations for each of the three
magnetometers having been discussed with reference to a particular
argument     ; such as, the month, the moon's age, the moon's position
in declination, the sun's hour angle, and the moon's hour angle; the
motion of the (supposed) freely suspended needle at right angles to
the plane of the magnetic meridian, was obtained with reference to
the argument in multiplying the corresponding variations of declina
tion by a constant factor
                               (the cosine of the dip) ; the motion parallel
to the same plane was obtained from the variations for the two com
ponents by the formula already referred to          ; the value of the former
part of the motion for any epoch         being taken as the abscissa,      and
that of the latter for the same epoch         as the ordinate,  the motion of
the north end of the needle is constructed.
    Annual Motions. — The difficulty of determining the law of an
nual variation of any of the magnetic elements            has  been  so great,
that it is doubtful whether that for the magnetic declination has ever
been obtained, though the instrument          upon which its determination
depends    is unaffected by variation     of temperature.     I believe that  I
have succeeded      in the determination of the laws of all the elements,
and from these the annual motion has been constructed.                The an
nual motion deduced from the observations of the three magnetome
ters for the four years 1843, 1844, 1845, and 1846,               is shewn   in
figure  A;    another and rather more symmetrical figure, deduced from
a different    combination    of years, is shewn in figure B, Plate       VI.,
Edin. Trans., Vol. xix., Part 2.
    From near the vernal till the autumnal equinox the annual mo
tion forms the half of an ellipse whose major axis, passing at the
vertex through June, makes an angle of about + 11° in figure                 A
 and of +16° in figure       B with the projection of the magnetical       me
ridian.    At   the autumnal equinox the north end of the needle again
ascends   till the winter solstice, after which it descends till the vernal
equinox.      In  its descent, the north end of the needle having crossed
 its previously ascending path, it forms a loop which, when untwisted
 and continued downwards from the equinoxes, completes the ellipse             ;
 the portion formed by the loop having almost exactly the same peri
 meter as that regularly formed when the sun is north of the equator           ;

                                        337
the completed portion is indicated by dotted lines in figures               A  and B.
It   does not seem    improbable     that in southern          latitudes the figure
will   be  inverted,   and that     it will   be   a   simple      ellipse  near the
equator.
     Monthly Motions.. — The motion corresponding               to the moon's vary
ing phase has not been projected, chiefly because of the irregularities
still existing in the result of the four years' observations for the mag
netic declination, the epoch of minimum             being ill-determined        ;  it is
conceived     that the figure is a simple ellipse with its major axis in the
astronomical meridian, the northern extremity being at conjunction,
the epoch of minimum dip, and the southern extremity at opposition,
the epoch      of maximum dip    ;  this, however, is doubtful.
     The motion for the moon's position in declination has been ob
tained in the following manner : — Having first projected the means
 of magnetic declination for each three days of the moon's position
 in declination,    as obtained from       the Tables for the years 1843-6,
the day after the farthest         northerly position being the            abscissa,   a
curve was passed freely among the points              ;   the values of the       ordi-
nates at the points      of intersection by the curve           were then taken as
the interpolated value of magnetic declinations for the corresponding
abscissae   :  a similar  operation was performed for the magnetic dip.
In both    cases very satisfactory curves, agreeing nearly with the true
 points,   were obtained.       These     values are projected in figure              C,
 Plate   VI., Edin. Trans., Vol. xix., Part          2.      From this figure the
 north end of the dipping-needle commences              its ascent about two days
 after the moon is north of the equator, attains its highest point about
 two days after the moon is farthest north, and afterwards it descends
 till the moon     is again near the equator      ;  thus forming a figure like
 a portion of an ellipse    with its vertex about         one day after the moon
 is farthest north, the major axis making an angle of about — 30°
 with the magnetic meridian.           It will be remarked that so far this
 motion is quite similar to that for the sun's position in declination,
 with the exception of the axis of the figure being on the opposite
 side  of the magnetic meridian ; when        we trace the figure farther, the
 analogy still subsists ; — as the moon        proceeds      south of the equator
 the north end of the needle again ascends               till the   moon is farthest
 south, thereafter descending,      and, in crossing its previously ascending
 path, a loop is formed lying partially out of the principal figure, as
 in the case of the annual motion.

                                               338
      The correspondence of the two results gives a great weight to the
  accuracy of both ; this will be more evident when it is remembered,
  that the whole motion of the dipping-needle for the moon's varying
  declination is included by a small circle with a diameter of little
  more than one-tenth of a minute of space, and, that no observation
 in the sixty thousand employed for this result has been rejected,
  however greatly affected by disturbance              ;   although   the graphic     in
 terpolation to remove slight irregularities                may be considered as an
  equivalent operation.
      Diurnal Motions. — The monthly               mean diurnal variations for the
  magnetic declination and magnetic dip, from four years' observations,
 still present irregularities, especially from 10h p.m. till 4h a.m., the
 hourly positions for this time depending on only two years' observa
 tions.     For this    reason,    the values from the Tables having been pro
jected, curves were passed freely among the points, and the interpo
 lated ordinates thus formed, were taken for the projections                   in Plate
 VII.    :  the interpolated quantities differ very little from the actual
 values,    and this is especially the case for the summer months.
      The diurnal      motions for the four winter             months  , November      to
 February, are of the           same class,      and they differ considerably from
 those for the other months (see Plate VII.) : in each of these months
 the motion consists of a figure of two closed loops : the north end of the
 needle moves eastwards with              little change of dip from about lh p.m.
 till  9h or 10h p.m.,       after which it turns westwards, and begins to
 ascend     about 4h a.m., crossing near its position               at 6h p.m.    ; thus
forming an eastern          loop, which is small compared with the western
loop, excepting in December.                 After  6h a.m., the north end        of the
 needle having moved a           little westwards, again descends, crossing a
 second    time the afternoon track near 5h p.m. ; still moving westwards,
 it  ascends about      llh   a.m.   till it  meets the position of      lh  p.m.,  thus
completing the western loop.                  The  eastern    loop  is not formed in
March, the north         end    of the     needle  not rising sufficiently high to
cross the afternoon track.             The change in the figure from February
to   March     is very great     ;  in  April and May the remains of the east
ern loop      are still  visible,   but  in June and July its position is indi
cated by a simple inflection in the figure               ; in August and September
the germ of the eastern loop becomes more distinct,                   and   in October
the loop is actually formed.              The transition in form from autumn to
winter is quite gradual, unlike that from winter to spring.                      In the

                                               339
winter months, the principal               or western loop      is formed by the mo
tion from 8h a.m. till 5h p.m.             ;  in the months from April            to   August,
three-fourths          of the whole diurnal motion occur between 6h a.m. and
 6h p.m., the remaining fourth forming a slightly inflected side to each
 of the figures      :  it is this side which    is gradually twisted up to form the
eastern loop        of the winter months.
     It  is evident that no proper comparison can be made of the areas
of these        figures on account of the involved                forms       in the winter
months       ;  the areas, however, of the figures from                  April to August,
differ very little.
     Perimeters        of the Figures. — The twisting of the perimeters, which
 renders a comparison of the areas of little value, does not appear to
affect the length of the motion, and this therefore                       seems a     fair   sub
ject for examination.              The following       are the values of the angular
 motion, or length of the perimeter, for each month, as obtained ap
proximately from Plate              VII.

December and January shew the least                      perimeters,       April, May, and
June, the greatest, though the perimeters for the months from April
to   August are nearly constant.
    Hourly Angular Motions. —Having obtained the approximate
motion from hour to hour for each of the monthly figures, we find
that, on the whole, they follow nearly the same law, that indicated
 in the following numbers, which are the                    means     for each two hours
 of the hourly motions from the 12 separate months.
    12h      14h     16h      18h   20h    22h     0h      2h    4h        6h     8h       lOh
   0'-43   0'-48    0'-46    0'-62 1'19 l'-60 l'-34       1'08 0'-99 0'-60      0'-57    0'-29
     These numbers give the following curious result                    ; — That      the velo
city of motion of the north end of a magnet freely suspended                              in the
direction of the magnetic force is a maximum when the sun makes its
superior transit of the magnetic meridian (between 10h and 1 lh a.m.),
and a minimum when it makes its inferior transit of the same meridian
 (between        10° and      llhp.M.).      This result is the more curious that
the epoch of the minimum velocity of the diurnal motion is an epoch
of maximum disturbance ; and, in as far as the declination is con-
     VOL.      II.                                                               2 F

                                        340
cerned, the epoch of maximum velocity of the diurnal motion is also
an epoch of minimum disturbance.
   When we compare the results for the irregular disturbance, with
reference to the separate elements         of magnetic declination and mag
netic dip (see    Ed. Trans., Vol. xix., Part 2), with the velocities of
motion as deduced from these figures, we find, that when the diurnal
motion is most rapid the departures           from  the direction     of that  mo
tion are least, and when the diurnal motion is slowest the irregular
departures from the hourly mean position are greatest.
    Thus, if we examine the mean disturbance of magnetic declina
tion for each hour, as deduced from two years' observations, we find
it a   maximum during       the hours from 8 p.m.      till 2  a.m. ; this is the
period for which the motion of the needle is at once slowest and least
as regards the declination      ;  about 21h (referring to the figure for the
year,   see  Plate  VIII.,   Edin. Trans., Vol. xix., Part 2), the motion
is most rapid and nearly altogether in declination, the minimum
disturbance in declination occurs immediately before this hour;
another and nearly equal minimum occurs under the analogous cir
cumstances      about 5h p.m.    ;  a secondary maximum          occurring about
lh  or 2h p.m.
   If we    approximate to the hourly mean disturbance of the magnetic
dip by means of those deduced for the two components of force, we
find the minimum       to occur about 6h— 7h a.m., when the velocity of
motion is     considerable,   and when almost wholly in the direction of
dip  ; the disturbance increases from that time       till about    2h a.m., shew
ing a secondary      minimum       about  lh  p.m. and about 8h p.m., at both
of which times the direction of motion is chiefly that of dip                 : the
maximum disturbance occurs           from  about 10h   p.m.  till 3h a.m., during
which period the velocity of motion is least.
    On the whole, then, the magnetic disturbance appears to be chiefly
at right angles to the direction of the motion of the needle, and to
be inversely as the velocity       of motion.
    It  is scarcely possible to connect the previous               facts  of area,
perimeter, or velocity of motion with the laws of variation of tem
perature.      In the mean for the whole year, the temperature changes
most rapidly between 8h and 9h a.m. ; but it changes with nearly
equal rapidity between 5h and 6h p.m.             There is no corresponding
fact in the previous numbers.           When    we compare the variations         of
 temperature with the variations         of position for the     suspended    mag

                                         341
net in the summer months, we find the difference between                       the two
classes    of facts even more marked         : in summer,        the temperature
changes     most rapidly about Vh a.m. and 7h p.m., the change for May,
June, and July, from 6h-8h a.m., being + 3°-80, and from 6h-8h
p.m., being — 3°-54      ; for the same months, the mean angular motion
of the   needle from    6h-8h   a.m.   = 1'00, from        9h-llh     a.m.    = 2'-12,
and from 6h-8h p.m.         =0'-74.      There   is a diminution          in the  velo
city of the motion between         lh and   2h p.m.    ;  there is also       a  slight
diminution at the turning point,         6h— 7h p.m.,    and between 2h and 3h
a.m.     These diminutions appear to be connected             with the fact, that
they occur at turning points in the figures.
    It  may be remarked          that the line      representing        the astrono
mical meridian, and passing through            the centre of gravity             of the
perimeters of the figures, for the months during which the sun is
north of the equator, also passes through the position of greatest velo
city, and nearly through that of least velocity, of the diurnal motion.
     General Form       and Turning Points of the Diurnal Motions.
—The      general forms of the diurnal motion vary between rude el
lipses and circles.      In the winter months, the principal portion, or
loop of the figures, is elliptical, with the major axis horizontal ; near
the equinoxes, the figure         becomes    somewhat circular,            and in the
 midsummer months it again becomes rudely elliptical, with the major
axis inclined about 20° or 30° west of the magnetic meridian.                         In
the usual investigations of the conventional element of declination, it
 has been remarked, that the         turning from the farthest westerly posi
 tion occurs near the time of maximum temperature                   ;   a  coincidence
 which has been supposed to indicate a real connection, though there
 is no similar coincidence between the epoch of minimum tempera
 ture, and the eastern turning point.          If, however, we          examine      the
 figures indicating the diurnal motions of         a needle    in its true position,
 such as those    for the months of April, August, October, &c.,                      we
 might find it difficult to say where is a turning point and where
 not  ; and it is difficult to see why the turning points at the extremi
 ties of the horizontal diameters of these rude circles, or at the extremi
 ties of a horizontal line, in the ruder ellipses,          should be chosen,          in
 preference to the turning points at the extremities of other lines
 drawn in the figures, as tests for a theory         ;   unless, indeed, it be ex
 plained by the accident that a horizontal           suspension of a magnetic
 needle,   is a convenient one for observing           a  certain   portion      of the

motion of a magnet, which, independently of gravity, would rest in
the direction of the magnetic force.
    It has been customary, however, to give theories       of the   cause   of
magnetical variations, with reference solely to the diurnal variations
                                 (and not unfrequently with a very indif
of the magnetic declination
ferent knowledge of the facts with respect even to that element).           I
venture to say, that it will only be from a careful comparison of the
whole facts relating to the motions of       a  freely suspended dipping
needle,  not for one place, but for different and distant portions of the
earth's   surface, that   a satisfactory theory will be obtained.        The
attempt to deduce one from a consideration of the declination varia
tions alone, can only be likened to a similar attempt with         reference
to planetary motions, the apparent position       of the planet being stu
died without any relation to the direction or rate of motion of the
place of observation.
    Dr Lloyd, who      has  done  so  much for magnetical      science,   has
lately brought    forward a discussion of his declination     observations,
which he considers strongly in favour of the theory that the diurnal
variations of magnetic declination are due to the sun's heating effect
upon the earth, in opposition to the atmosphere.          I venture   also to
offer my guess, founded upon a consideration of various meteorologi
cal facts, that it is in the atmosphere, and not the earth, that we shall
find seated the secondary causes of magnetic variations.      In the mean
time, it is facts that are wanted.
    It may be noticed, chiefly with reference to the months from
March    to October, that a line passing through the positions of noon
and midnight,     also passes through,    or   nearly through,    the mean
position, or the centre of gravity, each      hour having    equal weight     :
also a line passing through the positions, about four        hours    before,
and four hours after noon, passes nearly through the centre of gravity
of the perimeters   ; the former of these lines lies nearly in the direction
of the minor axis, the latter nearly in that of the major axis of the
rude ellipses for the midsummer months. The horizontal line pass
ing through     the centre of gravity also passes nearly through the
positions of lh a.m. and lh p.m., which, therefore are the epochs of
mean dip.
    Angular Distances between the Hourly Positions from the Mean
of all, and from the Undisturbed Days. — In order to render the
following result intelligible, it must be stated that, after a careful

                                             343
examination of each day's observations in the years 1844 and 1845,
a series was selected,      in    each month,         of days nearly unaffected by
magnetic irregularity        ;  the diurnal        variation      was then obtained for
these undisturbed days, and this was compared with the diurnal vari
ation deduced from all the observations                 ;  the assumption being made
that the mean for the whole 24 hours                      was    unaffected     by disturb
ance, the differences       of the hourly values would evidently shew                   the
effect  of disturbance     on the hourly mean position.                 This assumption,
it was found, must be as nearly as possible true for the magnetic
declination, because the monthly means of the selected days differed
little or nothing from those of all the days; this, however, is not the
case for the element of dip, the disturbance appeared to affect the
daily or monthly mean to             a small extent.            Confining myself       here
to the result for the year (referring to the volume                     of the    Transac
tions for the partial results which vary with season) ; the following
numbers indicate the displacement of the mean hourly positions by
disturbance, upon the assumption that the centre of gravity for each
figure is the same       : —
 12h    Hh    16h    18h    20h      22h       0h     2h      r4h    6h     8h     10h   12h
0-35   C-25  0'-06  0'-15   0'-27   0'-30   0'-23   0'-31   0'-30 0'-17   0'-31  C-39 0'-35
    The diameter of the figure is little greater than 2'-0.
    In the mean figure for the year (see Plate VIII. already referred
to), minima occur at 4h a.m. and about                5Jh    p.m., the maximum occurs
about 10h p.m., and a maximum occurs between                        8h a.m. and 4h p.m.
If,  making allowance for the effect of disturbance on the position of
the centre of gravity with reference to dip, we suppose the centre of
gravity of the dotted figure for the year, raised 0'-15 on the line of
mean declination, or that of the continuous figures lowered as much,
we find the maximum effect of disturbance to occur about 101* p.m.
and 10h a.m., and the minimum                   effect    about 4h a.m. and 5h p.m.
This result     was obtained      for the magnetic declination in 1844, and
is given   in the volume for that year.
    Motions with      reference     to    the   Moon's Hour-Angle. — These, as
obtained from the means            of all the lunations in the years 1844 and
 1845, and as deduced           from     winter     lunations      for 1845       only, are
shewn in Plate      VII.       The resulting figures, especially that for               the
winter lunations of 1845, bear some resemblance to the diurnal mo
tion for the month of December.

                              Aurora Borealis.
    A    table of 184 aurorae      seen    at Makerstoun         in years 1843 to
1849 is given in pages lxxv.— lxxviii. of Vol. xix.,             Part 2  ;  from this
table the following results have been obtained             : —
    A  very careful outlook for aurorae was kept throughout the whole
period, but especially during the first five years            ;  an outlook warned
by magnetic disturbance        in circumstances unfavourable            to the visi
bility of the meteor, and      assisted by a practical acquaintance          with the
faintest auroral indications.        In   several cases, the auroral          appear
ances were very     faint  ; these are entered in the table           as   " Traces,"
and, in others, there was doubt whether the appearance was truly
auroral    ; these are indicated by
                                        " Trace ? "       It  should be noted that,
with the exception of the years 1844              and 1845, aurorae were seldom
looked for after midnight.
    Diurnal variation of frequency of               the  Aurora Borealis. — The
following are the numbers of times which aurorae were seen, at each
hour, from 5h p.m.      till 5h a.m., for      the whole period — referring        to
the printed tables for the numbers for each season.
   Hour,         5h  6h  7h 8h    9h  10h       l1h   12h 13h 141 15h 16h 17h

The greatest number of          aurorae were seen at 9h p.m.          ;   this result
is independent of the effect of twilight, since                 9h p.m.  is also the
hour of maximum frequency             for the winter         months.      This hour
is nearly the hour of maximum              disturbance      for the magnetic de
clination    and dip  ;  as, however,      the maximum disturbance of the
total magnetic force and a maximum of the magnetic dip appear to
occur about 5h p.m., this also may be an epoch                   of maximum fre
quency or intensity, though this can only be determined in higher
latitudes.     It should also be remarked, that, since the epoch of
maximum disturbance varies with season, so, therefore, it is probable
will that of frequency of the aurora         ;   some traces of this may be de
duced from the previous table.           In    the winter quarter, November-
January, four-fifths of the times at which aurorae were seen were for
the hours before 10h p.m., whereas in the spring quarter there were
only three-fifths seen before 10h p.m.

gives the numbers of hours at which the aurorae were seen.

The greatest number of aurorae were observed in March for the first
six months, and in October for the last six months of the year :
none were observed in        June and July.        When     the   six months of
1849 are included, the number for February is 26, and for March,
28.     The law of visible frequency of the aurora is the same as that
deduced already for magnetic disturbance ; namely, maxima near the
equinoxes,    and minima       near the solstices, the minimum             at the
summer solstice being the principal.           As, however, the shortness of
night during the summer months must diminish the number of
visible aurorae, it is by no means certain from these numbers that a
minimum      occurs at the summer solstice ; the fact of the minimum
at the winter solstice is involved in no such difficulty.             If we could
assume that the aurorae had the same            diurnal law of frequency at
all  seasons of the year, the existence of the summer minimum could
be satisfactorily determined, by comparing the numbers of times
which aurorae were seen at the five hours, 10h p.M.-2h a.m., during
which (even in the months of August and May) there is little twi
light to extinguish auroras.        The numbers are as follow, for these
five hours in each month of the years 1843—8            : —
   Jan. Feb. March. April. May. Juno. July. Aug.         Sept.   Oct.  Nov. Dec.
    15    24     38       31     8      0    0     9      14     16    18    12
From    these  it  is evident that the numbers       in May and August are
certainly less    than for April and September ; but it has been already
mentioned as     probable that the diurnal law of frequency varies with
season, of which, indeed,      a  proof is to be found in the great excess
of the numbers       above for the spring    months, compared with those
for the autumn months, shewing the later epoch                 of the maximum
frequency in the former.         An examination, however, of the table for
the disturbance       of the magnetic declination (Table 18, Vol. xix.,
Part 2), will shew that, though the maximum disturbance occurs after
midnight, in the months of May, June, and July; yet in August and
the two following months it occurs about 10h p.m., so that there can
be no doubt of the less number for         August than for September and
October, if there should be a doubt in the case of May compared
with April.       The difference, however, even in the latter case is too
great to be explained by any slight shift of the epoch of maximum

                                                               346
     frequency in the two months.                             Upon the whole, it appears certain
     that a minimum of actual as well as of visible frequency occurs                                                       in
     summer        ;    a result        quite in accordance with that for the amount of
     magnetic disturbance, which accordance                                  is sufficiently close             to per
     mit us to complete                 it,   by   assuming that the number of aurorae                               is    a
     principal          minimum in summer.
        It    has been stated in the volume for 1844,                                  p.   401, that this result
     was long ago obtained                     by Mairan        ;    this statement, made chiefly on
     the authority of Kaemtz and Hansteen,                                 is    not quite accurate.                 It   is
     true that Mairan's numbers give                           a     rough indication               of the law, as
     will     be seen below         ;    but when        it     is   remembered that his table in
     cludes all the observations (229) of which he could find    record for                            a
     upwards 1000 years,       will be evident, that the conclusion that
                                             it                                                                           a
     greater number of auroree occurred at both equinoxes than at the
     winter solstice would have been hasty                             ;    this conclusion, however,                     is
     not made           by   Mairan, and, though                he has combined the numbers of
 aurorae in            a    great variety of ways,              he has           made       no combination ex
 hibiting this fact.                    It    did not enter into the necessities                       of his theory
 (that aurorae are the product of the solar atmosphere) to shew that                                                      a
 greater number of aurorae happened in the northern hemisphere at
 the vernal equinox than at the                         winter solstice           ;    he shews, indeed, that
 the number for one equinox is, and, in accordance                                               with his theory,
 ought to be, greater than for the other.                                   Some other philosopher has
 the merit of first pointing out this fact.

    Variation of Frequency of the Aurora Borealis with the Moons
Age. — This investigation is evidently beset with considerable diffi
culty, since the moonlight existing nearly extinguishes the appear
ances of all the fainter class of aurorae, and it renders the faintest
wholly invisible     ;      the careful       watch, however, which was kept for
auroral appearances              at Makerstoun,      probably renders the table given
in the Transactions              better fitted for such a question than any pre
vious series of observations.
    It  should be remarked, that the latitude of Makerstoun, or perhaps
even a lower latitude, is better fitted for this investigation, than much
higher latitudes       ;    at least this is the case as long as only frequency
of visibility    can     be considered.          The French Commission du Nord,
during their stay in Lapland, found aurorae existing, or probably ex
isting, almost every night.                  In  such    places variation    of frequency
there is none, and variation of intensity alone remains for investiga
tion.    It  is obvious,         that  till some better mode        of measuring this in
tensity can be devised for these high latitudes, we are forced to per
form this operation in a rude manner, by moving to lower latitudes,
where the fainter aurorae become invisible, and where, therefore, fre
quency is a test of intensity beyond a certain limit.
    Combining the numbers of aurorae                     observed    at each day of the
 moon's age into six groups of 5 days (the first group, 4* days), we
 find the average number of aurorae for one day of the moon's age in
 each group as follows, from the                6* years' observations : —
   Moon's age.     28*— 2*          3*— 7*    8*— 12*     13" — 17*   18"— 22*   23<>— 27*
   Number.           5-8             5-2        3-6         5-0         10-2        66
 Did   auroree occur         indifferently at all       ages   of the moon,     we  should
 expect to    see  the greatest number at conjunction, and the least num
 ber at opposition        ;     this, however, is not the case, the greatest num
 ber was seen about two days before the end of the third quarter, and
 the least number about two days after the first quarter, or the visible
 maximum        and    minimum           occurred at times        equidistant    from the
 epoch   of opposition.             The frequency of       aurorae, therefore, is a func
 tion of the moon's               age.    In order to determine the actual law,          we
 may consider the probable effect of moonlight in obliterating the au
 roral appearances            ;   remarking,     first,  that 9h p.m. is the epoch        of

     VOL.   II.                                                               2  G

 late, and to have sufficient light to render the earlier of the faint
 aurora invisible; about the end of the first quarter, it does not set
 till midnight, and thus shines throughout the period of the occurrence
 of  fi ve-sixths of the aurorae        ;   afterwards     it increases    in brightness,
 and the maximum           effect in extinguishing          faint aurorae     is evidently
 attained at opposition, when the moon begins to rise late enough to
 allow the earlier aurorae to be visible ; towards the end of the third
 quarter, when the moon does not rise                 till midnight, it    is also evident
 that the number of faint aurorae                 rendered invisible       must be very
 small.       From the beginning of the fourth quarter, therefore, till
conjunction, the numbers seen will obey nearly the true law of fre
 quency     ;  and as the visible maximum occurred before the end of the
 third quarter, the true maximum                  must have occurred even nearer
 to opposition.        On the whole, it appears very certain,               that the hy
 pothesis     of   an actual maximum           of frequency at opposition, and mi
 nimum at conjunction, is         satisfied by the previous numbers of aurorae,
 seen under the conditions          of the varying duration of moonlight for
 the hours of maximum              frequency.         This hypothesis is in unison
 with the law of magnetic disturbance, which is a maximum at oppo
 sition, and      a minimum at conjunction.
                       Note on   the    Theory      of the   Aurora.
     Although temptations            to     frame hypotheses have           been   avoided
hitherto,      I  cannot refrain from repeating here the opinion, that the
phenomena of the aurora borealis are chiefly optical.
     After watching the various              phases of the aurora for some          years,
the hypothesis of self-luminous                beams    and   arches appeared       to me
unsatisfactory       ; and the strongest argument              in its favour, that ob
tained from the computed height of the auroral arches, seemed                         of  a
 very doubtful character.           I was       quite prepared, therefore, to adopt
the idea, first      I believe  proposed by         M. Morlet     to the    French Aca
demy, in May 1847, that the auroral arch is an optical phenomenon
of position.        M. Morlet has pointed out that the arch appears gene
rally    as a segment      of a circle    ;   whereas, in these      latitudes, it ought
invariably       to appear as the segment of an ellipse,              if  the hypothesis
be true of a real luminous ring, with its centre on the continuation
of  the magnetic pole.          He    has also, among many other very obvious
objections to that hypothesis, shewn that the summit of the arch is
generally in the magnetic meridian of the place, the plane of which

                                                349
rarely    passes through the magnetic pole, and seldom                         passes through
the same point, for three different places.                      I have,    however, felt even
more persuaded           that the aurora        is,   partly at least, an optical phe
nomenon, from        a                      of the aurora constituting
                         consideration of that         phase
the corona borealis,  persuasion that stated in the Literary Gazette
                           a                      I
of the time, in giving an account of the beautiful corona of October
24, 1847.
   Mairan, and, more lately, Dalton,                    have      explained       this phase          of
the aurora by        a   hypothesis of polar beams, long fiery rods of solar
atmosphere,  according to the one, of red-hot ferruginous particles,
according to the other, seen in perspective, as they lie in the direc
tion -of the magnetic force.              A little     acquaintance with the pheno
menon —the        rushing and tilting of the beams                     against each other,
one beam occasionally rising from the horizon, passing through the
centre of the crown and beyond — would shew the improbability of
                                            it
this hypothesis.      I       am persuaded, that the phenomena of the corona
borealis   is   produced in      a     narrow    horizontal        stratum        of the earth's
atmosphere.          Thanks to the discoveries of                 Dr Faraday,          we    do not
require    a   ferruginous sea, in order to have                  polarized       particles      ;   the
watery crystals that inhabit the upper regions of the atmosphere can
themselves      assume     a   polar state, determined by the passage of elec
tric currents    ;   and we have only to complete                 this fact by a hypothesis
of luminous electric discharges seen refracted by these crystals,                                    the
position of visibility of the refracted rays depending on the angles of
the crystals, and the deflections from the direction                         of the magnetic
force which they suffer,           by   the electric currents.             Such a hypothesis,
which occurs at once when an optical phenomenon has to be ac
counted    for, would explain these remarkable auroral clouds,                              so   often
seen in connection with the aurora               itself ;   it   would also serve to explain
the appearance of the arch at certain altitudes, lower for lower alti
tudes, determined by the position of the source of light, direction of
the magnetic force at the place, and the effect of the electric current
in deflecting the crystals.   The crystals successively deflected by
electric currents would also exhibit the rushing pencils or beams.
  It   need     scarcely be       remarked, that differently                  formed crystals
might give rise to different phases of the phenomenon while reflec             ;
tion might bo combined with refraction in certain cases, especially                                   in
the case of arches seen south              of the anti-dip.                Such    a   hypothesis
evidently assumes         a   source    of light, independent of             these optical re

                                        350
sultants, and the pulsations seen in many aurorae                may be real lu
minosities.
   It  is hazardous, in the present ill-arranged state of auroral obser
vation, to offer so rude a sketch of a new hypothesis, although we
may suffer     a considerable defeat in very good company.
   Since the previous note was written,            I   find that   M. Morlet      has
published a theory of the auroral arch (Ann. de Ch., t. xxvii., 3me
Serie).     The ideas above were stated by me two years ago, to differ
ent persons.
